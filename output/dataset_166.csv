and

King (Defendant) Respondent.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Trial—Evidence—Charge of
murder—Alleged misdirection in trial judge’s charge to jury—Provocation (Cr.
Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 86, s. 261; reduction of murder to
manslaughter)—“Insult”—Drunkenness of accused as matter for consideration with
regard to his acting on the “wrongful act or insult”—Onus of proof as to
defences of drunkenness, provocation.

Conviction of appellant of the murder of his
wife was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1947] O.R. 332,
Roach J.A. dissenting (holding there should be a new trial) on grounds, (1)
that there was misdirection and non-direction in the trial judge’s charge to
the jury with reference to the defence of provocation, as a result of which the
full theory of the defence with respect to provocation was not stated by him to
the jury; (2) that he erred in his charge by telling the jury several times
that the burden of proof lay upon the accused to satisfy them with respect to
his defences of drunkenness and of provocation by a preponderance of evidence,
and, though at other times in the charge he gave a correct statement of the law
as to the onus of proof, yet it could not be concluded with certainty that the
jury must have had a proper understanding of it. Appellant brought tan appeal
to this Court, based on those dissents, and also, by leave granted under s.
1025, Cr. Code, on the ground that the decision appealed from conflicted
with that of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. Harms, 66
Can. Crim. Cas. 134 on the following point: assuming the facts permitted the
jury to find that they were “sufficient to deprive an ordinary -person of the
power of self-control” under s. 261 (2), Cr. Code, may the jury, in
deciding whether or not the provocation did in fact produce a passion that led
to the fatal act, take into account the actual condition of the accused in
respect to drunkenness.

At the trial appellant gave evidence, which
included evidence of words spoken between himself and his wife and, after a
certain answer by his wife, a slap by her on his head, and that he did not
remember what happened after that until he was trying to pick her up from the
floor.

Held: The
conviction should be set aside and a new trial held.

Per The Chief
Justice and Kerwin J.: Both grounds of said dissent were rightly taken.

As to the first ground: Under s. 261 (3), Cr.
Code, it was for the jury to say “whether or not any particular wrongful
act or insult amounts to provocation, and whether or not the person provoked
was actually deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he
received”. The jury were entitled to believe the whole, or part, or

[Page 463]

none, of appellant’s testimony; if they
accepted the whole, they were at least entitled to consider the wife’s answer
in connection with the slap; if they accepted only the evidence as to the
conversation between appellant and his wife, they were entitled, in view of the
word “insult” in s. 261, to consider whether that was sufficient to deprive an
ordinary person of the power of self-control; and these matters were not put to
the jury.

As to the second ground: Reading in its
entirety what the trial judge said to the jury, it is impossible to say that
there was no error; the jury did not have such a clear and correct direction as
the accused was entitled to; and under all the circumstances it could not be
said that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. The third
ground of appeal should not have effect. Should a jury find that what was complained
of was sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control,
then, in deciding whether the accused was actually so deprived, they are not
entitled to take into consideration any alleged drunkenness on the part of the
accused. Rex. v. Harms (supra) disapproved on this
point.

Per Taschereau
and Kellock JJ.: Appellant should succeed on the first ground of said dissent
and also on the third ground of appeal. If the jury believed appellant’s
evidence, his wife’s act of slapping him, which was wrongful in itself, was
also, against its verbal background (in a meaning which it was open to the jury
to give to the words spoken), an “insult”, within the meaning of that word in
s. 261 (2). It was (under s. 261 (3)) for the jury to find (1) as to the
sufficiency of the particular wrongful act or insult to cause an ordinary
person to be deprived of self-control, and (2) whether appellant was thereby
actually deprived of his self-control. In finding on the latter question the
jury should consider the effect on appellant’s mind of the intoxication to
which he was subject at the time, if they should find he was intoxicated to any
degree. Rex v. Harms (supra) approved.

As to the erroneous direction several times
to the jury as to onus with respect to drunkenness and provocation, and the
effect of this upon the jury in view of correct statements of the matter to the
jury at other times: As there is to be a new trial, it is sufficient to refer
to Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1935] A.C. 462,
at 481 and 482, where the trial judge’s duty on such matter is clearly defined.

Per Estey J.:
As to the first ground of said dissent: The conversation and the slap (of
appellant’s evidence thereon was believed by the jury) would, under all the
circumstances, constitute evidence of a “wrongful act or insult” within the
meaning of s. 261. An insult may be effected by either words or acts or a
combination of both. Appellant’s wife’s words and her act were so closely
associated that their meaning and effect could only be determined by
considering them together and in relation to all the surrounding circumstances.
It was a misdirection to charge the jury in such a way that their consideration
was directed to the slap alone.

As to the third ground of appeal: If the jury
found the “insult” of such a nature as to be “sufficient to deprive an ordinary
person of the power of self-control”, then, in considering whether the accused
“acted upon it on the sudden and before there had been time for his

[Page 464]

passion to cool”, the jury might consider any
facts in evidence that might have influenced the accused to act or not to act
upon it, including his consumption of liquor and its effect upon him. (The view
taken on this point in Rex v. Harms, supra, approved).

Whether the effect of the trial judge’s
repeated misdirection to the jury as to onus of proof was corrected in their
minds by his correct statements of the law at other times in his charge, it was
not necessary to determine, as a new trial must be had on other grounds above.
(The law as to burden of proof in criminal trials stated, with explanatory
discussion thereon, and reference to the Woolmington case, supra, at
p. 481).

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1]
dismissing (Roach J.A. dissenting) his appeal from his conviction, at trial
before Chevrier J. and a jury, on a charge of murder. The appeal was on grounds
of the dissent taken by Roach J.A. (who held there should be a new trial), and
also on a ground raised by leave granted under s. 1025 of the Criminal Code (R.S.C.
1927, c. 36). The said grounds are stated in the reasons for judgment in this
Court now reported and are indicated in the above headnote.

G.A. Martin K.C. and W.A. Donohue for the
appellant.

W.B. Common K.C. and W.M. Martin K.C. for
the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J.
was delivered by

KERWIN J.—The appellant was convicted of the
murder of his wife and that conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for
Ontario with Mr. Justice Roach dissenting on the ground that there was
misdirection and non-direction in the charge of the trial judge with reference
to the defence of provocation as a result of which the full theory of the
defence with respect to provocation was not put by him to the jury. This is the
only ground of dissent stated in the formal judgment, but in his reasons,
Mr. Justice Roach also dissented on the ground that the trial judge erred
in his charge by telling the jury several times that the burden of proof lay
upon the accused to satisfy them with respect to his defence of drunkenness and
of provocation by a preponderance of evidence. Although this second ground does

[Page 465]

not appear in the formal judgment, this Court is
entitled to look at the reasons of the dissenting judge: Reinblatt v. The
King[2].

The appellant appeals from the Order of the
Court of Appeal based on these two dissents. By leave of Mr. Justice Rand,
granted under section 1025 of the Criminal Code, the appellant also
appeals on the ground that the decision a quo conflicts with the
decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. Harms[3] on the point whether, assuming the facts
permitted the jury to find that they were sufficient to deprive an ordinary
person of the power of self-control under section 261 (2) of the Criminal
Code, the jury, in deciding whether or not the provocation did in fact
produce a passion that led to the fatal act, might take into account the actual
condition of the accused in drunkenness. Mr. Justice Rand treated what was
said in this respect by the Chief Justice of Ontario for the majority of the
Court of Appeal, not as a mere dictum but as laying down a proposition by which
that Court would be subsequently bound. It is open to the Court to come to a
contrary conclusion but, upon consideration of the reasons of the Chief
Justice, it would appear that he meant his remarks upon the subject to be
treated as laying down a binding rule.

As there should be a new trial, I mention only
such circumstances as are necessary for a determination of the three questions
thus raised. At the trial, the appellant testified that, some days before the
night his wife received the injuries from which she died, he warned her never
to be alone with one Holmes because of something the appellant had witnessed
between Holmes and Mrs. Morgan. There was evidence that throughout that
night and evening the appellant had been drinking at several places before
returning with his wife and Holmes to his own home. At some stage, the
appellant’s wife went out of the house. The appellant testified: that, being
alone in his house, he heard the sound of a motor car which he stated he
recognized as being Holmes’ motor car; that his wife shortly thereafter came in
the house and when he asked her “Where have you been?”, she did not answer;
that he said, “You have been out with Harry Holmes”, to

[Page 466]

which she replied “So what? Harry Holmes is all
right”,—which, he testified, meant to him that she thought Holmes a better man
than he, and when asked in what respect, he answered, “Well, that would depend
on how a woman judged a man”; he further testified that when he said to her
“You have been out with Harry Holmes”, he meant that as an accusation of
misconduct; upon being asked at the trial what happened after his wife answered
“So what? Harry Holmes is all right”, he replied, “She walked over to me and
slapped me a good one on the side of the head”, he said that he did not
remember what happened after that until he was trying to pick his wife up from
the floor.

As to both drunkenness and provocation, the
trial judge several times charged the jury correctly as to the onus remaining
throughout upon the Crown to prove a charge of murder beyond a reasonable
doubt, but on several occasions he put it as if there were an onus on the
accused to make out such a case of drunkenness or provocation as would reduce
the crime charged from murder to manslaughter. This was misdirection: Woolmington
v. Director of Public Prosecutions[4],
and the first general proposition stated by Viscount Simon in Mancini v.
Director of Public Prosecutions[5].

Woolmington’s
case4 is concerned with explaining and reinforcing the
rule that the prosecution must prove the charge it makes beyond reasonable
doubt, and, consequently, that if, on the material before the jury, there is a
reasonable doubt, the prisoner should have the benefit of it.

Finally, after the jury had been out for three
hours, they came in and the foreman addressed the judge:—

In your address to the jury, you spoke in
regards to provocation as regards to the sobriety item, and you spoke of
drunkenness as a second item, and it is the end of your remarks. In other
words, summarizing your address, you pointed out that we should take all the
facts into consideration. Well, we need some guidance in regard to combined
provocation and drunkenness.

The trial judge replied in part as follows:—

Well, gentlemen, if you are satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt the accused is the one who killed Rita Taylor, then
you have provocation and drunkenness to look after. If he was provoked to the
point that I have indicated, and you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
that there was then provocation, that provocation would reduce that to
manslaughter.

[Page 467]

It is true that he proceeded to state the matter
in terms that could not be objected to, but in view of the conflicting
directions in his charge before the jury retired and of the error in the first
part of his answer upon their return,

If he was provoked to the point that I have
indicated, and you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there was then
provocation, that provocation would reduce that to manslaughter.

I am forced to the conclusion that the jury did
not have such a clear and correct direction as the accused was entitled to.
Reading the charge in its entirety and particularly the whole of the trial
judge’s answer to the foreman’s question, I find it impossible to say that
there was no error. Mr. Justice Roach was, therefore, right in his second
ground of dissent, and under all the circumstances I cannot say that there was
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

I now turn to Mr. Justice Roach’s first
ground of dissent. The criminal law for Canada on the subject of provocation is
set out in section 261 of the Criminal Code.

261. Culpable homicide, which would
otherwise be murder, may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who causes
death does so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.

2. Any wrongful act or insult, of such a
nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control, may be provocation if the offender acts upon it on the sudden,
and before there has been time for his passion to cool.

3. Whether or not any particular wrongful
act or insult amounts to provocation, and whether or not the person provoked
was actually deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he
received, shall be questions of fact: Provided that no one shall be held to
give provocation to another by doing that which he had a legal right to do, or
by doing anything which the offender incited him to do in order to provide the
offender with an excuse for killing or doing bodily harm to any person.

4. The illegality of an arrest shall not
necessarily reduce an offence of culpable homicide from murder to manslaughter,
but if the illegality was known to the offender it may be evidence of
provocation.

Except for a few immaterial variations, this is
the same as section 176 of the Draft Code prepared by the Criminal Code
Commission of 1878-79 in England, which section is set out in the third
volume of Stephen’s History of the Criminal Law in England at page 81. A Bill
was prepared for enactment to carry out the provisions of the Draft Code and
that part of the Commission’s report relating to

[Page 468]

the provisions of the Draft Code and of the Bill
dealing with provocation is set out in Taschereau’s Criminal Code at page 156:—

There is no substantial difference between
the provisions of the Draft Code and the Bill dealing with provocation, though
the language and arrangement differ. Each introduces an alteration of
considerable importance into the common law. By the existing law, the
infliction of a blow, or the sight by the husband of adultery committed with
his wife, may amount to provocation which would reduce murder to manslaughter.
It is possible that some other insufferable outrages might be held to have the
same effect. There is no definite authoritative rule on the subject, but the
authorities for saying that words can never amount to a provocation are
weighty. We are of opinion that cases may be imagined where language would give
a provocation greater than any ordinary blow. The question whether any
particular act falls or not within this line appears to us to be pre‑eminently
a matter of degree for the consideration of the jury.

The Bill was never enacted into law and in
England, therefore, the matter is still dealt with at common law. It is in the
light of these circumstances that the decisions of the House of Lords in Mancini’s
case[6] and in Holmes
v. Director of Public Prosecutions[7]
must be read.

In the enunciation of the second general
proposition in the Mancini case6 it is said:—

If the evidence before the jury at the end
of the case does not contain material on which a reasonable man could find a
verdict of manslaughter instead of murder, it is no defect in the summing-up
that manslaughter is not dealt with.

That may be taken as generally true in Canada in
the sense that in order to raise a question of manslaughter there must be some
foundation for it at the trial. That is true also in so far as provocation is
concerned, subject to the express terms of section 261 of the Code. Earlier
in the Mancini case6 (at p. 10), Viscount Simon had stated:—

In that view [i.e., that Mancini’s story
was rejected] the only knife used in the struggle was the appellant’s dagger,
and this followed Distleman’s coming at him and aiming a blow with his hand or
fist. Such action by Distleman would not constitute provocation of a kind which
could extenuate the sudden introduction and use of a lethal weapon like this
dagger, and there was, therefore, on the assumption that the appellant’s
evidence was rejected, no adequate material to raise the issue of provocation.

The position at common law is again set forth in
Holmes’ case7, at page 597:—

If there is no sufficient material, even on
a view of the evidence most favourable to the accused, for a jury (which means
a reasonable

[Page 469]

jury) to form the view that a reasonable
person so provoked could be driven, through transport of passion and loss of
self-control, to the degree and method and continuance of violence which
produces the death it is the duty of the judge as matter of law to direct the
jury that the evidence does not support a verdict of manslaughter.

Thus at common law the House of Lords has
declared that it is the province of the judge to decide whether there is any
evidence of provocation proper to be dealt with by the jury, but for Canada
subsection 3 of section 261 of our Code provides:—

Whether or not any particular wrongful act
or insult amounts to provocation, and whether or not the person provoked was
actually deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he
received, shall be questions of fact.

This is not to say that in a proper case the
trial judge should not draw the jury’s attention to the nature of the
provocation and the mode of resentment and ask them to consider whether the
latter bears a reasonable relation to the provocation, but the
subsection clearly enacts that it is not the province of the judge to
decide such matters.

The Chief Justice of Ontario considered that the
wife of the appellant repudiated the latter’s implied accusation, and
continues:—

In the circumstances I am strongly of the
opinion that her words and conduct in so doing did not constitute provocation
within section 261. They were the answer to be expected from a woman of
any spirit to an unfounded charge of infidelity made by a husband who himself
had been so occupied with his drink that he did not know even where she was. In
my opinion there was no evidence to go to the jury in this case that would
support the plea of provocation set up by the appellant.

The issue, however, was raised, so that it
cannot be said that there was no foundation for it, and the meaning to be
ascribed to the wife’s equivocal answer to the appellant’s query, taken in
conjunction with the slap, was for the jury. As is pointed out in the extract
from the report of the English Criminal Code Commission set out above:—

The question whether any particular act
falls or not within this line appears to us to be pre-eminently a matter of
degree for the consideration of the jury.

And the matter is thus put by Sir Lyman Duff,
speaking for this Court in The King v. Manchuk[8]:—

We think it was a question for the jury
whether (a) the acts relied upon as constituting provocation were
calculated to deprive an ordinary

[Page 470]

man of self-control to such an extent as to
cause an attack upon Mrs. Seabright of such a character as that delivered
by the accused.

Viscount Simon stated in the Holmes’ case[9] at page 600 that it was not necessary to
decide whether there were any conceivable circumstances accompanying the use of
words without actual violence, which would justify the leaving to a jury of the
issue of manslaughter as against murder, but continued:—

It is enough to say that the duty of the
judge at the trial, in relevant cases, is to tell the jury that a confession of
adultery without more is never sufficient to reduce an offence which would otherwise
be murder to manslaughter, and that in no case could words alone, save in
circumstances of a most extreme and exceptional character, so reduce the crime.
When words alone are relied upon in extenuation, the duty rests on the judge to
consider whether they are of this violently provocative character, and if he is
satisfied that they cannot reasonably be so regarded, to direct the jury
accordingly.

The wording of our Code, however, is “any
wrongful act or insult”, and the word “insult”, as generally understood and as
defined in standard dictionaries, includes language as distinct from acts: Rex
v. Krawchuk[10]. The
reason for the recommendation of the English Criminal Code Commission is
expressed as follows:—

We are of opinion that cases may be
imagined where language would give a provocation greater than any ordinary
blow.

and our Code follows the Draft Code and Bill.

The jury were entitled to believe the whole, or
part, or none, of the accused’s testimony. If they accepted it in its entirety,
they were at least entitled to consider the wife’s answer in connection with
the slap, and, if they accepted only the evidence relating to the conversation
between the appellant and his wife, they were entitled, in view of the word
“insult”, to consider whether that was sufficient to deprive an ordinary person
of the power of self-control. These matters were not put to the jury, and the
first ground of dissent by Roach J.A., is, therefore, well taken.

I pass to the conflict between the decision of
the Court of Appeal in this case and that of the Court of Appeal for
Saskatchewan in the Harms case[11]. The
argument, that the jury should have been directed that if they came to the

[Page 471]

conclusion that what was complained of was
sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control, they
then, in deciding whether the appellant was actually so deprived, must consider
the alleged drunkenness of the appellant, cannot, in my view, prevail. It is
important to refer again to subsection 2 of section 261 of the Code:—

2. Any wrongful act or insult, of such a
nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control, may be provocation if the offender acts upon it on the sudden,
and before there has been time for his passion to cool.

The criterion is the effect on an ordinary
person. It is true that a trial judge must at some stage ask the jury whether
the accused was actually deprived of the power of self-control by the
provocation which he received, because there may be cases where, because of
evidence of ill-will before the provocation or other circumstances, it would be
open to the jury to find that the accused did not so act. However, in coming to
a conclusion on that point, the jury is not entitled to take into consideration
any alleged drunkenness on the part of the accused. In my opinion, the matter
is tersely and correctly put by Roach J.A., when he says that the argument on
behalf of the appellant is tantamount to saying

the act or insult on which I rely would
have caused an ordinary man to lose his self‑control but not me. The only
reason I lost my self-control was because I was drunk.

The decision on this point in the Harms case11
cannot be supported.

The appeal should be allowed, the order of the
Court of Appeal and the conviction set aside, and a new trial directed.

The judgment of Taschereau and Kellock, JJ., was
delivered by

KELLOCK J.—The appellant was convicted on a
charge of murdering his wife. His appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was
dismissed, Roach J.A. dissenting. This appeal comes to this Court on two
questions of law pursuant to section 1023 of the Criminal Code, namely,
alleged misdirection in regard to provocation and alleged misdirection and
non-direction with respect to the burden of proof. There is a further question
raised pursuant to

[Page 472]

leave granted under section 1025, as to
alleged conflict between the judgment in appeal and the decision of the Court
of Appeal of Saskatchewan in Rex v. Harms11. Mr.
Common submits that, notwithstanding the leave, this last point is not open as
there is in fact no conflict. It will be convenient to consider this point
first.

The way the matter is put is that the basis of
the judgment in appeal is that there was no evidence of provocation and
therefore anything said in relation to the decision in the Harms case11
was obiter. While in the judgment of the majority it is stated, not once
but twice, that there is no evidence of provocation, the point arising in the Harms
case11 is dealt with as a distinct ground of appeal and is
decided adversely to the appellant. I think, therefore, that the point was a
ground of decision and that conflict has been shown accordingly.

Provocation is governed by section 261 of
the Code. By subs. 1, the provocation with which the section deals is
sudden provocation, and the offender also must himself have acted “upon the
sudden”. By subs. 2 “any” wrongful act or insult may be provocation if
of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of
the power of self-control but only if the offender acts thereon. The
question, however, as to whether or not there is any evidence is for the court,
but, subject to that, it is provided by subs. 3 that the above two matters are
both questions of fact for the jury, namely:

(1) the sufficiency of the particular wrongful
act or insult to cause an ordinary person to be deprived of self-control, and

(2) whether the accused was actually deprived of
his self-control by such act or insult.

To appreciate the matters in controversy, it is
necessary to state shortly the relevant facts. I quote from the reasons for
judgment of Roach J.A. in the Court of Appeal:

Rita Taylor was the wife of the accused.
Together they resided in a residence which was originally intended as a summer
cabin, but which, due to a housing shortage, was occupied the year round, at a
place called Baxter’s Beach on the Canadian shore of the St. Clair River a
few miles outside the city of Sarnia. The accused was employed as a labourer at
a foundry in or near the city of Sarnia.

[Page 473]

On Friday, November 29th, he quit work at
noon and went to his home. In the afternoon he and his wife went into the city
of Sarnia where he, at least, did some shopping and later they went together to
the beverage room of a local hotel. There an orgy of drinking commenced which
was not concluded until somewhere around midnight out at Baxter’s Beach.

In the hotel the accused met a man called
Holmes, and he joined the accused and his wife at the latter’s table in the
beverage room. The accused did not have a motor car; Holmes did. Towards the
end of the afternoon Holmes suggested that he would drive the accused and his
wife to their home at Baxter’s Beach. Before leaving the city, however, and
shortly before 6 o’clock, Holmes and the accused went to a local wine shop and
purchased between them four bottles of cheap wine. Then Holmes drove the
accused and his wife to their home at the beach where all three proceeded to
drink the wine. Early in the evening a neighbour called Goodwin from a nearby
cabin joined them. While he was present, and about 9 o’clock, the appellant and
his wife got into an argument and they went into an adjoining bedroom. There is
some evidence of scuffling in the bedroom. The appellant emerged from that room
and said that he had given his wife a few “rabbit punches”. The accused states
that the argument developed as a result of the wife’s intoxicated condition,
and his insistence that she should go to bed. Whatever were the nature of the
“rabbit punches” the wife was not perceptibly hurt. She remained in the bedroom
and the three men went to Goodwin’s cabin, where the fourth and last bottle of
wine was consumed. Some little time later and while the men were still there,
the appellant’s wife came over to Goodwin’s cabin and joined them. The wine
having been exhausted, Holmes and the appellant and his wife drove in Holmes’
car to a bootlegger’s place where they drank beer. Leaving the bootlegger’s
place they returned to the appellant’s cabin, apparently, about 11 o’clock or a
little later, bringing with them three bottles of beer. Holmes and the
appellant went into the cabin but the wife apparently remained outside in the
car. Holmes and the appellant finished the beer and Holmes left about midnight.

The appellant stated in evidence that the
next he recalls was when he awoke and found himself on his bed dressed only in
a new suit of underwear which he had purchased that afternoon. He had no
recollection of having put on that underwear. He states that he was awakened by
the cold; he got up and realized that his wife was not there.

When Holmes arrived at his car he found the
wife half asleep—in a doze in the back seat. There was some conversation
between them which was not admissible in evidence, but as a result of which
Holmes and the wife drove around the country-side over a circuitous route and
returned to the neighbourhood of the accused’s cabin about one o’clock. They
stopped on the highway about a quarter of a mile from the Taylor cabin. There
the wife got out and walked home.

I should here interject that the appellant
swore in evidence that some days earlier he and this wife had some conversation
about Holmes, during which conversation he told her never to be alone with
Holmes because of an “incident” he had seen take place between Holmes and a
Mrs. Morgan who lived in a nearby cabin. Mrs. Morgan was a Crown
witness and on cross-examination she said that sometime earlier she had told
both Taylor and his wife that Holmes had tried to get “fresh” with her and to
have sexual intercourse with her.

As to what happened when the wife arrived
at the cabin in the early hour of the morning in question, we have only the
appellant’s word.

[Page 474]

In the evidence he stated that he heard the
noise from Holmes’ car. He identified that noise as coming from Holmes’ oar
because of the fact that apparently the car was lacking a muffler and made a
terrific noise. Realizing that his wife was not in the cabin, he concluded that
she was with Holmes. His evidence of what happened on her return is most
important, and is as follows: “Q. What, then, was your reaction on hearing this
car, realizing that your wife was away from the cabin? A. I was getting a
little mad, sir. Q. Now, what happened after that? A. My wife came in the
back door. I went out in the kitchen. I said, ‘Where have you been?’ I got no
answer. I said, ‘You have been out with Harry Holmes.’ Her answer to that was,
‘So what? Harry Holmes is all right.’ Q. Now, what did that convey to you,
Mr. Taylor? A. She thought him a better man than me. Q. In what respect?
A. Well, that would depend on how a woman judged a man. Q. What did you mean by
saying to her, ‘You have been out with Harry Holmes?’ Was it an accusation you
were making against her? A. It was. Q. Was it an accusation of misconduct with
Holmes? A. It was. Q. And her answer was, ‘So what? Harry Holmes is all right.’
Is that right? A. That is right, sir. Q. What happened after that? A. She
walked over to me and slapped me a good one on the side of the head. Q. Now,
Mr. Taylor, do you know what happened from there on? A. I do not, sir. Q.
What was the next thing chat you remember? A. I was trying to pick my wife up,
and I didn’t have the strength. Q. Have you any consciousness of the
passage of time between that last incident of the slap and the time you tried
to pick your wife up? A. I had not, sir.”

In the interval during which he swore he
had no recollection of what was happening, there can be no doubt that he caused
his wife most serious and grievous bodily injuries. He broke a chair over her
head or body, and probably struck her head with his fists. The attack can best
be described as maniacal.

Sometime about one-thirty o’clock that
morning the accused came to one of the nearby cabins and aroused the occupants.
They got up and went with the accused to his cabin where they found the wife on
the floor with frightful injuries to her head and bleeding profusely. A doctor
was called and later an ambulance and the wife was rushed to the hospital. She
died the following afternoon as a result of her injuries.

In these circumstances, the first question which
arises is, what is the matter in evidence upon which, if believed, the accused
was entitled to rely as constituting provocation within the meaning of the
statute. The learned trial judge in his charge, upheld by the majority below,
directed the jury that they could consider only the slap in the face and not
what was said by the deceased wife, taking the view that, as to the words
spoken, the point was covered by the decision of the House of Lords in Holmes
v. Director of Public Prosecutions[12].
Roach J.A. was of opinion that the Holmes case12 had no
application and that:

In my opinion it was grave error to
instruct the jury in that fashion and the result was that the whole theory of
the defence was not put to

[Page 475]

the jury. The theory of the defence was not
that the accused was provoked within the meaning of s. 261 by the mere slap;
the theory was that he was thus provoked by the slapping coupled with the words
spoken almost contemporaneously therewith and all the surrounding
circumstances.

As to the Holmes case12, it is
first to be observed that it is not a decision under a statute but upon the
common law. The actual decision that the words spoken in that case, namely, the
confession of the wife that she had been unfaithful, standing by themselves did
not amount to provocation, does not apply, in my opinion, to the case at bar.
The words spoken by the deceased were not the same as the words in question in
the Holmes case12, and, moreover, they do not stand by
themselves. Further, the statement of Viscount Simon that

in no case could words alone, save in
circumstances of a most extreme and exceptional character, so reduce the crime,

i.e. from murder to manslaughter, requires to be
placed against the language of the statute “any insult”, and, so viewed, cannot
in my opinion, be a correct statement under the Code. They were not intended to
be.

In the present case, the husband said to the
wife “You have been out with Harry Holmes”. At the least that amounted to a
statement that she had disregarded his injunction given previously, but it was
also open to the jury to interpret it as an accusation of misconduct with
Holmes. On the answer of the wife “So what? Harry Holmes is all right”, in my
opinion, it was open to the jury to believe that “So what?” meant either “Even
if that be so” or “It is so, what are you going to do about it?” or “There’s
nothing you can do about it”. “Insult” is defined in “The Oxford English
Dictionary” inter alia, as

an act, or the action, of attacking or
assailing; an open and sudden attack or assault without formal preparations;
injuriously contemptuous speech or behaviour; scornful utterance or action
intended to wound self-respect; an affront; indignity.

In my opinion the act of slapping, which was
wrongful in itself, was also, against its verbal background, an insult. I
therefore agree with Roach J.A. on this branch of the case.

Coming to the second question, the learned trial
judge refused to direct the jury that the fact that the accused

[Page 476]

was intoxicated to such degree, if any, as they
might find, was a matter which they might consider in determining whether or
not the accused

was actually deprived of the power of
self-control by the provocation which he received.

All the members of the Court of Appeal
considered that there was no error in this respect, the view of the majority
being that any such direction would be in conflict with the decision of the
House of Lords in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard[13]. This view was not accepted by the Court
of Appeal for Saskatchewan in the Harms case[14]. That Court regarded the Beard case13
as approving the direction of Baron Parke in Rex v. Thomas[15], which was applied in the Harms case14.
That direction was as follows:

But drunkenness may be taken into
consideration in cases where what the law deems sufficient provocation has been
given, because the question is, in such cases whether the fatal act is to be
attributed to the passion of anger excited by the previous provocation, and that
passion is more easily excitable in a person when in a state of intoxication
than when he is sober.

In support of the judgment in appeal
Mr. Common submits that the third proposition laid down by Lord Birkenhead
in Beard’s case[16] is in
conflict with the direction of Parke B. That proposition, to be found at p.
502, is as follows:

3. That evidence of drunkenness falling
short of a proved incapacity in the accused to form the intent necessary to
constitute the crime, and merely establishing that his mind was affected by
drink so that he more readily gave way to some violent passion, does not rebut
the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his acts.

For my part I am unable to see anything in the
language which is in conflict with the law as laid down in Rex v. Thomas[17]. The third proposition in Beard’s case16
draws the line between drunkenness of such a nature that capacity to form the
necessary intent is absent, and drunkenness of a lesser degree. A person doing
an act resulting in death while drunk to the greater extent, is guilty of
manslaughter only, whether provoked or not. If drunk to the lesser degree, the
same act may be reduced from murder to manslaughter if committed under
provocation as defined in section 261. Intent in the last mentioned

[Page 477]

case is present at the time, because there is no
lack of capacity, and it cannot be said that a person free from alcohol who
acts in passion due to provocation lacked intent at the time although
then deprived of his self-control due to the passion which has been provoked.
In Woolmington’s case[18],
Viscount Sankey, L.C., said at 482:

When evidence of death and malice has been
given (this is a question for the jury) the accused is entitled to show, by
evidence or by examination of the circumstances adduced by the Crown that the
act on his part which caused death was either unintentional or provoked.

Lack of intention, then, is not an element in
the application of section 261, and therefore the third proposition in Beard’s
case16 does not apply to it. In truth the proposition deals and
deals only with drunkenness as a defence and not with the aspect under
consideration in Rex v. Thomas17. I am unable to find
anything in Lord Birkenhead’s reference to Rex v. Thomas21
which throws doubt upon the soundness of that decision, and I find it still
cited as an authority in the Hailsham Edition of Halsbury, Vol. 9, p. 439, as
well as in Russell on Crime, the 9th Edition, p. 39. In Stephen’s Digest of the
Criminal Law, p. 231, Art. 317, the following is stated:

Provocation does not extenuate the guilt of
homicide unless the person provoked is at the time when he does the act
deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he has received;
and in deciding the question whether this was or was not the case, regard must
be had to the nature of the act by which the offender causes death, to the time
which elapsed between the provocation and the act which caused death, to the
offender’s conduct during that interval, and to all other circumstances tending
to show the state of his mind.

If intoxication to any degree is a circumstance
which may tend to affect the mind of a person, and it is generally agreed it
is, then, if Stephen J. be right, the jury must consider the effect on the mind
of the offender of the intoxication to which he was subject at the time if they
find he was intoxicated to any degree. That the proposition as stated by
Stephen J. correctly states the common law is established by the fact that it
was cited with approval by the House of Lords in Mancini v. Director
of Public Prosecutions[19]. The
statement in the judgment of Viscount

[Page 478]

Simon on the same page as to the relationship
between the mode of resentment and the provocation reserved is not, under the
Code, a matter of law, but a matter to be considered by the jury when
determining whether or not the accused acted as he did by reason of the
provocation. As put by Stephen J. in the passage already quoted,

regard must be had to the nature of the act
by which the offender causes death.

In my opinion, therefore, the Harms case[20] was rightly decided. It is admitted, this
being so, that the charge cannot be supported on this branch of the case.

If the jury be directed to disregard any degree
of intoxication to which they may believe the accused was subject at the time,
the result will be that the question which they will be considering is whether
the accused, if he had not been intoxicated, would have acted on the
provocation, instead of the question directed by the statute, namely, whether
the accused in his then actual state of mind so acted.

There remains the question as to the admittedly
erroneous direction of the learned trial judge to the jury, repeated on several
occasions, as to the matter of onus with respect to both drunkenness and
provocation. There was considerable argument as to the effect of this upon the
jury in view of the fact that upon other occasions the learned trial judge
stated the matter correctly. In view of the fact that there is to be a new
trial, it will perhaps be sufficient to say that the duty of a judge presiding
at a criminal trial with respect to this matter is clearly defined in Woolmington’s
case[21] at
pages 481 and 482. If the law as there laid down is followed at the new trial,
as no doubt it will be, there should be no further difficulty on this point.I
would allow the appeal and direct a new trial.

ESTEY J.—The accused, convicted for the murder
of his wife, appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. At his trial, apart
from contending that he had not committed the offence, he pleaded drunkenness
and provocation as separate grounds for reducing the offence to manslaughter.
The majority of the Court of Appeal affirmed the con-

[Page 479]

viction, but Mr. Justice Roach dissented on
the basis that the learned trial judge had misdirected the jury as to what
constituted evidence of provocation and as to the burden of proof both with
respect to drunkenness and provocation.

This appeal is taken under section 1023 of
the Criminal Code upon those points raised in the dissenting judgment
and on a further point as a consequence of leave granted under
section 1025 of the Criminal Code on the basis of possible conflict
between the decision of the majority of the Court of Appeal in this case and
that of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Rex v. Harms20.

The evidence disclosed that the accused, his
wife and Harry Holmes had been drinking downtown in the afternoon of November
29, 1946, that in the late afternoon they had all gone to the home of the
accused in Harry Holmes’ car. Harry Holmes remained there and all three
continued drinking. During the evening they visited two homes and returned to
the home of the accused around 11 o’clock. Sometime thereafter the accused fell
asleep on his bed. When he later awoke, he was alone in the house.

In a few minutes he heard a car upon the road
and from its noise concluded it was the car of Harry Holmes. As he had warned
his wife not to be alone with Harry Holmes, this made him a “little mad”. In a
few minutes his wife came in the back door, and to his inquiry as to where she
had been she made no reply. He then, as he deposed, accused her of improper
conduct in these words: “You have been out with Harry Holmes”. Her reply was:
“So what? Harry Holmes is all right” and with that he says “she walked over to
me and slapped me a good one on the side of the head.” He deposed that as to
what followed he had no recollection. Harry Holmes deposed that after the
accused went to sleep, he went out to his car and found Mrs. Taylor there,
that she refused to get out of the car and that as a result they drove around
for some time and then she went home and he continued to his home.

At about 1.30 a.m. the accused called at his
neighbour, Morgan’s, for assistance. Mr. and Mrs. Morgan went at once
to his home where they found Mrs. Taylor unconscious and bleeding as a
result of a brutal attack, as a consequences of which she died later the same
day.

[Page 480]

With deference to the learned judges who hold a
contrary opinion, it would appear that the conversation and the slap here
deposed to, if believed, would under all the circumstances constitute evidence
of a “wrongful act or insult” from which the jury might find provocation within
the meaning of section 261 of the Criminal Code.

His Lordship charged the jury that the slap in
the face alone could be considered as evidence of provocation and that the
foregoing words and their implication of immorality did not constitute evidence
of provocation and must be disregarded in the consideration of that issue. This
direction is based on statements similar in effect in the decisions at common
law, more recently discussed in Holmes v. Director of Public
Prosecutions[22], where
it would appear that even at common law there is some qualification to the
general statement that mere words cannot constitute evidence of provocation.

We need not here, however, discuss the precise
statement of the common law. Parliament, in enacting section 261 of the
Criminal Code, has declared the law with respect to provocation in Canada:

261. (Provocation) Culpable homicide, which
would otherwise be murder, may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who
causes death does so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.

2. (What is provocation) Any wrongful act
or insult, of such a nature as to; be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person
of the power of self-control, may be provocation if the offender acts upon it
on the sudden, and before there has been time for his passion to cool.

3. (Question of fact) Whether or not any
particular wrongful act or insult amounts to provocation, and whether or not
the person provoked was actually deprived of the power of self-control by the
provocation which he received, shall be questions of fact: Provided that no one
shall be held to give provocation to another by doing that which he had a legal
right to do, or by doing anything which the offender incited him to do in order
to provide the offender with an excuse for killing or doing bodily harm to any
person.

4. (Illegal arrest) The illegality of an
arrest shall not necessarily reduce an offence of culpable homicide from murder
to manslaughter, but if the illegality was known to the offender it may be
evidence of provocation.

Under this section, when there is evidence of
“any wrongful act or insult” it is for the jury to determine whether it is

of such a nature as to be sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control.

[Page 481]

If, therefore, there is any evidence of any
wrongful act or insult, this must be submitted to the jury in such a fair and
complete manner that the jury will appreciate the law, and the evidence in
relation to that issue.

Under this section 261 an insult may
constitute provocation, and an insult may be effected by either words or acts
or a combination of both. In the case at bar, the words of Mrs. Taylor and
her act were so closely associated that their meaning and effect can only be
determined by considering them together and in relation to all the surrounding
circumstances. This evidence adduced by the accused himself may or may not be
true, but that is entirely a question for the jury. The only concern of the
appellate court is the right of the accused to have his defence, so far as it
is supported in the evidence, fairly and fully placed before the jury. It was,
with respect, a misdirection to segregate the slap from the words and direct
the jury that the slap alone should be considered in determining whether there
was sufficient provocation within the meaning of section 261.

If the jury found that this insult was

of such a nature as to be sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self‑control,

then that insult was in this case provocation.
If and when the jury found such provocation, it was then their duty under
section 261 to consider whether the accused acted “upon it on the sudden”
and before there had been time for his passion to cool, or, as stated by Chief
Justice Duff in The King v. Manchuk[23]:

We think it was a question for the
jury * * * whether in fact the accused was by reason of
what occurred deprived of his self-control to such a degree; and in his
attack * * * was acting upon such provocation on a sudden
and before his passion had time to cool * * *

In determining this question whether the accused
acted on the sudden upon this provocation, the jury must consider the conduct
of the accused himself as distinguished from the conduct of the ordinary man.
Upon this question or issue the jury may consider any facts in evidence that
may have influenced the accused to act or not to act upon that provocation
already found by them. His consumption of liquor and its effect upon him may be
taken into con-

[Page 482]

sideration upon the second question where his
own conduct is under consideration, but not upon the first question where the
standard is that the wrongful act or insult must be such as to deprive an
ordinary person of the power of self-control in order to constitute
provocation.

That was the view expressed in Rex v. Harms[24]. It was submitted at the hearing that Director
of Public Prosecutions v. Beard[25]
was contrary to Rex v. Harms24. In the Beard case25,
the House of Lords was considering the defence of drunkenness as evidence of
inability to form the intent essential in the crime of murder. Drunkenness in
relation to its effect upon the action of one who had suffered provocation
within the meaning of the law was not an issue nor was it discussed further
than a mere reference thereto. Rex v. Thomas[26], cited in support of the reasons in Rex
v. Harms24, is mentioned along with certain other
authorities in the Beard case25 where the Lord Chancellor, in
referring particularly to these cases, states at p. 497:

The judgments however in these cases
diverged into topics not specifically helpful in the matter now under debate.

With geat respect, I do not find the suggested
conflict between the Beard[27] and
the Harms[28] cases.

The charge of the learned trial judge relative
to drunkenness sufficient to render the accused unable to form the intent
essential in the crime of murder was not questioned before this Court further
than with respect to the burden of proof both as to the defence of drunkenness
and provocation. It was contended, as Mr. Justice Roach held, the learned
trial judge had instructed the jury that the burden of proof rested upon the
accused to prove either of these defences by a preponderance of evidence. The
learned judge pointed out that this burden upon the accused was not so great as
to require that he prove his drunken condition beyond a reasonable doubt, but
he repeated at different times in the course of his charge that the accused
must prove either of these defences by preponderance of evidence. With respect,
this constituted a misdirection.

[Page 483]

However, about as often as this direction was
given, it was offset by a correct statement that throughout the entire trial
the burden rested upon the Crown to prove the accused guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt. Whether, therefore, the effect of the misdirection upon this
point was corrected in the minds of the jury we need not here determine, as a
new trial must be had upon the basis already discussed with respect to
provocation. It is sufficient to emphasize that, apart from the defence of
insanity and a statutory provision with respect to the burden of proof, the
burden of proof rests always and throughout the entire case upon the Crown to
prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence
favourable to the accused, either as found in the evidence adduced by the Crown
or adduced on his own behalf, may be sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in
the minds of the jury. The position is that if after all the evidence, both for
the Crown and the defence, has been seriously considered, the jury is unable to
conclude that the evidence establishes the guilt of the accused beyond a
reasonable doubt, then he is entitled to a verdict of not guilty.

In Woolmington v. The Director of Public
Prosecutions[29], Lord
Sankey at p. 481 states:

* * * it is not till the end of
the evidence that a verdict can properly be found and that at the end of
the evidence it is not for the prisoner to establish his innocence, but for the
prosecution to establish his guilt. Just as there is evidence on behalf of the
prosecution so there may be evidence on behalf of the prisoner which may cause
a doubt as to his guilt. In either case, he is entitled to the benefit of the
doubt. But while the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner, there is
no such burden laid on the prisoner to prove his innocence and it is sufficient
for him to raise a doubt as to his guilt; he is not bound to satisfy the jury
of his innocence.

See also Mancini v. Director of
Public Prosecutions[30].

In the result, a new trial must be held. The
appeal is allowed.

Appeal allowed; conviction set aside,
and new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Speedy Trials of Indictable
Offences by County Court Judge—Several Charges—Mixing Trials—Refusal to hear
argument and deliver judgment at conclusion of each charge—Criminal Code, ss.
838, 839 and 857 (2).

The accused, appellants, were charged on a
number of counts on which, following a preliminary hearing, they elected speedy
trial under Part XVIII of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36. The Crimes charged
fell into four groups. Those in the first group arose out of the breaking and
entering of premises in the township of York on the 23rd August 1945; in the
second, out of an armed robbery in the city of Hamilton on the 26th August
1945; in the third, out of an armed robbery in the city of Toronto on the 16th
September 1945; and in the fourth, out of an armed robbery in the city of
Stratford on the 12th October 1945.

As to the first group, both the appellants
and one Dobbie were jointly charged on counts 1, 2 and 3. As to the second, the
appellant Green alone was charged on count 7 and 8. As to the third, the
appellant Constantine and one Hiscox were jointly charged on counts 4 and 5,
and as to the fourth, both appellants were charged on count 6.

The accused Dobbie did not appear for trial.

[Page 540]

Counsel for the accused at the opening of the
trial, requested that each charge be tried separately, but acceded to the
suggestion of the Court, that those offences which arose out of the same set of
circumstances should be tried together. The trial of the appellants on counts
1, 2 and 3 was then proceeded with, and when all the evidence had been heard,
counsel for the accused, asked the Court to hear argument and deliver judgment
before proceeding to hear the evidence on any of the other counts. The trial
judge refused and stated that he would hear the evidence on all the charges and
then give counsel an opportunity to present argument on all of them before he
would deliver judgment. All the evidence was then heard on count 6, then on
counts 7 and 8 and finally on counts 4 and 5.

At the conclusion of all the evidence on all
the charges, the trial judge heard argument on all the charges and then
reserved judgment. Four days later he delivered judgment and found the
appellants guilty on counts 1, 3 and 6 and not guilty on count 2; the appellant
Green guilty on counts 7 and 8; the appellant Constantine and the accused
Hiscox not guilty on counts 4 and 5, and sentenced the appellants to 14 years
imprisonment on each charge, sentences to be concurrent.

On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario,
the convictions on counts 1 and 3 were quashed and a new trial directed, but
the appeal against the conviction of the appellants on count 6, and that of the
appellant Green on counts 7 and 8 were dismissed.

It was contended on appeal to the Appeal
Court of Ontario, that the trial judge erred in mixing the trials by refusing
to hear argument and deliver judgment at the conclusion of the evidence on each
charge or group of charges, where two or more were tried together; and by
reserving judgment until he had heard all the evidence on all the charges.

This submission was not accepted by the
appellate court, who followed its own previous decision in Rex v. Bullock[1]; that decision being in conflict with the
decision of the Court of Appeal of Nova Scotia in The Queen v. McBerney[2], application to appeal to this Court was
granted under section 1025 of the Criminal Code.

Held, affirming
the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1947] O.R. 264; [1947] O.W.N.
325; [1947] 3 D.L.R. 32, the appeal should be dismissed. Nothing should detract
from the salutary rule that everything should be done to avoid even the
appearance of prejudice in the mind of the convicting judge against the
prisoner arising out of facts developed in a later prosecution, and, therefore
the ordinary practice should be followed that one case should be disposed of,
so far as the verdict is concerned, before entering upon the consideration of
another. Irrespective of s. 838 of the Criminal Code, by which the judge
may adjourn the hearing, it should not be laid down (as a rule of law) that a
judge must acquit or convict in all cases before proceeding with another charge
against the same accused; or must announce his decision on one count against
two accused before proceeding with the trial of one of them on other counts.
There may be cases where it is necessary to do so because an accused might, on
the

[Page 541]

subsequent trial, plead autre fois acquit or
autre fois convict, and in no case may a judge convict a person on one charge by
reason of evidence heard on the trial of another charge but, if it appears
that these rules have not been infringed, then the convictions should not be
set aside.

The joinder in a single charge sheet of
several counts on which an accused has been committed for trial on a single
information is permitted, The King v. Deur [1944] S.C.R. 435 and by
section 857 (2) of the Criminal Code, which appears in Part XIX but
which, by section 839, is made applicable to the formal statement and
trial under Part XVIII, the Court, if it thinks it conducive to the ends of
justice to do so, may direct that the accused shall be tried upon any one or
more of such counts separately, subject to the proviso therein expressed.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[3] insofar
as that judgment affirmed convictions of the appellants on charges of armed
robbery by his Honour Judge Parker sitting in the County Judges’ Criminal Court
of the County of York at the City of Toronto.

Gordon W. Ford and Charles L. Dubbin for
the appellants.

W.B. Common, K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

KERWIN J.—Leave to appeal from a decision of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario was granted on the ground that it conflicted with
the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banco in The Queen v.
McBerny[4]. That
case decided that where a judge tries a charge without a jury under the Speedy
Trials clauses of the Criminal Code, it is not competent for him to
postpone his decision on a first charge against an accused until he has heard
the evidence on several other charges against the same party and to then decide
the question of guilt in all. In the judgment appealed from, the matter is treated
as one for consideration in each particular case and not as a rule of law of
general application.

[Page 542]

Of the other decision referred to, Hamilton
v. Walker[5] was
distinguished in the subsequent case of Regina v. Fry[6] where it appeared from an affidavit filed
on behalf of the justices that in adjudicating in each of several cases tried
before them they applied to that case the evidence given in reference to it and
no other, and that the evidence given in the second case in no way influenced
their decision on the first. The decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in
Rex v. Bullock[7]
followed the Fry case. The British Columbia Court of Appeal in The
King v. Iman Din[8],
divided equally on the question.

Nothing should detract from the salutary rule that
everything should be done to avoid even the appearance of prejudice in the mind
of the convicting judge against the prisoner arising out of facts developed in
a later prosecution, and, therefore, the ordinary practice should be followed
that one case should be disposed of, so far as the verdict is concerned, before
entering upon the consideration of another. I do not attach any importance to
section 838 of the Code by which the judge may adjourn the hearing.
Irrespective of that section, it should not be laid down that a judge must
acquit or convict in all cases before proceeding with the trial of another
charge against the same accused, or as in the case before us, announce his
decision on one count against two accused before proceeding with the trial of
one of them on other counts. There may be cases where it is necessary to do so
because an accused might, on the subsequent trial, plead autrefois acquit or
autrefois convict, and in no case may a judge convict a person on one charge by
reason of evidence heard on the trial of another charge but, if it appears that
these rules have not been infringed, then the convictions should not be set
aside. It is not without importance in disposing of the matter to bear in mind
that the joinder in a single charge sheet of several counts on which an accused
has been committed for trial on a single information is permitted: The King v.
Deur[9] and
that by section 857 (2), which appears in Part XIX

[Page 543]

but which, by section 839, is made
applicable to the formal statement and trial under Part XVIII, the Court,
if it thinks it conducive to the ends of justice to do so, maydirect that the
accused shall be tried upon any one or more of such counts separately,—subject,
of course to the proviso therein expressed.

In view of the evidence given in connection with
counts 6, 7 and 8 and the reasons of the trial judge, the rules set out above
have not been violated and the appeals should, therefore, be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Evidence—Admissibility
of—Admissions made by accused as witness on preliminary hearing of charge
against another—No objection made to questions as incriminating—No claim for
protection under section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act—Right of Crown to use
admissions on trial of accused—Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 69.

The appellant was convicted on charges of
having used a noxious fluid and instruments to procure an abortion. The facts
of the case are the following: One Ford was charged with manslaughter in
connection with the death of the woman in question. The appellant appeared as a
witness for the Crown at the preliminary inquiry. In the course of his
evidence, given without raising any objection nor claim for protection under
section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, the appellant made certain
admissions which the Crown later put in evidence against him at his own trial.
The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal on the ground of improper
admission in evidence of these admissions; but the conviction was affirmed by a
majority of that Count.

Held: That the
deposition of the appellant was properly admitted and the appeal should be
dismissed—If a person testifying does not claim the protection provided for by
section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, the evidence so given may be used
against him at his own subsequent trial.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1946] 2
W.W.R. 97) affirmed.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Manitoba[1], affirming a
conviction, on a trial before Donovan J. and a jury, on charges of offences
relating to procuring an abortion.

Harry Walsh for
the appellant.

C. W. Tupper for
the respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was
delivered by

Kerwin J.—The accused, Dr. David Tass, appeals from the judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Manitoba dismissing his appeal from a conviction on charges
that he

[Page 104]

did on or about October 22, 1944, unlawfully
administer to Agnès Ladéroute, a woman, with intent to procure a miscarriage of
the said Agnès Ladéroute, a noxious thing, to wit, a mixture of water, soap and
lysol, and that he, on the same day, unlawfully used instruments on Agnès
Ladéroute, a woman, with intent to procure a miscarriage of the said Agnès
Ladéroute. The appeal is based upon two grounds of dissent in law of Mr.
Justice Dysart although other matters of dissent are mentioned in the latter’s
judgment. As I have come to the conclusion that the appeal fails on the first
ground, I do not say anything as to the second because Mr. Walsh quite properly
agreed that, in that event, it would be unnecessary to do so.

Agnès Ladéroute died October 23, 1944. An
inquest was held and subsequently one Edward J. Ford was charged with
manslaughter in connection with the woman’s death and the preliminary inquiry
in connection with that charge was held before a police magistrate on November 23, 1944. Tass was subpoenaed to appear
as a witness at that inquiry. He attended and was sworn and gave evidence
without raising any objection to answering any question upon the ground that
his answer might tend to criminate him, as he was entitled to do by subsection
2 of section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, After testifying that he had
been called to Ford’s house to attend the woman and that he found her dead, he
was asked as to what he found in the room and as to any previous knowledge he
had of the woman or of her condition. He admitted that he knew she was
pregnant, that he drove her in his automobile to a point about one and one-half
city blocks from Ford’s house and that he knew Ford would conduct an abortion
as he “felt he had done them before.” From these admissions and others in his
testimony at the preliminary inquiry, it is plain that, if the examination was
admissible, the jury was entitled to find him guilty.

I disagree with the view of the dissenting judge
below that this evidence of Tass was not relevant to the charge against Ford.
It was suggested that an arrangement had been made between certain members of
the police force and Crown counsel to put Tass in the witness box at Ford’s
preliminary inquiry in order to secure from Tass an admission

[Page 105]

of his guilt. It was even suggested that the
magistrate had been a party to this arrangement. I find no evidence that any of
the named parties had entered into such an arrangement or that it had been
decided to arrest and prosecute Tass before the preliminary inquiry into the
charge against Ford, and the matter is therefore left with Tass as a witness in
a proceeding under oath admitting his guilt of the crimes now charged against
him and that he did not claim the protection provided for by the Canada
Evidence Act. Under these circumstances the decision in Regina v.
Coote[2] is
conclusive.

It is true that at the time of that decision
there was no such provision as subsection 2 of section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act. That Act removes a safeguard a person had at common law to refuse to
answer any questions that might criminate him. He is now obliged to do so but
such evidence may not be used against him if he claims the protection of the
Act. It has been pointed out in several cases such as Rex v. Clark[3], Re Ginsberg[4]), and Rex v. Barnes[5] that the protection now afforded may not be
as wide as that under the common law and objections have been raised from time
to time as to the possibility of the evidence acquired under the Act being used
to build up a case against a person who may be subsequently charged with an
offence. However that may be, the matter seems quite clear that if the person
testifying does not claim the exemption, the evidence so given may be later
used against him, and this notwithstanding the fact that he may not known of
his rights; Regina case2.

The appeal should be dismissed.

The judgment of Rand, Kellock and Estey JJ. was
delivered by

Kellock j.—This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of
Manitoba affirming (Dysart J. ad hoc dissenting) the conviction of the
appellant before Donovan J. and a jury on the 11th day of May, 1945, in respect
of two counts in an indictment, namely, attempt to procure a miscarriage and
use of instruments to procure a miscarriage.

[Page 106]

In view of the opinion which I have formed with
respect to the appeal it is necessary to mention only one ground of dissent.
The appellant had given evidence upon a preliminary inquiry with respect to
charges then pending against one Ford, arising out of the same facts out of
which the appellant was himself later charged and part of this evidence was
admitted against the appellant at his trial. Dysart J. was of opinion that this
evidence was inadmissible. His view may be summarized as follows: that the
evidence was irrelevant to the matter with which the preliminary inquiry was
concerned, namely, the pending
charges against Ford; that counsel for the prosecution had conducted the part
of the examination objected to from an improper motive, viz: merely to obtain
the admissions for use against the witness himself and that the magistrate was
a party to this scheme; that the appellant had ceased properly to be a witness
at all and his failure to avail himself of the provisions of section 5 of the Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C., c. 59 was immaterial and did not render his answers
subsequently admissible against him.

In the course of his reasons the learned judge
stated that the evidence in question had been

extracted from a man who was so strongly
suspected of complicity in Ford’s crime that the authorities had decided to
arrest and prosecute him.

However, counsel for the appellant before us
quite frankly admitted that this view of the learned judge was not supported by
the evidence.

When the evidence objected to is examined its
relevancy is not, in my opinion, open to objection. It is shown that there was
a common design between the appellant and Ford with respect to the matter in
question and the principle referred to in Koufis v. The King,[6] is applicable. The examination of the
appellant was therefore proper and accordingly there is no foundation for the
allegation as to any ulterior motive on the part of either the Crown Attorney
or the magistrate. Being properly before the magistrate it was for the
appellant to invoke the provisions of section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act. Not having done so his evidence is properly admissible against him.
It is not therefore necessary to consider whether the examination objected to
would have been other than

[Page 107]

admissible against Tass if it could have been established that it
was irrelevant to the pending charge against Ford. Rex v. Sloggett, (1);
Rex v. Graham, (2); The King v. Van Meter, (3) may
be referred to.

As to the other ground of dissent which was
argued before us, counsel for the appellant took the position that if he could
not support the first ground of dissent it was unnecessary for us to deal with
the second.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Evidence—Charge to jury—General
principles—Misdirection—Accomplice—Corroboration—Reading of extract of opinion
given by a member of appellate court in a previous appeal—Substantive wrong or
miscarriage of justice.

The presence of the accused in his apartment
with the perpetrators of a crime shortly after its commission, and the
improbability of his evidence as to what occurred at that meeting, is capable
of affording corroboration of the evidence of accomplices implicating him when
considered in the light of all the evidence.

While the reading of an extract from the
reasons of one of the Judges of the Court of Appeal on an appeal by the accused
from his conviction at a previous trial is to be deprecated, this did not,
under the circumstances, result in a miscarriage of justice.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario dismissing (Laidlaw J. dissenting) the appellant’s appeal
from his conviction, on a trial before the General Sessions of the Peace at
Toronto, Shea J., on a charge of armed robbery and kidnapping.

Vera Parsons (Miss) K.C. for the
appellant.

W.B. Common, K.C. and W.C. Bowman for the
respondent.

[Page 91]

The judgment of Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau
J.J. was delivered by

TASCHEREAU, J.:—On the 31st of October, 1944,
the appellant was convicted for armed robbery, robbery, forcible restraining
and imprisonment of one George Butcher, and, on the 7th of May, 1945, the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] quashed this
conviction and ordered a new trial.

The new trial took place before His Honour Judge
Shea and a jury on the 19th of October, 1945, and on the 25th of October of the
same year, after having been found guilty, he was sentenced to a term of
fifteen years imprisonment in the Penitentiary at Kingston.

At the first trial, the appellant had been
charged with and tried together with Benedetto Zanelli, Samuel Mancuso, Edwin
MacDonald and William M. Baskett. Zanelli was also charged with the offence of
receiving stolen goods. The appellant, Mancuso, Edwin MacDonald and Baskett
were found guilty of armed robbery and imprisoning Butcher, but Zanelli was
found guilty only of receiving stolen goods. The appellant and Mancuso appealed
their convictions and sentences, and, while Mancuso’s appeal was dismissed, the
appellant’s conviction was quashed and a new trial ordered. Having been
convicted again at the second trial, MacDonald appealed, but the conviction was
confirmed, the Honourable Mr. Justice Laidlaw dissenting on questions
of law.

The facts are that on the 13th of December, 1943, a truck, containing
liquor valued at many thousands of dollars, was seized in the city of Toronto by several men, one of whom was
armed with an automatic pistol. The driver of the truck, named Butcher, was
forcibly confined in an automobile, and the truck and its contents were taken
to a barn on the premises of one Shorting, who operated a riding school known
as The Lazy L. Ranch.

The evidence reveals that, on the 10th day of
December, 1943, Mancuso (subsequently convicted of the armed robbery and
unlawfully imprisoning the said Butcher), in company with one Zanelli
(subsequently convicted of receiving the liquor), appeared at the riding school
and

[Page 92]

arranged with Shorting to rent his barn for
storage of “a few cases of Christmas liquor”. Wilkinson, who was an employee of
Shorting and working at the school with him, was given $5.00 by Mancuso for
“shaking some hay” over the liquor. Shorting himself received $20.00 for the
use of his barn.

In the evening of the 12th of December, Zanelli
telephoned Shorting to be at the barn at five o’clock the next morning.
Following these instructions, Shorting and Wilkinson went to the barn and were
met there by Zanelli. Shortly thereafter, an automobile containing four or five
men arrived and also the truck containing six hundred cases of liquor which
were unloaded. Later the same day, Shorting, through one Moberly, notified the Toronto police that the truck and liquor
were at his barn. After having taken possession of the truck and liquor, the
police visited the appellant’s apartment in Toronto at one p.m. the
same day, and there found Mancuso, Edwin MacDonald, Baskett (all subsequently
convicted of the armed robbery and unlawful imprisoning). The appellant, Kay
Donavan, a man by the name of Applebaum, a whiskey salesman, and another man by
the name of Taylor, who is a
known bootlegger, were also present. At the appellant’s trial, Shorting and
Wilkinson identified the appellant as being one of the men assisting in the
unloading. Shorting also stated that one other man, while doing the unloading,
referred to the appellant as “Mickey”, which was his nickname.

The appellant’s defence was an alibi, and in
giving evidence in his own defence, he swore that the stolen liquor was never
mentioned in his apartment, where all the men who had committed the crime a few
hours before gathered at one p.m. on the 13th of December.

In his dissenting judgment in the Court of
Appeal, Mr. Justice Laidlaw adopted the view that the learned trial judge erred
in law in instructing the jury, that, if they found Shorting or Wilkinson to be
accomplices, they might find corroboration of their testimony, as to
appellant’s presence at the barn, in the fact and circumstances of the meeting
at the appellant’s apartment, and from the fact also that the appellant’s
denial that the stolen liquor was

[Page 93]

discussed was implausible. The second ground of
dissent of Mr. Justice Laidlaw, is that counsel for the Crown improperly read
to the jury, observations made by the Honourable Mr. Justice McRuer (now
C. J. H. C.) in his, judgment on the previous appeal, on the credibility of the
witness Shorting.

The crimes for which the appellant was charged
are not crimes for which, under section 1002 of the Criminal Code,
corroboration is essential. However, if Shorting and Wilkinson were found to be
accomplices in the perpetration of the crimes with which the appellant is
charged, it was imperative to give the jury the usual warning that it was
possible to convict without the evidence of Shorting and Wilkinson being
corroborated but that it was dangerous to do so.

In his address to the jury, His Honour Judge
Shea who presided at the trial said:

It is important for you to decide that,
because I have to instruct you as a matter of law that it is always dangerous
to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, though it is your
legal province to do so. Please note the word “uncorroborated”; it means
unstrengthened or unconfirmed. If you have the evidence of an accomplice, and
in addition you have something independent of that evidence, which strengthens
or confirms it, you have corroboration. But I must tell you here, also, that
the evidence of one accomplice cannot be taken in corroboration of the evidence
of another. It has to be additional evidence to that given by either one of
them. It need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime. The
evidence in corroboration must be independent evidence which affects the
accused, and connecting or tending to connect him in some material
circumstances.

The learned trial judge also explained to the
jury what was an accomplice, its legal meaning, and gave various definitions.
He said:

I will read you one or two of these
definitions: “An accomplice is one who knowingly * * * and
in a common intent with the principal offender, unites in the completion of a
crime.” Or, to determine if a witness is an accomplice, ask this question:
“Could the witness have been indicted under the wide provisions of the Code for
the offence for which the person has been convicted or is being tried?” And
other definition: “An accomplice is a party to the crime himself, who assists
in or is a partner of the crime.” One more: “Every person who knowingly,
deliberately co‑operates with or assists or even encourages another in
the completion of a crime is an accomplice.”

The questions were, therefore: Could it be said
that Shorting and Wilkinson were accomplices in the robbery

[Page 94]

of the liquor and of the imprisoning of Butcher?
And if so was the proper direction given to the jury, by the trial judge, as to
corroboration?

The definition of an accomplice is a question of
law, and the determination of all the elements that are necessary to constitute
corroboration is similarly a question for the trial judge. The trial judge must
direct the jury as to what are the essential requirements to make a person an
accomplice, and as to what is necessary to give a probative value to
corroborative evidence, and it is also his duty to instruct them as to the
legal evidence that must be adduced to establish complicity and corroboration.
But the weighing of the facts revealed by the evidence, as to whether a person
is an accomplice or not, and the question as to whether “corroborative inferences
should be drawn from the evidence”, are both within the exclusive province of
the jury. The King v. Christie,[2];
Hubin v. The King,[3]; Vigeant
v. The King,[4].

Corroboration must be found in some other legal
evidence which tends to implicate the accused. This other evidence may of
course be direct or circumstantial, oral or by writing or otherwise, as long as
it leads to the reasonable belief that the statement of the accomplice is true,
and does not let it stand alone. This additional evidence must be independent,
that is to say, it must be free from any acts or words attributable to the
witness for whom corroboration is sought, otherwise this witness would be a
party to his own corroboration. (The King v. Christie,[5]; Hubin v. The King,[6]. Likewise, an accomplice cannot be
corroborated by another accomplice, and it is further an essential ingredient
of corroboration that it should tend to show not only that a crime has been
committed, but that it has been committed by the accused.

Of course, corroboration must not be so meagre
that it should create a mere possibility that the accused has committed the
crime for which he is charged; it should be strong enough to sufficiently
impress the mind of the jury not with the probability of a conjecture, but with
the probability of the truth of a fact put in evidence. It need not be
conclusive, but it will be sufficient if it is pre-

[Page 95]

sumptive, provided that the facts independently
proven, and from which inferences are drawn, are consistent in tending to show
the guilt of the accused, and are inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion that the accused is the guilty person.

With deference, I am of opinion that the trial
judge has properly instructed the jury as to the law and as to their duties,
and that his charge is not impeachable.

The Court of Appeal for Ontario, in hearing the
first appeal in Rex. v. MacDonald and Rex. v. Mancuso, came to the
conclusion that a new trial in the case of MacDonald should be granted, because
the learned trial judge had warned the jury that Shorting might be considered
as an accomplice, but did not give the same warning as to Wilkinson. The Court
properly said that the warning should have been given as to both witnesses,
because the question as to whether they were accomplices or not was a question
to be decided by the jury after the proper instructions had been given to them.

But in the present case, the situation is
entirely different. The learned trial judge, after having given the proper
legal definition of an accomplice, left it to the jury to determine if in fact
Shorting and Wilkinson were accomplices. He then went on to explain that, if
they were found to be accomplices, it was dangerous to convict the appellant on
the uncorroborated evidence of Shorting and Wilkinson. He explained the legal
meaning of corroboration; told all that was essential to give a legal probative
value to corroborative evidence which must be of independent nature; he pointed
out that something outside the evidence of the witness must be found which
strengthens or confirms it; he said that the evidence of one accomplice cannot
be accepted as corroboration of the evidence of another, that it need not be
direct evidence, but that it may be circumstantial, as long as it connects or
tends to connect the accused with the charge against him in some material
circumstance. He also explained that if the jury found that they might decide
that Shorting was an accomplice and Wilkinson was not, in that event, the
evidence of the witness whom the jury found not to be an accomplice, could be
taken as corroboration of the evidence of the other.

[Page 96]

These directions given by the trial judge are in
harmony, I think, with what has been said in numerous well known cases, which
have definitely established the rules that are to be followed in this country.

As early as in 1855 and even before, it was
decided in Regina v. Stubbs[7],
that the rule that a jury should not convict on the unsupported evidence of an
accomplice is a rule of practice only, and not a rule of law, and that a judge
should advise the jury to acquit unless the testimony of the accomplice be
corroborated, not only as to the circumstances of the offence, but also as to
the participation in it by the accused, and that where there are several
prisoners, and the accomplice is not confirmed as to all, the jury should be
directed to acquit the prisoners as to whom he is not confirmed; but it was
held that this rule being a rule of practice only, if a jury choose to act on
the unconfirmed testimony of the accomplice, the conviction cannot be quashed
as bad in law.

Later, in re Baskerville,[8] the Court of Criminal Appeal in England
decided at page 87:

There is no doubt that the uncorroborated
evidence of an accomplice is admissible in law. See Rex v. Atwood[9]. But it has long been a rule of practice at
common law for the judge to warn the jury of the danger of convicting a
prisoner on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice or accomplices, and,
in the discretion of the judge, to advise them not to convict upon such
evidence; but the judge should point out to the jury that it is within their
legal province to convict upon such unconfirmed evidence: Reg. v. Stubbs6;
In re Meunier,[10].

At page 91 in the same case, it is said:

We hold that evidence in corroboration must
be independent testimony which affects the accused by connecting or tending to
connect him with the crime. In other words, it must be evidence which
implicates him, that is, which confirms in some material particular not only
the evidence that the crime has been committed, but also that the prisoner
committed it. The test applicable to determine the nature and extent of the
corroboration is thus the same whether the case falls within the rule of
practice at common law or within that class of offence for which corroboration
is required by statute. The language of the statute, “implicating the accused,”
compendiously incorporates the test applicable at common law in the rule of
practice. The nature of the corroboration will necessarily vary according to
the particular circumstances of the offence charged. It would be in a high
degree dangerous to attempt to formulate the kind of evidence which would be
regarded as corrobora-

[Page 97]

tion, except to say that corroborative
evidence is evidence which shews or tends to shew that the story of the
accomplice that the accused committed the crime is true, not merely that the
crime has been committed, but that it was committed by the accused.

The corroboration need not be direct
evidence that the accused committed the crime; it is sufficient if it is merely
circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime. A good instance of
this indirect evidence is to be found in Reg. v. Birkett[11].

Reference may also be made to the Beebe case[12]; Gouin v. The King[13]; Hubin v. The King[14]; Vigeant v. The King[15].

The jury had, therefore, several alternatives.
They could reach the conclusion that Shorting and Wilkinson were not
accomplices, and convict on their uncorroborated evidence. It was open to them
to believe that Wilkinson and Shorting were in no way connected with the
robbery and with the imprisoning of Butcher, and that although they both might
have violated the provincial liquor laws of Ontario, or might be a party to the
receiving of the stolen goods, they were not implicated in the armed robbery
and kidnapping. The offence of receiving stolen goods is a different offence
from the one for which the appellant was charged. It has been said that under
common law, the receipt of stolen goods did not constitute the receiver an
accessory to the theft, but was a distinct misdemeanour punishable by fine and
imprisonment. (Archibald’s Criminal Pleadings Evidence and Practice, 28th
edition, p. 1463).

In Rex v. Dumont[16], Mr. Justice Hodgins said:

I cannot regard the widow as an accomplice.
The test is: could she have been indicted under the wide provisions of our Code
for the offence for which the prisoner has been convicted? If she could, then
any spectator of a crime might find himself described as an accomplice, for
here she only saw the first blow struck and later witnessed the carrying out of
her husband.

The Court of Appeal for Ontario in Rex v.
Zocanno and Burleigh[17] said:

On a charge of breaking and entering, a
witness who was found in possession of some of the stolen property, and who
subsequently became an accomplice of the accused in other crimes in connection
with the disposition of some of the stolen property, is not an accomplice in
respect of the crime charged.

[Page 98]

It is quite unnecessary to examine the soundness
of these decisions. But the only ground, upon which they could possibly be
challenged, is that the possession of recently stolen goods is evidence upon
which a jury may convict of theft, but this possession creates a mere
presumption, and here, there is ample evidence to justify a jury to say that
the presumption has been rebutted. Rex v. Watson[18]; Baker v. The King[19].

The jury could also take the view that Shorting
or Wilkinson was an accomplice, and that the other was not. Then, they could
properly find the corroboration of one witness in the testimony of the other.

Another course the jury could follow was that,
even if both were accomplices, they could convict without corroboration, having
been on that point properly instructed by the trial judge. They knew that this
was a dangerous practice to follow, but it was within their province to do so
and to believe Shorting and Wilkinson.

Lastly, if they did rely on corroboration in
view of the warning given by the judge, because they believed Shorting and
Wilkinson to be accomplices, they had independent circumstantial evidence which
was of an incriminating nature. The presence of the appellant with the
perpetrators of the crime in his own apartment, and his association with them,
a few hours after the robbery, was a circumstance from which the jury could
reasonably draw the inference, that Shorting and Wilkinson were speaking the
truth when they swore that MacDonald was in the barn helping to unload the
stolen liquor. It was also for them to believe that MacDonald would not have
been present at that meeting if he was not linked in some material way with the
others who have been found guilty.

Another most extraordinary circumstance is that,
when heard as a witness in his own defence, MacDonald swore that all these
people gathered in his apartment after the robbery, the unloading of the stolen
liquor and the imprisonment of Butcher, did not mention among themselves the
stolen liquor. This statement could be regarded as implausible by the jury, and
as not being an expression of the truth. The jury saw and heard MacDonald, and

[Page 99]

from his demeanour, and from what they had the
right to believe as being an absence of reasonableness, they could draw their
own conclusions.

The behaviour of a witness as well as his
contradictory, or untrue statements are questions of fact from which a jury may
properly infer corroboration.

In The King v. Christie,[20] Lord Moulton said:

The evidential value of the occurrence
depends entirely on the behaviour of the prisoner, for the fact that some one
makes a statement to him subsequently to the commission of the crime cannot in
itself have any value as evidence for or against him. The only evidence for or
against him is his behaviour in response to the charge, but I can see no
justification for laying down as a rule of law that any particular form of
response, whether of a positive or negative character, is such that it cannot
in some circumstances have an evidential value. I am, therefore, of opinion
that there is no rule of law that evidence cannot be given of the accused being
charged with the offence and of his behaviour on hearing such charge where that
behaviour amounts to a denial of his guilt.

In Mash v. Barley,[21] Kennedy L.J. said:

I also agree that there may be cases in
which language, whether used in a Court of justice or outside a Court of
justice, may be considered as having the effect of corroboration, although
there is nothing like an express admission. There may be such cases.

Under the circumstances of this case, I think
that the jury could properly conclude that the meeting in MacDonald’s apartment
after the robbery, with the others who were since convicted, and his denial of
any reference to the stolen liquor, were facts from which the jury, if they
chose, could find elements of corroboration of Shorting’s and Wilkinson’s
evidence. In view of the evidence adduced, these circumstances could be found
consistent with appellant’s guilt and inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion.

The second ground raised by the appellant is that
counsel for the Crown, in his address to the jury, read a part of the reasons
for judgment of Mr. Justice McRuer, in the first appeal. Mr. Justice
McRuer had said:

The evidence of Shorting, it was argued,
ought not to have been received while the charge of receiving was pending
against him. I cannot agree with this contention. Nor do I think there was any
impropriety in presenting the evidence of Shorting under the circumstances.
Crown Counsel has a duty to offer to the Court such evidence as is available
bearing on the charge in question. In many cases it is not only necessary but
the duty of the Crown Counsel to call witnesses of low repute

[Page 100]

and against whom a charge may be pending.
In the case of appeal it would have been quite impractical to have proceeded
against Shorting on the charge of receiving until the accused had been tried on
the principal charge.

It is argued that the reading of this extract
was improper and amounted to a mistrial, because it dealt with the credibility
of Shorting as a witness, which was a vital issue of the trial. It is submitted
that anything Mr. Justice McRuer said was not the opinion of the Court, and
that if such extracts were read, the different opinions of other judges on the
same point should also have been communicated to the jury.

The question would be different, if in fact
Mr. Justice McRuer had said anything that would tend to create a
favourable impression as to Shorting’s credibility; but I find nothing of that
kind in that part of the judgment that was read to the jury. Obviously, Miss
Parsons, counsel for the appellant, had attacked the propriety of calling
Shorting as a witness and it was owing only to the position in which the Crown
had found itself at the time of the first trial that Mr. Justice McRuer
referred. I am unable to find anything in these remarks that can be interpreted
as praising Shorting’s credibility. The indirect reference to Shorting, who was
the Crown’s main incriminating witness against the appellant, as a man of “low
repute and against whom a charge may be pending” is surely not a vindication of
his credibility as a witness. I am far from agreeing with the proposition that
the Crown should call in all circumstances a person as a witness while a
criminal charge is outstanding against him, or with the propriety of Crown
counsel reading the judgment of a judge who had taken part in the hearing of
the previous appeal, but the reading of what Mr. Justice McRuer had said
involves no miscarriage of justice.

The appeal should be dismissed.

The judgment of Rand and Kellock JJ. was
delivered by

RAND J.—The first ground of challenge to the
conviction was the direction of the trial judge that the meeting in the
apartment of the accused within four or five hours of the unloading of the
liquor in the barn could be taken

[Page 101]

as corroboration of the evidence given by
Shorting. There were present at that time Mancuso, Baskett and Edwin MacDonald,
who were afterwards convicted of the robbery, two admitted bootleggers and the
accused, himself a gambler and a bootlegger. Edwin MacDonald is a brother of
the accused and Baskett is married to a step-sister of a woman who lives with
the accused. The car in which the truck‑driver was kidnapped was owned by
the father-in-law of Baskett. It is not clear just how long they had been
together before the detective arrived, shortly after one o’clock. When he
entered, Baskett, Edwin MacDonald and a bootlegger, Taylor, were in the bedroom
just off the living room, with MacDonald lying on the bed; in the living room
were Mancuso, the bootlegger Applebaum, and the accused, talking to Applebaum.
He was described as being under the influence of liquor, with an appearance of
having been up all night. On the stand, he gave reasons for the presence of the
different persons in his home and denied that the liquor had been mentioned.
These explanations and this denial, in the setting in which they were offered,
could have been accepted only by very credulous persons.

It is argued that the presence of these men,
characterized by the circumstances indicated, was as consistent with innocence
as with guilt; that either the gathering was mere coincidence or that the
thieves might have made use of the apartment to arrange for disposing of the
liquor without any previous knowledge on the part of the accused. Considering
all of the evidence bearing upon it, including an adverse inference from
disbelief in the improbable testimony of the accused, I am unable to treat the
incident as being neutral in its probative effect; that the jury could find a
balance of probability tending to connect him with the robbery seems to me to
be perfectly clear; and no more is necessary, Thomas v. Jones[22]. The direction was, therefore, well
founded, and on this ground the appeal must fail.

Then in his address, the Crown Prosecutor
introduced a quotation from the judgment of McRuer J.A. in the appeal from the
first conviction, which dealt with the pro-

[Page 102]

priety of offering Shorting as a witness when
there was a charge pending against him which had been the subject of twelve
adjournments, in these words:

Now, fortunately, in this very case one of
the Justices of Appeal made some comments on the propriety of the crown acting
as they did with regard to Shorting. The evidence of Shorting, it was argued, “ought
not to have been received while the charge of receiving was pending against
him. I cannot agree with this contention.” This is what the Justice said: I was
there. “nor do I think there was any impropriety in presenting the evidence of
Shorting under the circumstances. Crown Counsel has a duty to offer to the
Court such evidence as is available bearing on the charge in question. In many
cases it is not only necessary but the duty of the Crown is to call witnesses
of low repute and against whom a charge may be pending. In the case in appeal
it would have been quite impractical to have proceeded against Shorting on the
charge of receiving until the accused had been tried on the principal charge.”

Evidence of these and subsequent adjournments
was introduced at the second trial and we are told, and it is not questioned,
that, in her address, Miss Parsons stressed rigorously the importance of
Shorting’s evidence and the possible effect upon him of those circumstances
followed by the withdrawal of the preliminary proceeding against him in 1945, a
few weeks before the second trial.

There is no doubt the quotation ought not to
have been made; it was wholly irrelevant to the matters before the jury; and if
I could bring myself to the view that it might have influenced them in making
up their minds on the credibility of Shorting, I would not hesitate to hold
with Laidlaw J.A. that it was an impropriety to be cured only by a new trial.
But when the language is carefully examined in the background of the
suggestions of counsel, its application to Shorting is really derogatory; it is
simply a statement by a judge of what should be obvious to an ordinary juryman;
and I do not think its effect can be taken to have been more than to bring
forcibly to their minds the fact that in criminal prosecutions of the order in
question the Crown more often than not is compelled by the necessities of the
case to offer witnesses with character or reputation possessing little to
commend them to belief. This ground fails then likewise.

The appeal should therefore be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA EN BANC

Criminal law—Trial on charge of rape—Question
whether trial judge should have charged jury as to possible alternative
findings of lesser offence—Question whether failure of accused to testify was
made subject of comment, contrary to Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 59,
s. 4 (5).

The appeal was from the judgment of the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc dismissing appeal from appellant's
conviction on a charge of rape. The appeal to this Court was on two questions
of law on which there was dissent in said Court en banc, in connection
with the trial Judge's charge to the jury, it being contended: (1) He erred in
failing to instruct them as to possible alternative findings of a lesser
offence, there being evidence to warrant such a finding. (The trial Judge
withdrew from the jury a count of indecent assault contained in the indictment
and stated, according to an affidavit offered to the Court en banc, that
they ""must find a verdict of rape or nothing""; and he directed his
charge only to the count of rape). (2) The failure of the accused to testify
was made the subject of comment, contrary to s. 4 (5) of the Canada Evidence
Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 59. (The trial Judge stated: ""* * * You heard the
story of this woman * * * and her evidence is not denied * * * I can see
nothing in the conduct of this woman that day, according to her evidence—and
that is the only evidence we have as to her conduct excepting the other
witnesses that came in here to tell the `story of what she told them * * * It
was his doing, according to the evidence and the only evidence we have * *
*"").

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed (Taschereau J. dissented).

Per the Chief
Justice, Kerwin and Hudson, JJ.: As to the first contention: On the evidence (discussed),
the only evidence of the actual commission of the crime, on which the jury
could reasonably have returned a verdict of guilty, pointed only to rape, if
the jury believed the victim's story, or not guilty, if they did not believe
her; and the trial Judge's charge in this respect was justified. As to the
second contention: The trial Judge's remarks complained of could not be taken
to have had any effect on the jury as being a comment obnoxious to s. 4 (5) of
the Canada Evidence Act. (It was remarked that said words ""her
evidence is not denied"" were no doubt referring to statements made by the
victim, after the occurrence, to other persons, who gave evidence) (Rex v.
Gallagher, 37 Can. Cr.
C. 83, and Bigaouette v. The King, [1927] S.C.R. 112, discussed and
distinguished. Opinion expressed that the latter case went as far on the
subject in question as this Court would care to go).

[Page 320]

Per Taschereau
J., dissenting: As to the first contention (the second one is not dealt with):
It was open to the jury upon the evidence to find, if they saw fit, that the
accused was guilty only of an attempt to commit rape (a lesser offence included
in the major charge of rape), and the failure of the trial Judge to instruct
them that such a verdict was open to them and that it was within their power to
find the accused guilty of a reduced offence was fatal to the legality of the
verdict, and therefore the conviction should be quashed and a new trial
directed. (The facts were not sufficiently clear to allow an appellate court to
substitute, for the verdict found by the jury, a verdict of guilty of a lesser
offence, as may be done in certain cases under s. 1016 of the Criminal Code).

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia en banc dismissing appeal from the conviction of
appellant, at trial before Carroll J. and a jury, on a charge of rape. There
was dissent in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc on certain
questions of law in connection with the trial Judge's charge to the jury, which
questions are set out and discussed in the reasons for judgment in this Court
now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed, Taschereau J. dissenting.

R. A. Ritchie for the appellant.

R. M. Fielding K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin and
Hudson JJ. was delivered by

The Chief
Justice.—The appellant was, by a jury, found guilty of
rape and, on appeal, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, sitting, en banc, affirmed
his conviction.

In the order dismissing the appeal, Smiley J. is
stated to have dissented on questions of law, to wit:—

(1) That the learned trial Judge erred in
failing to instruct the jury as to possible alternative verdicts.

(2) That the failure of the person charged to
testify was made the subject of comment by the learned trial Judge contrary to
Section 4, sub-section. 5, of the Canada Evidence Act.

On the first point. Although Doull J., who sat
in the Court of Appeal, is not stated in the formal judgment to have actually
dissented, if we look at the learned Judge's reasons we find that, as he
expressed it:—

Giving the accused the benefit of every
argument, I proceed to give effect to the doubtful opinion which I have that
the verdict of an attempt

[Page 321]

was open to the jury. No reasonable jury
could in my opinion have found a verdict of anything less than attempted rape
and it seems to me that a new trial is a most undesirable outcome of this
prosecution.

On the actual findings, it appears that the
jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved the accused at least guilty
of an attempt. The court should therefore substitute a verdict of guilty of
attempted rape and pass a sentence of four years' imprisonment in Dorchester
Penitentiary.

We take that to be a dissenting opinion by Doull
J.; more particularly since the sentence against the appellant on the charge as
brought was for five years. The point would be in respect of the failure of the
learned trial Judge to charge the jury as to lesser offences. In the opinion of
Smiley J., ""there was evidence in this case from which the jury might
reasonably have inferred that the accused was guilty of a lesser offence, not
necessarily that contained in the second count"". The learned Judge
referred to Sections 949 and 951 of the Criminal Code, which read as
follows:—

949. When the complete commission of an
offence charged is not proved but the evidence establishes an attempt to commit
the offence, the accused may be convicted of such attempt and punished
accordingly.

951. Every count shall be deemed divisible;
and if the commission of the offence charged, as described in the enactment
creating the offence or as charged in the count, includes the commission of any
other offence, the person accused may be convicted of any offence so included
which is proved, although the whole offence charged is not proved; or he may be
convicted of an attempt to commit any offence so included.

We omit paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 951,
as they deal with counts charging murder, or manslaughter, and have no
application here.

The indictment in the present case contained two
counts, the first being that of rape, and the second that of indecent assault.
The learned trial Judge withdrew from the consideration of the jury the second
count in the indictment and directed his charge to the first count only, on
which the jury returned a verdict of guilty.

It is said that the trial Judge, when he
announced that he was withdrawing the count of indecent assault from the jury,
added that he ""was going to instruct them that they must find a verdict of
rape or nothing"", and that counsel should confine himself to the question
of rape. This is based on an affidavit offered to the Court of Appeal by Mr.
Norman D. Murray, Barrister at Law, who acted

[Page 322]

as counsel for the appellant upon his trial.
Nothing to that effect is to be found in the charge itself; but, as two of the
learned Judges of Appeal based their dissenting opinions on that point, we
think we ought to consider it in the present judgment.

The contention is that, by force of Sections 949
and 951, reproduced above, a jury properly instructed might have found the
accused guilty only of an attempt to commit the offence, or of the lesser
offence of indecent assault, notwithstanding that the latter charge was already
contained in the second count of the indictment and the learned trial Judge had
withdrawn that count from the jury.

The only evidence at the trial pointing to the
guilt of the accused was as to his being guilty of the crime of rape. That was
the story of the victim, Mrs. Myrna D. Bosma.

No doubt in a crime such as the one under
consideration, the initial step might be stated to be an indecent assault,
followed by the subsequent step which might be described as an attempt to rape;
but, when once the rape is stated to have taken place, there no longer remains
any question of indecent assault, or attempted rape, if the story of the victim
is believed.

In her testimony, Mrs. Bosma definitely states
that she was raped by the appellant. In the words of Sir Joseph Chisholm,
C.J.:—

She said the appellant had tried to rape
her—a quite correct statement—and she followed that answer with the direct
statement that he did commit the offence of rape. I do not think that any jury
could reasonably, from the fragment on which the contention is based, conclude
that the offence was merely an attempt, nor do I think that the first answer
should be weighed in isolation from the second. It was as if she exclaimed in
her excitement: ""He tried to rape me and he succeeded"".

It is true that when she was on her way back to Halifax she told Mr. Murdock Bell, who
testified to that effect:—""She said she had been attacked"". But, of
course, it was not to be expected that she would, in her conversation with Mr.
Bell, go into the details of what had taken place and the word
""attacked"" is quite apt to include the fact of the rape itself.

Then when the victim spoke to her housekeeper,
Mrs. Marion Marriott, she first mentioned that the appellant had
""mistreated her"". Mrs. Marriott was then asked whether the victim
described the mistreatment in any way,

[Page 323]

and she said that she did and that the
description which she gave of the mistreatment was ""that he had tried to
rape her"". The next question was:—""Did she say that he did?"",
and the answer is ""Yes, after she was upstairs, she said that he
did."" Again the question is put to Mrs. Marriott:—""And she said that
he had raped her?"", and the answer is ""Yes"".

Even if the testimony of Mr. Bell and of Mrs.
Marriott was to be taken as evidence of the commission of the offence itself,
it will be seen that in both instances the statements made by Mrs. Bosma to
them could not convey the idea that the accused had stopped at mere indecent
assault, or at attempted rape, but, on the contrary, they would tend to show
that actual rape was consummated. But it is not to be forgotten that Mrs.
Bosnia's statements, either to Mr. Bell or to her landlady, were not admissible
for the purpose of proving the crime; they were merely evidence of the
complaints subsequently made by Mrs. Bosma in order to show that her acts and
statements after the commission of the offence were consistent with her
evidence as to the actual facts that had taken place at the appellant's house
on the occasion where rape is alleged to have been committed by the appellant
upon Mrs. Bosma.

So that the only evidence there is in the record
of the actual commission of the crime, on which the jury could reasonably have
returned a verdict of guilty, pointed only to rape, if they believed the story
of Mrs. Bosma, or not guilty, if they did not believe her.

We, therefore, think that the learned trial
Judge, even if he did not actually say so in his charge, was justified in
withdrawing from the jury the count relating to indecent assault, and also in
telling the jury that, in the circumstances shown in the evidence properly
admissible, the only verdict could be either guilty of rape or not guilty. This
was the view of the majority of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, and
we cannot agree with the learned dissenting Judges that, in doing what he did,
the learned trial Judge erred in such a way as to justify the contention that
the jury might have found the accused guilty of a lesser offence and that, on
account of this failure, a new trial should be ordered.

[Page 324]

Dealing now with the second point. The portions
of the charge, to which objection is made, are as follows:—

Now, he is charged with rape and I tried to
define what rape is to you. You heard the story of this woman, who came on the
witness stand here, and her evidence is not denied.

And later the trial Judge said:—

Now Gentlemen, I am not going into the
sordid things that took place there, but I can see nothing in the conduct of
this woman that day, according to her evidence—and that is the only evidence we
have as to her conduct excepting the other witnesses that came in here to tell
the story of what she told them—I see nothing in her conduct that day that
should make the jury detract from the truth of anything that she said.

And then again:—

It was his doing, according to the evidence
and the only evidence we have * * *

On that point, as already stated, the majority
of the Court of Appeal was of the opinion that the remarks complained of do not
in effect amount to such comment that they may be regarded as obnoxious to the
statutory direction.

Doull J., in that regard, in the course of his
reasons, said:—

I certainly dissent from any pronouncement
that a statement of a judge that certain evidence is ""not denied"" or
is ""uncontradicted"" without more is a sufficient ground for setting
aside a verdict. The words ""subject of comment"" mean something more
than a reference to evidence as ""uncontradicted"". There must be
something which pointedly draws the attention of the jury to the fact that
there is evidence which the accused could give and which he has failed to give.

For his dissenting opinion on that point, Smiley
J. relied on the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of
Alberta in Rex v. Gallagher[1], and on
the judgment of this Court in Bigaouette v. The King[2]. He also said that in the Bigaouette case
a certain part of the statement of Stuart J.A. in the Gallagher case was
quoted with approval in this Court.

In the Gallagher case (1), the trial
Judge in his charge to the jury suggested that evidence ought to have been
given which only the accused could have given. The actual words by him were (p.
85):—

Now then, though we have the evidence which
we have that the defendant was the last person seen in the company of the
murdered man, the circumstantial evidence that he was killed at a certain time
after-

[Page 325]

wards and the circumstantial evidence as to
the possession of these bullets and the possession of the firearm or firearms
and that is not denied by the defendant, it would still seem to leave room for
a reasonable doubt as to whether or not he was the person who committed this
crime ……

There is no suggestion of anything else, he
either went down that path towards his own home or he went on with the car and
there is no suggestion from the defence or any other person that he could have
gone any other way.

It will be seen that there the trial Judge in
his charge to the jury offended, unwittingly no doubt, against the provision
contained in subsection (5) of Section 4 of the Canada Evidence Act that:—

The failure of the person charged * * * to
testify, shall not be made the subject of comment by the judge * * *

There the defendant, in the first part of the
portion of the charge objected to, was specifically mentioned, and in the
second part of it was referred to in such a way that it could not apply to
anybody else but the defendant.

In the Bigaouette case[3], the learned trial Judge said:—

Le docteur Marois a fait l'autopsie à trois
heures et quart, et si vous croyez son témoignage (c'est un homme dont le
témoignage a du poids), il a déclaré que la mort avait dû arriver à sept
heures, ou à six heures et même avant, du matin.

Voilà les circonstances qui enveloppent la
mort de la défunte.

Si la mort, mes amis, remonte à six heures
ou à sept heures du matin, où était l'accusé à ce moment-là, vers sept heures
ou six heures du matin, même plus à bonne heure? A la maison. A la maison, car,
d'après sa propre déclaration, il n'est sorti qu'à huit heures du matin.

Il était donc seul avec sa mère à la maison
quand la mort est arrivée et si l'accusé était seul avec sa mère quand elle a
été tuée et égorgée, la défense aurait dû être capable d'expliquer par qui ce
meurtre a été commis. Car une pareille boucherie n'a pas dû se faire, sans que
l'accusé en eut connaissance.

As was said by Duff J., as he then was,
delivering the judgment of the Court:—

It seems to be reasonably clear that,
according to the interpretation which would appear to the jury as the more
natural and probable one, the comment implied in this passage upon the failure
of la défense to explain who committed the murder would, having regard
to the circumstances emphasized by the learned trial judge, be this, namely,
that it related to the failure of the accused to testify upon that subject at
the trial. It is conceivable., of course, that such language might be
understood as relating to a failure to give an explanation to police officers
or others; but the language of the charge is so easily and naturally capable of
being understood in the other way, that it seems plainly obnoxious to the
enactment referred to, subs. 5 of s. 4, R.S.C., c. 145.

[Page 326]

Smiley J., as already adverted to, said that the
latter part of the statement of Stuart J.A., in Rex v. Gallagher[4] had been approved by this Court in the Bigaouette
case[5], but
the words which were approved as correctly stating the law are quoted in the
judgment of this Court and they only expressed a general view of the law
without in any way applying them to the particular facts of the Gallagher case
(1). They are merely to the effect that, even if the language used is just as
capable of one meaning as the other, the position would be that the jury would
be just as likely to take the words in the sense in which it was forbidden to
use them, as in the innocuous sense, and in such circumstance the error was
thought fatal.

We have nothing of the kind here. The accused
appellant was no where mentioned in those portions of the charge which are
objected to. In the last two paragraphs above mentioned the only statement in
the charge is that the evidence of the victim is ""the only evidence we
have""; and, as to the first statement: ""her evidence is not
denied"", the learned Judge no doubt was referring there to the fact that,
in the course of Mrs. Bosnia's evidence, she said that on her way back to
Halifax she had told Mr. Bell that she had been attacked and Mr. Bell confirmed
that; also that when she reached her house she had told Mrs. Marriott that she
had been mistreated and had described such mistreatment by saying that the appellant
""had tried to rape her"" and ""she said that he did"". Not
only was that not denied, but it was confirmed by Mrs. Marriott.

We think the Bigaouette case5
certainly goes as far on that subject as this Court would care to go and, like
the majority of the Court of Appeal, we are unable to find that the remarks
here complained of could have any effect on the jury as being a comment
""obnoxious to the statutory direction"".

We think, therefore, that the appeal should be
dismissed.

Taschereau J. (dissenting)—The appellant was indicted for rape and indecent
assault. In the course of the address of defendant's counsel, the presiding
Judge withdrew the count of indecent assault, and left the jury with the only

[Page 327]

alternative of finding the accused
""guilty"" or ""not guilty"" of rape. A verdict of
""guilty"" was returned, and the appellant was sentenced to five years
in the penitentiary.

His appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia
was dismissed, Justices Doull and Smiley dissenting. The former thought that a
verdict of attempted rape was open to the jury, and was of opinion that such a
verdict should be substituted to the one given by the jury. The latter reached
the conclusion that there was evidence from which the jury might reasonably
have inferred that the accused was guilty of a lesser offence, nor necessarily
that contained in the second count, and he was also of opinion that certain
comments made by the trial Judge might have been considered by the jury as
relating to the failure of the accused to testify. He would have granted a new
trial.

Before this Court, it is submitted on behalf of
the appellant that the learned trial Judge erred in failing to instruct the
jury as to possible alternative verdicts, and that the failure of the appellant
to testify was made the subject of comment in the charge to the jury.

It is undisputed and undisputable that the
offence of rape for which the appellant was charged, is one of those offences
which may be reduced, and that the accused, if the evidence does not warrant a
conviction for the major offence, may be found guilty of a lesser one. Under
the Criminal Code, (949-951), every count is deemed divisible, and when
the offence charged includes all the elements of a lesser offence, the person
accused may be convicted of the offence as charged, or may be convicted of an
attempt to commit the offence charged, or he may be convicted of the lesser
offence or of an attempt to commit it. In the case of rape, the possible
verdicts which in law may be found, are, therefore, attempted rape, indecent
assault, common assault, or attempt to commit one of these lesser offences. In
the case at bar, the charge of indecent assault in a separate count was quite
unnecessary, as it was included in the major charge of rape.

Of course, it cannot be contended that all these
intermediate verdicts are open to the jury in all cases. They will receive the
sanction of the courts only if there exists a foundation of facts which would
justify a reasonable jury, properly instructed, to reach such a conclusion. In

[Page 328]

other instances a trial Judge will, therefore,
be well advised to instruct the jury that the only possible verdict is
""guilty"" or ""not guilty"" of the major offence which is
charged, and that there is no room for any other finding.

The facts of each particular case must be
considered, but whenever there is evidence, the jury must be free to weigh it,
to consider it in the light of all the circumstances of the case, and all the
possible verdicts must be left open to them, even if it is unlikely that they
will reach some of them.

And if any authority is needed to substantiate
these propositions, I may refer to the cases of The King v. Hughes[6]; The King v. Hopper[7]; Rex v. Roberts[8].

It follows that it is the imperative duty of the
trial Judge to instruct the jury as to all the verdicts which they have the
right to find, and that he may not impose his personal views upon them, by
withdrawing from their consideration certain verdicts which they could reach if
they accepted a certain view of the facts as revealed by the evidence that
would reasonably justify them to find the accused guilty of a lesser offence.

In the present case, I do not find it necessary
to deal with the question of there being any evidence on which the jury might
find indecent or common assault. A graver offence may have been committed, but
I strongly disagree with the view that it was necessarily rape, and that the
jury, if left free, had not before them the necessary foundation of facts to
reach the conclusion, if they found fit, that the appellant was guilty of
attempted rape. I do not say that such would have been their verdict, but I am
of opinion that it was for them to decide.

It fell within their province after weighing the
surrounding circumstances of the evidence, to say if all the necessary steps
towards the full execution of the criminal purpose had been completed, or if
they were interrupted before the act, which the appellant had in mind, had been
totally accomplished within the meaning of the Criminal Code. If this last
hypothesis had been accepted by the jury, a verdict of attempt to commit rape
could not have been qualified as perverse and would have undoubtedly been left
undisturbed by the courts, if challenged by the Crown.

[Page 329]

But the jury were not instructed that such a
verdict was open to them, and that it was within their power to find the
appellant guilty of a reduced offence. The failure to give such a direction
was, I think, fatal to the legality of the verdict, and it should therefore be
quashed. In view of this conclusion, it is useless to discuss the second point
raised by the appellant.

Section 1016, Cr. Code, is drafted in
terms broad enough to allow a court of appeal in certain cases, to substitute
for the verdict found a verdict of guilty of a lesser offence. But I do not
think that in the present case such a course should be followed. I am not
satisfied that the facts are sufficiently clear to allow me to make such a
substitution, without assuming the role which belongs exclusively to the jury.
This course may be adopted when it appears to a court of appeal that the jury
must have been satisfied of facts which proved the accused guilty of the lesser
offence, but such a situation does not arise in the present case.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction
and direct a new trial.

Rand J.—I concur in dismissing the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION

Criminal law—Negligence—Child drowned in oil well—Charge
against owner of failing to guard the well adequately—Criminal Code, ss. 247,
284, 287 (b)—Child a trespasser—Duty and responsibility of owner of well.

[Page 191]

The appeal was from the conviction of appellant by the
Appellate Division, Alberta, [1944] 2 W.W.R. 503 (which set aside the judgment
of acquittal at trial), under ss. 247, 284 and 287 (b) of the Criminal
Code, of failing to guard adequately the cellar of an oil well of
appellant, in consequence whereof a child of tender years was drowned therein.
The well was not, and for some time had not been, in use, and there had been
erected a structure around and over it as a guard against danger. The child, in
company with other children, had climbed on the structure and in walking along
was accidentally pushed off by an older boy into the water below.

Held: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of
acquittal at trial restored.

Per the Chief Justice and Rand J.: Sees. 247 and 284
embody the common law rule and, under them, apart from s. 287, appellant could
not in the circumstances be held criminally responsible for the accident. The
child was a trespasser. Children were not tolerated about the well, there was
no practice of playing there, and on the occasions

[Page 192]

when a few played there, they were, if
seen, warned off by the owner's employees, chiefly because of danger from gas
and fire and the pressure in the pipes. There was no object of fascination
alluring children nor active conduct by the owner in disregard of children's
known or necessarily apprehended presence. In such circumstances the rule at
common law that (with certain exceptions not present here) an owner of land is
entitled to do with it what he pleases, and that trespassers move at their own
risk and peril, is as applicable to children as to adults (Holland v. Lanarkshire,
1909 Sess. Cas. 1142, and other cases, cited). As to s. 287 (b),
assuming the excavation here to be within its scope, what is there
contemplated, as indicated by its language, is the prevention of injury from
hidden openings; the required fence or guard must protect the unwary; but when
the existence of the opening is made evident (as in this case) the purpose of
the fence or guard is accomplished; the owner must protect the trespasser on
the land from a trap, but he is not called on to protect against a subsequent
danger from trespassing on the guard itself raised against that trap; and the
scope of the duty is as limited in relation to children as to adults.

Per Kerwin and Estey JJ.: The evidence supports the
trial Judge's finding that the child was a trespasser; and, under the common
law rule, of which s. 247 of the Criminal Code is a restatement,
appellant, in the circumstances of this case, would not be liable to
trespassers, including children (Hardy v. Central London Ry. Co., [1920]
3 K.B. 459, at 473, and other
cases, cited); the precautions taken and the warning and chasing away of
children exonerated appellant from any suggestion of intention to injure or
trap or of callous or wanton disregard of consequences.

As to respondent's contention (in the Appellate Division and
in this Court) that the facts disclosed an offence under s. 287 (b)
(under which the charge was not laid and which was not brought to the trial
Judge's attention) and that by virtue of ss. 951, 1013(5) and 1016(2) a
conviction should now be directed—It is doubtful if the offence under s. 287
could, within the meaning of those sections, be an offence so included under s.
247, both because of the essentials required to constitute the offence and
because it is a summary conviction rather than an indictable offence. Apart
from these considerations, the evidence did not disclose that an offence was
committed under s. 287, as the excavation was so far guarded that instead of
accidentally falling therein within the meaning of s. 287 (b), the
children climbed over the barrier.

Per Taschereau J.: The Appellate Division erred in
finding a breach of the duty imposed by s. 287 (b). The duty
imposed by s. 287 (b) is to fence the excavation in such a manner
that a person riding, driving or walking shall not fall therein accidentally.
It would unduly stretch the scope of s. 287 (b) and do violence
to its text, to hold that the fence must be so built that entrance is
impossible. What is contemplated is to protect a motorist or pedestrian from a
danger of which he is unaware and which may accidentally cause his death; it
does not apply to the present case, where a trespasser succeeded in making his
way to the excavation where the danger was obvious and was accidentally pushed
into the water by a companion.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate
Division[1],
which (setting aside the 3 judgment
of acquittal by Ives C.J.T.D.) convicted the present appellant

For that it * * * being then the owner and operator and having
under its charge and control an oil or gas well * * * the maintaining whereof
in the absence of precaution or care, might endanger human life, and being
under a legal duty to take reasonable precautions against, and use reasonable
care to avoid, such danger, did omit, without lawful excuse, to perform such
duty in that it failed to place adequate fencing around or covering over the
cellar of the said well and did permit the said cellar to become full of water
and gas, with the result that the said opening was dangerous to members of the
public and particularly to children who might come on the said well site and in
consequence whereof one John Douglas Stevenson, a child of tender years, was
drowned as a result of falling into the said cellar.

for which offence it was adjudged that the present appellant
forfeit and pay to His Majesty the King the sum of $1,000.

J.J. Saucier for the appellant.

H. J. Wilson K.C. for the respondent

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Rand J. was delivered by

RAND J.—This is an appeal from a conviction for criminal
negligence under sections 247 and 284 of the Criminal Code. The
negligence was charged as permitting an oil well not then in use to remain
unfenced or otherwise guarded, as a result of which a young child of about four
years of age was drowned.

The well was approximately 250
feet from a highway and some greater distance from a small number of
occupied houses. It had been temporarily discontinued under a conservation
order issued by the provincial government. Centered around it was a pit ten
feet square and eleven feet or so below the ground level, boxed in apparently
to a distance of about two feet above the ground. It was within a larger area
set with concrete pillars at the corners, four or five feet high. Between the
pillars, on the north and south sides, were concrete walls about two feet in height.
Supported on them were two large stringers twenty-four inches square running
north and south about four feet apart and passing over

[Page 194]

the pit approximately one foot from each
side. Lying longitudinally on each was a timber fourteen inches square. Across
these was another lying transversely over the pit about two feet from the
northerly side and extending well towards the sides of the larger square. From
the east there was a sloping mound of earth which approached the northerly
concrete pillar to within a few inches of its side and about one and a half
feet from its top. Two loose planks lay across the easterly pillars, the inner
of which passed close to the end of the transverse timber over the pit. In the
pit was about nine feet of water, the surface of which was then seven feet or
so from the top of the timbers. Access to this top could be gained by going up
the mound from the east, onto the pillar and then by means of the planks to the
timbers. The size of the opening into the pit inside the timbers was
approximately six feet in length by four feet in width.

The young child had made his way to the top in company with three
other children, two boys aged seven and eight years and a young girl of six,
and in walking along was accidentally pushed off by the oldest boy into the
water below. The other boy fell in also but he was able to save himself.

The well had been brought in about twelve years before and had
been closed down for a year and a half. Children had from time to time played
about it and in several instances had been seen by employees of the appellant.
One of these latter had brought what he considered the danger of the well to
the attention of the manager. He was prompted to this by a recent loss of two
grandchildren by drowning; and with the permission of the manager he had
secured the well by means of boards and fencing in a manner which he thought
sufficient for all reasonable purposes. This was in the autumn of 1941. He
considered the top of the structure—the timbers—to be beyond the reach of
children too small to look after themselves. No doubt the well with its pillars
and beams carried some degree of attraction to children from a point where they
had a right to be, but in the local surroundings probably any visible structure
would have done so. A small quantity of gas bubbled out through the water, but
this could be seen only at the well.

[Page 195]

The trial judge dismissed the charge. On appeal the court found
the accused guilty under the sections mentioned by reason of a breach of the
duty prescribed by section 287 (b), and a fine of $1,000 was imposed;

Sections 247 and 284 embody the Common Law rule and, under them,
apart from section 287, the owners of the well could not in the circumstances
have been held criminally responsible for the tragic mishap. The trial judge
found the child to be a trespasser on the land and I do not see how he could
have done otherwise. Trespass does not depend on intention. If I walk upon my
neighbour's land, I am a trespasser even though I believe it to be my own, and
this rule is as applicable to children as to adults. There was no evidence of
license: that goes to the mind of the licensor either actual or as drawn from
his actions. But here there was not only no willingness on the part of the owner
that the children should play on this property but unequivocal demonstration to
the contrary. Although children had, over the twelve years, played occasionally
about the well, their numbers were few, they did not make a practice of it and,
whenever seen by employees of the owners, they had been warned off, in one case
somewhat vigorously. What was done made it perfectly clear that they were not
being tolerated about the well. This was not wholly or even chiefly because of
any special danger from the exposed pit, but rather the danger from gas and
fire and the pressures in the pipes.

With certain exceptions, not present here, an owner of land is
entitled, at common law, to do with it what he pleases: Jordin v. Crump[2];
trespassers move at their own risk and peril; and in the absence of an object
of fascination drawing children to their injury or of active conduct by the
owner in disregard of their known, or necessarily apprehended, presence, that
rule is as applicable to them as to adults. No such allurement was present
here, nor is the case within the second qualification of the rule.

The facts are almost identical with those present in Holland v. Lanarkshire Middle Ward District Committee[3].
There the defendants were the owners of a piece of ground which contained a
disused and unfenced quarry,

[Page 196]

with high and precipitous banks and
containing water, at one point, eleven feet deep. A young child six years of
age had gained access to the quarry through a defective fence from a strip of
waste ground on which children were in the habit of playing. The child was
drowned but the Court of Session held that no duty on the part of the owner had
been shown. In the language of the Lord President (Lord Dunedin):

It is a new and unheard of proposition that, if you have
something on your ground as to which there is no duty of fencing, and someone
else makes use of his ground in some particular way, a duty is thereby imposed
upon you of doing what you were under no duty to do before, a duty, namely, of
fencing. I know of no authority for such a proposition. The quarry here was old
and disused long before this strip of ground had become open to the use of the
children, and that, I think, ends the question.

And in this respect the law of England is the same as that of Scotland (Addie's case[4]).
Cleasby, B., ruled to the same effect in a prosecution for manslaughter of the
owner of an abandoned coal mine down the open shaft of which a trespasser had
accidentally fallen: Reg. v. Gratrex[5].

But the conviction is placed on a violation of the duty imposed
by section 287 (b) of the Code, which is as follows:

287. Every one is guilty of an offence and liable, on
summary conviction, to a fine or imprisonment with or without hard labour, or
both, who

* * * * * *

(b) being the owner, manager or superintendent of any
abandoned or unused mine or quarry or property upon or in which there is any
excavation of a sufficient area and depth to endanger human life, leaves the
same unguarded and uninclosed by a guard or fence of sufficient height and
strength to prevent any person from accidentally riding, driving, walking or
falling therein.

Harvey, C.J., delivering the judgment of
the Court, 'considered this language to be so precise in its delineation of the
duty as to exclude any question of degree of fault or lack of care, and in
effect to require such a fence or guard as must in any event prevent a person
from falling into the well or opening; and in the case of young children, this
would take into account their natural and likely behaviour in such situations
as a circumstance to be anticipated in the measures of security taken.

[Page 197]

But, assuming the excavation here to be within the scope of the
subsection, does that interpretation pay sufficient I regard to the purpose of
the legislation as indicated by the language, ""to prevent any person from accidentally
riding, driving, walking or falling therein""? What is contemplated is
the prevention of injury from hidden openings; the fence or guard must protect
the unwary; but when the existence of the opening is made evident, the purpose
of the fence or guard is accomplished. The owner must protect the trespasser on
the land from a trap, but he is not called on to protect against a subsequent
danger from trespassing on the guard itself raised against that trap. The duty
is not to prevent a person from falling into an opening but from falling in
""accidentally"", that is, accidental as to the existence of the thing
holding the threat. It is to safeguard against a concealed danger; but if the
thing becomes known, it ceases to be the accidental circumstance; and the
accidental may, as here, become a consequential circumstance, as the jostling
of the older boy in the course of walking on the guarding structure.

A young child may not, of course, appreciate the danger; but we
are dealing here with objective causation toward persons without rights: and
if, considering the object of the legislation, the scope of the duty is clear,
it is as limited in relation to a child as to a grown person. A child, as he
plays or trudges over a field, may accidentally fall into an open shaft;
against this the owner must provide a safeguard. It is quite another matter
that the owner, otherwise blameless, should be called upon to afford physical
security against apparent dangers to children who ought not to be on his land
at all. Does such a rule protect the child within the precincts of his own
home? Is such a responsibility placed upon those charged with his care? It
would come as a shock to a parent to find himself guilty of manslaughter
because he had failed to provide barriers to keep his child from climbing into
a well in the farmyard.

The legislation is not specially intended for the protection of
children, and we cannot allow sympathy to stretch its scope. The conditions in
which we live bristle with hazards for the young but, from the standpoint of
safeguarding them, there is no more reason to treat the

[Page 198]

patent danger of such an opening as malum
prohibitum than that of many other accessible structures or conditions
equally dangerous. The balance between the responsibilities of owners of
property and guardians of children is too close in accepted considerations of
policy to justify our going beyond what the legislation has fairly indicated;
and however poignant the death of a child in such circumstances may be, it is
still one of the unhappy risks of living in this imperfect world, and not a
happening to call for the infliction of punishment on others.

Having reached this conclusion on the scope of the duty under
section 287 (b) and that the death of the child could not be
charged to neglect of it, I do not find it necessary to consider the view of
the Appeal Court that there could be no question of degrees of care in the
performance of it. This would be to make it absolute against certain
consequences and to rule out mens rea. It will be sufficient, of course,
to deal with a case within the section when it arises but I desire to guard
myself against being taken to assent to that interpretation of the obligation created.

I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction.

The judgment of Kerwin and Estey JJ. was delivered by

ESTEY J.—The accused company was tried before the Chief
Justice of the Trial Division in Alberta without a jury, at Calgary, on a
charge containing two counts, the first charging an offence contrary to the
provisions of secs. 247 and 284, and the second an offence contrary to sec.
222, of the Criminal Code. At the conclusion of the hearing, the learned
Chief Justice dismissed both charges and delivered the following oral judgment:

There is not any doubt that the condition existing there
with that ten by ten cellar, containing from eight to ten feet of water, and
open at the top, irrespective of the dispute about its approach on the four
sides under the timbers, but open on the top so that the child if he made a
mis-step while walking on these timbers, would fall in the water and probably
drown, or possibly drown, and it is quite clear from the evidence that there
was nothing done to prevent children reaching the top of those timbers or
stringers. That is the situation. It is quite clear that that could have been
remedied by a fence around

[Page 199]

the open cellar or well, or by the
top being planked over. Either of those acts would have made it safe as regards
children. That is the fact that I am bound to find.

I do think that the law is decidedly against the Crown
obtaining a verdict of guilty. No doubt the law is, in my opinion, this child,
however unreasonable you may think it or I may think, it, was a trespasser. He
had no right there. It does not matter whether he could read the sign or not,
according to the best statements of the law in my opinion, and no duty was owed
to that child or to the other children or to anyone else to fence that property
or to plank that cellar, on ground in proper and legal occupation of the
accused. Both charges will be dismissed.

Upon appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of
Alberta, the dismissal of the charge under sec. 247 was set aside and a verdict
of guilty directed.

Section 247 is a restatement of the common law. Union Colliery
Co. v. The Queen[6];
The King v. Baker[7].
The learned trial judge found the child to be a trespasser, and the evidence
supports that finding.

The duty which at common law rested upon a landowner towards
trespassers is stated by Scrutton, L.J., in Hardy v. Central London
Railway Company[8]:

If the children were trespassers, the landowner was not
entitled intentionally to injure them, or to put dangerous traps for them
intending to injure them, but was under no liability if, in trespassing, they
injured themselves on objects legitimately on his land in the course of his
business. Against those he was under no obligation to guard trespassers.

In that case, ""whenever servants of the company saw the
children, they either drove them away or told them to go away,"" and they
apparently went away but repeatedly returned. Upon this evidence the Court of
Appeal refused to find permission express or implied and therefore held the children
to be trespassers rather than licensees, as the learned trial judge had held
them to be.

The authorities are reviewed in Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v.
  Anderson[9],
where Chief Justice Duff at p. 218 states:

The respondent is precluded from recovering by reason of the
fact that, being a trespasser, the only duty owing to him is that explained in Barnett's
case[10],
not intentionally to injure him or ""not to do a wilful act in disregard of
humanity towards him,"" ""not to act with reckless disregard of the
presence of the trespasser.""

[Page 200]

It is sometimes suggested that a landowner is under an obligation
to take special precautions with respect to children, but so long as the
children remain trespassers the law seems to be settled that in principle there
is no difference between a child and an adult.

It is recognized that where, as in cases of licensees and invited
guests, a duty is placed upon a party in possession of land, from similar facts
different inferences may be drawn where children rather than adults are
involved, but the principle of legal responsibility is the same regardless of
age. Robert Addie & Sons (Collieries) Ltd. v. Dumbreck[11],
where at p. 376 Viscount Dunedin states as follows:

The truth is that in cases of trespass there can be no
difference in the case of children and adults; because if there is no duty to
take care that cannot vary according to who is the trespasser. It is quite
otherwise in the case of licensees, because there you are brought into contact
with what is known as trap and allurement.

In this case there is no suggestion of any intention to injure
the children or to place a dangerous trap or any trap for them. From time to
time the children did play about this well, but whenever observed were always
warned and chased away by both the employees of the accused company and by
nearby residents. Mr. F. C Tuckett was in charge of the property in question
for the accused company over a period of years. He deposed that in 1941 two of
his grandchildren were drowned in the Elbow River at Calgary, as a result of
which he discussed the possibility of such a fatality at this well, and was
then instructed by the company to fix it so as to keep small children out. He
obtained material and did what he thought was sufficient, and the well remained
substantially as he left it up to the time of the fatality that led to these
proceedings. The taking of such precautions does not create any obligation
towards trespassers but it does exonerate the accused from any suggestion that
it intended to injure or to trap, and indeed any suggestion that it had acted
with a callous or wanton disregard of consequences.

A tragedy such as this, that takes away a very young child,
arouses our feelings of sympathy. However deep and strong these feelings may
be, they must not influ-

[Page 201]

ence one either in ascertaining the law
or in the application thereof to the facts and circumstances of a given case.
If children in this case had been licensees or invitees, the obligation and
responsibility of the accused company would have been very different.

The respondent contended before the Court of Appeal of Alberta and this Court that the facts disclosed an offence under sec. 287 (b), and
by virtue of the provisions of secs. 951, 1013(5) and 1016(2) a conviction
should now be directed. It is doubtful if the offence under sec. 287 can within
the meaning of these sections be an offence so included under sec. 247, both
because of the essentials required to constitute the offence and because it is
a summary conviction rather than an indictable offence. Apart from these
considerations the evidence does not disclose that an offence was committed
under sec. 287. Under that section the accused can be convicted only when the
excavation is left ""unguarded and uninclosed by a guard or fence of
sufficient height and strength to prevent any person from accidentally riding,
driving, walking or falling therein."" The evidence here discloses that the
excavation in question was so far guarded that instead of accidentally falling
therein, the children in question climbed over some obstruction which they
described as a fence. Counsel contended it was not actually a fence, but,
however styled, it did constitute a barrier. Two of the children were called as
witnesses. Bennett Keith deposed as follows:

Q. Was there a fence all around the well?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you and Doug and Spike and Jane climb over the fence?

A. Yes.

* * *

Q. Just tell me this, how did Douglas get on to the plank?
How did he get over the fence you are talking about?

A. He just climbed over.

Q. Did he climb over it by himself?

A. Yes.

The other boy, Gordon Earl Andrews, deposed:

Q. How did you get up on to this plank? How did you get
there?

A. We climbed up.

Q. Climbed up. What did you climb?

A. A plank.

* * *

[Page 202]

Q. Now there is a fence around the well, is there not?

A. It is around the back part of it.

Q. Did you climb over the fence this day?

A. Yes.

Q. And did Doug, and Jane and Benny?

A. Yes.

Upon this evidence the children
encountered the obstacles erected by the company to prevent people from getting
into the well.

The charge was not laid under sec. 287 (b) and at the
trial this section was not brought to the attention of the learned Chief
Justice. His finding of fact must be read in relation to the issues raised
before him. It is obvious that, had he been asked to find the accused guilty
under sec. 287 (b), he would have dealt with the facts in the
light of the provisions of that section, as well as the requirements of secs.
247 and 284.

The evidence is clear that the concrete posts on which the
stringers rest extend about five feet above the ground. Photographs show that
between the posts boards had been placed to prevent persons getting into the
well. The stringers are on top of these posts. On the east side there are one or
two mounds of earth which one might walk up and reach the top of these posts.
The distance from the mounds to the top of the posts is a point upon which
there is some conflict in the evidence but it is clear there is some distance;
and some effort must be made to pass from the mounds of earth to the top of the
stringers. The evidence also discloses a place or two where children and others
by crawling under the boards might reach the well. In either case a party to
get into the well must put forth an effort towards that end. These facts
negative the commission of an offence under sec. 287, which requires only such
protection as will prevent persons from ""accidentally riding, driving,
walking or falling therein.""

In my opinion, the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be
reversed, the conviction there directed quashed, and the judgment of the trial
judge restored and the charge dismissed as against the accused.

[Page 203]

TASCHEREAU J.—I believe that this appeal should be allowed
and the conviction quashed.

The appellant was acquitted by the trial Judge, but the Court of
Appeal found a breach of the duty imposed by section 287 (b) of the Criminal
Code, and fined the appellant $1,000.

This section is to the effect that whoever is the owner, manager
or superintendent of any abandoned mine or quarry in which there is an
excavation of a sufficient area to endanger human life, must not leave the same
unguarded and uninclosed by a guard or fence of sufficient height and strength
to prevent any person from accidentally riding, driving, walking or falling
therein.

The duty imposed by this section is, therefore, to fence the
excavation in such a manner that a person riding, driving or walking shall not
fall therein accidentally.

We would, I believe, unduly stretch the scope of this section and
go further than the legislator did and, therefore, do violence to the text, if
we held that the fence must be built in such a way that entrance to the
premises is made impossible.

The law contemplates to protect a motorist or a pedestrian from a
danger of which he is unaware, and which may accidentally cause his death. It
does not apply, as in this case, to a trespasser who succeeds in making his way
to the excavation where the danger is obvious, in the manner described by my
brother Rand, and who is accidentally pushed in the water by a companion.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal should be set aside and the
order of acquitment made by the trial Judge should be restored.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Subsection (2) of s. 69 Cr. C.—Prosecution
of a common purpose by several persons—Police officers attempting to effect
arrest of person charged with conspiracy—Firing almost simultaneous by three of
them while in pursuit of the latter—Only one shot causing death—Two officers
charged with manslaughter under subs. (2)—Verdict of guilty affirmed by
majority of appellate court—Whether evidence sufficient to justify such finding—Direction
by trial judge that subs. (2) applied—Misdirection rendering verdict defective
and void—New trial ordered by dissenting judgments—Power of this Court on
appeal—Not limited to opinion expressed by dissent—Acquittal of accused can be
pronounced by this Court—Granting of new trial may place accused a second time
in jeopardy—Jurisdiction—Grounds of dissent—This Court justified to look into
reasons for judgment of dissenting judges of appellate court.

The appellants, members of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, had, on May 7, 1944, together with another constable by the
name of Massicotte and a corporal Dubé who was in charge, gone to the village
of St. Lambert, situated at some thirty miles from the city of Quebec, for the
purpose of apprehending one Georges Guénette wanted on a charge of having
conspired with others to assist one Plante to escape from the custody of a
peace officer, some ten or more attempts having previously been made. These
constables and three others had made on the same day an earlier trip and, after
having searched the premises of Guénette's father unsuccessfully, decided to
return to their headquarters in the city of Quebec. After proceeding some distance, the four abovenamed constables
turned about and went back to St. Lambert on the chance that Guénette might have returned to his father's
house thinking that the coast was clear, Corporal Dubé stationed the appellant
Lizotte and Massicotte outside the house, while he himself entered it followed
by the appellant Savard. While so engaged, Dube's attention was attracted by a
sound upstairs and he went up just in time to see Guénette jump from a window.
Savard immediately ran from the house in pursuit of Guénette, and, seeing he
was losing ground, and as Guénette ignored his calls to stop, he fired four
shots in the air from his revolver. As Guénette still paid no attention, Savard
lowered his revolver toward a point approximately, so he says, six feet to the
left of Guénette so that the latter would not only hear the bullet but see the
spurt of the ground where it hit. As Savard fired this fifth shot, Guénette was
in the act of jumping a fence, at a distance of more than two hundred feet from
the house, and, as he reached the

[Page 21]

other side, he appeared to bend forward with
the left hand resting on the fence and the right hand on the ground. He then
straightened himself and ran for a distance of approximately seventy-eight feet
where he stumbled and fell face down. According to medical evidence, he was
then dead or died very shortly thereafter. The appellant Lizotte and Massicotte
also ran in pursuit of Guénette, Lizotte firing one shot in the air and a
second one toward a point, he says, some thirty feet to Guénette's right and
Massicotte also firing one shot in Guénette's direction. The indictment charged
that the appellants ""have together and illegally inflicted corporal wounds
which caused the death of (Guénette), thus committing manslaughter."" In
view of the uncertainty as to the identity of the person who had fired the
fatal shot (only one bullet hit Guénette), counsel for the Crown at the opening
of the trial declared expressly that the case fell within the provisions of
subsection 2 of s. 69 Cr. C., and they submitted to the jury that the appellants
had formed a common intention to bring about the arrest of Guénette by any
means, that such intention involved an unlawful purpose, namely, the use of
force beyond the limits permitted by section 43 Cr. C., that each of the
appellants was an accomplice in the commission of a crime by one or the other
and that it was immaterial which of them actually fired the fatal shot, as the
death of Guénette was or ought to have been known to each of them to have been
a probable consequence. Counsel for the Crown further submitted that the common
wrongful intention originated from the acts of the appellants and their
companions and the incidents occurring during their trip, which showed a fixed
purpose to use more violence than necessary to take Guénette into custody, or
that the common intent started to be illegal at the moment of the simultaneous
firing by the appellants and Massicotte. The trial judge after having read
subsection 2 of section 69 Cr. C., charged the jury in so many words that it
applied; he also stated that there was no illegality attaching to the
appellants' conduct prior to the moment of the firing, but that the illegality
then started, if the jury was of the opinion that they had then used undue
violence (s. 43 Cr. C). The appellants were found guilty and condemned
respectively to twelve and nine months' imprisonment. The conviction was
affirmed by a majority of the appellate court, the two dissenting judges being
of the opinion that a new trial should be granted.

Held that the
appeal should be allowed, the convictions quashed and the appellants be
discharged. There is no evidence upon which a finding could be made that the
appellants formed at any time a common wrongful intention as required by
subsection 2 of section 69 Cr. C.—Moreover the erroneous directions given by
the trial judge have necessarily influenced the jury's minds and have totally
rendered defective and void the conclusion they have reached.—Their verdict,
being thus illegal, must be quashed.

Counsel for the Crown also contended that, if
the verdict was held to be illegal, the only remedy this Court could grant
would be an order for a new trial, as the Court could not go beyond what was
directed by the dissenting judgments: the appellants could then be proceeded
against individually under subsection (1) of section 69 Cr. C. or additional
evidence might be forthcoming which would make subsection (2) applicable.

[Page 22]

Held that, in
a case like the present, such an order ought not to be made, so as to permit an
entirely new case to be made against the appellants. While the existence of a
dissent on a question of law (s. 1023 Cr. C.) is a condition precedent for an
appeal to this Court, the Court once seized of the appeal is not limited to the
remedy considered appropriate in the dissent, but has complete jurisdiction to
direct the remedy which in its opinion the Court appealed from ought to have
granted (s. 1024 Cr. C). Under the circumstances of the case and in view of the
manner the case was deliberately proceeded with by the Crown, the granting of a
new trial would violate the fundamental right of an accused not to be placed
for a second time in jeopardy. Manchuk v. the King ([1938] S.C.R.
341 and Wexler v. The King [1939] S.C.R. 350) foll.

Per The Chief
Justice and Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. The Supreme Court of Canada, when given
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal on any question of law on which there has
been dissent in the court of appeal (section 1023 Cr. C.), is justified,
whether grounds of dissent are specified or not in the formal judgment of that
court, to look into the reasons for judgment of the dissenting judges in order
to find the grounds of dissent.—Reinblatt v. The King ((1933)
S.C.R. 694) foll.

APPEAL by the appellants from a judgment by a
majority of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province
 of Quebec, affirming a verdict
of guilty rendered by a jury in a trial of manslaughter, the dissenting
judgments ordering a new trial.

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are stated in the above headnote and in the judgments now
reported.

Lucien H. Gendron K.C., Gérald Fauteux
K.C. and Mark Drouin K.C. for the appellants.

Antoine Rivard K.C. and Noël Dorion K.C. for
the respondent.

The judgment of The Chief Justice and of Kerwin
and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by

Taschereau J.:—Les appelants Fernand
Savard et Roger Lizotte, tous deux de la Gendarmerie Royale canadienne, ont été traduits devant la Cour d'Assises à Québec,
pour répondre à l'accusation d'avoir:—

ensemble illégalement causé des lésions corporelles
qui ont entraîné la mort de Georges Guénette commettant par là un crime
d'homicide involontaire (manslaughter).

[Page 23]

Trouvés coupables, ils furent condamnés
respectivement à douze et à neuf mois de prison, et ce verdict du jury fut
confirmé par la Cour du Banc du Roi. MM. les juges Francœur et E. Stuart McDougall, qui étaient dissidents,
auraient accordé un nouveau procès.

Dans le jugement formel de la Cour du Banc du Roi,
la dissidence de M. le juge Francœur est exprimée dans les termes suivants:—

(a) Admission au cours du procès de
preuve illégale;

(b) Direction
erronée en droit sur l'interprétation de l'article 69 du Code Criminel.

Et celle de M. le juge McDougall se lit ainsi:—

that,

(a) the accused were deprived of
their right to challenge peremptorily the number of jurors allowed by law;

(b) that the presiding judge
committed an error in law in instructing the jury that subsection 2 of section
69 of the Criminal Code applied;

(c) that the presiding judge further
erred in law in instructing the jury that evidence declared by him to be
irrelevant as to the guilt of the accused would be helpful and could be
accepted by the jury to indicate an atmosphere or ""climat spécial"" surrounding
the actions of the accused.

Ces deux mêmes juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi,
dans leurs raisons où cette Cour peut également chercher des motifs de
dissidence, en sont également venus à la conclusion qu'il n'y a aucune preuve
qui puisse justifier l'application de l'article 69, paragraphe 2, Code
Criminel.

Georges Guénette, Roland Fontaine et Edouard
Bernard étaient tous trois accusés d'avoir conspiré ensemble afin de faire
évader un nommé Hervé Plante, détenu par Gordon P. Coutu, qui avait
antérieurement procédé à son arrestation. Le mandat avait été émis par M. le juge
Laetare Roy, de la Cour des Sessions de la Paix à Québec, le 3 mars 1943, mais le 6 mai 1944, il n'avait pas encore été exécuté. Durant
au delà de 14 mois, les prévenus
avaient réussi à dépister les policiers, qui avaient fait plus de dix voyages à
St-Lambert, dans le comté de Lévis, mais chaque fois, leurs recherches étaient
demeurées infructueuses.

Dans l'après-midi du 6 mai 1944, le caporal
Turgeon, en charge du détachement de la Gendarmerie Royale à Québec, décida de
faire une nouvelle tentative afin d'opérer ces arrestations. Il donna
instruction au constable Dubé, accompagné
de six constables, dont les appelants, de se

[Page 24]

rendre à St-Lambert, et c'est au cours de leurs
recherches que Georges Guénette fut tué d'une balle de revolver. Et comme
conséquence de cette tragédie, Savard et Lizotte furent accusés d'homicide
involontaire coupable.

Durant cette nuit du 6 au 7 mai, les constables firent deux autres voyages à
St-Lambert. Quelques incidents, qui se produisirent au cours du premier,
doivent nécessairement être mentionnés, car il en sera question plus loin,
lorsque nous examinerons certains aspects légaux de la cause, que les parties
ont discutés au cours de l'audition.

En arrivant à St-Lambert, Dubé aperçut une
automobile qui filait vers l'autre extrémité du village, dans la direction de
St-Isidore. Croyant que cette voiture pouvait être occupée par les trois
personnes recherchées, il la suivit, mais après s'être rendu compte que les
passagers n'étaient pas ceux qu'il désirait appréhender, il leur permit de
continuer leur route. Mais la preuve révèle qu'avant de leur donner cette
autorisation, l'un des constables non
identifié dans l'automobile de Dubé aurait dit aux passagers, parmi lesquels se
trouvait un nommé Baillargeon:—""Si
vous n'aviez pas arrêté, nous aurions tiré.""

Lorsque Dubé revint avec ses deux compagnons au
village de St-Lambert, il donna instruction à trois constables,
Lizotte, Desjardins et Emond de se rendre chez Fontaine et Edouard Bernard, tous deux
également recherchés, pendant que lui-même avec d'autres iraient chez Guénette.
Chez Fontaine, l'un des constables serait entré dans la chambre de mademoiselle Jeannette Fontaine, et lui
aurait dit:—""Je regrette de
vous déranger"". Elle aurait répondu, d'après son témoignage:—""Vous vous
fatiguez encore pour rien ce matin"". Et ce même constable
aurait répondu à son tour:—""Vous croyez que nous nous fatiguons pour rien, peut-être que
d'autres seront fatigués avant longtemps"".

Durant ce temps, les autres constables qui n'étaient pas allés chez
Fontaine firent des recherches dans la maison de Guénette et dans les environs.
Dubé rapporte qu'après qu'il eût fouillé en vain la maison, le père Guénette
lui dit qu'il n'avait pas vu son fils depuis quinze jours, qu'il venait
rarement à la maison, qu'il avait perdu toute influence sur lui et qu'il était
bien décidé à ne pas être pris vivant.

[Page 25]

Dubé décida alors de retourner à Québec, mais à la
sortie de la maison de Guénette, il rencontra le constable
Massicotte qui, au second étage de la grange de Guénette,
avait trouvé une couverture et un oreiller. Il s'était rendu compte que ce lit
improvisé avait été récemment occupé, car l'oreiller était encore chaud. On fit
alors d'autres recherches dans la direction de la rivière Chaudière, mais sans
résultat.

Au cours du voyage de retour vers Québec, Dubé
s'avisa de revenir à la maison de Guénette accompagné de trois constables, Massicotte, Savard et Lizotte,
tandis que les autres devaient continuer leur route vers la ville. En arrivant
à St-Lambert, il plaça ses hommes à des points stratégiques autour de la maison
de Guénette, y pénétra lui-même et demanda au père Guénette si son fils était
revenu. C'est à ce moment qu'il entendit un bruit provenant de l'étage
supérieur, où il monta, et vit Georges Guénette, l'homme qu'il recherchait,
sautant par une fenêtre du côté ouest de la maison. Massicotte, Savard et
Lizotte partirent alors à sa poursuite vers la rivière, où les constables, lors de leur visite précédente,
avaient remarqué des embarcations.

Guénette, qui avait une avance d'environ cinquante
pieds et qui gagnait toujours du terrain, refusa de s'arrêter, malgré les
ordres qu'on lui intimait, continua sa course à travers le champ fraîchement
labouré et sauta la clôture en y posant la main gauche, de sorte qu'il avait
les pieds dans une position horizontale à la droite de son corps. Savard était
au centre derrière lui; il avait Lizotte à sa droite, placé dans le chemin
Brochu, et Massicotte à sa gauche. C'est pendant cette course que les trois constables firent feu. Savard tira cinq coups
de son revolver 45, Massicotte un
seul d'un revolver de même calibre et Lizotte deux coups, d'un revolver 38. Tous d'après leurs témoignages tirèrent en
l'air, sauf Savard et Lizotte qui tirèrent chacun un coup, vers le sol, mais à
côté de Guénette, afin de l'impressionner
davantage et le convaincre qu'il était préférable de se rendre.

Après avoir sauté cette clôture, située à 225 pieds de sa résidence, Guénette parcourut
encore 78 pieds et là, après avoir fait une hésitation, il tomba la
face contre terre. La

[Page 26]

preuve médicale révèle qu'il dût mourir à ce moment
ou quelques instants plus tard. La balle, qui avait pénétré au dessus du rein
gauche, était sortie dans la région du poumon droit. Le docteur Gilbert, de
Charny, le premier qui constata la mort, exprima l'opinion que la balle devait
provenir d'un revolver calibre 38, car cette dernière pouvait être introduite plus facilement dans
l'orifice de la blessure. Cependant, cette prétention n'est pas admise par l'un
des médecins de la Couronne.

Ce résumé de la preuve, peut-être trop long, est
cependant nécessaire pour bien situer le litige et pour déterminer les
questions légales qui nous sont actuellement soumises et que l'on trouve dans
le jugement formel de la Cour du Banc du Roi et les raisons écrites des juges
dissidents.

La Couronne a fait reposer sa cause devant le jury
sur le paragraphe 2 de l'article 69 du Code Criminel. C'est aussi la directive
donnée par le juge présidant le procès. Cet article se lit ainsi:—

69. (2) Quand
plusieurs personnes forment ensemble le projet de faire quelque chose
d'illégal, et de s'entraider dans ce projet, chacune d'elles est complice de
toute infraction commise par l'une d'entre elles dans la poursuite de leur but
commun, si elles savaient ou devaient savoir que la commission de cette
infraction devait être la conséquence probable de la poursuite de leur but
commun.

Une seule balle a frappé Guénette, et, comme il
était assez problématique de dire qui avait tiré cette balle, on a voulu, par
le jeu de l'article 69, paragraphe
2, faire disparaître cette
difficulté de l'esprit du jury, en leur disant que les accusés faisaient partie
d'un complot illégal, que chacun d'eux était complice d'une infraction commise
par l'un ou l'autre des constables et qu'il était en conséquence immatériel de déterminer qui avait tiré
le coup fatal.

Au cours du procès qui eut lieu à Québec, le
procureur de la Couronne, expliquant la cause au jury, fit un résumé de la
preuve qu'il désirait lui soumettre, et lui dit:—

Vous aurez à juger, messieurs les jurés, si
les deux agents n'étaient pas alors engagés dans la poursuite de buts
illégaux: l'arrestation de Guénette sans mandat entre leurs mains et le
recours à des moyens aussi radicaux pour l'exécution de leur mission. Dans
l'affirmative, la Couronne vous soumettra qu'en droit les deux accusés
doivent répondre de la mort de Guénette.

[Page 27]

Plus tard, lorsque la preuve de la Couronne fut
terminée, la défense présenta une motion de non-lieu de la part de l'accusé
Lizotte, et dans la réplique de l'avocat de la Couronne, on y trouve ce qui
suit:—

Les jurés décideront si, à un moment donné,
cette expédition, qui a pu paraître commencée avec des buts légaux, est devenue
une expédition illégale.

A la conclusion du procès, lors de sa plaidoirie au
jury, l'un des avocats de la Couronne s'exprima ainsi:—

C'est que cette loi a été faite précisément
pour prévoir de ces cas comme celui qui nous occupe actuellement, lorsqu'une,
deux, trois ou quatre personnes, ensemble, dans un même but, commettent des
actes illégaux; ils sont tous ensemble responsables des conséquences, et
c'est pour cela qu'il importe peu de savoir si c'est la balle de Lizotte ou
de Savard qui a tué.

Ce qu'il importe de savoir, c'est si ces
deux-là, ou ces trois-là ou quatre-l'à, ensemble, ne s'étaient pas réunis pour
faire de la poursuite de Guénette une opération qui est devenue illégale du
moment où ils ont commencé à tirer. Guénette ne serait pas mort aujourd'hui.

Ce n'est pas ensemble qu'ils ont tiré. C'est
parce qu'ensemble ils ont pris des moyens illégaux pour arriver à leur fin avec
illégalité, que l'article 69, paragraphe 2, trouve son application.

Et plus tard, un second avocat de la Couronne dit à
son tour:—

L'invention de Lizotte pour essayer de
chercher ailleurs le coupable est une invention qui ne tient pas debout;
d'autant plus que, même si c'était vrai, ces deux personnes étaient engagées
dans la poursuite de moyens communs qui étaient des moyens illégaux, et au même
titre que celui qui aurait vraisemblablement tiré, ils sont coupables de manslaughter, ils sont coupables de la mort
qu'on leur impute de Guénette.

Et, dans son adresse au jury, le juge donne la
direction légale suivante:—

L'article 69,
paragraphe 2, s'applique. Je l'affirme et j'y reviendrai
plus tard.

Ailleurs, il dit:—

Devez-vous trouver une différence de
responsabilité entre l'accusé Savard et entre l'accusé Lizotte, si vous en
venez à un verdict de culpabilité?

Et après avoir cité l'article 69, paragraphe 2, du Code Criminel, l'honorable juge continue:—

Me Gendron soutient que cet article ne
s'applique pas. Malheureusement, je ne puis partager son opinion. Le
paragraphe 2 s'applique.
L'illégalité commença au moment où ils, les accusés,
et le constable Massicotte, se
mirent ensemble à tirer dans la poursuite de leur but commun, contrairement à
la loi, si vous jugez qu'ils abusèrent de la violence.

L'entente est devenue illégale au cours de
l'exécution, tousjours si les accusés excédèrent,
d'après vous les moyens raisonnables et causèrent la mort—article 43 C. Cr.

[Page 28]

D'après ces textes que je viens de citer, les constables poursuivaient donc des buts
illégaux, leur expédition qui à l'origine a pu paraître légale serait devenue
une expédition illégale, au moment où les deux appelants et Massicotte ont
commencé à tirer. Comme conséquence, en vertu des dispositions de l'article
69, paragraphe 2, tous ceux qui ont fait feu sont coupables au
même degré, quel que soit celui qui ait tué Guénette. C'est bien là la théorie
de la Couronne, admise par le juge au cours du procès.

Pour que l'article 69, paragraphe 2, s'applique,
il faut de toute nécessité qu'il y ait entente de poursuivre un but illégal.
C'est l'élément essentiel qui entraînera la culpabilité de tous, si l'un d'eux
commet une infraction dans la poursuite de ce but.

Or, il importe donc de se demander quel projet
illégal avaient conçu les accusés, quel acte défendu par la loi ils avaient
projeté de poser; où, quand et
comment ils se sont concertés pour qu'ils tombent sous le coup de l'article que
je viens de citer.

Lors de l'audition de la cause devant cette Cour,
le procureur de la Couronne a tenté d'établir que le projet de commettre un
acte illégal n'était pas nécessairement né sur le terrain de Guénette au moment
où les constables ont commencé à
faire feu, mais que les actes des appelants et de leurs compagnons, au cours du
trajet de Québec à St-Lambert, démontraient l'intention bien arrêtée d'user de
plus de violence qu'il n'était nécessaire pour procéder à l'arrestation de
Guénette. Il y aurait donc eu complot de commettre un acte illégal, et
l'illégalité de cet acte consisterait dans la violation de l'article 43 du Code Criminel, qui se lit ainsi:—

43. Tout individu, qui
opère légalement l'arrestation d'un autre pour quelque cause autre qu'une
infraction mentionnée en l'article qui précède, est justifiable, si celui qu'il
cherche à arrêter tente de se soustraire par la fuite à cette arrestation,
d'employer la force nécessaire pour empêcher son évasion, sauf si cette évasion
peut être empêchée par des moyens raisonnables sans recourir à la violence;
mais cette force ne doit être destinée ni de nature à causer la mort ou des
lésions corporelles graves.

Cette prétention doit être rejetée pour deux
raisons. La première, c'est qu'elle n'a jamais été soumise au jury, qui n'a pas
eu à se prononcer sur ce point, et qui en a été empêché par les directives
mêmes du juge, qui lui a dit que l'illégalité avait commencé au moment même où
les

[Page 29]

coups de feu ont été tirés.
La seconde raison qui motive le rejet de cette prétention, c'est qu'il n'y a
aucune preuve au dossier qui puisse justifier un jury, instruit de ses devoirs,
d'en arriver légalement à une semblable conclusion. Pour essayer d'établir
l'intention commune des constables de faire usage d'une force plus que
nécessaire, on a invoqué l'incident qui est arrivé lorsqu'un constable aurait dit aux passagers de
l'automobile Baillargeon: ""Si
vous n'aviez pas arrêté, nous aurions tiré"". Et on a relevé aussi la
conversation entre le constable non
identifié qui aurait dit à mademoiselle Fontaine:

Vous croyez que nous nous fatiguons pour rien,
peut-être que d'autres seront fatigués avant longtemps.

Ces faits ne sont pas pertinents à la cause, et
leur récit devant le jury était inadmissible. Ces paroles ont été prononcées
hors la présence des accusés et ne peuvent en aucune façon servir de preuve
contre eux.

Je n'ignore pas que lorsqu'il s'agit de
conspiration, des déclarations faites par l'un des conspirateurs, hors la
présence des autres, peuvent en certains cas, servir de preuve contre tous les
conspirateurs; mais encore faut-il qu'il existe quelque connexité entre ces
déclarations et la poursuite du but commun qui, dans le cas actuel, aurait
conduit à la mort de Guénette. De plus, cette règle que je viens de citer, et
qui dans notre droit constitue une exception, est basée sur la théorie qui veut
que dans le cas de conspiration, vu qu'il y a unité de volonté, la déclaration
de l'un est censée être la déclaration de tous. Pour que la léclaration de l'un
puisse ainsi servir contre les autres, il faut donc prouver par des preuves
additionnelles que celui contre qui on veut s'en servir était partie au
complot. Cette autre preuve dans le cas présent fait totalement défaut.

Ces deux faits sont les seuls que la Couronne a
invoqués pour démontrer l'existence d'un complot antérieur. Il me semble
qu'elle a faillir/?/ dans sa tentative de convaincre la Cour de l'existence de
cette entente préalable de commettre un acte illégal.

D'ailleurs, dans sa charge au jury, le juge a dit
que le témoignage de Baillargeon ne pouvait pas incriminer les deux accusés, et
il a aussi ajouté que le témoignage de mademoiselle Fontaine ne pouvait pas non
plus avoir

[Page 30]

d'influence sur la cause. Il a cependant autorisé
le jury à prendre connaissance de la déclaration faite à Baillargeon, non pas
parce qu'elle peut relier les accusés à la tragédie qui est arrivée, mais
seulement afin de ""se mettre dans une atmosphère ou un climat
spécial"". Si je m'accorde avec le juge quand il dit que la preuve de ces
deux incidents ne peut incriminer les deux accusés, je diffère entièrement
d'opinion avec lui quant à sa seconde remarque. La preuve est pertinente ou
non. Comme elle ne l'est pas, elle n'aurait pas dû être soumise au jury, et
encore moins pour le justifier au cours d'un procès criminel de se placer dans
un ""climat special"", ce
qui à mon sens constitue une nouvelle et bien étonnante théorie.

La Couronne elle-même ne semble pas convaincue de
l'existence de ce plan préconçu par les constables pour faire usage d'une violence déraisonnable, car elle dit dans son factum:—

The expedition was without any doubt legal
in its purpose, etc.

Et le juge dit au jury:—

L'entente est devenue illégale au cours de
l'exécution.

Evidemment, le but de cette expédition était légal.
On se rendait à St-Lambert pour exécuter le mandat émis contre Guénette et les
autres par M. le juge Lætare Roy. Rien
dans la preuve ne peut laisser supposer que les constables
aient eu des intentions criminelles, qu'ils aient voulu
faire autre chose que de mettre à exécution, par des moyens légaux, l'ordre
légal du magistrat.

Il reste, comme le juge l'a dit au jury, et comme
d'ailleurs la Couronne elle-même l'a prétendu au cours du procès, que l'entente
serait devenue illégale au cours de l'expédition. Le complot illégal existerait
donc, et son fait constitutif serait que les accusés et leurs compagnons
auraient fait feu presque simultanément, pour forcer Guénette à arrêter sa
course.

Mais la simultanéité de ces coups de feu est-elle
bien la preuve d'une résolution concertée et arrêtée, agréée par tous, de poser
un acte illégal?

Je sais bien, et la jurisprudence et les auteurs
l'enseignent, que le complot n'a pas besoin toujours de longue préparation, et
même qu'en certains cas, il peut être établi par la preuve de certains faits,
qui démontrent chez plusieurs

[Page 31]

l'existence d'une volonté commune d'agir
illégalement. Mais la seule résolution concertée, qu'elle soit préalable ou
sur-le-champ, n'est pas suffisante; pour qu'il y ait crime, il faut le dessein,
l'intention de commettre un acte illégal, qui est une circonstance nécessaire à
la criminalité. Sans doute, les
trois constables qui poursuivaient
Guénette se sont entendus, tacitement on autrement, pour tirer des coups de feu
dans l'air ou sur le sol, afin d'inspirer au fugitif une crainte salutaire, qui
peut-être le pousserait à se livrer aux officiers de justice, et cette entente
demeure jusqu'ici dans les cadres de la stricte légalité. Rien en effet ne défend
à des constables, autorisés à
porter des armes, de s'en servir pour les fins que je viens de mentionner.

Dans le cas présent, six coups ont été tirés en
l'air, et deux dans la direction du sol. Qu'au cours de la poursuite d'un but
légal, qui était l'arrestation de Guénette, une balle égarée ou non, provenant
de l'arme de l'un des poursuivants, frappe la victime, n'indique pas qu'il y
ait unité de but entre tous les policiers pour commettre un acte illégal, et
qu'il s'ensuive que, par l'opération de l'article 69, paragraphe 2, tous soient
tenus responsables de l'imprudence criminelle de l'un, si imprudence criminelle
il y a véritablement. Cet acte isolé ne peut certes pas démontrer un concert de
volontés confondues en une volonté unique et commune, de commettre un acte
illégal et qui marquerait les actes de tous du sceau de la criminalité. Tout au
plus indique-t-il l'agissement d'une seule personne qui, sans doute, peut être
le résultat d'une négligence ou d'une imprudence criminelle, si on y rencontre les
éléments voulus, ou encore le simple résultat d'un accident qui n'entraînerait
aucune responsabilité.

On sait que le complot criminel est un crime par
lui-même, qu'il est complet, et par conséquent punissable, sans qu'il soit
nécessaire de prouver un commencement d'exécution. Le législateur a considéré
la résolution arrêtée de plusieurs personnes de commettre un crime, sans même
que le crime ne soit commis, comme une menace envers la société, qui justifie
cette dernière représentée par l'Etat de se placer en légitime défense et
d'exercer une action répressive. Si Guénette n'eut pas été frappé, il est
certain

[Page 32]

que personne n'eût songé alors à voir dans les
actes des constables qui tiraient
en l'air, pour procéder à cette arrestation, les éléments du complot. Et
cependant, d'après la théorie de la Couronne, ces constables
eussent été des criminels qui, sans réaliser la fin
poursuivie, étaient tout de même tous des conspirateurs qui avaient dans
l'esprit des intentions perverses.

Or, c'est parce qu'on a dit au jury qu'il y avait
complot et que l'article 69 (2) s'appliquait;
c'est parce qu'on lui a enseigné que l'acte isolé de l'un entraînait la
responsabilité de l'autre; et c'est parce qu'instruit qu'il n'avait pas à se
demander qui avait tiré la balle qui a causé la mort de Guénette, que le jury a
rendu un verdict que la loi du pays n'autorise pas. C'est cette directive
erronée, qui a nécessairement influencé le jury et qui viole totalement la
conclusion à laquelle il est arrivé. Je suis clairement d'opinion, comme
d'ailleurs MM. les juges Francœur et McDougall le disent dans leurs notes
dissidentes, qu'il n'y a aucune preuve qui puisse justifier l'existence d'un
semblable complot criminel, et par conséquent, l'application de l'article 69 (2). Entaché d'illégalité, ce verdict doit
être cassé.

Mais la Couronne soutient que, même si le verdict
est illégal, cette Cour ne peut pas accorder plus que les juges dissidents de
la Cour du Banc du Roi n'ont accordé, soit un nouveau procès. Je ne puis
admettre cette prétention, que je crois erronée en droit. La juridiction de
cette Cour est limitée évidemment aux questions de droit sur lesquelles il y a
eu dissidence en Cour du Banc du Roi. L'une de ces dissidences était qu'on
avait donné à l'article 69 (2) du
Code Criminel une interprétation erronée, et avec cette dissidence, je suis
d'accord.

Mais il est du devoir de cette Cour, lorsqu'elle
croit une dissidence bien fondée, de procéder à rendre le jugement qui aurait
dû être prononcé, et, pour atteindre ce but, elle tient ses pouvoirs de
l'article 1024 du Code Criminel,
qui dit:—

1024, La Cour Suprême
du Canada établit à cet égard la règle ou rend l'ordonnance qui lui semble
juste, soit aux fins de confirmer le jugement de culpabilité ou d'accorder un
nouveau procès, soit autrement, soit aux fins d'accueillir ou de refuser cette
demande, et établit toutes autres règles et décerne toutes autres ordonnances
nécessaires pour mettre cette règle ou ordonnance à effet.

[Page 33]

La question de droit qui donne juridiction à cette
Cour, qui en réalité la saisit du litige, est formulée par la Cour du Banc du
Roi, mais le remède qui doit être apporté, quand elle est jugée fondée, est du
ressort de cette Cour, qui peut et doit alors rendre l'ordonnance que requiert
la justice. (Manchuk v. The King[1]).

Mais si cette Cour a ce pouvoir d'accorder un
remède différent de celui que les juges dissidents de la Cour du Banc du Roi
ont cru juste d'appliquer, doit-elle exercer ce droit, ou ordonner qu'il y ait
un nouveau procès? Je pense bien qu'il y aurait lieu à un nouveau procès, si la
Couronne, ayant soumis la cause qu'elle a présentée au jury, avait demandé
subsidiairement de déterminer la culpabilité de l'un des accusés, au cas où
l'article 69 (2) ne s'appliquerait
pas, et si le juge, refusant de donner cette dernière instruction, avait avisé
le jury que seul 69 (2) trouvait
son application. Alors, évidemment, dans le cas d'un acquittement, la Couronne,
n'ayant pas obtenu la justice qu'elle demandait, aurait pu invoquer ce grief et
obtenir un nouveau procès.

Mais, dans le cas qui nous occupe, c'est l'inverse
qui se présente. La Couronne a soumis que l'article 69
(2) s'appliquait. C'est le fondement même de sa
prétention; toute sa cause repose sur
cette théorie, et c'est ainsi qu'elle a voulu que les accusés fussent jugés.
Alors qu'elle est intimée devant cette Cour et qu'il est établi que sa première
tentative d'obtenir une condamnation doit nécessairement faillir, elle demande
la permission de recommencer le procès, en soumettant les mêmes faits ou des
faits additionnels. Ceci ne peut pas être accordé.

Les appelants ont été en péril déjà, au cours de ce
premier procès. Ils ont été jugés devant une cour compétente par douze de leurs
pairs; ils ont répondu à une accusation légalement portée, à laquelle ils ont
plaidé, et le procès s'est instruit suivant les soumissions légales de la
Couronne que le tribunal a acceptées.

Il est un principe de droit criminel, qui date de
temps immémoriaux, qu'un accusé ne peut pas être ""in
jeopardy"" deux fois. Cette doctrine est aujourd'hui
universellement reconnue et sanctionnée par les tribunaux. Même si
personnellement j'entretenais des doutes sur cette question, je serais lié par
une décision de cette Cour, rendue il y a

[Page 34]

quelques années. En effet, dans la cause de Wexler
v. The King[2] où la Cour du Banc du Roi de la province de Québec avait ordonné un
nouveau procès, cette Cour a prononcé l'acquittement, et le principe posé dans
cette cause-là doit nous guider dans la détermination de celle-ci. Comme le
disait alors Sir Lyman Duff, juge
en chef:—

To set aside a verdict of acquittal in such
circumstances, merely because the case for the Crown might, on a possible view
of the evidence, have been put upon another footing would, it appears to me,
introduce a most dangerous practice; a practice not, I think, sanctioned by the
statute.

Et M. le juge Kerwin s'exprimait ainsi:—

The real point for determination is
whether, after an accused person has been tried on a charge of murder and
acquitted, the Crown is entitled to an order for a new trial in order to
present an entirely new case against him.

An appeal is given the Crown by the 1930
amendment to section 1013 of the Code ""on any ground of appeal which
involves a question of law alone."" Assuming, without deciding, that the
pertinent question here is one of law, the Crown's contention is not entitled
to prevail.

Je crois donc, pour les raisons ci-dessus, que
l'appel doit être maintenu et que les accusés doivent être libérés. Etant donné
cette conclusion à laquelle j'arrive, il est inutile de discuter les autres
moyens d'appel qui ont été soulevés.

Rand J.—The case against the accused, advisedly and exclusively presented
by the Crown to the jury, was this: the use of arms by way of shooting in the
air or the ground was in the circumstances an unnecessary use of force and
hence illegal; from its commencement, it constituted an unlawful common purpose
affecting all those taking part in it; and each officer became, under ss. 2 of
sec. 69 of the Criminal Code, responsible for the consequences of that use of
arms by the others. This dispensed with the consideration by the jury of the
question whose shot brought the deceased down.

The following excerpts from the address of Crown
counsel summarize the position taken:

Admettons, pour le bénéfice de la discussion
et sans rien retirer de ce que j'ai dit jusqu'à présent, que, jusqu'à la fuite
de Guénette, tout est parfait, tout est légal. Guénette saute, ils partent à
courir après, c'est ce qu'ils doivent faire; ils sont mal organisés; parce
qu'ils sont mal organisés, ils vont être obligés de sauter des barrières, ça ne
fait rien, c'est leur faute, ils sont mal organisés; à un moment donné, ils se
mettent à tirer.

[Page 35]

De ce moment, Votre Seigneurie, tous ensemble
et d'un commun accord, Lizotte et Savard ont ensemble décidé, dans la poursuite
du but commun, d'employer des moyens illégaux. De ce moment-là il y a entre eux
une entente qui est devenue une entente illégale.

* * *

C'est que cette loi a été faite précisément pour
prévoir de ces cas comme celui qui nous occupe actuellement, lorsqu'une, deux,
trois ou quatre personnes, ensemble, commettent ensemble, dans un même but, des
actes illégaux; ils sont tous ensemble responsables des conséquences, et c'est
pour ça qu'il importe peu de savoir si c'est la balle de Lizotte ou de Savard
qui a tué.

The trial judge adopting the same view
instructed the jury that ss. 2 applied and that the only question was accident
or not, in the following language:

L'article 69, paragraphe 2, s'applique.
Je l'affirme et j'y reviendrai plus tard.

* * *

Comme il ne s'agissait que d'une question de
droit qui n'intéressait pas le jury, parce que je déciderais le contraire de la
prétention de Me Gendron, que je voulais simplement discuter ses arguments, une
traduction eut été inutile et n'eut servi qu'à créer de la confusion.

Je n'ai pas traduit plus loin pour le jury que
les citations qui appuyaient mon opinion. Il est clair que la Couronne doit
faire sa preuve. C'est une question de faits pour le jury de dire si elle l'a
fait ou non. S'il s'agissait d'un accident ou non.

* * *

Devez-vous trouver une différence de
responsabilité entre l'accusé Savard et l'accusé Lizotte, si vous en venez au
verdict de culpabilité?

* * *

Me Gendron soutient que cet article ne
s'applique pas. Malheureusement, je ne puis partager son opinion. Le paragraphe
2 s'applique. L'illégalité
commence au moment où ils, les accusés et le constable Massicotte, se mirent ensemble à tirer dans la poursuite de leur but
commun, contrairement à la loi, si vous jugez qu'ils abusèrent de la violence.

It is desirable for the moment to consider the
circumstances in relation to sec. 69, which is enacted in these words:

69. Accessories, principals, etc.—Every one
is a party to and guilty of an offence who

(a) actually commits it;

(b) does or omits an act for the
purpose of aiding any person to commit the offence;

(c) abets any person in commission
of the offence; or

(d) counsels or procures any person
to commit the offence.

[Page 36]

2. Common intention by several persons.—If
several persons form a common intention to prosecute any unlawful purpose, and
to assist each other «therein, each of them is a party to every offence
committed by any one of them in the prosecution of such common purpose, the
commission of which offence was, or ought to have been known to be a probable
consequence of the prosecution of such common purpose.

Two conditions are seen to be essential to bring
the common purpose charged within ss. 2: that it was unlawful and that the
shooting of the deceased ought to have been known to be a probable consequence
of it. It was of course open to the Crown, under the first subsection, to seek
at the same time to hold individually responsible the officer whose shot
actually struck the deceased; but that course, as I have intimated, was
deliberately put aside. One reason for this was virtually conceded: the
conviction of both accused was sought, but as only one bullet struck the
deceased, resort to ss. 2 was necessary. There was also serious doubt of which
one of the eight shots fired from three guns, all of the others admittedly into
the air or the ground, was fatal; but consistently with the case submitted the
trial judge, over the objections of the accused, gave the instruction quoted. It
was not suggested that the accused intended to hit the victim, and accident
might have arisen from a ricochet or from the officer stumbling on uneven
ground at the moment of firing.

I am unable to agree that in the circumstances
the use made of arms for such a purpose could be found or held to be unlawful.
Failing illegality, it becomes unnecessary to consider whether the accused
could be found liable for the death as a probable consequence. The direction
that ss. 2 applied was therefore an error that vitiates the conviction and it
must be set aside.

On the argument, the actual theory laid before
the jury was confused with a purpose, formed when the detachment set out from
Quebec, to bring back the deceased if necessary by the use of any force short
of taking life, even though in excess of that permitted by section 43, and that
this involved the accused in the shot that caused the death. The short answer
to this is that there was not a tittle of evidence by which it could have been
supported. Even less was there any evidence to justify the view that such a
purpose arose at the moment of the firing.

[Page 37]

The question now is whether the Crown should be
permitted to submit to another jury the alternative view, the individual
responsibility of each of the accused, which in the first instance it
deliberately refrained from presenting. In that situation we are governed by a
judgment of this Court, (Wexler v. The King[3]) in which it was laid down that such a
proceeding would violate the fundamental right of an accused not to be placed
for a second time in jeopardy.

It was urged that it would be contrary to the
public interest that such a serious consequence through force, excessive in
fact, in making an arrest, should escape punishment. I do not consider whether
or not there was evidence on which the jury could have found whose act struck
the deceased down. The guilt or innocence of either accused is not relevant to
the question with which I am now dealing. What the Wexler case (1)
declares is the principle that in such circumstances the interest of the
accused becomes the paramount public interest; that, however serious the
occurrence may have been, and disregarding all question of guilt or innocence,
the Crown having failed on an hypothesis which was fairly and unexceptionably
to itself tried out, is not on the same set of facts and on a view open to it
but rejected on the first trial to be permitted a second opportunity to try to
fasten guilt upon an accused. The Wexler case (1) was an appeal from an
acquittal, but there is no difference in principle between that and a
conviction on a basis for which there was no support in law or in fact. And
once it is clear that the conviction cannot stand, justice requires the same
treatment in the one case as in the other.

I would therefore allow the appeal and quash the
convictions.

Kellock J.—This is an appeal from the judgment or order of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, of the province of Quebec, pronounced the 28th day of June, 1945, Francœur and Stuart
McDougall JJ. dissenting, which affirmed the conviction of the appellants, upon
a charge of manslaughter following the verdict of a jury.

[Page 38]

The dissents as expressed in the formal judgment
are as follows:

Messieurs les juges Francœur
et Stuart McDougall,
dissidents, casseraient le verdict, annuleraient les sentences et ordonneraient
un nouveau procès; M. le juge Francœur pour les motifs suivants:

(a) Admission au cours du procès de preuve illégale;

(b) Direction erronée en droit sur
l'interprétation de l'article 69 du Code Criminel.

Stuart McDougall J., dissenting, being of opinion
that the verdict should be quashed and that a new trial should be ordered on
the grounds:

(a) that the accused were deprived
of their right to challenge peremptorily the number of jurors allowed by law;

(b) that the presiding judge
committed an error in law in instructing the jury that subsection 2 of section
69 of the Criminal Code applied; and

(c) that the presiding judge further
erred in law in instructing the jury that evidence declared by him to be
irrelevant as to the guilt of the accused would be helpful and could be
accepted by the jury to indicate an atmosphere or ""climat spécial""
surrounding the actions of the accused.

The facts in substance are as follows:

The appellants, members of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, Lizotte being a temporary constable, had, on May 7, 1944,
together with another constable by the name of Massicotte and a corporal Dubé,
who was in charge, gone to the village of St. Lambert for the purpose of apprehending
the deceased, Georges Guénette, wanted on a charge of having conspired with
others to assist one Hervé Plante to escape from the custody of a peace
officer. A number of unsuccessful attempts, some ten or more it is said, had
already been made by the police to effect Guénette's arrest. On the day in
question, these constables and others had made an earlier trip to the village
and after having searched the premises of Guénette's father unsuccessfully, had
set out on the return to their headquarters in the city of Quebec. After proceeding some distance
toward Quebec, the four named
constables on the orders of Dubé turned about and went back to St. Lambert on the chance that Guénette
might have returned to his father's house thinking that the coast was clear.
The evidence indicates that Guénette had in fact, at the time of the earlier
visit, been sleeping in his father's barn, but had managed to make his escape.

[Page 39]

Corporal Dubé stationed Lizotte and Massicotte
outside the house, which was situated on the south side of a road known as the Brochu Road, while he himself entered the
house followed by Savard. While so engaged, Dubé's attention was attracted by a
sound upstairs and he proceeded up the stairs just in time to see Guénette jump
from a window on the west side of the house. Savard immediately ran from the
house in pursuit of Guénette who ran westerly through a ploughed field behind
the house extending for a distance of 255 feet to a fence which separated the
Guénette property from the property of Brochu, further to the west. Brochu's
land in turn extends some 300 feet to a river.

As Savard pursued Guénette, he says he was
losing ground, and as Guénette ignored his calls to stop, he fired four shots
in the air from the ·45 calibre revolver which he carried. As Guénette still
paid no attention, Savard says he lowered his revolver and fired toward a point
approximately 6 feet to the left of Guénette with the idea that the latter
would not only hear the bullet but see the spurt of the ground where it hit. At
this time, he was some 40 or 50 feet approximately in a direct line, parallel
with the road, behind Guénette. As Savard fired this fifth shot, Guénette was
in the act of jumping the fence into the Brochu field and as he reached the
other side, he appeared to bend forward with the left hand resting on the fence
and the right hand on the ground. He then straightened himself and ran somewhat
more toward the south, but still westerly, for a distance of approximately 78
feet where he stumbled and fell face down. According to the medical evidence,
he was then dead or died very shortly thereafter. This evidence by itself might
very well indicate that Savard's last bullet had hit Guénette. There is,
however, other evidence to be mentioned.

Lizotte had been stationed on the Brochu Road on the north side of the
Guénette house, while Massicotte had been instructed by Dubé to post himself in
a line with Lizotte on the south side of the house between the house and the
barn to the west. Massicotte, however, testified that these instructions had
been changed and that Dubé had assigned him to a post on the highway running
north

[Page 40]

and south, east of the Guénette house. This
change in instructions is, however, denied by Dubé. Lizotte, from his post on
the Brochu Road, on observing
Guénette jump from the window, tried to get over the fence separating the
Guénette property from the road but was unable to do so. He then ran westerly
on the road and fired one shot in the air and a second in a westerly direction
down the road toward a point, he says, approximately 30 to 35 feet to the north
of Guénette and to the latter's right. After he had fired these two shots, he
heard someone behind him say ""tire-le"" (shoot at him) and then a shot
from the same direction. At that moment, Guénette who had just jumped the fence
appeared to throw himself backwards. The words ""tire-le"" were also
heard by a Crown witness, Larochelle by name.

Massicotte's evidence is that, from his position
on the highway east of the house, he heard Lizotte call to someone and he,
Massicotte, thereupon ran after Savard in the field in pursuit of Guénette.
However, three other Crown witnesses, namely, Larochelle, Brochu and Guénette
Sr. describe having seen two constables running on the Brochu
 Road and both Dubé and Savard say they did not see
Massicotte in the field where Savard was. This evidence of Massicotte was
evidently regarded as so unsatisr factory by the Crown that Crown counsel told
the jury that Massicotte had not done as he said but had in fact run after
Lizotte on the Brochu Road.
Larochelle further testified that one of the two constables on the Brochu Road had lowered his arm and fired
in Guénette's direction and that the constable who did so was wearing a
soldier's cap. Lizotte was in civilian attire and bareheaded while Massicotte
was in uniform. There is evidence indicating that Lizotte's last shot and the
shot fired by Massicotte were both fired after Savard's fifth shot. The Crown
does not and did not at any time suggest that the words ""tire-le""
were spoken by Lizotte. Accordingly, if the evidence of Larochelle and Lizotte
is trustworthy on this point, these words must have been spoken by Massicotte.

When the body was examined by a doctor at the
hospital to which it was taken by the constables, Massicotte

[Page 41]

asked the doctor to insert at the penetration
point of the wound a ·45 and a ·38 calibre bullet. This was done and the doctor
then told Massicotte that it was a ·38 which had caused the death because that
bullet could be introduced more easily into the opening than the ·45. Both
Massicotte and Savard carried ·45's, while Lizotte carried a ·38. Before the
wound was further examined, the body was placed in the hands of an undertaker,
who sewed up the wound. One of the Crown experts, who later examined the body,
stated that in his opinion the bullet which caused the death was a ·45. The
experiment at the hospital by the doctor who first examined Guénette was not
communicated to Savard, who was evidently then of the opinion that it was a
bullet from his pistol which had caused the death. Savard said, however, that
he did not hear the words ""tire-le"" nor any shot after the fifth shot
he fired. He says that, when he heard shots from the Brochu
 Road, he called out to stop shooting.

The indictment charged that the appellants,

Ensemble et illégalement causé des lésions
corporelles qui ont entraîné la mort de Georges Guénette, commettant par là un
crime d'homicide involontaire.

It becomes important to observe the course followed
by the Crown's advisers and the way in which the case went to the jury. As
stated in the factum of the respondents, Crown counsel at the opening of the
trial declared expressly that the case fell within the provisions of section 69
(2) of the Criminal Code, and it is common ground that the trial judge so
charged the jury on the request of counsel for the Crown so to do. The case did
not go to the jury in any sense as within the first subsection of section 69.
As put by counsel for the respondent in their factum:

If there was evidence in the case that
Lizotte or Savard had been provoked, advised, aided or counselled to commit
that offence, it would have been the duty of the judge to quote and explain
that first part of section 69. The judge did not think that the evidence in the
case justified him to do so. It is hard to say that he then, on this point,
made a mistake.

In the factum of the Crown it is also stated
that:—

It is established that the two accused not
only drew their revolvers and fired, pointing them at the sky, but also aimed
at Guénette.

[Page 42]

The Crown also submitted the evidence of the
witness Larochelle that a constable wearing a soldier's hat on the Brochu Road had fired at Guénette. As
already mentioned, this evidence, if accepted, points to Massicotte. Further,
it appears that the bullet which killed Guénette entered the body at the left
side of the back in the vicinity of the eleventh rib and passed out at the
level of the fourth rib some six inches higher, the direction of the bullet
through the body being to some degree from left to right. Guénette in jumping
the fence had placed one hand on the top rail and had vaulted over it with his
feet toward the Brochu Road. As
he reached the ground, his back might well have presented a target to a person
firing from the road quite consistent with the location and direction of the
wound, while it is not so easy, perhaps, to visualize how such a wound could
have been caused by a person in the position of Savard, who is said to have
been approximately in a straight line behind him. It is impossible, however, to
be dogmatic with regard to this matter, and this is the view taken by St.
Jacques J. in the Court of King's Bench.

The uncertainty as to the identity of the person
who had fired the fatal shot (only one bullet hit Guénette), and the fact that
the Crown did not suggest that Lizotte was the person who had used the words
""tire-le"" and that in the opinion of counsel for the Crown there was
no evidence that Lizotte or Savard had been ""provoked, advised, aided or
counselled"" to commit the offence were no doubt the considerations which
dictated the course followed in proceeding under subsection (2). This being the
view of the Crown's advisers, that course was not other than proper. The
important point is that the decision was made after full consideration of all
the facts and followed after all the evidence had been placed before the jury.

Section 69 reads as follows:

(1) Every one is a party to and guilty of
an offence who

(a) actually commits it;

(b) does or omits an act for the
purpose of aiding any person to commit the offence;

(c) abets any person in commission
of the offence; or

(d) counsels or procures any
person to commit the offence

(2) If several persons form a common
intention to prosecute any unlawful purpose, and to assist each other therein,
each of them is a party to every offence committed by any one of them in the
prosecution

[Page 43]

of such common purpose, the commission of
which offence was, or ought to have been known to be a probable consequence of
the prosecution of such common purpose.

In the course of his charge, the learned trial
judge read subsection 2 to the jury and told them in so many words that it
applied. He did not, however, explain the subsection or direct the jury as to
how it was to be applied to the facts in evidence according as they might
determine them to be. In so doing, he took away from the jury, in my opinion,
the question as to whether or not there was in fact any intention such as the
subsection requires. This appears more clearly from a reading of the charge, to
parts of which I will presently refer.

The theory of the Crown with regard to the
application of subsection (2) was that the appellants had formed a common
intention to bring about the arrest of Guénette by any means; that such
intention involved an unlawful purpose, namely, the use of force beyond the
limits permitted by section 43 of the Criminal Code; and that it was immaterial
which of them actually fired the fatal shot, as the death of Guénette was or ought
to have been known to each of them to have been a probable consequence. I am
content, without determining the point, to deal with the case on the footing
that the subsection may be so applied.

The learned trial judge, as will appear, charged
the jury that there was no illegality in any way attaching to the appellants'
conduct that day prior to the moment when the actual firing commenced. The way
in which he told them it was open to them to convict from that time on I shall
now refer to. Counsel for the Crown who, as already stated, requested the
learned trial judge to charge on the basis of subsection (2), did not object to
the charge and must be taken to have been satisfied with it.

Coming to the charge itself, I quote:

Je crois, messieurs les jurés, que je vous ai
fait un résumé aussi fidèle que possible de la preuve, d'après les nombreuses
notes que j'ai prises et la transcription de certains témoignages. Je vous ai
exposé le droit suivant ce que je crois les principes du code, son sens
littéral, le sens commun et ma façon de lire la loi. C'est le cadre. Vous avez,
par les faits, le tableau, l'ambiance, l'atmosphère, le climat en un mot. C'est
à vous maintenant de décider si les accusés sont coupables ou non. Je vous

[Page 44]

le répète: vous êtes maîtres des faits, et si
je les avais rapportés erronément, vous n'êtes pas tenus de me suivre. C'est
votre opinion, c'est votre conviction seule qui compte.

Les accusés ont-ils, usant de leur discrétion,
suivant les ordres reçus, abusé de leur port d'armes, et aux termes de la loi,
fait un excès de violence?

Les accusés auraient-ils pu opérer
l'arrestation, comme dit le code, par des moyens raisonnables, sans recourir à
violence? Les accusés auraient-ils pu arrêter Georges Guénette ce matin-là, en
le cernant, en se jetant sur lui, sans recourir aux armes à feu? Ont-ils été négligents, de négligence grossière
et ont-ils dépassé les limites de leurs pouvoirs, en se servant de revolvers,
qui, sous prétexte de l'avertir, le couchèrent dans un champ et lui enlevèrent
la vie? Georges Guénette pouvait-il se sauver bien loin, seul contre quatre
gendarmes armés et qui avaient avec eux une automobile? Si vous en venez à
cette conclusion, qui est uniquement de votre province, vous devez les trouver
coupables, suivant l'accusation portée.

Les accusés ont-ils fait leur devoir, sont-ils
restés dans les limites de la loi, n'ont-ils commis aucun excès, est-ce un
accident? Si vous en venez à cette conclusion, vous devez les acquitter.

Devez-vous trouver une différence de
responsabilité entre l'accusé Savard et l'accusé Lizotte, si vous en venez au
verdict de culpabilité?

C'est ici que l'article 69 du Code Pénal, paragraphe 2, à son application:

""Quand plusieurs personnes forment
ensemble le projet de faire quelque chose d'illégal et de s'entraider dans ce
projet, chacune d'elles est complice de toute infraction commise par l'une
d'entre elles dans la poursuite de leur but commun, si elles savaient ou
devaient savoir que la commission de cette infraction devait être la
conséquence probable de la poursuite de leur but commun.""

Me Gendron soutient que cet article ne
s'applique pas. Malheureusement, je ne puis partager son opinion. Le paragraphe
2 s'applique. L'illégalité
commença au moment où ils, les accusés et le constable Massicotte, se mirent ensemble à tirer dans la poursuite de leur but
commun, contrairement à la loi, si vous jugez qu'ils abusèrent de la violence.

L'entente est devenue illégale au cours de
l'exécution, toujours si les accusés excédèrent, d'après vous, les moyens raisonnables
et causèrent la mort—article 43 C. Cr.

Il me reste à vous dire que le doute est en
faveur des accusés. Quand on parle de doute, il faut que ce soit un doute
raisonnable qui entraîne la conviction, c'est-à-dire, que si vous n'êtes pas
logiquement et raisonnablement sûrs que les accusés soient coupables, votre
devoir est de les acquitter.

In the above, the jury are told these four
things:

(1) If they thought that the appellants could
have effected the arrest by means other than by resorting to their firearms or
if they were guilty of gross negligence in resorting to their firearms, they
had gone beyond the limits of section 43 Cr. C. and the jury must find them
guilty as charged.

[Page 45]

(2) If, in the opinion of the jury, the
appellants did not exceed the limits of section 43, Cr. C. then the death was
an accident and the appellants should be acquitted.

(3) They need not differentiate between Savard
and Lizotte in arriving at their verdict under (1) above in view of the
provisions of section 69 (2).

(4) The unlawful intention within the meaning of
subsection 2 arose when the appellants started to fire, if, in the opinion of
the jury, the appellants transgressed the limits of section 43.

Section 43 Cr. C. is as follows:

Every one proceeding lawfully to arrest any
person for any cause other than an offence in the last section mentioned is
justified, if the person to be arrested takes to flight to avoid arrest, in
using such force as may be necessary to prevent his escape by flight, unless
such escape can be prevented by reasonable means in a less violent manner, if
such force is neither intended nor likely to cause death or grevious bodily
harm.

Assuming that the theory of the Crown as
previously set out correctly interprets the provisions of section 69 (2) as
applied to the case at bar, the question of fact as to the existence or
non-existence of a common wrongful intention on the part of the appellants was
completely taken away from the jury by the charge. They were told that the
guilt of the appellants was dependent merely upon a finding that the appellants
had gone beyond that which is authorized by section 43. This, of course, is
completely erroneous and sufficient of itself to vitiate the verdict and direct
a new trial.

However, in my opinion, that course cannot be
followed as it is impossible to find in the record any evidence supporting the
existence of a common intention on the part of the appellants to prosecute any
unlawful purpose within the meaning of subsection (2) even had the jury been
properly charged. The learned trial judge charged the jury, as already
mentioned, and I think correctly, that there was no illegality until the
instant when the firing commenced. Accepting that, I agree with the learned
dissenting judges in the court below that there is nothing from which it can be
established that either of the appellants acted other than independently and as
a result of the circumstances which came into existence during the attempt to
make the arrest after Guénette

[Page 46]

was sighted. There is no evidence upon which a
finding could be made that the appellants formed at that time any common
wrongful intention as required by the subsection.

Notwithstanding the position taken by the Crown
at the trial, Mr. Rivard now argues that there was evidence showing that the
appellants had formed a wrongful intention prior to the time when the firing
commenced.

For the purpose of showing that the whole
expedition was illegal, Mr. Rivard endeavoured to make use of the fact that
the constables did not have with them the warrant for Guénette's arrest. The
evidence shows that this was due to a mistake on the part of corporal Dubé.
Unknown to him, the file at headquarters had been split into two parts, and,
when leaving Quebec for St. Lambert, he had picked up what he thought was the
complete file, but in fact, the papers he took with him did not include the
warrant. However, the learned trial judge told the jury that this fact made no
difference so far as the appellants were concerned and specifically instructed
the jury that, in considering their verdict, they were to leave the question of
the presence or absence of the warrant out of consideration. I think the
learned trial judge was right and I do not think, therefore, that any point can
be made of this.

Mr. Rivard next called our attention to an
incident which occurred when the constables arrived at the village in the early
morning for the first time. An automobile was observed by Dubé on the village
street and he gave chase. After some trouble, he managed to place his car in
its path and to bring it to a stop. Some conversation took place between the
occupants of the two cars, and one Baillargeon, the driver of the other
automobile, deposed at the trial that one of the constables, he would not say
which, in the course of this conversation had said that if Baillargeon had not
stopped the constables would have fired. There is some question as to whether
this conversation took place in the presence of Savard, but I am content to
assume his presence. The learned trial judge charged the jury that legally this
conversation had no bearing upon the case, but he told the jury it was a
circumstance which might give them what the learned

[Page 47]

trial judge called the ""atmosphere"" or
""special climate"" of the case. This was, in my opinion, highly
improper. The incident was either evidence against the appellants or it was
not. There is no middle ground and the charge of the learned judge on this
point amounts to a direction that the jury might draw a conclusion unfavourable
to the accused from something which was not evidence at all. In my opinion, the
learned trial judge was right in holding that the incident was inadmissible as
evidence.

Mr. Rivard now seeks to use this incident for
the purpose of his present argument, namely, as showing the existence of a
common wrongful intention on the part of the appellants prior to the moment of
the firing. If in fact such an intention did exist at that time, then it must
have been on the part of Dubé and Massicotte and Savard, who were in the police
car at the time. Lizotte was not in that car but was in the other car with
three other constables in another part of the village. If Lizotte was also a
party to this wrongful intention, surely the other constables in the car with
him must also have been parties. It is remarkable, therefore, if Mr. Rivard be
right, why none of the other constables, and more especially why Dubé and
Massicotte, were not charged. It seems apparent that this contention is an
afterthought. It was not entertained by counsel for the Crown when the case was
placed before the jury.

Apart from this, this incident has no relevancy
to the charge upon which the appellants were tried. The argument is that when
the remark was made, the constables thought that Guénette might have been in
the Baillargeon car, and if they were willing to fire then, it would be some
evidence, the weight being for the jury, that they intended to fire later when
they did in fact sight Guénette and he did not stop. The incident is not
capable of being the foundation for the inference sought to be drawn from it.
There is nothing in the remark which would properly permit the inference to be
drawn that the firing would be with intent to do other than warn, and the
Crown's case would not be advanced.

The third circumstance relied upon by Mr. Rivard
in support of his argument was a conversation between one of the constables and
a Miss Fontaine, which took place also

[Page 48]

at the time of the first visit to the village,
while some of the constables were engaged in searching the home of her father.
Miss Fontaine said to this constable something to the effect that the
constables were tiring themselves that morning. His reply, according to Miss
Fontaine, was to the effect that that might be so, but others would soon be
tired. This evidence, in my opinion, was also inadmissible. Neither of the
appellants were present when the words were spoken. The trial judge permitted
this evidence to be given but directed the jury that it did not incriminate the
appellants and that they were not responsible for something spoken when they
were not present. Following this, however, he told the jury that it was for
them to decide whether or not the words were spoken. This was equally
objectionable to his treatment of the Baillargeon incident. Even if it were the
fact that both appellants were present when the statement was made, the
statement, in my opinion, is completely colourless and innocuous, and incapable
of being the basis of an inference that there was on the part of the appellants
any such intention as is now contended for.

In my opinion, therefore, as already stated,
there is no evidence anywhere to support the argument now put forward by Mr.
Rivard.

When a conviction is set aside on the ground
that there is no evidence to support it, the result ordinarily is that the
accused must be acquitted. The Crown contends, however, that there should be a
new trial, and, of course, that is what is directed by the dissenting
judgments. The argument is that the appellants should now be proceeded against
at the proposed new trial under section 69 (1) or, that additional evidence
might be forthcoming which would make section 69 (2) applicable. Such an order,
however, cannot be made. Section 1024 provides:

(1) The Supreme Court of Canada shall make
such rule or order thereon, either in affirmance of the conviction or for
granting a new trial, or otherwise, or for granting or refusing such
application, as the justice of the case requires, and shall make all other
necessary rules and orders for carrying such rule or order into effect.

(2) Unless such appeal is brought on for
hearing by the appellant at the session of the Supreme Court of Canada during
which such affirmance takes place, or the session next thereafter if the said
court is not then in session, the appeal shall be held to have been abandoned,
unless otherwise ordered by the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof.

[Page 49]

(3) The judgment of the Supreme Court of
Canada shall, in all cases, be final and conclusive.

(4) Notwithstanding any royal prerogative,
or anything contained in the Interpretation Act or in the Supreme Court Act, no
appeal shall be brought in any criminal case from any judgment or order of any
court in Canada to any court of appeal or authority, by which in the United
Kingdom appeals or petitions to His Majesty in Council may be heard.

While the existence of a dissent on a question
of law, as provided by section 1023, is a condition precedent for an appeal to
this Court, in a case like the present, this Court, once seized of the appeal
is not limited to the remedy considered appropriate in the dissent, but has
complete jurisdiction to direct the remedy which, in its opinion, the Court
appealed from ought to have granted. In Manchuk v. The King[4], Duff CJ.C. said:

We have concluded after full consideration
that by force of section 1024 coupled with the enactments of the Supreme
Court Act this Court has authority not only to order a new trial or to
quash the conviction and direct the discharge of the prisoner. * * *

Having this jurisdiction then, what is the duty
of the Court in the circumstances here present? In my opinion it would not be
proper to direct a new trial. Even had the jury been properly instructed under
section 69 (2), there is no evidence, as I have pointed out, upon which the
appellants could properly have been convicted. The case was deliberately
proceeded with upon a theory of guilt under a certain provision of the Criminal
Code which now turns out to be one which the evidence entirely fails to justify.
Merely because it is suggested that upon some other possible view of the
evidence some other provision of the Code might apply (which the Crown
deliberately determined at the trial did not apply), or because the Crown might
be able to adduce further evidence are not circumstances which would make it
proper to do otherwise than to acquit. I think the principle of the decision in
Wexler v. The King[5]
prevents our making such an order as the Crown now asks for. I would therefore
allow the appeal and quash the convictions. It is not necessary in the
circumstances that I deal with any of the other grounds of dissent.

Appeal allowed, convictions quashed and
appellants discharged.

In Re Morris C. Shumiatcher

1961: September 18, 26, 27.

Present: Judson J. in Chambers.

Criminal law—Habeas corpus—Counselling to commit perjury
before Registrar of Saskatchewan Securities Commission—Whether examination by
Registrar a judicial proceeding—Registrar's power to examine on oath— Solemn
declaration—Perjury—Powers of Court on habeas corpus—The Securities Act, 1954
(Sask.), c. 89, s. 13—The Saskatchewan Evidence Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 73, s.
41—Criminal Code, 1953–54 (Can.), c. 61, ss. 22, 112, 114.

The petitioner, a barrister and solicitor, was committed for
trial in Saskatchewan on an indictment of ten charges. Seven charges were that
the petitioner counselled seven named individuals to commit perjury in their
examination before the Registrar of the Saskatchewan Securities Commission held
pursuant to s. 13 of The Securities Act, 1954 (Sask.), and thereby
became a party to the said perjury by reason of s. 22(1) of the Criminal
Code. The other charges were that he counselled and procured one L to make
a false declaration on oath before an authorized person and thereby became a
party to an offence under s. 114 of the Criminal Code. The plaintiff
applied to the Supreme Court of Canada for a writ of habeas corpus on
two grounds: (1) that there was no offence at law shown in the first seven
charges because the examination of the individuals before the Registrar was not
a judicial proceeding within the meaning of s. 112 of the Criminal Code; and
(2) that L was not a person permitted, authorized or required by law to make
the said declaration within the meaning of s. 114 of the Criminal Code, and
that there existed no authorization at law for the taking or receiving of these
solemn declarations.

Held: The application was dismissed.

Under s. 13 of The Securities Act, 1954, the Registrar
had by law authority to examine under oath. He also had the power to administer
the oath if not under that section then under s. 41 of The Saskatchewan
Evidence Act. Consequently, counts one to seven disclosed offences known to
the law and for which the accused was properly committed for trial.

The jurisdiction of this Court in a writ of habeas corpus was
limited to a consideration of the warrant of committal and other germane order,
and if they were regular on their face, that was the end of the matter. The
Court in such a writ has no more power to look at the solemn declarations
alleged to have been made than it has to look at the evidence given on a
preliminary hearing. No distinction can be drawn between a warrant of committal
before and one after conviction.

APPLICATION before Judson J. in chambers for a writ of habeas
corpus. Application dismissed.

[Page 39]

The following judgment was delivered

Judson J.
(orally):—This is an application for habeas corpus. Before I can deal
intelligibly with the issues raised on the application, I think I should set
out in chronological order the steps that have been taken in this prosecution
before the application was launched.

The accused came before the magistrate on a summons
containing eleven charges on which the magistrate conducted a preliminary
hearing lasting seven days. He committed the accused for trial on all charges
except number nine, in which he made an amendment to reduce it to
""counselling, procuring or inciting the commission of an offence""
which was not committed, under s. 407(a) of the Criminal Code.

I should say at this point that the magistrate on that date,
that is, the 30th November 1960, signed no warrant of committal. He admitted
the accused to bail immediately on his own recognizance.

On January 23, 1961, an indictment containing eleven counts
was preferred against the accused in the Court of Queen's Bench presided over
by Mr. Justice Disbery. Without analyzing the counts in the indictment in
detail, it is accurate, I think, to say that they are substantially in the same
form as the charges contained in the summons before the magistrate, as amended.

I can make this rough classification at this point, that the
first seven counts in the indictment have to do with counselling seven named
individuals to commit perjury before the Registrar under The Securities Act of
 Saskatchewan and an allegation that that offence of perjury was afterwards
committed. The charge, therefore, on the first seven counts was that of
perjury.

Count number eight charged an attempt to obstruct and defeat
the course of justice by attempting to induce the seven named individuals in
the first seven counts to give false evidence in a judicial proceeding, namely,
an examination before the Registrar under The Securities Act.

Counts nine, ten and eleven have to do with procuring or
inciting two named individuals to make a solemn declaration.

I will deal with all these counts in more detail later.

[Page 40]

Counsel for the accused moved to quash all counts in the
indictment. The application was dismissed by the trial judge, with the
exception of count number eight on which the accused had elected a non-jury
trial and on which the Crown had no right of election before a judge and jury.
Count number eight, therefore, requires no further consideration here.

The remaining counts were then severed and the accused was
arraigned on counts nine, ten and eleven. He pleaded not guilty.

At the conclusion of the evidence there was a motion for a
directed verdict, which was rejected by the trial judge. The jury found the
accused not guilty on count eleven and disagreed on counts nine and ten.

The trial judge then adjourned the trial on counts nine and
ten and the remaining seven counts, counts one to seven, to the next sittings
of the Court to be held in May 1961; and continued the bail.

The next step was a motion by the accused before the
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal for a Writ of Certiorari to quash the committal
for trial on counts one to seven and counts nine and ten and to quash the
indictments corresponding to those counts. Judgment was given dismissing this
application on August 16, 1961, and on September 15, 1961, the accused launched
this application for habeas corpus.

On September 15, 1961, the accused was still at liberty on
bail, but on Monday, September 18, he appeared before Judge Hogarth and,
according to the order made by Judge Hogarth on that day, surrendered himself
into the custody of the judge for the purpose of satisfying the conditions of
the recognizance; and applied to be relieved of his obligations under the terms
of the recognizance and no longer acknowledged himself to be bound by its
terms.

The order recites that the accused was so relieved of his
obligations and then commands W. H. Williams, Sheriff of the Judicial Centre of
Regina, to take the accused into custody and convey him to
Regina Gaol.

On the same day, an order was made by a Judge of this Court
directing the issue of a Writ of Habeas Corpus to W. H. Williams, the Sheriff,
and to the Keeper of the Regina

[Page 41]

Gaol, to have the body of the accused before the judge
making the order on September 25, 1961. At that time the accused was admitted
to bail. The writ was served but no formal return to the writ has been made.

I have before me, first of all, the recognizance entered into
by the accused on November 30, 1960; a copy of the order of Judge Hogarth; and
a certified copy of a warrant of committal dated November 30, 1960.I have
already mentioned that this warrant was not signed on that day because the
accused was immediately admitted to bail.

There is evidence before me that this warrant was not signed
until September 21, or possibly September 22. In any event, I am not in any
doubt how the accused came to be in custody and I assume that if any formal
return had been made it would recite the facts that I have recited.

The application for habeas corpus is made on two grounds—the
first ground having reference to the first seven counts and the second ground
having reference to counts nine and ten. The first seven counts have been
referred to throughout these proceedings as the ""registrar charges""
and counts nine and then have been referred to as ""Leier charges"".

I will set out now count number one, the first of the
registrar charges. The others are in exactly the same terms but with a
different name. I am quoting not from the indictment but from the summons.

The first charge is that the accused, during the month of
January 1958, at the City of Regina, did counsel another
person, to wit, one Edward Joseph Leier to commit the
offence of perjury, which offence was afterwards committed by the said Edward
Joseph Leier at the examination before the Registrar of
the Saskatchewan Securities Commission held pursuant to s. 13 of The
Securities Act, 1954, on the 23rd day of January, A.D. 1958, by swearing
falsely to the following effect:

(a) that he did not make
certain representations to prospective purchasers of shares in Columbia Metals
Exploration Co. Ltd., including statements regarding the listing of the shares,
the resultant increase in the price of the shares, the financial position of
the said Company, and its association with other companies, including the Ford
Motor Company, and

[Page 42]

(b) that the information
contained in the said representations was not given to him by Walter Luboff,
and

(c) that he could not
remember certain facts which he did actually remember,

while knowing the same to be false and with intent to
mislead the said Registrar contrary to the Criminal Code, and did
thereby become a party to the said perjury by virtue of 22(1) of the Criminal
Code.

When the Registrar charges became the first seven counts in
the indictment the application to quash was based on the same argument that has
been addressed to me on this motion for habeas corpus. Its outlines are set out
in the Notice of the application.

The argument is that there is no offence at law shown in
these counts, because the examination before the Registrar of the Saskatchewan
Securities Commission which he is said to have held under s. 13 of The
Securities Act, 1954, is not a judicial proceeding within s. 112 of the Criminal
Code. Section 112 of the Criminal Code reads:

Every one commits perjury who, being a witness in a judicial
proceeding, with intent to mislead gives false evidence, knowing that the
evidence is false.

""Judicial proceeding"" is defined in s. 99 of the
Code. I think the only subsection that I am concerned with is para. (iv) of
subs. (c), which reads:

(c) ""judicial
proceeding"" means a proceeding

* * *

(iv) before an arbitrator or
umpire, or a person or body of persons authorized by law to make an inquiry and
take evidence therein under oath,

* * *

I next set out s. 13 of The Saskatchewan Securities Act, which
reads:

13. The registrar may and shall when so directed by the
commission require any further information or material to be submitted by any
applicant or any registered person or company within a specified time and may
require verification by affidavit or otherwise of any information or material
then or previously submitted or may require the applicant or the registered
person or any partner, officer, director or employee of the registered person
or company to submit to examination under oath.

[Page 43]

Counsel for the applicant submits that this section does not
authorize the registrar to make an inquiry or examination. His argument is that
if it did so authorize the registrar the concluding words of the section would
be, not ""to submit to examination under oath"" but ""to submit to
examination under oath before him"".

That is reducing the argument to its simplest elements. The
answer that is made by the Crown to it is that the plain meaning of the section
is that the registrar has this power to require the named person, in this case,
to submit to examination under oath and that the section cannot mean anything
else but submit to examination under oath before him.

Two other parts of the Act are referred to in support of
that argument. The first is s. 2(5) (f), which defines
""fraud"", in part, as

the making of a material false statement in any application,
information, material or evidence submitted or given to the commission or the
registrar under the provisions of this Act or the regulations, or in any prospectus
or return filed with the commission;

The subsection that I have just read, it is argued,
contemplates the giving of information, material or evidence to the registrar.

Section 65(1) (c) is also relevant. It provides:

65. (1) Every person, including any officer, director,
official or employee of a company, who is knowingly responsible for

* * *

(c) the making of any
material false statement in any application, information, statement, material
or evidence submitted or given under this Act or the regulations to the
commission, its representative, the registrar or any person appointed to make
an investigation or audit under this Act;

I have no doubt, after listening to the two arguments
and the reading of the sections that I have already mentioned, that the
registrar has the power under s. 13 to take evidence and to take evidence under
oath.

That was Mr. Justice Disbery's opinion when he dismissed the
motion to quash, and it is also my opinion.

I think it is the plain meaning of s. 13 that the registrar
may require this particular person to give this information under oath, to
submit to examination under oath and before the registrar. To what other
possible place or person could he send the man for examination?

[Page 44]

If the person to conduct the examination is the registrar, I
think it is implicit in the terms of the section too that the registrar can
administer the oath. In any event, there is s. 41 of The Saskatchewan
Evidence Act which I had better set out in full:

41. Every court, judge, police magistrate, justice of the
peace, arbitrator or other person now or hereafter having by law or by consent
of parties authority to hear, receive and examine evidence may administer an
oath to any witness who is legally called before such court, judge, police
magistrate, justice of the peace, arbitrator or other person respectively.

In my opinion the registrar, under s. 13, has by law
authority to examine under oath. I think he has, by s. 13, also the power to
administer the oath, but if he has not got that power by s. 13 of The
Securities Act, I think he has it by s. 41 of the Evidence Act.

I am therefore holding that counts one to seven do disclose
offences known to the law and that the accused was properly committed for trial
on those charges and that to that extent the motion to quash the committal on
those charges fails.

I turn now to counts nine and ten, referred to as the Leier charges. I set out count nine in full:

9. And further, that you during the month of August A.D.
1958 at the said City of Regina unlawfully did counsel or
procure one Edward Joseph Leier who, not being a witness
in a judicial proceeding but being permitted or authorized by law to make a
statement by solemn declaration, to make in such statement before a person who
is authorized by law to permit it to be made before her, assertions with
respect to matters of fact, opinion, belief or knowledge knowing the said
assertions to be false, and thereby to be a party to an offence against the
Criminal Code section 114, which offence was afterwards committed by the said
Edward Joseph Leier by solemn declaration declared at the
said City of Regina on the 14th day of August A.D. 1958,
and you did thereby become a party to the said offence against section 114 of
the Criminal Code by virtue of section 22(1) of the Criminal Code.

Count number ten is in the same terms, with this exception,
that the solemn declaration referred to was simply dated ""in the month of
August 1958"". Section 114 of the Criminal Code reads:

114. Every one who, not being a witness in a judicial
proceeding but being permitted, authorized or required by law to make a
statement by affidavit, by solemn declaration or orally under oath, makes in
such a statement, before a person who is authorized by law to permit it to be
made before him, an assertion with respect to a matter of fact, opinion, belief
or knowledge, knowing that the assertion is false, is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.

[Page 45]

The attack on these two counts is made on these
grounds— that Leier was not a person permitted, authorized
or required by law to make the solemn declarations referred to in counts nine
and ten and that there exists no authorization at law for the taking or
receiving of these solemn declarations.

The argument is that the phrase ""permitted, authorized
or required by law"" to make a statement, means permitted, authorized or
required by some substantive law; that the Crown must point to some statute
which permits, authorizes or requires Leier to make these
solemn declarations, and that there is no such statutory authorization.

The Crown's submission in answer to that is that Leier is permitted by s. 37 of the Canada Evidence Act to
make this declaration if Part I of the Canada Evidence Act is applicable
and, if it is not so applicable, he is permitted under provincial law to make
the declaration; and that the purpose of the declaration may very well
determine which law is applicable and the determination of the purpose is a
matter of evidence for the jury.

All that I have before me is the declaration itself. The
declaration does refer to a statement of claim in an action brought by a
plaintiff, whose name I cannot read, against Columbia Metals Exploration Co.
Ltd., Western Bond and Share Corporation Limited, William Luboff, John J.
Abbott, Edward Leier and Laurence Tetrault.

This brings me to the question of what use may be made of
this material on a motion for habeas corpus before a judge of this Court.

The Crown's submission is that I am limited to looking at
the warrant of committal and that I cannot look at these declarations and the
statement of claim any more than I can look at the evidence—seven or eight
volumes of it— given on the preliminary hearing.

The basis for that submission is to be found in a number of
cases decided in this Court going back to In re Trepanier1. This
and the other cases to which I propose to refer in a moment have to do with
motions for habeas corpus after a conviction. The present application is
brought in a case

[Page 46]

where there has been no conviction but only a committal for
trial and a bill of indictment preferred. It is suggested that that makes a
difference and I will deal with that later.

In Re Trepanier an application was made to a judge of this Court on behalf of a
person arrested on a warrant issued on a conviction, for a writ of habeas
corpus with certiorari in aid. The application was dismissed. Chief Justice
Ritchie said, at p. 113:

The jurisdiction of the magistrate being unquestionable over
the subject-matter of complaint and the person of the prisoner, and there being
no ground for alleging that the magistrate acted irregularly or beyond his
jurisdiction, and the conviction and warrant being admitted to be regular, the
only objection being that the magistrate erred on the facts and that the
evidence did not justify the conclusion as to the guilt of the prisoner arrived
at by the magistrate, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that we
cannot go behind the conviction and inquire into the merits of the case by the
use of the writ of habeas corpus.

It was also pointed out that there is no jurisdiction
in this Court to issue a writ of certiorari in aid of habeas corpus. The
certiorari provisions in the Supreme Court Act have to do with appellate
jurisdiction and not with jurisdiction in matters of habeas corpus which is
concurrent with that of jurisdiction of the judges of the Superior Courts of
the provinces.

The next case I refer to is Ex parte Macdonald2. That was also an
application for habeas corpus after there had been a conviction. At p. 687, the
judgment reads:

I believe therefore that the jurisdiction of a judge of the
Supreme Court in matters of habeas corpus in any criminal case, is limited to
an inquiry into the cause of commitment, that is, as disclosed by the warrant
of commitment, under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.

Finally on that point, in the case of In re Goldhar3, the principle to be found
in the previous cases reported in the court is reaffirmed in the plainest
terms. For example, Chief Justice Kerwin, at p. 435, says:

The Calendar is a certificate regular on its face that the
appellant was convicted by a court of competent criminal jurisdiction and
therefore it is impossible to go behind it on an application for habeas corpus;
Re Trepanier (1885) 12 S.C.R. 111; Re
Sproule (1886) 12 S.C.R. 140; In re Henderson (1930) S.C.R. 45, 1
D.L.R. 420. 52 C.C.C. 95.

[Page 47]

And to the same effect in the judgment of Mr. Justice
Fauteux, at p. 439:

The question, which counsel for the appellant admittedly
sought to be determined by way of habeas corpus proceedings, is stated in the
reasons for judgment of other members of the Court. In my view, it is one which
would require the consideration of the evidence at trial and which, in this
particular case, extends beyond the scope of matters to be inquired under a
similar process. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to convert the writ of
habeas corpus into a writ of error or an appeal and to confer, upon every one
having authority to issue the writ of habeas corpus, an appellate jurisdiction
over the orders and judgments of even the highest Courts. It is well settled
that the functions of such a writ do not extend beyond an inquiry into the
jurisdiction of the Court by which process the subject is held in custody and
into the validity of the process upon its face.

In my opinion the jurisdiction of this Court is
similarly limited in an inquiry into a committal for trial. In the absence of
power to issue a writ of certiorari in aid of habeas corpus, a judge of this
Court has no power to look at the evidence at the preliminary hearing or to
receive affidavit evidence relating to it.

My jurisdiction is limited to a consideration of the warrant
of committal and the other material that I have referred to—the recognizances
and the order of Judge Hogarth. I cannot look at evidence, whether a transcript
of the evidence at the preliminary hearing or evidence sought to be introduced
by way of affidavit identifying a portion of such evidence.

I am founding my reasons on this branch of the case entirely
on that principle and I am expressing no opinion on the point on which I heard
full argument—whether there does exist, by virtue of provincial legislation,
permission to take a declaration of this kind.

It was suggested that that power is to be found in 1835
legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and that that legislation is still in
force in some way in the Province of Saskatchewan. The applicant, on the other
hand, says that that legislation cannot have been in force after the year 1907
when The Saskatchewan Evidence Act was enacted. If that is so, any
statutory declaration made in Saskatchewan before the 1959 amendment to the Evidence
Act is invalid unless it comes within Part I of the Canada
Evidence Act. I am expressing no opinion on that point, but founding my
judgment on the lack of jurisdiction in this Court to do more

[Page 48]

than examine the warrant of committal, and to find that, if
it is regular on its face, that is the end of the matter. I am drawing no
distinction between a warrant of committal after conviction. I see no
distinction in principle between the two.

The application will therefore be dismissed.

The judgment will issue on the 10th October, 1961, to afford
the applicant an opportunity to apply to the full Court on that date for bail
and, in the meantime, I continue the bail.

Application dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Theft—Essential elements—Accused charged with theft
of cheque forged and issued against account of company controlled by accused—Series of fraudulent
transactions culminating in issue of cheque—Whether cheque property of company—Whether company had special
property or interest in cheque—Criminal Code, 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, s. 269.

The appellants were
convicted by a jury on a charge of stealing money and securities or other
property or a valuable security to the value of $960,000 belonging to B Mines
Ltd. By an elaborate fabrication, including the fabrication of minutes of
meetings that never took place, the

[Page 216]

forgery of a cheque in the
name of the company by the appellants and the sale of shares without the
knowledge of the optionee, the company was fraudulently deprived of $960,000
from its bank account. All documents purporting to be signed by the company
were signed by two of the appellants representing themselves as president and
treasurer and the corporate seal was used where necessary. The convictions were
affirmed by the Court of Appeal, and the appellants obtained leave to appeal to
this Court.

Held: The convictions should be
quashed.








The real case for the Crown
was that the appellants stole the cheque, but the verdict of the jury indicated
that they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the cheque was an
integral and necessary part of an elaborate scheme of fraud to which the appellants
were parties and that none of the appellants could have thought that the
company had given its consent.

It was implicit in the
findings of the jury that the cheque was a false document, known to be false by
the parties to this scheme and made with the intent that it was to be used or
acted upon as genuine to the prejudice of the company. On these findings the
cheque was a forgery.

The company did not have
any ownership or special property or interest in the cheque. The fact that the
name of the company was fraudulently inscribed on the cheque, and that loss
might result to the company, did not vest in the company any proprietary rights
or special property or interest therein. It would be creating a new and strange
mode of acquisition of property to hold that if A’s signature is forged by B on a
document, A for that sole reason could as owner recover that document from B.
Possession of the cheque was not at any material time that of the company. It
was the possession of those who created it to defraud the company. Therefore
the cheque could not have been stolen.

APPEALS from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the appellants
convictions on a charge of theft of a cheque. Appeals allowed.

G.A. Martin, Q.C., for the
appellant Smith.

C.L. Dubin, Q.C., for the
appellant Schonbrun.

appellant Stuart.

Shibley, for the respondent.



The
judgment of the Court was delivered by



FAUTEUX
J.:—Pursuant to leave granted
by this Court, under s. 597(1) (b) Cr.C., the appellants appeal from a
unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 dismissing an
appeal from their conviction on the first of several counts contained in the
indictment preferred against

[Page 217]



them.
The Crown had elected to proceed on this count. As amended at the close of the
case for the prosecution, by the insertion of the words here italicized, this
count reads as follows:










that
Ben Smith, D. Charles Stuart, Stanley I. Schonbrun, Sol R. Rauch and Harold D.
Rauch during the year 1957, at the City of Toronto in the County of York and
elsewhere, did steal money and securities or other property or a valuable
security to the value of $960,000 more or less, the property of Brilund
Mines Limited, contrary to the Criminal Code.



The
case for the Crown is not that these accused stole money or securities which
were the property of Brilund Mines Limited. In essence, the case is that these
appellants, by an elaborate fabrication, obtained for their own use and benefit
the sum of $960,000 from the company’s
bank account. Stuart obtained a blank cheque at the counter of the Bay Street
Branch of the Imperial Bank in Toronto and filled in the body of the cheque,
payable to his order, for $960,000. Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch signed the
cheque representing themselves on its face as president and treasurer of the
company. On May 1, 1957, this cheque was deposited to the credit of Stuart’s bank account at the
above-mentioned branch of the Imperial Bank. The real case for the Crown is
that the appellants stole this cheque.



These
dealings are recited at length in the address of the learned trial judge to the
jury and in the reasons for judgment delivered by Laidlaw J.A., for the Court
of Appeal. As full a recital, however, is unnecessary for the understanding of
the questions of law to be considered on this appeal. A simple and, I think, a
true outline of the case for the prosecution will sufficiently emerge from the
following summary of the interdependent and interlocked transactions carried
out by the appellants and their ultimate result, all of which happened within
the four days from April 29 to May 2, 1957.



Prior
to April 29, out of the 2,800,000 shares of the company issued and outstanding
in the hands of some 1,800 shareholders, the appellant Ben Smith, with his
brother Harry, owned or controlled 600,000 shares, of which 300,000 were in
escrow. The market price of the company’s shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange
had been steadily declining for some time and was about 47 cents per share. At
that price the total value of 600,000 shares was below $300,000. The company
had a credit balance of $577,000 in its account at the King and York Streets
Branch of the Imperial Bank

[Page 218]



in
Toronto and a readily marketable block of shares in New Chamberlain Petroleum
Company Limited and Spooner Oils Limited. The company had granted to Chapco
Investments Corporation irrevocable and still exercisable options to purchase
these shares. The exercise of the options would bring in $455,000 and thus
increase the company’s credit balance to over
one million dollars.










The
appellant Stuart, a resident of North Bay, Ontario, had for some years dealt in
mining claims and was at that time the owner of 21 unpatented mining claims
acquired by him within the year at a cost of $5,800 which, on the submission of
the Crown, represented the maximum value of these claims.



Knowing
that Ben Smith had considered selling his interest in the company, Stuart
sought and obtained the confirmation that the “Brilund deal” was still available. With the
assistance of two “finders”, he then invited to
Toronto the two appellants Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch and the brother of the
latter, Harold Rauch, who were all three associated in a company called Capital
Funding Corporation, with offices in New York State. Upon their arrival in
Toronto on April 30, these three were introduced to Smith and within 48 hours
the following interlocked and interdependent transactions were arranged and
completed:



(i) A
sale by Smith of the 600,000 share “control block” in the company to Stuart
or his associates or both for a price of $900,000, which was three times their
indicated value on the stock exchange. For the payment of this price, Stuart,
who had a credit balance of $16 in his account at the Bay Street Branch of the
Imperial Bank in Toronto, drew a cheque on that account for $900,000 payable to
the order of Ben Smith. He and Sol R. Rauch arranged with Udell, the Manager of
that Branch, to certify this cheque but not to deliver it until he had in his
possession a cheque for $960,000 expected by Stuart as a result of the
transaction mentioned in the next paragraph (ii) and a cheque for $1,010,000
which the company was to draw in its favour on the completion of the
transaction set out in paragraph (iii) in order to transfer its bank account
from the King and York Streets Branch to the Bay Street Branch.



(ii) A
sale by Stuart to the company of his 21 unpatented mining claims, having a
maximum value of $5,800 for the price of $960,000. In payment for these
claims, the cheque

[Page 219]



which
is the subject-matter of the amended count of the indictment was issued. Dated
May 1, 1957, it was drawn on the new account of the company at the Bay Street
Branch of the Bank in the amount of $960,000, made payable to the order of
Stuart and signed for the company by Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch, purporting to
act as president and treasurer.










(iii) A
sale by the company to Ben Smith of the Chamberlain and Spooner shares for
$460,856. Carried out without the knowledge of the Chapco Investments
Corporation, which had options on these shares, this sale was made on the
condition that, in the event of the exercise of the options, Smith would
surrender the shares to the optionee and be repaid by the company the amount
paid by him for their acquisition. This cheque for $460,356, issued by Smith in
favour of the company, was given by him to Findlay, his bank manager, with
instructions that it was to be used only if the sale of the 600,000 shares was
completed. Subsequently deposited to the King and York Streets Branch account
of the company, this cheque increased the credit balance of the company’s account to $1,010,000
before that account was transferred to the Bay Street Branch.



These
transactions were all interlocked and mutually dependent. Stuart’s cheque for $900,000 could
only be paid if the company’s cheque to his order for
$960,000 was deposited to his credit. The company’s cheque to Stuart for $960,000 could
only be paid if the credit balance of $577,000 in the company’s bank account was
sufficiently increased. This increase could only be achieved by the deposit to
the company’s account of the cheque for
$460,356 issued by Smith in favour of the company in payment of the Chamberlain
and Spooner shares; and Smith’s cheque could not be used
until the sale by him of his 600,000 shares was completed.



All
documents purporting to be signed by the company were signed by Schonbrun and
Sol R. Rauch representing themselves as its president and treasurer. The
corporate seal of the company was used wherever it was found necessary.
However, on the submission of the Crown, the minutes of the meetings purporting
to have been held on May 1, 1957 and recording the election of Schonbrun and
Sol R. Rauch as directors and as president and treasurer of the company, the
banking or other resolutions purporting to authorize

[Page 220]



them to
sign for the company in the capacity aforesaid, and all documents wherein the
veracity of these facts was represented, were false documents fabricated by the
appellants for the attainment of their dishonest purpose.










The
ultimate result of all these transactions, as related in respondent’s factum, was that Ben
Smith received $900,000 from Stuart for the sale of 600,000 shares of the
company, half of which were in escrow; Stuart received 200,000 shares of the
company, half of which were in escrow and retained about $4,000 cash in his
bank account; Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch or Capital Funding Corporation
received 400,000 shares of the company of which 200,000 were in escrow,
together with $6,000 in United States funds; and each of the two “finders” received $25,000. All the
moneys thus distributed were derived from the $960,000 obtained from the
company in exchange for the 21 unpatented mining claims of Stuart, valued at
$5,800.



Such,
in the main, are the facts relied on by the prosecution,—and which, for the purpose
of this appeal, are assumed to have been found by the jury—as justifying in law the
verdict of guilty returned against the appellants on the charge of having
stolen the cheque for $960,000, the property of the company.



Two of
the questions raised at the trial and on appeal were whether this cheque was
the property of the company or whether the company had any special property or
interest in it notwithstanding that its signatories had no authority to issue
or deliver the same. With respect to these questions, the learned trial judge
gave the following instructions to the jury:



Now,
I have explained the difference between the former indictment and the present
indictment, and I have explained that you cannot convict any accused for
stealing money or securities. All that is open to you now is to convict or
acquit with respect to stealing other property or a valuable security, the
property of Brilund.



The
charge, “a valuable security to the
value of $960,000 more or less, the property of Brilund…” would certainly include the cheque
for $960,000, Exhibit 49. If you have any doubt about that, it seems to me to
be concluded by another provision of the Criminal Code which reads in this way,
in part:



“In this Act…”



That
is, in the Criminal Code,



“a valuable security
includes an



order
for the payment of money.”

[Page 221]



Now,
the second point is this: did Brilund have any special property or interest in
that cheque? If you find that Schonbrun and Sol Rauch signed that particular
cheque purporting to act for Brilund, even without the authority of Brilund,
then I tell you that Brilund did have a special property or interest in it
before it was delivered to Stuart for negotiation. If you decide they signed it
in furtherance of a dishonest purpose, they were not acting as officers for
Brilund but in their own personal interests; but even so, Brilund would have a
special interest in that cheque, if for no other purpose, to try to get it back
before it was cashed. In any event, between the time the cheque was signed and
when it was handed over to Udell or Stuart it was in the possession of Brilund,
and that possession would be a special interest within the Code.”



On
appeal and with reference to the same matter, Laidlaw J.A., speaking for the
Court, said:










It
was contended first that the signatures Stanley I. Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch
on the cheque for $960,000 in favour of D. Charles Stuart were forgeries and
that their acts in signing the cheque did not constitute a corporate act of the
company; in other words there was no issue or delivery of the cheque in
question by the company as a corporate body; that the paper bearing the forged
signatures Stanley I. Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch was not a “valuable security” within the meaning of that
word as defined in sec. 2(42) of the Criminal Code as follows:



“a…order…for the payment of money.” I do not accept that
argument. In my opinion, Schonbrun and Rauch signed the cheque as officers of
the company with ostensible authority and thereafter the cheque became a
valuable security and the property of the company. Even if it be assumed that
Schonbrun and Rauch had no authority in law or in fact to sign the cheque,
nevertheless, in my opinion and in the opinion of the learned trial Judge, the
company had a special property or interest in it and which could be the subject
of theft.



The
questions of law upon which leave to appeal to this Court was granted are:



1.
Did the trial judge err in holding that Brilund Mines Limited did not consent
to the issue and delivery of the cheque for $960,000, or, alternatively, did he
err in holding that the cheque was nevertheless the property of Brilund Mines
Limited?



2.
Did the trial judge err in holding that there was no contract between Brilund
Mines Limited and Stuart for the transfer of the twenty-one mining claims?



3.
Did the trial judge err in holding that Brilund Mines Limited had a special
property or interest in the cheque, notwithstanding that the signatories to the
cheque had no authority to issue and deliver the same?



4.
Did the trial judge err in instructing the jury that the interest of the
corporation in seeing the cheque was not cashed constituted a special property
or interest in the cheque?



I find
it necessary to deal only with the two questions whether the learned trial judge
erred in holding, and instructing the jury, that the cheque for $960,000 was
the property of the company or that the company had a special

[Page 222]










property
or interest therein. With the greatest deference to the learned judges of the
two Courts below, my opinion is that there was error in both these instructions
to the jury. On the directions given to the jury as to each of the essential
elements of the offence of theft and as to the various circumstances in which a
person may be held to be a party to a criminal offence, the verdict of the jury
against the four appellants indicates that they were satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the cheque was an integral and necessary part of an
elaborate scheme of fraud to which all appellants were parties and that none of
the appellants could have thought that the company gave a corporate consent to
the purchase of these mining claims for $960,000 or to the signing and delivery
of the cheque purporting in appearance to be given in payment thereof. These
findings, involving each of the appellants as particeps criminis in this
fraudulent and indivisible scheme, constitute the background against which must
be considered the two questions of law to be determined.



On the
definition of theft given in s. 269 Cr.C., a thing cannot be said to have been
stolen unless it appears that the thing was taken or converted



…with intent to deprive…the owner of it or a person
who has a special property or interest in it, of the thing or of his property
or interest in it.



The
special property or interest, like the property itself, must be in the very
thing alleged to have been stolen. The interest a person may have in protecting
himself against loss or damage resulting from the use of a document forged by
and in the possession of another is neither property nor “special property or
interest” in the forged document. It
is also clear from the section that the property or the “special property or
interest” must exist at the time at
which the theft, either by taking or conversion, is committed.



It is
implicit in the findings of the jury that this cheque purporting to have been
made by the company was a false document (s. 268-e Cr.C.), known to be false by
the parties to this fraudulent scheme and made with the intent that it was to
be used or acted upon as genuine to the prejudice of the company. On these
findings this cheque was a forgery (s. 309 Cr.C.).

[Page 223]










The
company did not have any ownership or special property or interest in the blank
cheque picked up by Stuart at the public counter of the bank; nor could it have
any immediately prior to the instant at which, after signing it, Schonbrun and
Sol R. Rauch delivered it to Stuart. The company acquired no property and no “special property or
interest” in this cheque while it
was under the control of any of the parties to this fabrication nor upon its
delivery by Stuart to Udell. The fact that the name of the company was
fraudulently inscribed on this cheque in the circumstances and for the purposes
aforesaid, and that loss might result to the company, does not vest in the
company any proprietary rights or special property or interest therein. It
would be creating a new and strange mode of acquisition of property to hold
that if A’s signature is forged by B
on a document, A, for that sole reason, could, as owner, recover that document
from B. Had the appellants elected to destroy the cheque before handing it over
to Udell or had Udell destroyed it upon its receipt, nothing whatever could be
held to have been lost to the company or stolen from it. Possession of this
cheque was not at any material time that of the company. It was the possession
of those who created it to defraud the company. Possession of this cheque was
never entrusted to them by the company. And if it was not entrusted to them by
the company, they could not, while having it under their control, steal it by
conversion any more than by taking.



In The
King v. Phipoe[2], it was decided that to
obtain from a person his note of hand, by threats, is not a felonious stealing
of the note, for the reason that the note was never of value to or in the
peaceable possession of such person.



Being
of the view that the two questions of law extracted from the points on which
leave to appeal was given and set out above must be answered in the affirmative
and that there was no taking or conversion of this cheque by the appellants, I
would allow the appeals, quash the convictions and direct a verdict of
acquittal to be entered on count (1) of the indictment and the record to be
returned to the Clerk of Assize of the Supreme Court of Ontario at Toronto.

Appeals allowed,
convictions quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE,
PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Conviction for robbery—Substituted on
appeal for unlawful possession of property—Indictment dealt with robbery
alone—Whether unlawful possession an included offence—Criminal Code, 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, ss. 288, 296, 592.

[Page 230]

Appeals—Jurisdiction—Criminal law—Appeal by Attorney
General limited to pure question of law—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51,
s. 598.

The accused was charged with the offence of robbery under s.
288(b) of the Criminal Code and was convicted as charged. The
Court of Queen's Bench reached the conclusion that he was not guilty of
robbery, and, exercising its power under s. 592(3) of the Code, found him
guilty of unlawful possession under s. 296 in the view that this was an
included or lesser offence to that of robbery. The indictment had contained a
count for robbery only. The accused and the Attorney General were both granted
leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The accused's appeal should be allowed and the
conviction under s. 296 set aside; the appeal of the Attorney General should be
quashed for want of jurisdiction.

The authorities do not hold that receiving stolen goods is
included in the offence of robbery or theft, but merely that recent possession
of stolen goods, if unexplained to the satisfaction of the tribunal of fact,
may be evidence of robbery or theft. A count in an indictment is divisible and
where the commission of the offence charged includes the commission of another
offence, the accused may be convicted of the offence so
included if proven. Thus, a man charged with robbery may be found guilty of
theft, but a person charged with robbery may not be found guilty of receiving
stolen goods, as was done in this case, where the indictment contains a count
for robbery alone. Receiving stolen goods is a less serious offence, but is not
included in a charge of robbery. R. v. Louie Yee (1929), 1 W.W.R. 882,
applied.

As to the appeal of the Attorney General since the appeal was
based on a mixed question of law and fact and not on a pure question of law,
this Court was without jurisdiction to entertain it.

APPEALS by the accused and the Attorney General from a
judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, substituting a conviction of
unlawful possession for that of robbery. Appeal of accused allowed; appeal of
Attorney-General quashed.

R. Daoust, Q.C., for the accused.

Bruno J. Pateras, for the Attorney-General.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Taschereau J.:—The
appellant Fergusson was charged as follows under s. 288 (b) of the Criminal
Code:

William Fergusson, en la cité d'Outremont,
district de Montréal, le ou vers le 28 juillet 1959, a illégalement volé
Gustave St-Germain de billets de banque, des effets de commerce et 120 coffrets
de sûreté, le tout d'une valeur d'environ $50,000.00, la propriété de la Banque
Provinciale du Canada, et en même temps ou immédiatement avant ou après ledit
William Fergusson de s'être porté à des actes de violence contre ledit Gustave
St-Germain, commettant par là un vol qualifié, un acte criminel, contrairement à
l'article 288 (b) du Code Criminel.

[Page 231]

Section 288 (b) of the Criminal Code reads as
follows:

288. Every one commits a robbery who

(b) steals from any person
and, at the time he steals or immediately before or immediately thereafter,
wounds, beats, strikes or uses any personal violence to that person,

The case was heard in Montreal before His Honour Judge M. A.
Blain of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace, who found the accused guilty,
and sentenced him to be detained in the St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary for a
period of eight years.

The Court of Queen's Bench2
reached the conclusion that Fergusson was not guilty of robbery, but found him
guilty under s. 296 of the Criminal Code, which is to the effect that
every one commits an offence who has anything in his possession knowing that it
was obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by
indictment. The Court decided that receiving is an included or a lesser offence
to that of robbery, and that under s. 592, para. 3, of the Criminal Code, it
could substitute the verdict that in its opinion should have been found and
affirm the sentence passed by the trial judge or impose a sentence that is
warranted in law.

It is the contention of the appellant Fergusson that the
offence of which the Court of Queen's Bench found him guilty is not an offence
included in the offence of robbery, and that the Court had no power to
substitute a verdict of that kind for the one that was set aside by the Court
itself. It is therefore submitted that the appellant should be acquitted.

In the Court of Queen's Bench Mr. Justice Casey relied on Duplessis
v. The King3,
to support the view that an offence must be regarded as being included in
another, if the elements of the latter include those of the former. For the
same proposition, Mr. Justice Choquette cited Baker v. Regem4; Rex
v. Loughlin5;
Rex v. Seymour6;
Rex v. Siggins7.

[Page 232]

In Duplessis v. Regem, the
Court of Queen's Bench for the Province of Quebec ruled that obtaining money
under false pretence is of the same nature as theft, and that it is an included
offence, the only difference being the means adopted for committing the
offence.

In Baker v. Regem, it was
held that possession by the accused shortly after a burglary of goods, stolen
at the time of the burglary, if unexplained, is sufficient to warrant a
conviction of burglary or theft.

In Rex v. Loughlin, the Court of Criminal Appeal of
England held that where it is proved that premises have been broken into and
property stolen therefrom, and that very soon after the breaking the prisoner
has been found in possession of that property, it was open to the jury to find
the prisoner guilty of breaking and entering, and the jury should be so
directed. The Court of Criminal Appeal in The King v. Seymour applied
the Loughlin case.

In Rex v. Siggins, the Ontario Court of Appeal
reached the conclusion that the offence of theft, where the person charged is
the actual thief, necessarily involves the taking of possession by him of the
articles stolen, and the person found in possession of goods which he himself
has stolen, has also committed the offence of having in his possession goods
knowing them to have been stolen. The Crown of course is entitled to lay both
charges against him. If the jury convict of theft, they should not convict on
the charge of unlawful possession. If, however, they acquit on the charge of
theft, they may then consider and, if they see fit to do so, convict on the
other charge. It must be kept in mind that in Siggins the accused was
charged on two counts, one of theft and the other of unlawful possession.

These judgments do not hold that receiving stolen goods is
included in the offence of robbery or theft, but merely that recent possession
of stolen goods, if unexplained, to the satisfaction of the tribunal of fact,
may be evidence of robbery or theft. In Seymour it was held that there
should be two counts where the evidence is as consistent with larceny as with
receiving, and that the jury should be directed that it is for them to decide
whether the prisoner was the thief or whether he received a property from the
thief, and should be reminded that a man cannot receive property from himself.

[Page 233]

In the present case, there was only one count in the
indictment, and the charge was for robbery in violation of s. 288(b) of
the Criminal Code. A count in an indictment is divisible and where the
commission of the offence charged includes the commission of another
offence, whether punishable by indictment or on summary conviction, the accused
may be convicted of an offence so included that is proved, notwithstanding that
the whole offence that is charged is not proved, or of an attempt to commit an
offence so included. (Criminal Code 569). Thus, a man charged with
robbery may be found guilty of theft, but a person charged with robbery may not
be found guilty of receiving stolen goods, as was held by the Court of Queen's
Bench in the present instance. Receiving stolen goods is a less serious
offence, but is not included in a charge of robbery.

The count must therefore include but not necessarily mention
the commission of another offence, but the latter must be a lesser offence than
the offence charged. The expression ""lesser offence"" is a ""part
of an offence"" which is charged, and it must necessarily include some
elements of the ""major offence"", but be lacking in some of the
essentials, without which the major offence would be incomplete. Rex v.
Louie Yee8.

Fergusson's appeal should therefore be allowed and the
conviction against him set aside.

As to the appeal of the Attorney General who submits that
the judgment of the trial judge should be restored and that the accused should
be found guilty of robbery as charged, this Court has no jurisdiction to make
such an order. On June 26, 1961, Fergusson was granted leave to appeal by this
Court, and on the same date, the application of the Attorney General was also
granted. In the latter case, Mr. Justice Fauteux was ""dubitante"" as
to our jurisdiction but, nevertheless, leave was granted. Upon consideration
and a review of the whole case, the appeal of the Attorney General must be
quashed.

This Court has jurisdiction to entertain appeals by the
Attorney General in criminal matters under s. 598 of the Code. But, it is only
where a judgment of a Court of Appeal sets aside a conviction pursuant to an
appeal taken under para. (a) of s. 583, or dismisses an appeal taken
pursuant

[Page 234]

to para. (a) of s. 584. Paragraph (a) of s.
598 states that it must necessarily be on a pure question of law, and here, I
am of the opinion that the appeal of the Attorney General of Quebec is not
based on a pure question of law, but on a mixed question of law and fact. The
Court of Queen's Bench was not satisfied with the findings of the learned trial
judge, particularly that the proof of identification and some other facts,
while creating an atmosphere of suspicion, did not meet the test to which all
circumstantial evidence must be put. Both Courts had to weigh the evidence. The
trial judge found that there was direct and circumstantial evidence against the
accused, sufficient to find him guilty of the offence as charged. The Court of
Queen's Bench found that there was not.

In view of the decision of this Court in The King v.
Wilmot9,
it may be contended that this Court has no jurisdiction on the further
ground that the accused having been found guilty by the Court of Queen's Bench
of receiving stolen goods, was not acquitted within the meaning of s. 598 of
the Criminal Code. He was of course acquitted of robbery, but found
guilty of a different offence. However, in view of my conclusion that we are
not faced with a pure question of law, it becomes immaterial to discuss this
point any further.

Fergusson's appeal is therefore allowed, and the order of
the Court of Queen's Bench and the conviction are set aside. The appeal of the
Attorney General is quashed for want of jurisdiction.

Appeal of accused allowed;
Appeal of Attorney-General quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION.

Criminal law—Bribery—Bribes offered to Chief Building
Inspector of city— Whether proof that he was a municipal official—Whether
bribery related to official act—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s.
104—City Act, R.S.C. 1955, c. 42, s. 2(q).

The accused was charged under s. 104 of the Criminal Code with
offering bribes to W, the Chief Building Inspector for the City of Calgary, in
consideration for that official to fail to perform certain official acts. The
trial judge held that the bribes had been offered, but dismissed the charges on
the ground that there was no evidence that W had been appointed as an official
in accordance with s. 104 of the Code. The Court of Appeal set aside the
acquittal and found the accused guilty, as charged.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

The finding of fact by the trial judge that the bribes had
been offered having been unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeal and being
entirely consistent with the probabilities of the case, could not be disturbed.

The uncontradicted evidence of W that he was both the Chief
Building Inspector and a municipal official, coupled with the description of
his official activities contained in his own evidence and in that of the
appellant, and which were appropriate to those of a person holding office
within the dictionary sense of that term and under The City Act, R.S.C.
1955, c. 42, constituted prima facie evidence that he was a person who
held office under the City of Calgary and was a municipal official within the
meaning of s. 104 of the Code. It has been held on more than one occasion that
evidence of a person acting in an official capacity raises a rebuttal
presumption of his due appointment to that office. In this case there was not
only evidence of W having performed the duties, but there was also direct
evidence from W himself that he held the appointment and it was plain that the
appellant recognized that he represented the city in an official capacity.
There was evidence that the alleged bribes related to an official act.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division1,
reversing a judgment of Cairns J. and finding the accused guilty of having
offered bribes. Appeal dismissed.

Joseph Sedgwick, Q.C., and Robert H.
Barron, Q.C., for the appellant.

[Page 255]

H. J. Wilson, Q.C., and
R. P. Adolphe, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Ritchie J.:—This
is an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court
of Alberta2
allowing the appeal of the Crown from the judgment of Cairns J. whereby the
present appellant had been acquitted of the following two charges:

1. That he, at Calgary, in the
Judicial District of Calgary, on the 9th day of November, A.D. 1959, did offer
to Lawrence Walker, Chief Building Inspector for the City of Calgary, a
Municipal Official, the sum of $500 as consideration for the said official to
fail to perform an official act, contrary to Section 104 of the Criminal Code.

2. That he, at Calgary, in the
Judicial District of Calgary, on the 22nd day of August, A.D. 1960, did offer
to Lawrence Walker, Chief Building Inspector for the City of Calgary, a
Municipal Official, the sum of $300 as consideration for the said official to
fail to perform an official act, contrary to Section 104 of the Criminal Code.

Mr. Walker, who testified that during the years 1959-60
he held the position of Chief Building Inspector of the City of Calgary and was
a municipal official, recounted two separate occasions upon which the appellant
offered him money. The first incident took place on November 9, 1959, after
Walker, in his capacity as Chief Building Inspector, had condemned a building
owned by the appellant and one J. Singer; Walker states that at this time the
appellant said to him:

Allow this building to remain in occupancy for another year,
and forget about the condemning order, and if you will so do I will give you
$500.

and that he then took some money out of his pocket and
put it on the table between them. The second incident which took place on
August 22, 1960, concerned an order issued by one of the building inspectors in
Walker's department, notifying a ""builder-owner"" by the name of
Korytko that a building on his property was being over-developed in contravention
of a city by-law; in this regard Walker's best recollection of the relevant
portion of his conversation with the appellant is that ""he asked me if I
would overlook this over-development, and if I would overlook it he would give
me $300.""

[Page 256]

The appellant denied having made these offers, but the
learned trial judge, having heard all of the evidence, expressed himself as
follows:

I have no doubt whatsoever on the facts of this case that
the defendant offered the bribes alleged in the charges. It has been proved to
me to a moral certainty and beyond reasonable doubt. There is no question about
that at all. On that I accept the evidence of Mr. Walker, and I don't think I
need to go any further; it follows that if I accept his evidence I do not
accept other evidence.

It is contended on behalf of the appellant that because the
learned trial judge acquitted him on the ground that there was no evidence that
Mr. Walker had been appointed as an official in accordance with s. 104 of the Criminal
Code, it, must, therefore, follow that the above-quoted finding was obiter
and should be disregarded as having been intended to be ""a mere
gratuitous rebuke to the appellant"". This finding is also attacked on the
ground that no reasons are given for it and one of the grounds stated in the
notice of appeal to this Court is that the Appellate Division erred in law in
not holding that the trial judge had misdirected himself in determining the
credibility of witnesses without considering whether or not the evidence of the
witnesses whom he believed was in accordance with the probabilities of the
case.

In my view the excerpt above-quoted from the decision of the
learned trial judge constitutes a clear finding of fact for which it was
unnecessary to give any other reason than his acceptance of the evidence of
Walker. (See Lemay v. The King3).
As this finding has been unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeal and as
it is, in my view, entirely consistent with the probabilities of the case, I do
not think it can be disturbed.

In acquitting the appellant, the learned trial judge said:

However, I feel the Crown has failed to prove that in the
acts which Mr. Walker did, he was acting as an official in accordance with the
terms of Section 104. An official is one, as Mr. McGillivray points out, who is
appointed either by by-law or resolution of a city. There is no evidence before
me that Mr. Walker has been so appointed, and unless he does these acts as à
person holding office under a municipal government, and the office is proven in
the manner in which he is appointed, I think the charge must fail.

In setting aside the acquittals which were based on
this finding, Macdonald J.A., speaking on behalf of the Appellate Division,
held it to be ""abundantly proved that Walker was Chief Building Inspector
of the City of Calgary"" and that

[Page 257]

as such he ""held an office under a municipal
government, namely, the City of Calgary"". It followed from these
conclusions that the Appellate Division found him to be ""a municipal
official"" within the meaning of s. 104 of the Criminal Code, the
relevant portions of which read as follows:

104. (1) Every one who

(a) gives, offers or
agrees to give or offer to a municipal official, or

(b) being a municipal
official, demands, accepts or offers or agrees to accept from any person, a
loan, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind as consideration for the
official

* * *

(f) to perform or fail to
perform an official act, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for two years.

* * *

104. (3) In this section ""municipal official""
means a member of a municipal council or a person who holds an office under a
municipal government.

In conformity with the finding of the learned trial judge,
it was urged on behalf of the appellant that there was no evidence that Walker
was ""a municipal official"" within the meaning of this section or that
either of the alleged offers of money related to ""an official act"".
In support of this contention, it was said that the only evidence quoted by the
Appellate Division as a basis for its finding that Walker was a municipal
official was his affirmative answer to the question: ""Mr. Walker, during
the year 1959 and during the year 1960 and up to the present moment, were you a
municipal official?"" and that the finding cannot stand because this was an
improper and leading question, the answer to which involved the very question
of law which the trial court had to decide. I do not agree that this question
and answer formed the basis for the finding of the Appellate Division, but in
any event it is significant to note that no evidence was called to contradict
this answer and that the first question and answer on Walker's
cross-examination by appellant's counsel were:

Q. Mr. Walker, you have been the
Chief Building Inspector for a matter of some four years?

A. That is correct.

This latter statement which is uncontradicted, when
taken together with the extensive evidence illustrative of the manner in which
Walker carried out his duties in the inspection of buildings, appears to me to
fully justify the finding of the

[Page 258]

Court of Appeal that it is ""abundantly proved that
Walker was the Chief Building Inspector of the City of Calgary"". That this
evidence is of itself sufficient to support such a finding is shown by
reference to R. v. Gordon4,
Berryman v. Wise5
and other cases cited in Roscoe's Criminal Evidence, 16th ed.,
p. 11.

Certainly Walker's own evidence that he had been Chief
Building Inspector for some four years disposes of the argument advanced on
behalf of the appellant to the effect that the fact of Walker having signed
certain letters as ""Building Inspector"" simpliciter raised
some doubts as to whether he held the office of Chief Building Inspector.

It is, however, stated in the appellant's factum and was
strenuously argued on this appeal that the real issue in the present case

… is not whether Walker was the Chief Building Inspector,
but rather whether the Chief Building Inspector is a ""municipal
official"" within the strict narrow meaning of that term as defined in sec.
104(3).

This resolves itself into the question of whether the
Chief Building Inspector of the City of Calgary has been shown to be ""a
person who holds office under a municipal government"" and this in turn
depends in great degree on the meaning to be given to the word
""office"" as used in s. 104(3). Section 99(d) of the Criminal Code provides
that in Part III of the Code the word ""office"" includes:

(i) an office or appointment
under the government;

(ii) a civil or military
commission; and

(iii) a position or employment
in a public department.

I am satisfied, however, that this section does not
apply to an ""office"" under a municipal government, and that Macdonald J.A. was entirely justified in referring to the
definitions of ""office"" contained in the New Century and Shorter
Oxford English Dictionaries. The evidence in the present case is that the
duties of the Chief Building Inspector included the inspection of buildings for
the purpose of enforcing the by-laws of the city, and that as Chief Building
Inspector Walker had authority to supersede decisions made by building
inspectors in the Building Inspection Division. A position which involved such
authority, responsibility and

[Page 259]

public trust can, in my view, properly be described as
an ""office"" within the meaning of s. 104(3) of the Criminal Code.

The City Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 42, which appellant's
counsel describes as ""the Charter of the City of Calgary"" is advanced
as containing a number of sections which are of considerable help in
determining whether or not a ""Chief Building Inspector"" is an
""official"" of the City of Calgary. Section 2(q) of that Act reads as
follows:

""official"" includes a city commissioner, city
manager, city clerk, city treasurer, assessor, city solicitor, auditor,
comptroller, city engineer and any other official appointed by the council
to any office pursuant to the provisions of Part III, Division B; (The
italics are mine.)

It is provided in Part III, Division B (s. 55(1)) that
""such other officials as are deemed necessary for carrying into effect of
the provisions of the"" City Act are to be appointed by resolution
of the City Council and s. 81(1) requires that before entering upon the duties
of his office such an official shall make and subscribe the official oath,
solemn affirmation or declaration prescribed by the Oaths of Office Act. Although
The City Act does not expressly mention the office of Chief Building
Inspector, the provisions of ss. 385 to 389 deal with ""Control of
Buildings"" and s. 388(e) provides that the

… Council may pass by-laws

* * *

(e) appointing street and building inspectors and
defining their duties.

As the evidence makes it clear that there was a Chief
Building Inspector and as there was no evidence that he was not properly
appointed, it is to be assumed that the City Council of the City of Calgary
deemed it necessary to appoint and did appoint such an official for carrying
into effect the provisions of The City Act.

The substance of the appellant's argument in this regard is
that there was no evidence that Walker had been appointed by resolution or
by-law of the City Council. In my view, Walker's uncontradicted evidence that
he was both the Chief Building Inspector and a ""municipal official"",
coupled with the description of his official activities contained in his own
evidence and in that of the appellant, constitutes prima facie evidence
that he was a person who held office under the City of Calgary and was a
""municipal

[Page 260]

official"" within the meaning of s. 104(3). It has been
held on more than one occasion that evidence of a person acting in an official
capacity raises a rebuttable presumption of his due appointment to that office.
(See Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 15, p. 347,
para. 628; Phipson on Evidence, 9th ed., p. 120; R. v.
Smith6;
R. v. Goodman7;
R. v. Roberts8
and Doe v. Brawn9).
In this case there is not only evidence of Walker having personally
inspected buildings in the City of Calgary and of his having been the superior
officer in control of other building inspectors, but there is also direct
evidence from the official himself that he held the appointment, and it is
plain that the appellant recognized that he represented the City of Calgary in
an ""official capacity"". In the course of his direct examination, the
appellant, referring to Walker's having condemned another building, said that
he did whatever Walker asked him to do, and he was then asked:

Q. Why did you do what he asked
you?

A. Why? I couldn't help it.

Q. Not because he is a nice
fellow?

A. No.

Q. Just because you couldn't help
it?

A. I couldn't help it, it is the
City, you couldn't knock the City.

As to the contention that there was no evidence that
either of the alleged bribes related to an official act, it seems to me to be
sufficient to say that Walker's evidence, as to his refusal of the money
offered in November 1959, is that he told the appellant,

… that in my office as Building Inspector I had, it was my
duty to do what I believed was the proper thing to do in relation to the
building by-law regarding buildings.

and that when the appellant asked him in August 1960 to
overlook the ""over-development"" by the builder-owner Korytko he was,
in effect, asking him to countermand an order made by a building inspector who
was under his authority which order was enforceable by the laying of a charge
under By-law 4682 of the City of Calgary. In my opinion, if he had complied
with either of these requests, Walker would have failed to perform an official
act.

[Page 261]

The last error alleged in the decision of the Appellate
Division was that the findings by that Court that Walker was ""a municipal
official"" and that the bribes related to ""an official act"" were
findings of fact which that Court had no jurisdiction to make on an appeal by
the Crown. There was no conflict of evidence as to the fact that Walker was the
Chief Building Inspector and the alleged findings of fact, in my opinion,
constitute a decision of the Appellate Division that under the true
construction of the language used in s. 104(3) of the Criminal Code the
holder of such a position is a ""municipal official"" and the acts
performed in his capacity as such are ""official acts"" within the
meaning of those phrases as used in that section. This was a decision which the
Appellate Division had jurisdiction to make in this case.

I would dismiss this appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Summary
conviction—Plea of guilty—Whether right to appeal—Conditions precedent for
appeal—Whether accused bound by plea on trial de novo—Whether right to appeal
to Court of Appeal—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 708, 719, 720,
722(1)(a), 723, 727, 743(1)(a).

The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of impaired driving and
was summarily convicted by a magistrate. He appealed to the County Court, and,
on preliminary objection taken to the sufficienty of his grounds

[Page 287]

for appeal, the County Court judge dismissed his appeal
without hearing evidence or taking any plea. It was held that the grounds did
not disclose a sufficient degree of particularity to comply with s. 722(1) (a)
of the Code. The Court of Appeal allowed his appeal and referred the matter
back to the County Court. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

The taking of a plea from the accused forms no part of the
hearing of the trial de novo by way of appeal from a summary conviction
pursuant to s. 727 of the Code. Compliance with s. 722 is all that is required
to found jurisdiction. Consequently, the failure of the County Court judge, in
this case, to take a plea did not deprive him of jurisdiction. Although an
accused, after pleading guilty in the first instance, is bound by such plea in
the trial de novo, nevertheless he is not debarred from changing his
plea upon showing proper grounds for so doing. Thibodeau v. The Queen,
[1955] S.C.R. 646, applied.

The allegation, made in the present case, that ""there was
no legal evidence to support the conviction"" was a proper and sufficient
ground of appeal to comply with s. 722 of the Code on an appeal under that
section from a summary conviction.

The accused had a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal when
the County Court judge dismissed his appeal, as he did in this case, on
preliminary objections, without a trial de novo, by virtue of s. 743(1)
(a).

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing a judgment of Remnant Co. Ct. J. and
referring the matter back to the County Court. Appeal dismissed.

J. J. Urie, for the
appellant.

R. R. Maitland, for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—In the present case
the respondent, having been convicted and sentenced under Part XXIV of the Criminal
Code by W. G. Harris, Esq., a Police Magistrate in and for the District of
Powell River, for driving a motor vehicle whilst his ability to do so was
impaired, appealed such conviction to the County Court of Vancouver on the
following grounds:

1. The said conviction was
against the law and the weight of evidence.

2. The said conviction was
contrary to law.

3. There was no legal
evidence to support the said conviction.

[Page 288]

Preliminary objection having been
taken to the sufficiency of these grounds, the learned County Court judge
dismissed the said appeal without hearing evidence or taking any plea, holding
that the said grounds did not disclose a sufficient degree of particularity to
comply with the requirements of s. 722(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code.

From this decision the respondent
gave notice seeking leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia,
and upon such leave having been granted the appeal was duly heard and allowed
and the matter was referred back to the County Court by order of the said Court
of Appeal[2].

From this latter order the
appellant sought leave to appeal to this Court, and by order dated June 25,
1959, such leave was granted upon the following grounds:

1. Did the Court of Appeal
of British Columbia err in holding that the Notice of Appeal under
section 722 of the Criminal Code of the respondent from his conviction
by the magistrate to the County Court of Vancouver set out the grounds of
appeal in sufficient particularity?

2. Did the failure of the
County Court to take a plea deprive it of jurisdiction?

3. Was there a right of
appeal by the respondent to the Court of Appeal when the County Court had
dismissed the appeal to it on preliminary objections without a trial de
novo?

Although the first of these
grounds was virtually abandoned by the appellant at the argument before this
Court and counsel for the appellant found himself in agreement with the
decision of the Court of Appeal giving a negative answer to the question raised
by the second ground, this Court was nonetheless invited to express its views
concerning the nature of the right of appeal for which provision is made in ss.
720 to 726 inclusive of the Criminal Code and the type of trial
contemplated by the provisions of s. 727. It is, therefore, desirable to make
some general observations before dealing specifically with the particular
questions raised in this appeal.

Section 720 of the Criminal
Code reads in part as follows:

Except where otherwise
provided by law.

(a) the defendant in
proceedings under this Part may appeal to the appeal court

(i) from a conviction or
order made against him, or

(ii) against a sentence
passed upon him; and

[Page 289]

(b) the informant,
the Attorney General or his agent in proceedings under this Part may appeal to
the appeal court

(i) from an order dismissing
an information, or

(ii) against a sentence
passed upon a defendant ….

The Appeal Court
referred to in this section means one of the Courts specified in s. 719. In the
case of the Province of British Columbia this means the ""County Court of the County in which the cause of
the proceedings arose"". In my opinion, the provisions of this section, unless
cut down by some other provisions of the Criminal Code, accord a right
of appeal to any ""defendant in proceedings under this Part [Part
XXIV]"" irrespective of the nature of the plea taken in the Court of first
instance and limited only by the necessity of complying with the following
conditions:

722. (1) Where an appeal is
taken under section 720, the appellant shall

(a) prepare a notice
of appeal in writing setting forth

(i) with reasonable
certainty the conviction or order appealed from or the sentence appealed
against, and

(ii) the grounds of appeal; ….

As is indicated by Fauteux J.,
speaking on behalf of the majority of the Court in Dennis v. The Queen[3],
compliance with these provisions is not only a condition precedent to the
exercise of the right of appeal under s. 720 but it is the very foundation upon
which the jurisdiction of the Appeal Court must and does rest as can be seen
from the opening words of s. 723 which read as follows:

723. (1) Where an appellant
has complied with section 722, the appeal court or a judge thereof shall set
down the appeal for hearing at a regular or special sittings thereof and the
clerk of the appeal court shall post, in a conspicuous place in his office, a
notice of every appeal that has been set down for hearing and notice of the
time when it will be heard.

(2) No appeal shall be set
down for hearing at a time that is less than ten days after the time when
service was effected upon the respondent of the notice referred to in paragraph
(b) of subsection (1) of section 722, unless the parties or their
counsel or agents otherwise agree in writing.

As is noted by Sheppard J.A., in
the course of the decision rendered by him on behalf of the Court of Appeal, it
is well to appreciate the significance of the last quoted section, requiring as
it does that the Appeal Court or a judge thereof ""shall set down the
appeal for hearing"" upon being satisfied that s. 722 has been complied
with. Such power to ""set down the appeal for hearing"" presupposes
jurisdiction to hear it

[Page 290]

and in my view compliance with s.
722 is all that is required to found jurisdiction in the Appeal Court
and the ""plea"" which, if it were required, would be taken at a later
stage forms no part of the material upon which the jurisdiction of the Court is
based.

The nature of the hearing of an
appeal under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code is described in s. 727 and
conflict of opinion has been expressed between the Courts of last resort in
some of the provinces of Canada as to the effect of the following provisions of
subs. (1) of that section:

727. (1) Where an appeal has
been lodged in accordance with this Part from a conviction or order made
against a defendant, or from an order dismissing an information, the appeal
court shall hear and determine the appeal by holding a trial de novo,
and for this purpose the provisions of sections 701 to 716, insofar as they are
not inconsistent with sections 720 to 732, apply, mutatis mutandis.

The difficulty which has given
rise to much of the conflict is centered about the question of whether the
words ""appeal by holding a trial de novo"" are intended to
describe ""an appeal"" in the sense of a review of the proceedings and
decision in the Court of first instance as in the case of an appeal to a
provincial Court of Appeal from conviction for an indictable offence or whether
they are more descriptive of a ""new trial"" such as that which is held
pursuant to order of the Court of Appeal after a conviction has been quashed.

As was said by Hogg J.A. in R.
v. Crawford[4],
the outstanding distinction between the trial de novo contemplated by s.
727 and the new trial which may be ordered by the Court of Appeal is that in
the latter case the conviction has been quashed before the new trial
starts whereas in the former the conviction remains outstanding, subject,
however, to being reversed by the Appeal Court on evidence called afresh or
indeed on entirely new evidence. In the one case, the conviction has gone while
in the other it is under review by fresh eyes in the light of fresh evidence.

On the other hand, the
distinction between ""an appeal by holding a trial de novo"" and
an appeal to the provincial Court of Appeal is that although the object of both
is to determine whether the decision appealed from was right or wrong, in the
latter case the question is whether it was right

[Page 291]

or wrong having regard to the
evidence upon which it was based, whereas in the former the issue is to be
determined without any reference, except for purposes of cross-examination, to
the evidence called in the Court appealed from and upon a fresh determination
based upon evidence called anew and perhaps accompanied by entirely new
evidence. It is to be borne in mind, of course, that under the provisions of s.
727(2) the Appeal Court may, under the circumstances therein specified,
treat the evidence of any witness in the Court below as having the same force
and effect as if the witness had given evidence before the Appeal Court.
This can be done by consent of both the appellant and the respondent or if a witness
cannot be reasonably obtained or if the evidence is purely formal or the Court
is otherwise satisfied that this procedure will not prejudice the opposite
party. When this procedure is followed, the evidence so introduced is to be
treated by the Court of Appeal in all respects as if it were being actually
given for the first time before that Court and all objections are available to
either party in the same way that they would be if the evidence was being given
vivâ voce for the first time.

A further difficulty which has
given rise to some conflict is the question of whether the accused should be
required to plead at a ""trial de novo"". This difficulty has
been occasioned by the fact that s. 708 which in terms requires that the
defendant ""shall be asked"" to plead is included in the group of
sections (701 to 716) which apply to a trial de novo ""insofar as
they are not inconsistent with sections 720 to 732"" (see s. 722).

While this point is not directly
raised in the grounds specified in this appeal, it forms such an integral part
of the whole question that it is as well to consider it here.

There can be no trial in the
strict sense of that word until issue has been joined and as issue is not
joined in a criminal case until the plea is entered the meaning of
""trial"" as used in the phrase ""trial de novo"" in s.
727 would seem both logically and grammatically to indicate the proceedings
after the entry of the plea. This is the meaning which was attributed to its
use in the other sections of Part XXIV which were under consideration in The
Queen v. Larson[5],

[Page 292]

per Abbott J., and it should, therefore, be construed as
connoting ""the hearing alone"" exclusive of the plea and arraignment.
A consideration of proceedings on trial by jury brings to mind the fact that
the trial proper does not start until the accused is given in charge to the
jury which stage is, of course, not reached until after the plea has been taken
and the adoption of this more restricted meaning of the word ""trial""
has been widely accepted in our own Courts for many years. See In re Walsh[6],
approved in Giroux v. The King[7],
per Anglin J., and Clement v. The Queen[8].
This is also the effect of what was said by Hogg J.A. in R. v. Crawford,
supra. That the same connotation of the word ""trial"" applies to
its use in relation to proceedings before a magistrate in England may be seen
from the decision of Lord Goddard in R. v. Craske[9],
and it is also to be noted that the plea is not required when a new trial is
held on appeal from a conviction of an indictable offence. See Welch v. The
King[10],
per Fauteux J.

This interpretation is borne out
by a consideration of the anomaly which would be created if an accused were required
to plead to a charge in respect of which he had already been convicted in the
course of a proceeding taken for the purpose of bringing such conviction into
question and throughout the whole of which the conviction entered upon the
earlier plea remains outstanding. These considerations seem to indicate that
the procedure for taking a plea which is outlined in s. 708 is indeed
inconsistent with the provisions of s. 727 and, therefore, inapplicable to the
hearing for which provision is made in the latter section. This does not mean
that an accused who has pleaded guilty in the Court of first instance is
debarred from changing his plea upon showing proper grounds for so doing. He
stands before the Appeal Court in exactly the same position procedurally as he
stood before the magistrate after having made his plea and he may be allowed to
change that plea. See Thibodeau v. The Queen[11],
per Cartwright J. at 653 and Fauteux J. at 657.

[Page 293]

As to the first ground of appeal
specified in the order granting leave to appeal to this Court, counsel for the
appellant stated during the argument that after more mature consideration he
had concluded, with respect to this ground, that the third ground of the
respondent's original notice of appeal to the County Court was a proper one,
namely, ""There was no legal evidence to support the conviction"". I am
in entire agreement with this conclusion as were the learned judges of the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia and no further comment is necessary on this
phase of the matter in this case.

The second ground of appeal to
this Court, ""Did the failure of the County Court to take a plea deprive it
of jurisdiction?"" is in somewhat the same category as the first because in
this regard counsel for the appellant agrees with the conclusion reached by the
learned judges of the Court of Appeal with which conclusions, as can be seen, I
am also in agreement for the reasons above stated which are substantially the
same as those expressed by Sheppard J.A., speaking on behalf of the majority of
that Court.

The third ground of appeal was
fully argued and involves a consideration of the meaning to be attached to the
words used in s. 743(1) (a) of the Criminal Code. These
words are:

743. (1) An appeal to the
court of appeal, as defined in section 581 may, with leave of that court, be
taken on any ground that involves a question of law alone, against

(a) a decision of a
court in respect of an appeal under section 727….

It was argued on behalf of the
appellant that when an Appeal Court, within the meaning of s. 719, has decided
that it has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal under s. 727 because the notice
of appeal required by s. 722 is inadequate, it has not, by so doing, made a
decision ""in respect of an appeal under section 727"" at all, but
rather one in respect of s. 722 from which there is no provision for appeal,
and that the only remedy lies in a writ of mandamus. It seems to me that
the time for making such a decision is the time when the appeal is to be set
down for hearing as required by s. 723, and the nature of the decision to be
made at this time is whether or not all formalities have been complied with so
as to make it necessary to ""set down the appeal for hearing 

[Page 294]

at a regular or special
sittings"" of the Appeal Court. The ""hearing"" there referred to is
obviously a hearing under s. 727, and the decision as to whether or not the
Court will hear an appeal under that section certainly seems to me to be
""a decision of a court in respect of an appeal under section 727"". As
was indicated by Fauteux J. at the hearing of this appeal, this construction is
borne out by the French version of s. 743(1) (a) which reads as
follows:

743. (1) Un appel à la cour
d'appel, telle qu'elle est définie dans Particle 581, peut, avec la permission
de cette cour, être interjeté, pour tout motif qui comporte une question de
droit seulement,

(a) de toute décision
d'une cour relativement à un appel prévu par l'article 727….

In view of all the above, it will
be seen that I am of opinion that the notice of appeal of the respondent from
his conviction by the magistrate set out the grounds of appeal in sufficient
particularity, that the failure of the County Court to take a plea did not
deprive it of jurisdiction, that the respondent had a right of appeal to the
Court of Appeal when the County Court dismissed his appeal on preliminary
objection and that this appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION.

Criminal law—Common gaming houses—Slot machines—Whether
bowling machine giving amusement and chance of free game depending on skill a
""slot machine"" contrary to the Criminal Code, 1953–54 (Can.), c. 51,
s. 170.

The accused's premises contained an automatic machine whereby
a person, on the insertion of a coin, could play a bowling game by aiming a
device which propelled balls toward the pins at the other end of the machine.
The skill used in playing the game was in aiming the mechanical bowler. If the
scoring of points had a sufficient margin the operator became entitled to a
free game. On a charge of keeping a common gaming house for the purpose of
gambling contrary to the Criminal Code, the respondent was acquitted by the
magistrate and this judgment was confirmed by the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court on an equal division. The Crown appealed to this Court.

Held (Fauteux and Judson JJ. dissenting): The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Taschereau, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: This machine
is not a slot machine within the meaning of the Act. It is used for vending
""services"", and ""services"" include ""amusements"". Laphkas
v. The King, [1942] S.C.R. 84, applied.

What the law forbids is a machine that by electronic devices
or other means, defeats the ability of the player to obtain favourable results.
To be within the law, the player must control the game, and not be at the mercy
of a machine where skill is not the only element.

When the Act speaks of a matter of chance or uncertainty to
the operator, it refers obviously to the machine itself which may produce
different results independently of the skill of the player. Laphkas v. R.,
supra; R. v. Isseman, [1956] S.C.R. 798; Regent Vending Machines v.
Alberta Vending Machines, [1954] S.C.R. 98, referred to.

The privilege of a free game is the result of skill in
operating rather than an element of chance or uncertainty due to the machine
and therefore does not make the machine unlawful.

Per Fauteux and Judson JJ., dissenting: It
is an offence if the result of one of any number of operations of the machine
is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the operator. Chance or uncertainty to
the operator must be present unless he can, without possibility of failure,
achieve any result that he wishes or unless the result is automatic.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division1, affirming, on an equal division, the
acquittal of the accused. Appeal dismissed, Fauteux and Judson JJ. dissenting.

[Page 899]

S. A. Friedman, for
the appellant.

T. A. Miller, for the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was
delivered by

Taschereau J.:—The
charge against the respondent is that on the 26th day of February, 1959, at the
City of Edmonton, he did unlawfully keep a disorderly house, to wit: a common
gaming house for the purpose of gambling contrary to the Criminal Code. His
Honour Magistrate Barclay acquitted the respondent, and this judgment was
confirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta2,
on an equal division, Mr. Justice McBride having died before the rendering of
the judgment.

The provisions of the Criminal Code which have to be
examined for the purpose of determining this case, are the subsections of section
170. This section reads as follows:

170. (1) For the purpose of proceedings under this Part, a
place that is found to be equipped with a slot machine shall be conclusively
presumed to be a common gaming house.

(2) In this section ""slot machine"" means any
automatic machine or slot machine

(a) that is used or
intended to be used for any purpose other than vending merchandise or services;
or

(b) that is used or
intended to be used for the purpose of vending merchandise or services if

(i) the result of one of any
number of operations of the machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the
operator,

(ii) as a result of a given
number of successive operations by the operator the machine produces different
results, or

(iii) on any operation of the
machine it discharges or emits a slug or token.

It was admitted at the trial that when the machine was
seized, it was in good operating condition, and was on the premises of the
accused. The only question that arises and which has to be decided is whether
or not this ""William Ten Strike"" bowling machine is a ""slot
machine"" contrary to the above section of the Criminal Code.

This alleged slot machine, as found by the learned trial
judge, is operated as follows, and this is not contested by the appellant.
""There is a mechanical man at one end, and when ten cents is inserted in
the slot, a ball comes out and comes before the man's hand. The man can be
turned through an angle and is aimed at the pins which are placed in the form
of a triangle at the other or far end. The base

[Page 900]

of the triangle is at the far end of the rectangle, with the
apex facing the ""man"" and the player. After the man is aimed a
plunger is pushed forward and the arm of the man moves and propels the ball
forward. The direction of the ball is determined by the position of the man as
determined by the player."" The trial judge came to the conclusion that the
skill used in playing the game is in aiming the man or bowler.

If the aim is accurate, the operator will get a
""strike"", and if he gets twelve strikes in a row, his score will be
300, which is the maximum that can be obtained. If the aim is inaccurate, the
score will be lower. A better player will of course be the winner.

I do not think that this machine is a ""slot
machine"" within the meaning of the Act. It is used for vending
""services"" and, ""services"" include ""amusements"". (Laphkas
v. The King3).

This machine, I believe, procures an innocent amusement to
the operator, and this is not within the ban of the Act. It is an automatic
machine used for vending services, and it does not emit a slug or token.
Of course, under s. 170, a machine used for vending services or amusements
will be illegal, if the result produced by the machine is a matter of chance or
uncertainty to the operator, or if different results as a consequence of the
adjustment of the mechanism are obtained. But this has nothing to do with the
skill of the operator and is quite independent of the ability of the player to
hit the target if he aims properly.

What the law forbids is a machine that by electronic devices
or other means, defeats the ability of the player to obtain favourable results.
To be within the law, the player must control the game, and not be at the mercy
of a machine where skill is not the only element, as it is in the present case.

When the Act speaks of a matter of chance or uncertainty
to the operator, it refers obviously to the machine itself which may
produce different results independently of the skill of the player. I think
this is the letter and spirit of the law. (Vide: Laphkas v. R., supra; R. v.
Isseman4; Regent Vending Machines v. Alberta
Vending Machines5).

[Page 901]

Skill might be successful or not, it may produce uncertain
results, as in baseball, football, trap or skeet shooting, golf or hockey, but
the uncertainty then comes from the player, and not from the mechanism of a
machine which nullifies, the ability of the player.

I would hate to think that the law intends to brand as a
criminal a Canadian citizen who, for a dime, procures an innocent amusement to
the public where there is no element of gambling or hazard.

Of course, I have in mind a machine that functions properly
and not a machine which does not operate normally, and where the skill of the
player might be defeated. I finally believe, as did the learned Chief Justice
of Alberta, that if the scoring of points shows that the operator has a
sufficient margin, he is entitled to play another game without further payment
of money for the operation. This feature can be eliminated by an adjustment of
the scoring mechanism. As found by the courts below, the privilege so given is
the result of skill in operating rather than an element of chance or
uncertainty due to the machine, and does not make the machine unlawful.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Fauteux and Judson JJ. was delivered by

Judson J. (dissenting):—For
the reasons given by Porter J.A. in the Appellate Division, I would allow this
appeal. While there is some element of skill involved in the operation of the
machine, in that one player may obtain a better result than another, it is
still an offence if the result of one of any number of operations of the
machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the operator. Chance or
uncertainty to the operator must be present unless he can, without any
possibility of failure, achieve any result that he wishes or unless the result
is automatic. I do not think that uncertainty to the operator can be given the
restricted meaning set out in the reasons of my brother Taschereau.

Appeal dismissed, Fauteux and
Judson JJ.
dissenting.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA APPELLATE
DIVISION.

Criminal law—Lotteries—Scheme of distributing by chance
questionnaire forms to be completed and returned for value—Whether scheme for
the disposition of property by chance—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss.
2(32)(a), 179(1).

The respondent corporation distributed over 100,000 packages
of its soap products, each package being marked with a five star seal. The
corporation advertised to the public that it had enclosed a questionnaire form
in 10,000 of these containers. The questionnaire sought certain information
from the recipient which would be valuable to the respondent in the operation
of its business. A recipient who completed the form and mailed it to the
respondent was entitled to a payment of $5 from the respondent.

The corporation was charged with three offences under s.
179(1) of the Criminal Code, the lotteries section. All three charges
were dismissed in magistrate's court, and this decision was sustained on appeal
to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on equal division. The Crown
appealed to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

The contention that what was disposed of by lot or chance
under the respondent's scheme was the sum of $5 failed. It was not the money
that was disposed of by chance, but a form by means of which the recipient
thereof could, on compliance with the required conditions, obtain the payment.

An uncompleted questionnaire form is not an instrument
""giving a right to receive money"" within the definition of property
in s. 2(32) (a) of the Criminal Code. In itself the questionnaire
created no right to property.

[Page 909]

The services which the recipient of the form was asked to
perform were not a mere formality, serving as a device seeking to avoid the
application of s. 179(1) of the Code.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division1, affirming, on an equal division, the
acquittal of the accused. Appeal dismissed.

S. A. Friedman, for the appellant.

C. W. Clement, Q.C., and B. M. Osler, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Martland J.:—The
respondent is a corporation which manufactures soap products. On April 11,
1959, it advertised by newspaper, in Edmonton, that it had enclosed a
questionnaire in 10,000 packets of its products, distributed across Canada, and
identified by a five star seal on the container. Over 100,000 packages of soap
products were distributed in Canada in the containers marked with the five star
seal. A person who obtained a questionnaire, by purchase of a package
containing it, could, by completing and mailing it to a specified address,
receive the sum of $5. The scheme was also advertised on television.

The questionnaire sought information from the recipient of
it, among other things, as to the product in the package in which the
questionnaire was found, the type of washing machine used, the laundry product
mostly used, whether bleach was used in laundering, how certain kinds of
garments were washed and concluded with a question as to the ways in which the
respondent's laundry, dish washing, and house cleaning products could be
improved.

The respondent was charged with three offences under s.
179(1) of the Criminal Code. The first was that it ""did unlawfully
conduct a certain scheme for the purpose of determining who, or the holders of
what lots, tickets, numbers or chances, are the winners of any property so
proposed

[Page 910]

to be advanced, loaned, given, sold or disposed of, to wit:
Questionnaire forms each of which when completed and returned to the said
Company had a value of $5. Contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada."" The
second and third charges were that the respondent unlawfully advertised and that
it unlawfully caused to be advertised this scheme.

Section 179(1) of the Criminal Code provides:

179(1) Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for two years who

(a) makes, prints,
advertises or publishes, or causes or procures to be made, printed, advertised
or published, any proposal, scheme or plan for advancing, lending, giving,
selling or in any way disposing of any property, by lots, cards, tickets, or
any mode of chance whatsoever;

* * *

(d) conducts or
manages any scheme, contrivance or operation of any kind for the purpose of
determining who, or the holders of what lots, tickets, numbers or chances, are
the winners of any property so proposed to be advanced, loaned, given, sold or
disposed of;

* * *

The relevant definition of ""property"" is contained
in para. (a) of subs. (32) of s. 2 of the Criminal Code, which
reads:

(32) ""property"" includes

(a) real and
personal property of every description and deeds and instruments relating to or
evidencing the title or right to property, or giving a right to recover or
receive money or goods,

All three charges were dismissed by the learned Magistrate
who tried the case. In the written reasons for his decision he makes the
following findings:

Therefore, to sum up, I find that the forms were sent out in
these packages, to various areas throughout the whole of Canada, that there was
a sincere effort on the part of the company to ascertain the desires and
opinions of the housewives who used their property with the intention of improving
the property, the packages of soap in this case. I find that the reward was not
unduly high, and that it didn't vary, and that the price of the packages didn't
vary and that no extra money had to be sent in with the form, that once the
questionnaire form was sent in, duly answered by the person sending it, there
was no lottery or no choice of who would

[Page 911]

win. It was a conscientious effort on the part of the
company to obtain the views of the people using their product. I don't think
there was any sham about the whole proceedings, and I think that the company
have proved this in their evidence by calling the member of the research
department of their firm to show that the answers received were treated
seriously, …

His decision was sustained on appeal to the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta2 on an equal division.
The appellant has appealed from that judgment.

It is not questioned that the distribution of the
questionnaire forms was determined by chance. The question is whether, because
of that fact, the respondent's scheme was one for the disposition of property
by chance. This involves the question as to what it was that the purchaser of a
five star seal package, which contained a form, had obtained.

The contention of the appellant is that, under the
respondent's scheme, what was disposed of by lot or chance was the sum of $5.
It was contended that the acquisition of the questionnaire form gave to the
recipient a right to receive the sum of $5 from the respondent.

The obtaining of a form in a package did not, however,
immediately entitle the recipient to the payment. Before he could claim the
payment he was required to complete the form and to mail it to the respondent.
That which was disposed of by chance was not, therefore, the money, but a form,
by means of which, on compliance with the required conditions, he could obtain
the payment.

This brings us to the question as to whether an uncompleted
questionnaire form is an instrument ""giving a right to receive money""
within the paragraph defining ""property"" in the Criminal Code.

I do not think that it was. Assuming that the form was an
instrument, the questionnaire uncompleted, or completed but not mailed, did not
confer any right to receive a $5 payment. The form gave to the recipient an
opportunity

[Page 912]

to obtain the payment by performing the stipulated services;
i.e., completion and mailing of the form. The questionnaire constituted nothing
more than an offer, but the right to receive the payment could only arise by
contract, which would result if the offer were accepted in the manner which it
had indicated, which involved the furnishing of information to the respondent.
In itself it created no right to property.

As previously pointed out, the learned Magistrate has found,
and the evidence supports the finding, that the requirement for the completion
and mailing of the questionnaire form was not a sham. The services which the
recipient of the questionnaire form was asked to perform were not a mere
formality, serving as a device seeking to avoid the application of s. 179(1) of
the Criminal Code. On the contrary, the evidence, accepted by the
learned Magistrate, establishes that the whole plan was a genuine effort on the
part of the respondent to obtain information which would be valuable to it in
the operation of its business. For those services the respondent agreed to make
a standard payment of $5 in each case.

For these reasons it is my opinion that the appeal should be
dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Robbery with
violence—Acquittal on ground of drunkenness rendering accused incapable of
forming specific intent to commit robbery—Omission of Crown to raise issue of.
included offence of common assault at trial—Drunkenness as a defence to a
charge of common assault—Mens rea—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51,
ss. 288, 569(1) (a).

Respondent was charged under s. 288 of the Criminal Code
with robbery with violence, and was acquitted by the trial judge on the ground
that he was so intoxicated as to be incapable of forming the specific intent to
commit robbery. In appealing this decision the Crown contended that the trial
judge did not consider the included offence of common assault and, in the
result, failed to direct himself with respect to the divisibility of the charge
laid and to the incidence of drunkenness as a defence to a charge of common
assault, as distinguished from a charge of robbery with violence. The appeal
was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, and the Crown then sought and obtained
the leave of this Court to appeal from that judgment.

Held (Locke J. dissenting) : The appeal should
be allowed, the verdict of acquittal with respect to common assault set aside,
and a verdict of guilty of that offence entered.

Per Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: As provided by s.
569(1) (a) of the Code, when the commission of the offence charged, as
described in the enactment creating it or as charged, includes the commission
of another offence, the charge is divisible, and the accused may be convicted
of the offence so included, if proved, notwithstanding that the whole offence
that is charged is not proved. The King v. Wong On (No. 3), 8 C.C.C.
423; Rex v. Stewart, 71 C.C.C. 206, referred to.

In a like situation, the offence included is part of the case
which the accused has to meet under the law. The mere omission of the Crown to
raise the issue cannot per se and without more relieve the trial judge
from the duty imposed upon him under the section. The words ""may
convict"" give an authority which must be exercised when the
circumstances described in the section are present. Rex v. Bishop of Oxford,
(1879) 4 Q.B.D. 245, applied; Wexler v. His Majesty The King, [1939]
S.C.R. 350, distinguished.

Contrary to what is the case in the crime of robbery, where,
with respect to theft, a specific intent must be proved, there is no specific
intent necessary to constitute the offence of common assault. Here the manner
in which force was applied by the respondent to his victim was not accidental
or unintentional. Re Beard, [1920] A.C. 479, referred to.

[Page 872]

The finding of the trial judge that the accused had not the
capacity to form the specific intent to commit robbery did not justify the
conclusion reached in appeal that he could not then have committed the offence
of common assault.

Per Martland and Ritchie JJ.: Pursuant to s. 569 of the
Code the trial judge was under a duty to consider the included offence of
assault, and the fact that his report to the Court of Appeal contained a
statement ""that common assault was not raised by Crown counsel at the
trial"" is not sufficient ground for concluding that he did not consider
this offence.

The duty which rests upon the trial judge to consider all
included offences of which there is evidence can, in no way, be affected by the
fact that the Crown has omitted to make reference to such offences, and it
follows that where the trial judge has wrongly applied the law applicable to an
included offence the Crown is not deprived of its statutory right of appeal
because of its omission at trial to address the Court on the matter.

The offence of robbery requires the presence of the kind of
intent and purpose specified in ss. 269 and 288 of the Code, but the use of the
word ""intentionally"" in defining ""common assault"" in s.
230(a) is exclusively referable to the physical act of applying force to
the person of another.

Per Locke J., dissenting: The Crown's contention
that where a trial judge hearing a criminal charge fails not to deal with, but
to consider independently, an offence included in the offence specifically
charged, and this is done with the approval of counsel for the Crown, the
provisions of s. 584 of the Code may be invoked to again place the accused in
jeopardy, should be rejected.

The right of the Crown to appeal, while given in clear terms,
may not be exercised in all circumstances, as was decided in Wexler v. R.,
supra. To construe the section differently would mean that accused persons
could be subjected to a succession of trials for the same offence on grounds
that were not advanced at the first and succeeding previous trials, and which
the accused person had not accordingly attempted to meet. The King v. Miles,
(1890) 24 Q.B.D. 423, referred to.

Although s. 569 imposes a duty upon the judge to consider the
included offence of assault, his failure to do so does not render the
proceeding defective and a new trial necessary. The King v. Wong On, supra,
applied; The Queen v. Bishop of Oxford, supra, referred
to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] affirming a judgment of Morrow C.C.J. Appeal
allowed, Locke J. dissenting.

J. Urie, for the
appellant.

E. P. Newcombe and R.
Cleary, for the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau and
Fauteux JJ. was delivered by

[Page 873]

FAUTEUX J.:—Respondent was
charged with robbery with violence and tried by Morrow C.C.J., in the County
Court of Cariboo holden at Prince George in the Province of British Columbia. In answer to the charge, the
accused raised, amongst others, the issues of identification and drunkenness.
At the end of a lengthy hearing, the trial Judge acquitted him and, in doing
so, said in part: 

(i) as to identification.

I have reached the
conclusion, therefore, without any doubt, that it was the accused who committed
the offence on the night in question. 

(ii) as to drunkenness.

The law seems to be that in
the case of intoxication an accused person can claim that drunkenness need not
result in absolute incapacity rendering the accused incapable of awareness of
the nature of his physical act, but it is sufficient if there is a degree of
drunkenness which renders the accused incapable of forming the specific intent
essential to constitute the crime.

I will be frank and say that
this defence of drunkenness in this instance is one that caused me much
concern. To me it is very much a border line case. That being so it is my duty
to give the accused the benefit of the doubt on the defence of drunkenness that
has been set up in my mind.

Having announced the acquittal,
the trial Judge then addressed these remarks to the accused:

You are being acquitted not
because you didn't do it—there is no doubt in my mind that you did do it—you
are being acquitted because I have found that you were so drunk on the night in
question that you were unable to form an intent to do it. In that respect, you
have been very fortunate, and perhaps fortunate in another respect in that you
were not up on a charge of murder, because anyone that tackles a man as you did
and the man survives after an attack of double pneumonia, you can only put it
down to good luck. Perhaps this will be a warning to you. The next time, you
see, you may not be so fortunate. This defence of drunkenness does not excuse a
crime, it merely is a defence under the circumstances that we have had during
this rather lengthy trial.

In the reasons for judgment,
there is nothing expressed or implied with reference to common assault, an
offence included in the major offence of robbery with violence.

The Crown appealed this decision
to the Court of Appeal for the Province, on grounds stated as follows in the
notice of appeal:

(i) The learned trial Judge
erred in holding that drunkenness was a defence to said charge at all;

(ii) In the alternative, the
learned trial Judge erred in not convicting the respondent of common assault;

(iii) The learned trial
Judge misdirected himself on the defence of drunkenness and its effect on
question of intent.

[Page 874]

In clear reference to the second
ground, the trial Judge, in his report to the Court of Appeal, stated that
common assault had not been raised by Crown counsel at the trial. From this
statement, the Crown contended in the Court below, one must infer that common
assault was not considered by the trial Judge who, in the result, failed to
direct himself with respect to the divisibility of the charge laid and to the
incidence of drunkenness as a defence to a charge of common assault, as
distinguished from a charge of robbery with violence.

In dismissing the appeal[2]
O'Halloran J.A., with the concurrence of Bird J.A., rejected as ill-founded the
inference drawn by the Crown from the report of the trial Judge and further
expressed the view that ""if the respondent could not, through the effect
of liquor, have the intent to rob, then he could not, because of liquor's
effect upon him, have the intent to assault and steal, where as here these two
essential ingredients of robbery occurred concurrently and integrated in the
robbery as charged.""

Sheppard J.A. declared that if,
as suggested, the trial Judge omitted to consider the included offence of
common assault, such an omission was entirely due to the failure of Crown
counsel to raise that issue as part of the case to be met by the accused.
Assimilating such a situation to the one considered in Wexler v. His Majesty
the King[3],
he concurred in the dismissal of the appeal.

The Crown then sought and
obtained leave of this Court to appeal from this judgment. As stated in
appellant's factum, the questions submitted for determination are:

1. Whether or not evidence
of drunkenness falling short of insanity can be used as a defence not only to
negative the capacity of the accused to form a specific or special intent, but
also to negative the ordinary mens rea which is a constituent of all crime.

2. Whether or not the Court
of Appeal should substitute a conviction for the included offence of common
assault, or order a new trial with respect thereto, when Crown counsel at the
trial of the accused did not raise the issue of the accused's capacity to
commit the included offence of common assault.

That the trial Judge did not
consider the included offence of common assault is, in my view, the reasonable
inference flowing from his statement in the report to the Court of Appeal. This
is specially so when this statement, made in

[Page 875]

reference to the second ground
raised by the Crown in its notice of appeal, is considered in the light of the
reasons given by the trial Judge in support of the acquittal.

In the circumstances of this
case, it was the duty of the trial Judge to consider common assault. For when,
as in the present case, the commission of the offence charged, as described in
the enactment creating it or as charged, includes the commission of another
offence, the charge is divisible, and the accused may be convicted of the
offence so included, if proved, notwithstanding that the whole offence that is
charged is not proved. The law and the jurisprudence in this respect are clear.
Section 569(1) (a) Cr. C. reads as follows:

569. (1) A count in an
indictment is divisible and where the commission of the offence charged, as
described in the enactment creating it or as charged in the count, includes the
commission of another offence, whether punishable by indictment or on summary
conviction, the accused may be convicted

(a) of an offence so
included that is proved, notwithstanding that the whole offence that is charged
is not proved, or

See The King v. Wong On (No.
3)[4];
Rex v. Stewart[5].

In a like situation, the offence
included is part of the case which the accused has to meet under the law. The
mere omission of counsel for the Crown to have raised the issue cannot per
se and without more relieve the trial Judge from the cardinal duty imposed
upon him under the section. This is not a civil but a criminal case. The words ""may
convict"", appearing in the opening phrase thereof, give an authority
which must be exercised when, as in this case, the circumstances described in
the section are present. In Reg. v. Bishop of Oxford[6]
it was held that

so long ago as the year 1693
it was decided in the case of R. v. Barlow, that when a statute
authorizes the doing of a thing for the sake of justice or the public good, the
word ""may"" means ""shall"" and that rule has been acted upon
to the present time ….

This proposition was relied on in
Welch v. The King[7]
where, at page 426, this Court said:

For new and extraordinary
would be a rule of construction stating that, being empowered to make an order
required by justice, a Court of justice would be free to refrain from making it
when the occasion to do so arises.

[Page 876]

With deference, the decision of
this Court in Wexler v. His Majesty the King, supra, has no application
in the matter. The question of divisibility did not arise in that case. What
the Court decided was simply that subsection 4 of section 1013 Cr.C. was not
intended to confer jurisdiction upon an appellate court to set aside a verdict
of acquittal and so entitle the Crown to an order for a new trial for the
purpose of presenting an entirely new case against the accused. Furthermore,
the circumstances which gave rise to that decision are entirely different from
those present in this case. As stated by Sir Lyman Duff, C.J., at pp. 351 and
352:

The case presented by the
Crown was that the appellant had intentionally shot the deceased Germaine
Rochon with the intention of killing her. The defence relied upon the testimony
given by the appellant himself. It was agreed by both counsel for the Crown and
for the defence, and the learned trial Judge so instructed the jury, that if
they believed the account given by the accused he was entitled to be acquitted.
I quote the words of the learned judge in which he summed up the whole matter
at the request of counsel for the defence after the jury had retired and had been
recalled:

The COURT: Gentlemen, I have
been asked by the defence attorneys, to give a further explanation on a certain
point. I have told you that, if you are satisfied with the explanation given by
the accused, that the shooting was an accident, that he was entitled to an
acquittal, but I must add—and I think I did—I must add, even on that evidence,
he is entitled to the benefit of the doubt; that is, if you are not reasonably
sure that his explanations are not true, that you must give him the benefit of
the doubt and acquit him.

That is, the accused is
entitled to the benefit of the doubt on the entire evidence. You must be
reasonably sure that he has committed the offence before finding him guilty.

We are left in no doubt that
this instruction by the learned trial judge was accepted as satisfactory by
counsel both for the Crown and for the accused and that it correctly formulated
the single issue of fact which both counsel put before the jury as the sole
issue upon which it was their duty to pass.

In the present case, the record
does not indicate any agreement between counsel, or any suggestion that robbery
was the only issue or that common assault which, under the law, was part of the
case that the accused had to meet, was excluded. Nor was there any occasion for
counsel to approve or disapprove the manner in which the trial Judge directed
himself. The Wexler case, supra, is no authority for the
proposition that the mere omission of the Crown to raise the issue of common
assault amounted to an approval of 

[Page 877]

the trial Judge's failure to
direct himself in the matter or to a circumstance relieving him of the duty he
had under s. 569(1) (a).

It must then be held that the
failure of the trial Judge to consider common assault amounted to non-direction.

It follows that the appeal of the
Crown should have been allowed, unless it be shown by respondent that, but for
this error, the verdict would necessarily have been the same.

This indeed is the view which
appears to have been reached by O'Halloran and Bird JJ.A., who, as above
indicated, said in substance that if, as found by the trial Judge, the accused
did not, owing to drunkenness, have the capacity to form the specific intent
required as a constituent element of the crime of robbery, he could no more,
for the same reason, have had the intent to assault and steal.

With deference, I do not think
that this conclusion legally follows from the premises upon which it rests.

In considering the question of mens
rea, a distinction is to be made between (i) intention as applied to acts
considered in relation to their purposes and (ii) intention as applied to acts
considered apart from their purposes. A general intent attending the commission
of an act is, in some cases, the only intent required to constitute the crime
while, in others, there must be, in addition to that general intent, a specific
intent attending the purpose for the commission of the act.

Contrary to what is the case in
the crime of robbery, where, with respect to theft, a specific intent must be
proved by the Crown as one of the constituent elements of the offence, there is
no specific intent necessary to constitute the offence of common assault, which
is defined as follows in s. 230 Cr.C.:

A person commits an assault
when, without the consent of another person or with consent, where it is
obtained by fraud,

(a) he applies force
intentionally to the person of the other, directly or indirectly, or 

(b) he attempts or
threatens, by an act or gesture, to apply force to the person of the other, if
he has or causes the other to believe upon reasonable grounds that he has
present ability to effect his purpose.

[Page 878]

The word
""intentionally"" appearing in s. 230(a) is exclusively related
to the application of force or to the manner in which force is applied. This,
indeed, is also made clear in the French version, reading:

230. Commet des voies de
fait, ou se livre à une attaque, quiconque, sans le consentement d'autrui, ou
avec son consentement, s'il est obtenu par fraude,

a)d'une manière
intentionnelle, applique,
directement ou indirectement, la force ou la violence contre la personne
d'autrui, ou

b)tente ou menace, par un acte ou un geste, d'appliquer
la force ou la violence contre la personne d'autrui, s'il est en mesure
actuelle, ou s'il porte cette personne à croire, pour des motifs raisonnables,
qu'il est en mesure actuelle d'accomplir son dessein.

(The italics are mine).

There can be no pretence, in this
case, that the manner in which force was applied by respondent to his victim
was accidental or—excluding at the moment, from the consideration, the defence
of drunkenness—unintentional.

On this finding of fact, the
accused was guilty of common assault unless there was evidence indicating a
degree of drunkenness affording, under the law, a valid defence.

The rules for determining the
validity of a defence of drunkenness have been stated by the House of Lords in
the well known case of Beard[8]:

(i) Insanity, whether
produced by drunkenness or otherwise, is a defence to the crime charged.

(ii) Evidence of drunkenness
which renders the accused incapable of forming the specific intent essential to
constitute the crime should be taken into consideration with the other facts
proved in order to determine whether or not he had this intent.

(iii) Evidence of drunkenness
falling short of a proved incapacity in the accused to form the intent
necessary to constitute the crime, and merely establishing that his mind was
affected by drink so that he more readily gave way to some violent passion,
does not rebut the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of
his acts.

The first rule has no relevancy
here for there is no pretence that, owing to drunkenness, respondent was
insane, even temporarily, at the time of the assault.

The second rule was relevant and
indeed properly applied by the trial Judge who entertained a doubt on the
question whether the Crown had proved, as part of its case, that the

[Page 879]

accused had, owing to
drunkenness, the capacity to form the specific intent required in the
offence of robbery, i.e., the intent to steal.

However, and consequential to the
applicability of the rule of divisibility, the included offence of common
assault is to be considered independently of the major offence of robbery, and
the law as to the validity of a defence of drunkenness has to be related to
that particular included offence.

Hence, the question is whether,
owing to drunkenness, respondent's condition was such that he was incapable of
applying force intentionally. I do not know that, short of a degree of
drunkenness creating a condition tantamount to insanity, such a situation could
be metaphysically conceived in an assault of the kind here involved. It is
certain that, on the facts found by the trial Judge, this situation did not
exist in this case.

The accused was acquitted of the
offence of robbery, not on the ground that he could not have applied force
intentionally, but because of the doubt entertained by the trial Judge on the
question whether he had the capacity to form the specific intent required as a
constituent element for the offence of theft.

In these views, the finding of
the trial Judge that the accused had not the capacity to form the specific
intent to commit robbery did not justify the conclusion reached in appeal that
he could not then have committed the offence of common assault; nor is it shown
that, had the trial Judge considered common assault, the verdict would
necessarily have been the same.

In these circumstances, the Court
of Appeal should have allowed the appeal from the acquittal and should have
proceeded to make an order pursuant to its authority under s. 592(4) (b),
to wit, either enter a verdict of guilty with respect to the offence of which,
in its opinion, formed in the light of the law applicable in the matter, the
accused should have been found guilty but for the error in law, and pass a
sentence warranted in law, or order a new trial.

Under section 600 Cr. C., this
Court is given the authority to make any order that the Court of Appeal might
have made. At the hearing before this Court, it was intimated 

[Page 880]

that should the appeal of the
Crown be maintained, this case should be finally disposed of, if possible, and
that in such event, respondent could appropriately be given a suspended
sentence.

Being of opinion that the accused
should have been found guilty of common assault, had that offence been
considered in the light of the law applicable to the facts of this case, I
would maintain the appeal, set aside the verdict of acquittal with respect to
common assault and enter a verdict of guilty of that offence. Prior to his
acquittal in the Court below, respondent has been incarcerated during a number
of weeks. It would appear more consonant with the representations made with
respect to sentence, to sentence respondent to the time already spent by him in
jail; and this is the sentence that I would pass.

LOCKE J. (dissenting) :—This
is an appeal by the Crown pursuant to leave granted by this Court from a
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, which dismissed an appeal
from the acquittal of the respondent by His Honour Judge Morrow, Judge of the
County Court Judges' Criminal Court for the County of Cariboo, on a charge
that:

He did on the 8th day of
February, 1959, at the City of Prince
 George, in the County of Cariboo, Province of British Columbia, unlawfully and by violence
steal from the person of Nicholas Avgeris the sum of Twenty-two dollars,
contrary to the form of Statute in such case made and provided.

The charge appears to have been
laid under the provisions of s. 288 of the Criminal Code. The evidence
disclosed that the respondent, an Indian, had gone on the afternoon of the day
in question to the home of Avgeris, a man 84 years of age who apparently
purchased furs, and was informed that the latter would not purchase a fisher
skin which the respondent offered for sale. Later that night, or early the next
morning, the respondent returned to the home of Avgeris demanding money,
beating him severely with his fists, breaking his nose and causing other grievous
bodily injuries and obtaining a sum of $22. According to Avgeris, the
respondent, in addition to beating him, threatened to kill him unless he gave
him money and wrenched the telephone in the house from the wall.

[Page 881]

The defence advanced on behalf of
the respondent was that he had been drinking heavily during the day, apparently
following the first occasion that he went to the house of Avgeris, and that
this reduced him to such a state that he was unable to form the intent of
committing the offence charged against him. At the conclusion of the hearing
the learned trial judge acquitted the accused, saying that while he was
satisfied that he had committed the offence he was being acquitted because:

I have found that you were
so drunk on the night in question that you were unable to form an intent to do
it.

While two questions of law were
raised in the factum filed on behalf of the Crown, only the second of these was
argued before us. This was expressed in the following terms:

Whether or not the Court of
Appeal should substitute a conviction for the included offence of common
assault, or order a new trial with respect thereto, when Crown counsel at the
trial of the accused did not raise the issue of the accused's capacity to
commit the included offence of common assault.

While the question, therefore, as
to whether the learned County Court judge was right in acquitting the
respondent of the offence charged on the ground above stated is not questioned,
some reference should be made to the evidence. The only account of what had
occurred was that given by Avgeris who described the severe beating he had
received before he gave his attacker the sum of $22. He was, however, unable to
identify the respondent. The latter, however, after his arrest gave two statements
to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. In the first of these, which appears to
have been expressed in the language employed by the respondent, he said that he
had been drinking heavily and did not remember where he had gone but that he
had gone to a house and remembered hitting a man. In the second statement he
described in more detail his movements on the day in question, saying that he
had brought a fisher fur from Summitt Lake and had
gone to a fur buyer and tried to sell the fur to an old man who came to the
door and who said he did not want to buy it. After describing the drinking he
had done after this, he then said:

Then I blacked out and the
next thing I remember I was in a house. It was the house I was at in the
afternoon where the fur buyer lived. I remember hitting a man in this house. I
was hitting him with my fists.

I had mitts on. The person I
was hitting was old and I think he was wearing a kimona. I think it was the fur
buyer I had talked to in the afternoon. I remember seeing the same furniture in
the house then as I had seen in the afternoon. Then I don't remember anything.

The constables by whom these
statements were taken swore that they were made voluntarily, that the
respondent had been duly warned and that no promises or threats had been made
to induce him to make the statements, and the learned County Court judge
admitted both of them in evidence. They had both been signed by the respondent.

While the first statement had
been couched in the language of the respondent, the second was in the language
of the police officer who took the statement, being his interpretation of what
the respondent had said. The respondent did not deny having signed the
statements but denied having said that he remembered hitting the man and said
that the police had told him to sign the statement. The learned judge
apparently did not believe this but, while holding the second statement
admissible in evidence, said that he considered that, as it was not in the
language of the prisoner but of that of the police officer, he should not
attach any weight to it.

Section 569 of the Criminal
Code reads in part:

A count in an indictment is
divisible and where the commission of the offence charged, as described in the
enactment creating it or as charged in the count, includes the commission of
another offence, whether punishable by indictment or on summary conviction, the
accused may be convicted

(a) of an offence so
included that is proved, notwithstanding that the whole offence that is charged
is not proved.

Section 288 of the Criminal
Code, so far as relevant, reads:

Every one commits robbery
who

(a) steals, and for
the purpose of extorting whatever is stolen or to prevent or overcome
resistance to the stealing, uses violence or threats of violence to a person or
property,

(b) steals from any
person and, at the time he steals or immediately before or immediately
thereafter, wounds, beats, strikes or uses any personal violence to that
person.

That violence was used for the
purpose of extorting and stealing money from Avgeris was proved and this upon
the evidence involved an assault within the meaning of that term in s. 230 of
the Criminal Code, and an assault occasioning bodily harm within s. 231
(2).

[Page 883]

In the reasons for judgment
delivered by O'Halloran J.A., with whom Bird J.A. agreed, that learned judge
said that it followed rationally in the circumstances that the judge must also
be deemed to have found that the respondent was equally incapable, for the same
reason, of having an intent to commit an assault and that if he could not have
the intent to commit robbery he could not have the intent either to assault or
to steal, and did not say that he disagreed with this conclusion.

The offences described in subss.
(a) and (b) of s. 288 of the Code include the offence of assault
described in s. 230 and it was, in my opinion, the duty of the learned trial
judge to consider this offence upon the hearing of the charge of robbery with
violence. In view of the severity of the injuries inflicted upon Avgeris by the
brutal beating to which he was subjected, it is clear that George might
properly have been charged with assault occasioning bodily harm under s. 231.
That had not been done and that offence is not an included offence within the
meaning of s. 569. In respect of the offence charged and the offence of
assault, it was necessary to prove that force was applied intentionally and in
the case of the charge under s. 288 that it was done with intent to steal, and
the case of the Crown has been argued on the footing that it is only the latter
question that was considered by the learned judge in arriving at the conclusion
that the prisoner should be acquitted.

It is not made clear in the
reasons for judgment delivered at the trial that the learned judge had not
considered the included offence and O'Halloran and Bird JJ.A. were of the
opinion that it was to be assumed that he had done so. They do not, however,
mention the judge's report referred to by Sheppard J.A. This is required by s.
588(1) of the Code. The report is not in the case and the only information we
have relating to it is in the reasons of Sheppard J.A. who says that it
""states that common assault was not raised by Crown counsel at the
trial."" In my opinion, the proper inference to be drawn from this is that
the trial judge did not consider the question of common assault and we should
deal with the appeal on that footing.

[Page 884]

The effect of the acquittal
extended to both offences and the basis of the appeal taken by the Attorney-General
to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia under the provisions of s. 584 of
the Code, in so far as the included offence of common assault was concerned,
was that the learned judge had not considered whether or not the accused was
intoxicated to such an extent that he was incapable of forming the intent to
assault Avgeris. The appeal proceeded, of necessity, on the footing that the
accused had been acquitted of the charge.

The decision to be made in these
circumstances is of general importance in dealing with the Crown's right of
appeal under s. 584 of the Code. That right was first given by the amendment of
s. 1013 of the Criminal Code effected by s. 28 of c. 11 of the Statutes
of 1930. The long-standing principle of the common law that was affected by
this enactment was stated by Hawkins J. in The King v. Miles[9]
in the following terms:

Where a criminal charge has
been adjudicated upon by a Court having jurisdiction to hear and determine it,
that adjudication, whether it takes the form of an acquittal or conviction, is
final as to the matter so adjudicated upon, and may be pleaded in bar to any
subsequent prosecution for the same offence.

In Hawkins' Pleas of the Crown,
vol. 2, p. 515, it is stated:

The plea of autrefoits
acquit is grounded on this maxim that a man should not be brought into danger
of his life for one and the same offence more than once.

The right of appeal thus given to
the Attorney-General is a departure from this long-established principle of the
common law. The appeal is on a question of law alone. The question of whether
George was at the time of the commission of the offence capable of forming the
intent to assault Avgeris was a question of fact and not of law. The trial
judge did not consider it and this was obviously due to the fact that he was
not asked to do so by counsel for the Crown and, apparently, overlooked the
fact that the offence of common assault was included in the charge laid under
s. 288.

[Page 885]

Had the matter been tried before
a jury, it would clearly have been the judge's duty to have instructed them
that they were to consider not merely the offence of robbery with violence, but
also that of common assault. The question, and indeed the only question, that
arises on this appeal is whether in these circumstances the Crown may ask that
the accused be again placed in jeopardy.

Sheppard J.A. considered that the
question as to whether a new trial should be ordered was affected by the
decision of this Court in Wexler v. R.[10].
In Wexler's case the charge was murder. The defence was that the shooting
was the result of an accident. The evidence of the accused was that at the time
in question he had intended to commit suicide and informed Rochon, the woman
who was killed, of his intention to do so: that she had seized hold of the
revolver to prevent this and that while they were struggling it had
accidentally discharged, killing her. The case for the Crown was that the
killing of the woman had been intentional and the jury were not charged by the
trial judge on manslaughter or upon an issue suggested on appeal that, as upon
his own admission the accused was in the course of committing the unlawful act
of suicide, the killing of the woman was murder. The jury acquitted the accused
but this verdict was set aside on appeal to the Court of King's Bench and a new
trial ordered. On the appeal to this Court the judgment at the trial was
restored.

In that case the trial judge had,
with the consent of both counsel, charged the jury that if they accepted
Wexler's account of what had occurred, they should acquit him. As a matter of
law, the jury should also have been charged upon both of the issues suggested
in this Court. These were not, of course, included offences within the meaning
of that expression in the present section 569, but were offences of which the
accused might have been found guilty if the jury reached certain conclusions on
the evidence. As all of the judgments delivered show, it was by reason of the
course of the trial that the order for a new trial was held to be error.

In the present case, the learned
judge dealt only with the charge of robbery with violence with the apparent
consent and approval of counsel for the Crown, overlooking

[Page 886]

the fact that it was his duty to
deal with the included offence. In this respect, Wexler's case touches
the matter and must be considered.

Stated bluntly, the contention of
the Crown is that where a trial judge hearing a criminal charge fails not to
deal with, but to consider independently, an offence included in the offence
specifically charged, and this is done with the approval of counsel for the
Crown, the provisions of s. 584 may be invoked to again place the accused in
jeopardy. I do not think that it was ever contemplated when the legislation was
enacted that it might be exercised in circumstances such as these.

The principle of law referred to
by Hawkins J. in Miles' case was, prior to 1930, as firmly imbedded in
the criminal law of this country as the principle that a man is to be presumed
innocent until the contrary is proven in a court of competent jurisdiction. The
right to appeal, while given in clear terms, may not be exercised in all
circumstances, as was decided by this Court in Wexler's case. To
construe the section differently would mean that accused persons could be
subjected to a succession of trials for the same offence on grounds that were
not advanced at the first trial and succeeding previous trials, and which the
accused person had not accordingly attempted to meet. The section should not be
construed as permitting in criminal prosecutions a course so contrary to this
long-established principle and, in my opinion, to the public interest.

In my opinion, the decision in The
Queen v. Bishop of Oxford[11],
does not affect the question. In that case a section of the Church
Discipline Act (3 & 4 Vict. (Imp.), c. 86) reading that ""it shall
be lawful"" in defined circumstances for the Bishop of a diocese to issue a
commission of enquiry, was held to be imperative rather than permissive. The
proceedings were instituted by a parishioner for a mandamus to the
Bishop to compel the issue of a commission to enquire into a charge made
against the rector. From this it may be suggested that the word ""may""
in s. 569 should be construed as meaning ""shall"" and that,
accordingly, the failure of the judge to consider the included offence renders
the proceedings defective and a new trial necessary. I agree that the section
imposes such a duty

[Page 887]

upon the judge but I do not agree
that his failure to do so has the suggested consequences. It was also the duty
of the judge who presided at the trial in Wexler's case to charge the
jury that upon the evidence they might return a verdict of manslaughter or a
verdict of murder if they were of the opinion that it was while endeavouring to
commit suicide that Wexler had fired the shot that killed Rochon. The law is as
stated by Hunter C.J. in The King v. Wong On[12],
in these terms:

The cardinal duty of the
judge in his address to the jury is to define the crime charged and to explain
the difference between it and any other offence of which it is open to the jury
to convict the accused.

a statement concurred in by Drake
and Duff JJ. The trial judge was not relieved of that duty by the views
asserted by the counsel at the trial. The duty was not discharged but it was
held by this Court that, in the circumstances, an appeal did not lie.

As to the question of fact as to
whether the respondent was at the time capable of forming the intent necessary
to constitute the crime of assault, I express no opinion in view of my
conclusion upon the point of law.

I would dismiss this appeal.

The judgment of Martland and
Ritchie JJ. was delivered by 

RITCHIE J.:—This is an appeal
from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British
 Columbia[13] affirming the acquittal of the respondent by Morrow
C.C.J. of the charge that he did ""unlawfully and by violence steal from
the person of Nicholas Avgeris the sum of Twenty-two Dollars"".

The learned trial judge has found
that:

…a man of 84, was violently
manhandled by an Indian on the date noted in the Indictment …as a result of
which he was in hospital for a month. During this scuffle he was badly injured,
dumped into a bathtub and pulled out again when he agreed to give the Indian
what money he had, $22.

and he has also

…reached the conclusion …
without any doubt that it was the accused who committed the offence on the
night in question.

[Page 888]

The learned trial judge
continued:

The first statement perhaps
should be considered. It was obviously written in the words of someone who has
not had too much education. In his second paragraph after recalling the
drinking period, he said: ""Then I came to and I was in house and I
remember hitting man and I don't remember where I went after.""

Notwithstanding these findings,
the learned trial judge acquitted the respondent, saying:

To me it is very much a
border line case. That being so it is my duty to give the accused the benefit
of the doubt on the defence of drunkenness that has been set up in my mind.

After acquitting him, the learned
trial judge addressed the accused in part as follows:

You are being acquitted not
because you didn't do it—there is no doubt in my mind that you did do it—you
are being acquitted because I have found that you were so drunk on the night in
question that you were unable to form an intent to do it.

From this acquittal the Crown
appealed to the Court of Appeal of British
 Columbia, and in rendering the decision
of the majority of that Court Mr. Justice O'Halloran said[14]:

I am unable with respect to
accept Crown counsel's submission that in failing to convict respondent of
assault upon this charge of robbery, the learned trial Judge omitted to
instruct himself regarding any difference between the intent to commit the
robbery and a specific intent to commit assault as one of the essential
ingredients of the robbery with which he was charged.

In my judgment, with
respect, a sufficient answer thereto is; that having found the respondent so
incapacitated by liquor that he could not form an intent to commit the robbery,
it follows rationally in the circumstances here, that he must also be deemed to
have found that respondent was equally incapable for the same reason of having
an intent to commit the assault. If he could not have the intent to commit the
robbery, viz. to assault and steal as charged, then he could not have the
intent either to assault or to steal when both occurred together as charged;
the charge reads ""by violence steal"".

Mr. Justice Sheppard dismissed
the appeal on another ground, namely, that the Crown's case at the trial was
confined to the charge of robbery with violence, and that in any event a
conviction of assault should not be entered in the Court of Appeal without the
accused having been given an opportunity to meet that included offence as the
failure to do so in the circumstances of this case may have

[Page 889]

been due to his having been
misled by Crown counsel presenting the case as solely that of robbery with
violence.

In the course of his decision Mr.
Justice Sheppard said[15]:

The learned trial Judge in
his report states that common assault was not raised by Crown counsel at the
trial. It, therefore, appears that the case presented by the Crown at the trial
was that of robbery with violence; that is the sole offence which the accused
was here called upon to meet.

It is to be noted that the report
of the learned trial judge was not part of the record before this Court and
this observation by Mr. Justice Sheppard is the sole reference made to it in
the course of the proceedings.

Leave to appeal to this Court was
granted pursuant to an application made on behalf of the Attorney-General of British Columbia. No appeal was taken from the acquittal of the respondent on the charge
of robbery and the first five grounds of appeal are, in large measure, devoted
to the question of whether a distinction should be drawn ""between the
degree of drunkenness required to negative the existence of"" that intent
which is, under the Criminal Code, an essential ingredient of the crime
of robbery and the degree of drunkenness which is necessary to negative such
intent as is an ingredient of common assault.

The sixth ground of appeal was
directed to the decision of Mr. Justice Sheppard and the appellant put the
question thereby raised in the following terms:

Whether or not the Court of
Appeal should substitute a conviction for the included offence of common
assault, or order a new trial with respect thereto, when Crown counsel at the
trial of the accused did not raise the issue of the accused's capacity to
commit the included offence of common assault.

Pursuant to s. 569 of the Criminal
Code, the learned trial judge was under a duty to direct his mind to the
""included offence"" of assault, and in the absence of any evidence to
the contrary, I do not think that it should be assumed that he did not do so.
Whether or not he properly directed himself as to the effect of drunkenness in
negativing the intent to commit this offence is another question.

The report of the learned trial
judge is not before us, and, with the greatest respect for those who may take a
contrary view, I do not consider that the fact that it contains

[Page 890]

a statement ""that common
assault was not raised by Crown counsel at the trial"" is sufficient ground
for concluding that the learned trial judge did not consider this offence.

In my opinion, the duty which
rests upon the trial judge to direct himself with respect to all included
offences of which there is evidence can, in no way, be affected by the fact
that the Crown Prosecutor has omitted to make reference to such offences. It
follows, in my view, that in a case where the trial judge has wrongly applied
the law applicable to such an offence the Crown is not deprived of its
statutory right of appeal because of the omission of its agent at the trial to
address the Court on the matter.

The fact that the learned trial
judge found, as I think he did, that the respondent had ""violently
manhandled"" an old man but was not guilty of assault because he was drunk
at the time raises the question of law posed by the appellant as to whether, under
the circumstances as found by the trial judge, drunkenness is a valid defence
to common assault.

In considering the question of mens
rea, a distinction is to be drawn between ""intention"" as applied
to acts done to achieve an immediate end on the one hand and acts done with the
specific and ulterior motive and intention of furthering or achieving an
illegal object on the other hand. Illegal acts of the former kind are done
""intentionally"" in the sense that they are not done by accident or
through honest mistake, but acts of the latter kind are the product of
preconception and are deliberate steps taken towards an illegal goal. The
former acts may be the purely physical products of momentary passion, whereas
the latter involve the mental process of formulating a specific intent. A man,
far advanced in drink, may intentionally strike his fellow in the former sense
at a time when his mind is so befogged with liquor as to be unable to formulate
a specific intent in the latter sense. The offence of robbery, as defined by
the Criminal Code, requires the presence of the kind of intent and
purpose specified in ss. 269 and 288, but the use of the word
""intentionally"" in defining ""common assault"" in s. 230(a)
of the Criminal Code is exclusively referable to the physical act of
applying force to the person of another.

[Page 891]

I would adopt the following
passage from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law, 17th ed., p. 58, para. 42, as an
authoritative statement on this subject. He there says:

…in Director of Public
Prosecution v. Beard, (1920) A.C. 479 …it was laid down that evidence of
such drunkenness as ""renders the accused incapable of forming the specific
intent, essential to constitute the crime, should be taken into consideration,
with the other facts proved, in order to determine whether or not he had this
intent"". In such a case the drunkenness, if it negatives the existence of
the indispensable mental element of the crime ""negatives the commission of
that crime"". Thus a drunken man's inability to form an intention to kill, or
to do grievous bodily harm involving the risk of killing, at the time of
committing a homicide, may reduce his offence from murder to manslaughter
(which latter crime requires no more than a realization that some bodily harm
may be caused). Drunkenness may likewise show that a supposed burglar had no
intention of stealing, or that wounds were inflicted without any ""intent
to do grievous bodily harm"", or that a false pretence was made with no
""intent to defraud"". But it must be remembered that a man may be so
drunk as not to form an intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm while yet
in sufficient control of his senses to be able to contemplate some harm and so
to be guilty of manslaughter or of an unlawful wounding.

The decision of the learned trial
judge, in my opinion, constitutes a finding that the respondent violently
manhandled a man and knew that he was hitting him. Under these circumstances,
evidence that the accused was in a state of voluntary drunkenness cannot be
treated as a defence to a charge of common assault because there is no
suggestion that the drink which had been consumed had produced permanent or
temporary insanity and the respondent's own statement indicates that he knew
that he was applying force to the person of another.

In view of the above, I would
allow the appeal, and, having regard to the circumstances mentioned by him, I
would dispose of this appeal as proposed by my brother Fauteux.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION.

Criminal law—Perjury—Divorce action—Evidence of innocent
bystander with no interest in outcome of trial—No evidence of intent to
mislead, or knowledge of falsity of the evidence given—Criminal Code, 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, s. 113(1).

The appellant was charged with perjury in that, as a witness
in a divorce case in the outcome of which he had no interest, he had given
evidence well knowing same to be false and with intent to mislead. The
appellant asserted that his evidence, given more than a year after the events
to which it related, was an honest statement of what he could remember. An
appeal from his conviction by a judge sitting without a jury was dismissed by
the Court of Appeal. The appellant then appealed to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be allowed, the
conviction quashed and a judgment of acquittal entered.

Per Curiam: There was no evidence of any intent to
mislead, or knowledge of the falsity of the evidence given. The evidence may
have been in error, although that was doubtful, but error alone affords no
basis for the inference of the intent and knowledge necessary to support a
charge of perjury.

Per Locke, Cartwright, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.:
It was incumbent upon the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt (i) that
the appellant's evidence, specified in the indictment, was false in fact, (ii)
that the appellant when he gave it knew that it was false, and (iii) that he
gave it with intent to mislead the Court. Although there was some evidence on
which it was open to the tribunal of fact to find that the first of these
matters was proved, there was no evidence on which it could find that either of
the other matters was proved. In such circumstances, had the trial been before
a jury it would have been the duty of the trial judge to direct them to find a
verdict of not guilty and it was equally his duty to so direct himself.

[Page 893]

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau, Locke,
Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

Judson J.:—John
Gordon Calder appeals from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta, which dismissed his appeal from his conviction on a
charge of perjury after a trial before a judge sitting without a jury. The only
reasons before us from the Appellate Division are those of the Chief Justice,
who dissented and would have allowed the appeal.

The precise charge of perjury against the appellant was
that, as a witness in a divorce case heard in September 1958, he had given
evidence to the effect

that shortly after the 1st day of July, A.D. 1957, Mr.
Douglas Dunn and Mrs. Geraldine Holland and her two children moved to his
trailer located about 30 feet west of his office facing south on 8th Street and
Railway Avenue, Dawson Creek, British Columbia, and lived in the said trailer
from three weeks to a month, well knowing same to be false and with intent to
mislead.

In 1957 the appellant was living in Dawson Creek and
carrying on a transport business. In his yard there was a trailer which he used
for the accommodation of his drivers when they came in late at night and needed
sleeping quarters. In June 1957 he permitted one Douglas Dunn, who also owned a
small trucking business, to occupy this trailer. In the latter half of June
1957, Dunn was joined by a woman, whom he introduced as Mrs. Dunn. This woman
was at that time married to William Holland. The two lived in this trailer for
a period of about two weeks in the month of June 1957, and for part of this
time there was another couple living there with them. At the end of June Mrs.
Holland returned to Edmonton with Dunn to pick up her two children at the end
of the school term. The two returned with the children to Dawson Creek early in
the morning of July 2. Her story is that for the remainder of the first night
she slept in the car with the two children and then immediately moved into a
house with Dunn.

In the divorce action between Holland, as plaintiff, and his
wife, as defendant, the appellant was subpoenaed as a witness. This is the
evidence that he gave:

Q. Was anybody else living in this trailer at the time you
met Mrs. Dunn, as you were introduced to her?

A. Mr. Dunn.

[Page 894]

Q. He was living there?

A. Yes.

Q. How long did Mr. Dunn and the woman you were introduced
to as Mrs. Dunn live in this trailer?

A. I would say approximately three weeks to a month.

Q. Had Mr. Dunn slept in the trailer prior to the time that
this lady appeared on the scene?

A. That is right, yes.

Q. And do you recall what period of time it would be that
Mr. Dunn and this lady, who you now know to be Mrs. Holland, occupied the
trailer?

A. Sometime shortly after the 1st of July. It was right
within a week of that First of July.

Q. Were there any children?

A. Yes.

Q. The Court: Do you
mean that she started to occupy the trailer about the 1st of July or the latter
part of June?

A. No, after the 1st of July, sometime right in there.

Q. The Court: Sometime
after the 1st of July, that was the first time she occupied it?

A. Yes.

Q. The Court: Now you
said something about the children, they were there too?

A. Yes.

Q. Mr. Stanton: How
many children?

A. Two I believe sir.

Q. When did they appear on the scene?

A. Sometime just a few days after the 1st of July.

Mr. Miller cross-examines:

Q. Another thing now, Mr. Calder, I am suggesting to you
that Mrs. Holland's children never stayed in that trailer, that when they came
to Dawson Creek they immediately went to this house that we are speaking about
that belonged to Henderson?

A. No sir.

Q. I want you to consider, Mr. Calder, I am suggesting to
you that the children never stayed in that trailer.

A. Well, it is, they were there, that is all I know.

Q. I know they were in Dawson Creek.

A. They were there in that trailer. I have mentioned that
twice or three times now sir.

Q. All right now, Mr. Calder, I am suggesting to you that
Mr. and Mrs. Hine stayed in that trailer at the time that Mrs. Holland or/and
Mr. Dunn were there?

A. I don't know anything about that.

The Court: Were
you ever in the trailer when Mrs. Holland and Mr. Dunn were in there?

A. No, not that I recall sir.

The Court: When
did you see Mrs. Holland in there with Mr. Dunn?

[Page 895]

A. Every day, right there 30 feet from my office, I couldn't
help but see.

The Court: She
was inside?

A. Yes, she was outside and inside and in and out all the
time.

The Court: And
the children too?

A. Yes.

At the trial of the appellant on the charge of perjury, Mrs.
Holland, who by that time had become Mrs. Dunn, denied that she had ever
occupied the trailer at any time in the month of July 1957 with Dunn and the
children. The appellant gave evidence in his own defence and stated that Dunn
and the woman had stayed in the trailer in June for some time and that the next
time he saw them was July 2. On the following day they moved into the trailer
again and he saw them in and around the trailer for a few days, after which
they moved into a house. He asserted that his evidence, given at the trial, was
an honest statement of what he could remember and that he thought that the
couple had stayed in the trailer for a few days with the children. He admitted
that he had never walked around and looked in the trailer to see who was in it.
His observations were made from his office which was about 30 feet away. His
understanding from Dunn was that they would be there for a few days. He
explained that his evidence of the occupation of the trailer for a period of
three weeks to a month, given at the trial, related to the month of June. He
also said that he had seen Mrs. Holland's children around the trailer after
Dunn had spoken to him about arrangements for the use of the trailer.

The unquestionable facts are that Mrs. Holland was living in
the trailer with Dunn in the second half of June 1957, with Dunn and the
children in a small house nearby from some time early in July until the end of
September 1957 and that the children did not arrive in Dawson Creek until July
2.

The appellant gave his evidence at the divorce trial on
September 16, 1958, more than a year after the events to which he testified. He
became involved, as an innocent bystander, in events which were of no
particular significance to him at the time. He had no interest in the outcome
of the divorce trial and he was in court under subpoena. On this record, there
is, to me, a preponderance of evidence, coming

[Page 896]

from other witnesses as well as the appellant, that this
couple, along with the children, were in occupation of the trailer for some
period early in July 1957. This, however, is no ground for reversal in this
Court. But I agree with the learned Chief Justice that this appellant should
not have been convicted of perjury on the ground that there was no evidence of
any intent to mislead, or knowledge of the falsity of the evidence given. The
evidence may have been in error, although I doubt that, but error alone, and
that is the most that can be found against the appellant, affords no basis for
the inference of the intent and knowledge necessary to support this charge.

I would quash the conviction and direct that a judgment of
acquittal be entered.

The judgment of Locke, Cartwright, Abbott, Martland and
Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

Cartwright J.:—I
agree with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Judson and have little to
add.

While the learned Chief Justice of Alberta dissented from
the judgment of the majority of the Appellate Division on two questions of law
I find it necessary to consider only the first of these which is expressed in
the formal order in the following words:

There was no evidence on which it could properly be found
that the accused intended to swear as to the facts as was charged.

The test to be applied in determining whether or not there
was any evidence, as distinguished from sufficient evidence, to
support a conviction is to be found in the unanimous judgment of this Court
delivered by Duff C.J.C. in The King v. Décary1. The
question to be answered is whether ""there was no evidence in support of
the accusation before the jury in the sense that it was within the power of the
trial judge, and therefore, of course, his duty, to direct a verdict of not
guilty to be entered""; it has long been settled that the question so
stated is one of law in the strict sense, while the question on which the Court
of Appeal is empowered to pass by s. 592(1) (a) (i) of the Criminal
Code —whether the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is
unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence—is a mixed question of fact
and law.

[Page 897]

This Court has jurisdiction to review a decision of the
Court of Appeal on the first but not on the second of these questions. The two
questions have however a common feature; to answer either the Court must,
speaking generally, review the whole of the evidence.

In the case at bar it was incumbent upon the prosecution to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt three matters, (i) that the evidence, specified
in the indictment, given by the appellant on September 16, 1958, before
Greschuk J. was false in fact, (ii) that the appellant when he gave it knew
that it was false, and (iii) that he gave it with intent to mislead the Court.
It may well be that if there were evidence to support findings that the
appellant had given evidence false in fact knowing it to be false the tribunal
of fact, in the absence of other evidence as to his intention, could properly
draw the inference that in so doing he intended to mislead the Court.

After reading all the evidence with care it appears to me
that there was some evidence on which it was open to the tribunal of fact to
find that the first of the matters mentioned above was proved but, in my
opinion, there was no evidence on which it could find that either the second or
third of such matters was proved. In such circumstances, had the trial been
before a jury it would have been the duty of the learned trial judge to direct
them to find a verdict of not guilty and it was equally his duty to so direct
himself.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a
judgment of acquittal to be entered.

Appeal allowed, conviction quashed and judgment
of acquittal directed to be entered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Aliens—Deportation—Chinese mother—Non-immigrant—Child born in Canada during
visit—Right to deport mother—The Immigration Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 325—The Canadian Citizens Act,
R.S.C. 1952, c. 33—The Canadian Bill of
Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44.

The applicant, a citizen of
China, came to Canada on a non-immigrant visa issued to her in Hong Kong. Her
husband and two other children remained in Hong Kong. During her stay in
Canada, a son, issue of her marriage, was born to her. A deportation order was
made against her by a special enquiry officer under the Immigration Act. This
order was quashed by the trial judge, but restored by the Court of Appeal.

Held: The appeal should be
dismissed.

The applicant fell within
the terms of s. 5(t) of the Act and of ss. 18 and 20 of the Regulations,
and has not been deprived of her liberty except by due process of law. The fact
that she was the mother of a legitimate child born in Canada had no bearing on
the matter.

The
judgment of the Court was delivered by 










THE
CHIEF JUSTICE:—This is an appeal by
Mrs. Louie Yuet Sun from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1
reversing a decision of King J. which had quashed a deportation order made
against the appellant under the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 325. As
set out in the factum of the appellant, it appears that she is a citizen of
China who came to Canada as a visitor in December 1957 by way of Hong Kong. She
was in possession of a passport in which was entered a Canadian non-immigrant
visa issued to her in Hong Kong. She had been allowed entry into Canada for a
period of six months and later her permit was extended another six months to
December 1958. She had come to Canada to visit her father and brother, who live

[Page 71]



in
Ottawa. Her husband, a farmer, and her two children, remained in Hong Kong.
She, who is now twenty-nine years of age, and her husband, who is thirty-one
years of age, were married in China in 1948. On August 18, 1958, while she was
in Ottawa, the appellant gave birth to a son, a child of that marriage.



Since
the permission she had received to enter Canada had expired, the appellant
reported to an immigration officer as required by the Act. She was examined by
the officer who made a report under s. 23 of the Act that it would be contrary
to the provisions of the Act to grant admission to or otherwise let the
appellant come into Canada by reason of her coming under the prohibited classes
of s. 5, para, (t) thereof, in that she could not or did not fulfil or
comply with the conditions or requirements of ss. 18 and 20 of the Regulations
promulgated under the Act. Subsequently an enquiry was held by a special
enquiry officer, who decided that the appellant might not come into or remain
in Canada as of right and that (1) she was not a Canadian citizen; (2) she was
not a person having Canadian domicile; (3) she was a member of a prohibited
class described in s. 5(t) of the Act in that she could not and did not
fulfil or comply with the conditions or requirements of the Act or the
Regulations because: (a) she did not have an immigrant visa as required
under subs. 3 of s. 18 of the Regulations; (b) she did not come within
the provisions of subs, (d) of s. 20 of the Regulations. He accordingly
ordered her to be detained and to be deported.



King J.
held that the appellant was not a person within the meaning and intent of s. 5(t)
of the Act because she had recently given birth to a child in Canada; the child
being a natural born Canadian citizen had a right to live in Canada and was
entitled to the love, care and attention of its mother. The mother desired to
remain in Canada because she thought it would be better for the child. No
reasons were given by the Court of Appeal but upon consideration I can see no
basis for the judgment of the judge of first instance. If the appellant chooses
to take the child with her, the material indicates that the Hong Kong
authorities are willing to receive her and the child. If, on the other hand,
she chooses to leave the child here, he is entitled to remain in Canada. It is not
denied that the

[Page 72]










applicant
falls within the terms of the relevant sections of the Act and
Regulations, and, unless the fact that she is the mother of a legitimate child
born in Canada affects the matter, she has not been deprived of her liberty
except by due process of law. In my view that fact has no bearing on the
matter.



Any
other points raised in the Courts below were abandoned before us. The appeal
should be dismissed without costs.

Appeal dismissed without
costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION.

Criminal law—Murder—Conviction quashed by Court of
Appeal on ground inter alia it could not be supported by the evidence—Whether
question of law raised—Jurisdiction of Supreme Court to hear appeal —Criminal
Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 201, 202, 592 (1) (a) (i).

[Page 145]

The respondent was found guilty of murder. He appealed and, by
a unanimous decision, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court quashed the
conviction of murder, and substituted therefor one of manslaughter.

It was not disputed that the victim was killed by the
respondent. According to the latter's evidence, the deceased while sitting in
his car with the respondent, made an indecent proposal to the respondent who
was drunk. The respondent seized the deceased by the neck and choked him. When
the respondent came to his senses he found the victim limp and he attempted
unsuccessfully to revive him. Thinking that the man was dead, he drove the car
a short distance and then dragged the body to a ditch. He placed the man's belt
around his neck, took his wallet and the car and left the place.

The pathologist who performed the autopsy concluded that death
was caused by strangulation due to the tightening of the belt.

Held (Locke, Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ.
dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau and Abbott JJ.: There
was no jurisdiction in this Court to hear the appeal. The Chief Justice of
Alberta, speaking on behalf of the Appellate Division, considered that the
evidence was not sufficient to support a conviction, which was a question of
fact. This first reason was not obiter dictum merely because he also
gave another reason. Gravestock v. Parkin, [1944] S.C.R. 150; Jacobs
v. London County Council, [1950] A.C. 361, referred to.

Per Taschereau, Cartwright and Abbott JJ.: The
Appellate Division quashed the conviction on the ground inter alia that
it could not be supported by the evidence. This was a distinct ground on which
its judgment was based, and was a ground raising no question of law in the
strict sense. It was nihil ad rem that the judgment was based also on
other grounds raising such points of law.

Per Ritchie J.: In finding that a reasonable doubt existed
as to whether or not the respondent believed his victim to be already dead at
the time when he in fact caused his death, the Appellate Division made a
finding of fact which excluded the application of s. 201 of the Code from the
circumstances of this case, and which was not subject to review in this Court.

If the Appellate Division erred in finding that such a doubt
existed, then this was an error of fact from which other errors necessarily
flowed, including that s. 202 was the only one under which the jury could have
found the accused guilty of murder. The error, if error it was, raised a mixed
question of fact and law, and as such was not a competent ground of appeal to
this Court. R. v. Décary, [1942] S.C.R. 80, referred to.

As the Appellate Division quashed the conviction on the ground
inter alia that it could not be supported by the evidence, no question
of law in the strict sense was raised by this appeal.

Per Locke J., dissenting: The language of the
Chief Justice of the Appellate Division did not indicate that the decision of
that Court rested upon the insufficiency of the evidence. If, however, it
should be so construed, what was said as to the insufficiency of the evidence
referred only to a charge of murder under s. 202 of the Code and not to such a
charge under s. 201. This was misdirection. It

[Page 146]

was further made manifest that one of the grounds for this
conclusion was the opinion that, as it could not be said with assurance that
the accused did not believe the victim to have been dead when he tightened the
belt around his neck, there could be no conviction for murder under s. 202.
These were errors in law, which this Court was vested with jurisdiction to
correct. Thabo Meli v. R., [1954] 1 W.L.R. 228; Bradley v. The Queen, [1956] S.C.R. 723,
referred to.

Per Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ., dissenting:
Although the Chief Justice of the Appellate Division was strongly of the
opinion that the verdict of murder could not be supported by the evidence, he
was not satisfied that this opinion had that degree of finality required to
assert it as a distinct ground for the decision of the appeal.

If, however, it could be said that the decision of the
Appellate Division was that the verdict could not be supported on the evidence,
it appeared that this conclusion rested on the proposition stated when the
Chief Justice, after dealing with s. 202, said: ""this is the only section
under which the jury could have found the accused guilty of murder."" This
was tantamount to saying that there was no evidence on which the jury could
have convicted under s. 201, which was a question of law.

Where it appears that a decision of a court of appeal that a
verdict cannot be supported by the evidence has been founded on a wrong
conclusion of law, this Court is not without jurisdiction to hear an appeal
from it. It was an error in law to say that there was no evidence upon which
the jury could have found the accused guilty of murder under s. 201, which was
the conclusion, in a relation to that section, which was ultimately reached by
the Chief Justice of the Appellate Division.

The jury having rejected the defence of drunkenness, the
suggestion of the Appellate Division that the trial judge should have put to
the jury ""a suggestion"" that the accused put the belt around the
victim's neck to assist in dragging him from the car to the ditch, was
untenable. In directing a jury, the trial judge has not the duty to speculate
and instruct them as to all the views which one might possibly take of the
evidence.

As to the errors found in the Court below, and as to the
grievances alleged for respondent in the notices of appeal to that Court, there
was nothing of real substance.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division1, quashing a conviction of murder and
substituting one of manslaughter. Appeal dismissed, Locke, Fauteux, Martland
and Judson JJ. dissenting.

W. Shortreed, Q.C., for the appellant.

Bruce D. Patterson, for the respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau and Abbott JJ.
was delivered by

[Page 147]

The Chief Justice:—In
my opinion there is no jurisdiction in the Court to hear this appeal. The first
two sentences of the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice of Alberta,
speaking on behalf of the Appellate Division, are as follows:

I am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot
be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go further, and set out other
reasons for setting aside the conviction.

I read the first sentence as meaning that the Chief
Justice considered that the evidence was not sufficient to support a
conviction,—which is a question of fact. As to the second sentence and the
remainder of the reasons, the decisions, referred to on the argument, of Gravestock
v. Parkin2 and Jacobs v. London County
Council3 show authoritatively that the
first reason given by the Chief Justice of Alberta was not obiter dictum merely
because he also gave another reason.

While it was announced that we had jurisdiction, further
consideration has persuaded the majority of the Court that such is not the
case.

The appeal should be dismissed.

The judgment of Taschereau, Cartwright and Abbott JJ. was
delivered by

Cartwright J.:—This
is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court of Alberta4 pronounced on March 31, 1960, allowing
an appeal from the conviction of the appellant on January 22, 1960, before
Greschuk J. and a jury on the charge that at Edmonton on or about August 23,
1959, he did murder Stanley Valpeters. The Appellate Division quashed the
conviction of murder, substituted a conviction of manslaughter and subsequently
sentenced the appellant to ten years imprisonment.

The appeal is brought pursuant to an order made by this
Court on May 12, 1960, granting the appellant leave to appeal on the following
questions:

(a) Did the Appellate Division err in law in holding
that there was nondirection amounting to misdirection, if not misdirection, in
respect to the offence of murder under section 202 of the Criminal Code, and
that

[Page 148]

the grounds on which the jury could find the accused guilty
of murder while committing robbery were not placed before the jury as facts to
be found by them;

(b) Did the Appellate Division err in law in finding
that the trial judge should have put to the jury ""a suggestion"" that
the accused put the belt around Valpeters' neck to assist in dragging him from
the car to the ditch, in the absence of evidence to support any such
suggestion;

(c) Did the Appellate Division err in law in holding
that the judge's charge was inadequate in failing to explain the theory
advanced by the Crown that strangulation was used to facilitate the commission
of robbery, and, hence, whether it was intended to cause death or not the act
constituted murder;

(d) Did the Appellate Division err in law in holding
that only under section 202 of the Criminal Code could the jury have found the
accused guilty of murder.

The order granting leave was made by a court consisting of
five members, two of whom, dissenting, would have dismissed the application.

It is not disputed that Valpeters was killed by the
appellant. There were no eye-witnesses of the killing other than the appellant
himself who made a voluntary statement to the police after his arrest on the
charge of murder and also gave evidence at the trial. The effect of the
evidence is sufficiently summarized in the following passage in the reasons of
Ford C.J.A. who delivered the reasons of the Appellate Division:

The facts of what happened when the deceased, Valpeters, met
his death must be ascertained from the story told by the accused himself with
the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, the location and condition of
the body when found, and the opinion evidence of the two doctors called by the
Crown.

The story of the accused is that he is a drink addict and
had been drinking throughout part of the afternoon of Saturday, August 22nd,
1959 and all of the evening, during which time he visited at least two hotels,
the Hotel Regis, and the King Edward. He said that he met a constable on the
street and asked to be taken into custody for being drunk as he wanted to go to
Belmont for treatment because of his drink habits. Being unsuccessful in this,
he went to police headquarters and suggested that there was a charge of false
pretences that could or should be laid against him on which he could be taken
into custody. In this, too, he was unsuccessful. There is no doubt that he
tried to have this done as it is confirmed by the evidence of the police
constables.

After this he roamed the streets of Edmonton until about two
o'clock Sunday morning. During this period he was put out two or three times
from the Rose cafe. This is also confirmed by independent evidence. About the
hour just mentioned, when still in search of liquor, he met a stranger somewhere
near the same restaurant. This stranger, who has turned out to be Valpeters,
invited him to go in his car out of the City of Edmonton into the country to
consume a bottle of whiskey. Valpeters

[Page 149]

drove out past the oil refineries until the car was brought
to a stop somewhere in the entrance to a farmhouse in the country. Valpeters
invited the accused into the back seat in order to drink the whiskey. After
both got into this seat he invited the accused to perform an act of gross
indecency, whereupon a struggle began in which some blows, apparently
ineffective, were struck, and Valpeters got the accused down and the accused
seized Valpeters by the neck and choked him. The accused said that when he came
to his senses Valpeters was all limp and that he attempted to revive him. The
accused said that he had had some training with the St. Johns Ambulance. The
attempt to revive was unsuccessful and, after feeling his heart and pulses, he
thought the man was dead.

He said that he was in fear because of what he had done and
backed the car out of the entrance way to the farmhouse and drove it a short
distance along the road to a ditch where he got out and pulled the body from
the back seat and dragged it by the armpits to the ditch. He said that he tried
again to revive the man but could not do so. He said also what is the most
serious evidence against himself that he put the man's belt around his neck
when he was in the ditch and took his wallet and the car and left the place.
That is where the body was found the following Monday afternoon.

The accused, on taking the car, drove to where he was living
in Edmonton and took with him the woman with whom he was living and their son,
that same morning, and drove back to the home of her parents in Ontario where
he was later arrested.

I do not find it necessary to consider the several errors of
law alleged by the appellant to have been made by the Appellate Division as I
think it is clear that the Appellate Division allowed the appeal on two main
grounds:

(1) that, in the opinion of the Appellate Division, the
verdict of guilty of murder should be set aside on the ground that it could not
be supported by the evidence, and

(2) that there had been errors in law in the charge of the
learned trial judge.

So far as the judgment of the Appellate Division is based on
the first ground mentioned, this Court is powerless to interfere with it. The
question whether the Appellate Division was right in proceeding on this ground
is not a question of law in the strict sense. It is a question of fact or, at
the best from the point of view of the appellant, a mixed question of fact and
law.

The reasons of the learned Chief Justice of Alberta open
with the following paragraph:

I am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot
be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go further, and set out other
reasons for setting aside the conviction.

[Page 150]

Later in his reasons, the learned Chief Justice says:

No one can say with assurance that the accused did not
believe Valpeters was dead on his becoming unconscious during the course of the
struggle and after the efforts to revive him had failed.

This is a finding of fact made by the Appellate Division as
a result of its examination of the evidence. It is irrelevant to inquire whether
we would make the same finding if we had the power, which the Appellate
Division has but which we have not, to proceed upon grounds of fact.

The jurisdiction of the Appellate Division to allow the
appeal is found in s. 592(1) (a) of the Criminal Code which
reads:

592(1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction, the
court of appeal

(a) may allow the appeal
where it is of the opinion that

(i) the verdict should be set
aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the
evidence,

(ii) the judgment of the trial
court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of
law, or

(iii) on any ground there was a
miscarriage of justice;

On reading the reasons as a whole, I am satisfied that the
Appellate Division was exercising its jurisdiction under s. 592(1) (a)
(i) and was setting the verdict aside on the ground that, in its opinion, it
could not be supported by the evidence.

It was suggested during the argument that what the Appellate
Division really did was to rule that there was no evidence on which the jury
could have convicted the respondent of murder and that the question whether
there is any evidence, as distinguished from the question whether there is
enough evidence, is a question of law.

I cannot agree with this suggestion for several reasons.
First, it appears that there was, as indeed both counsel concede, some evidence
on which it would have been open to a properly instructed jury to find a
verdict of murder and I am not prepared to assume that the Appellate Division
overlooked or misunderstood this evidence. Secondly, if the Appellate Division
had intended to hold that there was no evidence they would have said so; it is
significant that they followed the very words of s. 592(1) (a) (i). This
clause gives jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal to proceed on grounds of fact,
while clause (ii) which follows immediately gives it jurisdiction to proceed on
the ground that there has been

[Page 151]

a wrong decision on a question of law. Thirdly, while a
large number of grounds of appeal were put forward in the notice of appeal to
the Appellate Division these did not include the ground that there was no
evidence to support the conviction, while the following grounds were all
appropriate to found the submission that the verdict should be set aside under
s. 592(1) (a) (i) as being one that could not be supported by the
evidence:

(1) That the said conviction is against the law, evidence
and weight of the evidence.

* * *

(3) That the jury failed to give proper, fair, reasonable
and adequate consideration to the evidence and came to a hasty conclusion.

(4) That the verdict of the jury was perverse and contrary
to the evidence at the trial.

* * *

(19) The verdict of the jury was perverse and contrary to
the evidence in that it generally failed to give the appellant the benefit of
reasonable doubt and more particularly with respect to the following:

(a) That the medical
evidence indicated that a person rendered unconscious by pressure on the
carotid nerve would become dead in a matter of minutes if certain steps such as
lowering of the head between the knees and relieving of the pressure did not
take place and there being no evidence that the deceased was so relieved prior
to the placing of the belt.

(b) That the medical evidence
indicated death by strangulation and the evidence of the appellant indicated
the deceased was limp and appeared to be dead in the car, which evidence was
consistent with appellant's theory and defence as to cause and time of death or
at least raised reasonable doubt that death occurred from the placing of the
belt on the deceased's neck in the ditch and not by reason of the appellant's
actions as stated in the car.

However, I may have dealt with this suggestion at undue
length for the grounds on which leave to appeal to this Court was granted do
not include a ground that the Appellate Division erred in holding that there
was no evidence on which the jury could have convicted the respondent of
murder.

If I am right in my view that the judgment of the Appellate
Division is based on distinct grounds, with one of which we cannot interfere
because it raises no question of law in the strict sense, it is of no
consequence that the other grounds on which they proceeded did raise such
questions of law. If authority be needed for this proposition it is to be

[Page 152]

found in the cases referred to by the Chief Justice during
the argument of the appeal, Gravestock v. Parkin5 and
Jacobs v. London County Council6: in the last mentioned case Lord
Simonds, with whom the other Law Lords agreed, said at page 369:

But, however this may be, there is in my opinion no
justification for regarding as obiter dictum a reason given by a judge for his
decision, because he has given another reason also. If it were a proper test to
ask whether the decision would have been the same apart from the proposition
alleged to be obiter, then a case which ex facie decided two things would
decide nothing.

At the risk of appearing repetitious, I venture to suggest
that if the learned Chief Justice of Alberta, as he might have done, had simply
said:

I am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot
be supported by the evidence … I would allow the appeal and quash the
conviction of murder … we order that the conviction for murder be quashed, and
a conviction of manslaughter be substituted.

no one would have suggested that this Court had power
to review the judgment of the Appellate Division. I am unable to see how we
acquire such power because the learned Chief Justice felt that he ""must go
further, and set out other reasons for setting aside the conviction""; his
use of the word ""other"" makes it plain that he had already given one
reason. The meaning of the word ""other"" as here used is that given
first in the Concise Oxford Dictionary ""not the same as one or more or
some already mentioned or implied, separate in identity, distinct in kind,
alternative or further or additional"". Once a distinct reason has been
given its character is not altered by the giving of additional reasons.

I conclude that the Appellate Division quashed the
conviction on the ground inter alia that it cannot be supported by the
evidence, that this was a distinct ground on which its judgment was based, that
it is a ground raising no question of law in the strict sense and that it is nihil
ad rem that the judgment was based also on other grounds raising such
points of law.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Locke J. (dissenting):—The
passage from the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Alberta which is
relied upon to support the argument that this Court is without jurisdiction to
entertain this appeal must be read together with

[Page 153]

other passages of the reasons which discuss the grounds upon
which that portion of the opinion is based. After saying:

I am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot
be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go further, and set out other
reasons for setting aside the conviction.

the learned Chief Justice said in part:

I would hold that there was non-direction amounting to misdirection,
if not misdirection, in respect of the offence of murder under Section 202 of
the Code. This is the only section under which the jury could have found the
accused guilty of murder.

and again, after referring to the fact that the belt of
the deceased was drawn tightly about his neck, this admittedly having been done
by the respondent, and that the medical evidence was to the effect that the man
had died of strangulation, it was said:

No one can say with assurance that the accused did not
believe Valpeters was dead on his becoming unconscious during the course of the
struggle and after the efforts to revive him had failed.

With great respect, I am of the opinion that upon the
evidence the accused might properly have been found guilty of murder under s.
201 of the Criminal Code and I consider the learned trial judge properly
charged the jury upon that section.

I am further of the opinion that the fact that the accused
may have believed that Valpeters was dead when he put the belt around his neck
and drew it tight does not affect the question as to whether the offence was
murder under either sections 201 or 202.

Upon the respondent's own statement, in the struggle with
Valpeters in the car he struck him several times with his fists and attempted
to throttle him and, after moving the car to another location, dragged the man
to the ditch and there placed and tightened the belt around his neck. These
were all facts which formed part of the offence of either murder or
manslaughter and were properly all considered together. The argument that the
various unlawful acts causing the death of a person may be split up and the
intention of the accused considered in respect of each of them separately was
made and rejected by the Judicial Committee in Thabo Meli
v. R7. In that case the accused

[Page 154]

persons had planned to kill the victim and had beaten him so
severely that they thought he was dead. They then threw his body over a cliff
for the purpose of indicating that the man had accidentally fallen over and
been killed. It was shown at the trial that the injured man died not from the
beating to which he had been subjected but from the exposure when lying out at
the foot of the cliff. The contention that as the accused persons thought the
man was dead when they threw him over the cliff and did this accordingly
without the intent of killing him was rejected, for reasons which are
applicable in the present case. I would add that a similar contention was
advanced in this Court and rejected in Bradley v. The Queen8.

I agree with my brother Fauteux, whose reasons I have had
the advantage of reading, that the language of the learned Chief Justice above
quoted does not indicate that the decision was rested upon the insufficiency of
the evidence. If, however, it should be so construed, it is my opinion that
there is jurisdiction in this Court to hear the appeal. Clearly, what is said
as to the insufficiency of the evidence refers only to a charge of murder under
s. 202 and not to such a charge under s. 201 and this, with respect, was
misdirection. It is further made manifest that one of the grounds for this
conclusion was the opinion that, as it could not be said with assurance that
the accused did not believe Valpeters to have been dead when he tightened the
belt around his neck, there could be no conviction for murder under s. 202.
These were errors in law, in my opinion, which this Court is vested with
jurisdiction to correct.

I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the
trial.

The judgment of Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ. was
delivered by

Fauteux J. (dissenting):—In
the early afternoon of August 24, 1959, two hunters discovered a body, in a
ditch beside a municipal road, outside the city limits of Edmonton, in the
Province of Alberta. The body, later identified

[Page 155]

as that of one Stanley Valpeters, was partly hidden by
growing grass and was lying face down with a belt around the neck.

The pathologist who subsequently performed the autopsy
observed, amongst other marks of violence, that there were, all around the
neck, a straplike constriction and a furrow to which blades of grass were
stuck. When the belt was exhibited to him and when told of its finding around
the neck of the body, he expressed the opinion that the furrow could have
resulted from a tension sustained for some time on the free end of the belt. He
estimated it would take a minimum of about five minutes for constriction to
stop the breath so as to cause
death. His findings indicated to him that Valpeters was alive prior to the
exertion of the pressure that caused the furrow. He concluded that death was
caused by strangulation.

Investigation by the police led to the arrest of respondent
a few days later, in the city of Toronto. Warner was then found in possession
of Valpeters' wallet and automobile, the wallet containing identification
papers of the latter and the license plates, issued for his automobile, having
been substituted.

Respondent made an admittedly voluntary statement to the
police. In the first part thereof, he relates at length and with details
various occasions during which, the week before the date of the fatal
occurrence and on the very day itself, he consumed alcoholic liquors. Then
follows a narration of events contemporaneous and immediately subsequent to the
killing of Valpeters, including his hurried departure from Edmonton, with all
the members of his family, in the automobile of the latter. Respondent says
that, in the early hours of the 23rd of August, 1959, the day before the
discovery of the body, he and the deceased, who were strangers to one another,
met casually on a street within the city limits of Edmonton. He accepted an
invitation of Valpeters to drive to a suitable place to consume a bottle of
liquor which the latter said he had in his automobile. They eventually stopped
on a gravel road ""or a kind of track or cattle-path in some bushes"",
where, on respondent's story, the following events took place:

He (Valpeters) says ""Let's get in the back seat because
the whiskey is there"". Both of us got in the back seat with him behind the
driver's seat and I was on his right. Instead of producing a bottle of whiskey

[Page 156]

he put his hand over and started to undo my pants. The next
thing I knew I got mad and proceeded to struggle with him. I started to choke
him. I don't remember too much how long I was choking him or what but when I
came to my sense again he was all limp.

I tried to feel a heart beat but couldn't and I got scared.
This was in the back seat with my door open and I tried artificial respiration
with him laying on the back seat. Nothing happened so I closed the back door
and climbed into the driver's seat. I backed the car out of there on to the
road and I drove a short distance from there. It wasn't very far. I got out and
pulled him out of the car into the ditch.

I don't know whether I was still mad or crazy but I took his
belt from his pants and wrapped it around his neck. I left him there.

I took his wallet from him but I don't know just what pocket
it was in. I put it in my own pocket. Then I drove out of there and went home.
It was just breaking daylight when I got home. I went into the house and got my
wife out of bed and told her we were leaving right away as we were going to
Drayton Valley and to pack everything that she could get in the car and we would
send for the rest of the stuff later.

Respondent was then charged with the murder of Valpeters. At
trial, he testified in his own defence repeating, with some additions, what he
had already stated to the police. Thus, he suggested that while wrestling in
the car, he was overpowered by his victim and then started to choke him. He
said he had some knowledge of first aid and that, to practise artificial
respiration, he thought it better, being in fear that attention of people in
the neighbourhood might have been attracted by the scuffle, to drive some
distance away. Having done so, he dragged Valpeters by the arm-pits in the
ditch where, he said, he attempted to revive him and then he put the belt
around his neck—an act for which, he testified, he was unable to account.

On this direct and other incriminating evidence of a
circumstantial nature, the jury, having been directed particularly on the
various issues raised in defence, to wit, drunkenness, provocation and
self-defence, found the accused guilty of murder.

Respondent appealed and, by a unanimous decision, the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court quashed the verdict of murder,
substituting thereto one of manslaughter.

The reasons for judgment were delivered by Ford C.J.A., and
concurred in by the other members of the Court. In the opening paragraph of his
reasons for judgment, the learned Chief Justice said:

I am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot
be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go further, and set out other
reasons for setting aside the conviction.

[Page 157]

He then proceeded to review the evidence, relating it
to the offence of murder under s. 202 Cr.C., i.e., murder associated with
robbery, and, having found fault with the address of the trial Judge in that
respect, he disposed of the appeal in the manner just indicated.

The Crown then applied to this Court for leave to appeal. On
this application, counsel for respondent, relying on the first sentence of the
opening paragraph of the reasons for judgment, contended that this Court had no
jurisdiction in the matter.

Subject to the right of respondent to raise the question of
jurisdiction at the hearing of the appeal on the merit, leave to appeal was
granted on questions of law here mentioned in the order in which they will
hereafter be considered:

(i) Did the Appellate Division err in law in holding that
only under section 202 of the Criminal Code could the jury have found the
accused guilty of murder.

(ii) Did the Appellate Division err in law in finding that
the trial judge should have put to the jury ""a suggestion"" that the
accused put the belt around Valpeters' neck to assist in dragging him from the
car to the ditch, in the absence of evidence to support any such suggestion;

(iii) Did the Appellate Division err in law in holding that
there was nondirection amounting to misdirection, if not misdirection, in
respect to the offence of murder under section 202 of the Criminal Code, and
that the grounds on which the jury could find the accused guilty of murder
while committing robbery were not placed before the jury as facts to be found
by them;

(iv) Did the Appellate Division err in law in holding that
the judge's charge was inadequate in failing to explain the theory advanced by
the Crown that strangulation was used to facilitate the commission of robbery,
and, hence, whether it was intended to cause death or not the act constituted
murder;

Dealing with the objection to the jurisdiction of this
Court.

It may well be impossible to affirm our jurisdiction in a
case where a Court of Appeal states, clearly and without more, that a verdict
is set aside on the ground that it cannot be supported by the evidence. This is
not the situation in the present case. Here, the Chief Justice said:

I am strongly of the opinion that the verdict of murder
cannot be supported by the evidence.

This sentence, he immediately and substantially
qualified in adding:

But I feel I must go further, and set out other reasons for
setting aside the conviction.

[Page 158]

Read together, these two sentences indicate, I think,
that while entertaining, even to a strong degree, the opinion expressed, the
Chief Justice was not ready to rest a decision upon it, but felt compelled to
""go further"" and give, not the other reasons, but ""other
reasons"", meaning reasons other than the opinion expressed, to justify
the setting aside of the verdict of murder. In other words, strong as was this
opinion, the Chief Justice was not satisfied that it had that degree of
finality required to assert it as a distinct ground for the decision of the
appeal which he ultimately rested on grounds stated as follows at the end of
his reasons for judgment:

I would hold that there was non direction amounting to
misdirection, if not misdirection, in respect of the offence of murder under s.
202 of the Code. This is the only section under which the jury could have found
the accused guilty of murder.

On this interpretation, the decisions in Gravestock
v. Parkin9 and Jacobs v. London County
Council10 have no application in this
case.

If, however, it can be said that the decision of the
Appellate Division was that the verdict of murder could not be supported on the
evidence, we must, in that event, read the remainder of the reasons for
judgment as being explanatory of the decision which had been reached. When that
is done, it appears to me to be clear that the conclusion rested upon the
proposition stated when the learned Chief Justice, after dealing with s. 202,
said: ""This is the only section under which the jury could have found the
accused guilty of murder."" This is tantamount to saying that there was no
evidence on which the jury could have convicted under s. 201, and that is a
question of law.

Has this Court jurisdiction to hear an appeal under such
circumstances? In my opinion it has. The situation is somewhat analogous to
that which arose in Lizotte v. The King11. In that case
the Court of King's Bench had affirmed a conviction of murder, one of the
grounds being that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice,
notwithstanding certain errors of law at the trial. The Court12 had
declared ""que la preuve justifie amplement le verdict"". Before this
Court it was contended, on behalf of the Crown,

[Page 159]

that, as this was a decision of fact, or mixed law and fact,
it was not subject to review in this Court. That argument was rejected in the
following terms at p. 134:

I do not think that this argument is entitled to prevail. In
the case at bar it might perhaps be disposed of by pointing out that in my
opinion there were serious errors in matters of law at the trial which the
Court of Appeal did not regard as being errors at all; but even had the Court
of Appeal found the existence of all the errors in law which in my view did
occur and nonetheless dismissed the appeal pursuant to section 1014(2), I do
not think that this court would be without jurisdiction.

Similarly, in my view, where it appears that a decision of a
court of appeal, that a verdict cannot be supported by the evidence, has been
founded on a wrong conclusion on a question of law, this Court is not without
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from it. That this occurred in the present
case is shown in the consideration of the first ground of appeal.

Dealing with the merits of the appeal. The question whether
the Appellate Division erred in law in holding that only under section 202
could the jury have found the accused guilty of murder, must be answered
affirmatively. As presented to the jury, the case was not and could not have
been legally confined to the issue of murder under section 202, i.e., murder
associated with robbery, but included the issue of murder under section 201. On
the latter issue, it was open to the jury to accept the opinion of the
pathologist that the straplike constriction and the furrow around the neck resulted
from a tension sustained for about five minutes on the free end of the belt and
that prior to the exertion of the tension, Valpeters was alive. From these
facts and subject to the consideration of the various defences raised,—which
were rejected,—the jury could validly infer an intention to kill and reach a
verdict of guilty of murder under section 201.

In his reasons for judgment, the Chief Justice said:

No one can say with assurance that the accused did not
believe Valpeters was dead on his becoming unconscious during the course of the
struggle and after the efforts to revive him had failed.

It has been suggested that this constitutes a finding of
fact which excludes the application of s. 201 of the Criminal Code, because, it
is contended, if the respondent believed Valpeters to be dead he could not
thereafter have conceived

[Page 160]

the intent to cause his death. It is then contended that,
being a finding of fact, this Court has no jurisdiction to disturb it.

It should be noted, however, that the learned Chief Justice
did not himself, in his reasons for judgment, relate the statement above quoted
to the conclusion which he ultimately reached that the respondent could not
have been convicted under s. 201. It occurs in the course of his consideration
of the adequacy of the charge to the jury by the learned trial Judge in respect
of the application of s. 202 of the Criminal Code, for, after discussing what
was said in the charge in relation to that matter, he said:

Taken by itself, this is not objectionable. But the real
question for the jury was whether or not what the accused did was done in the
course of a robbery and, basic to this, is the question of whether or not this
was a robbery; and that, in turn, depends upon the intent in the mind of the accused
up to the time that he thought the man was dead. No one can say with assurance
that the accused did not believe Valpeters was dead on his becoming unconscious
during the course of the struggle and after the efforts to revive him had
failed.

The question of the belief of the respondent as to the
condition of Valpeters after the struggle is thus related by the learned Chief
Justice solely to the question as to whether, prior to Valpeters becoming
unconscious during the course of the struggle, the respondent had formulated
the intent to rob him.

In any event, even if it could be said that the respondent
did believe Valpeters to be dead, it does not follow that, because of this
belief, he could not conceive the idea and form the intent to make definitely
certain that any possible spark of life be conclusively destroyed. It was
clearly open to the jury to infer that such an intent accompanied the
commission of the very acts of violence by which the respondent did actually
kill his victim; and this is murder under s. 201.

It was, therefore, an error in law to say that there was no
evidence upon which the jury could have found the accused guilty of murder
under the latter section, which is the conclusion, in a relation to that
section, which was ultimately reached by the learned Chief Justice.

With respect to the second question, there is nothing in the
evidence suggesting that the accused put the belt around Valpeters' neck to
assist in dragging him from the car to the

[Page 161]

ditch. On the contrary, in both his statements to the police
and in his testimony, the accused said that the placing of the belt took place
once the victim was in the ditch. The presence of blades of grass stuck to the
furrow found around the neck is significant. Moreover, on his own story given
at the trial, the accused specified that he dragged his victim by the armpits
in the ditch, in order to revive him by practising artificial respiration. The
jury having rejected his defence of drunkenness, the suggestion of the
Appellate Division is, with all deference, untenable. In directing a jury, the
trial judge has not the duty to speculate and instruct them as to all the views
which one might possibly take of the evidence.

As to the errors found in the Court below and referred to in
the third and fourth grounds of the appeal for the Crown, and as to the
numerous grievances alleged for respondent in the original and supplemental
notices of appeal to the Court below, I must say that, after having considered
the address of the trial Judge and the evidence, I can find nothing of real
substance. The jury were directed with exceptional care and clarity on all the
issues upon which it was the duty of the trial Judge to do so, and more
particularly on the defence of drunkenness, provocation and self-defence raised
by the accused and ultimately rejected by the jury. While failure of counsel
for an accused to object to the address of the trial Judge at the stage of
trial is not fatal, it may be added that though invited to submit objections,
none were offered by counsel.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the
Appellate Division, and restore the verdict of the jury.

Ritchie J.:—The
circumstances giving rise to this appeal are outlined in the reasons for
judgment of Mr. Justice Cartwright and Mr. Justice Fauteux which I have had the
benefit of reading.

In my view the opening words of the decision rendered by
Ford C.J. on behalf of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta
are the controlling factor in the determination of the difficult question as to
whether or not a question of law in the strict sense is raised by this appeal.
The learned Chief Justice said:

I am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot
be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go further, and set out other
reasons for setting aside the conviction.

[Page 162]

In the course of his decision, the learned Chief Justice
also held that s. 202 of the Criminal Code ""is the only-section
under which the jury could have found the accused guilty of murder"" and it
was contended on behalf of the appellant that this finding constituted an error
in law and formed the basis of the opinion of the Appellate Division that the
verdict of murder could not be supported by the evidence. It, therefore,
becomes necessary to examine the grounds upon which the Appellate Division
based its conclusion with respect to s. 202 of the Code.

Dominant amongst the reasons set out by the learned Chief
Justice for allowing this appeal is the finding that ""no one can say with
assurance that the accused did not believe Valpeters was dead on his becoming
unconscious during the course of the struggle and after the efforts to revive
him had failed"".

In my view this finding must be interpreted as meaning that
on the evidence before them, all the members of the Appellate Division
concluded that there was a reasonable doubt as to whether or not the respondent
believed his victim to be dead before the belt was placed around his neck. The
medical evidence was that the deceased came to his death by being strangled
with his belt and must, therefore, have been alive when the belt was first
applied, and it is implicit in the decision of the Appellate Division that this
evidence was accepted.

If the respondent had believed his living victim to be dead
after his efforts to revive him had failed, it follows that he could not
thereafter have conceived the intent to cause his death which is a necessary
ingredient of the offence of murder as described in s. 201 of the Criminal
Code for no man can intend to kill a person whom he thinks to be already
dead. It, therefore, seems to me that in finding that a reasonable doubt
existed as to whether or not the respondent believed his victim to be already
dead at the time when he in fact caused his death, the Appellate Division made
a finding of fact which excluded the application of s. 201 from the
circumstances of this case and which is not subject to review in this Court.

If the Appellate Division erred in finding that such a doubt
existed, then this was an error of fact from which other errors necessarily
flowed, including the finding that

[Page 163]

s. 202 was the only one under which the jury could have
found the accused guilty of murder. The latter conclusion follows directly from
the former, and, accordingly, in my view the error, if error it was, raises a
mixed question of fact and law, and as such is not a competent ground of appeal
to this Court (see The King v. Décary13).

I agree with Mr. Justice Cartwright that, as the Appellate
Division quashed the conviction on the ground, inter alia, that it could
not be supported by the evidence, no question of law in the strict sense is
raised by this appeal.

I would dismiss this appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.

Criminal law—Trading stamps—Criminal liability—Whether
Criminal Code definition of ""trading stamps"" exhaustive—Criminal
Code, 1953–64 (Can.), c. 61, ss. 322(b), 369(2).

The respondents in both appeals, the circumstances of which
were the same or similar, were charged with unlawfully giving trading stamps to
a customer, contrary to s. 369(2) of the Criminal Code. In each case the
magistrate dismissed the charge, and an appeal by way of a stated case was
dismissed by a majority in the Court of Appeal. The appellant appealed to this
Court.

Held: The appeals should be dismissed.

Per Curiam: The only object in deleting the words
""besides trading stamps commonly so called"" from the definition of
trading stamps section in the 1953 revision of the Code (s. 322(b)) was to make
the present definition exhaustive. The word ""include"" had an
exhaustive definition in the present case.

There was no general accepted definition of ""trading
stamps"". Here the stamp was not token currency, nor was it used in the
obtaining of goods; it was not usable instead of money in procuring articles
from the issuer of the stamps. The stamp could be redeemed only from the
respondent from whom the article had been purchased and at the premises where
it was sold; and the stamp showed upon its face the place where it was
delivered and where it was redeemable upon demand, and in fact where it was so
redeemed.

[Page 139]

Per Fauteux J.: The word ""includes"" in s.
322(b) of the Code was, in the context, exclusively related to the words
""any form""; it was not referable to what the documents or other
devices must be as to substance in order to come within the prohibition. While
all-embracing or all-inclusive as to the forms which may possibly be adopted
for such documents or devices, the definition was exhaustive as to the
particular features required as constituent elements of the prohibited trading
stamps. The precise specifications as to substance, contained in (b) (i), (ii)
and (iii) of the section as well as in the saving clause did not justify the
inference that Parliament intended, from the use of the word
""includes"", to extend the definition in order to cover any other
documents or devices as to which it said nothing with respect to features
attending issuance, nature of benefit and redemption.

APPEALS from judgments of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba1, affirming orders of acquittal of a
Police Magistrate.

J. A. Scollin, for the appellant in both
appeals.

Edward A. Pitblado, Q.C., and David
Procter, for the respondent, Loblaw Groceterias Co. (Manitoba) Ltd.

J. J. Robinette, Q.C., H. Solway,
Q.C., and J. F. R. Taylor, for the respondent, David Thomson
(Niagara I.G.A. Grocery).

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Locke, Abbott and
Martland JJ. was delivered by

The Chief Justice:—These
two appeals were argued together. I deal first with that in connection with
Loblaw Groceterias Co. (Man.) Limited, which is an appeal against a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Manitoba2 on an appeal to it by way of stated
case against an order or judgment of acquittal of a Police Magistrate. By
answering the three questions submitted to it in the affirmative the Court of
Appeal held that on the facts found by the Magistrate, as to which there is no
dispute, he had correctly dismissed the charge against that respondent company
that it did on November 17, 1959, at Winnipeg, unlawfully, being a merchant or
dealer in goods, by its employee or agent, directly, or indirectly, give
trading stamps to William Hrycyk, a person who purchased goods from it.

[Page 140]

The charge was laid under subs. 2 of s. 369 of the Criminal
Code, 1953–54, c. 51:

(2) Every one who, being a merchant or dealer in goods, by
himself or his employee or agent, directly or indirectly gives or in any way
disposes of, or offers to give or in any way dispose of, trading stamps to a
person who purchases goods from him is guilty of an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

Section 369 appears in Part VIII and the first section
in that Part reads as follows:

322. In this Part,

(a) ""goods"" means anything that is the
subject of trade or commerce; and

(b) ""trading stamps"" includes any form of
cash receipt, receipt, coupon, premium ticket or other device, designed or
intended to be given to the purchaser of goods by the vendor thereof or on his
behalf, and to represent a discount on the price of the goods or a premium to
the purchaser thereof 

(i) that may be redeemed

(A) by any person other than the
vendor, the person from whom the vendor purchased the goods, or the
manufacturer of the goods,

(B) by the vendor, the person
from whom the vendor purchased the goods, or the manufacturer of the goods in
cash or in goods that are not his property in whole or in part, or

(C) by the vendor elsewhere than
in the premises where the goods are purchased; or

(ii) that does not show upon its
face the place where it is delivered and the merchantable value thereof; or

(iii) that may not be redeemed
upon demand at any time,

but an offer, endorsed by the manufacturer upon a wrapper or
container in which goods are sold, of a premium or reward for the return of
that wrapper or container to the manufacturer is not a trading stamp.

The respondent is a merchant or dealer in goods doing
business at 1445 Main St. North, Winnipeg. On November 17, 1959, a member of
the Winnipeg City police force, William Hrycyk, purchased from the respondent
at that address, one tin of sardines for which he paid ten cents; at the time
of the purchase Hrycyk was given by an employee of the respondent, one
""Lucky Green stamp"" and a book, called a stamp saver book, in which
could be pasted that stamp and any others secured by the purchaser from time to
time. On the face of the stamp appear the words:

Redeemable at any time

Merchantable Value 2 Mills

1445-Main St. N.

Winnipeg

B.C. Premium Company

[Page 141]

and the stamp saver book states that the stamps are
redeemable at any time and only at the store from which original purchases were
made, and, further that the gifts illustrated in the premium catalogue are the
property of the retailer. There were filed before the Magistrate as one exhibit
a premium catalogue and supplements thereto and it was agreed that the lucky
green stamp scheme was as detailed in that exhibit. Hrycyk presented the stamp
and book to the manager of the respondent's store at the above address for
redemption and he was handed by the manager two cake cups.

The answer given by the majority of the Court of Appeal to
each of the following questions submitted by the Magistrate was:
""Yes"".

1. Was I right in law in holding that the word
""includes"" in Section 322(b) of the Criminal Code is to be construed
as ""means and includes""?

2. Was I right in law in holding that the stamp given to the
said William Hrycyk by the said Loblaw Groceterias Co. Manitoba Limited is not
a trading stamp within the meaning of the term ""Trading stamps"" in
Section 322(b) of the Criminal Code?

3. Was I right in law in holding that the stamp given to the
said William Hrycyk by the said Loblaw Groceterias Co. Manitoba Limited is not
a trading stamp within the meaning of the term ""trading stamps"" in
Section 369(2) of the Criminal Code?

Tritschler J.A. and Miller J.A. would have answered
""No"" to the questions.

The problem to be decided is whether the lucky green stamp
is a ""trading stamp"" within the meaning of the Code and more
particularly whether the definition of ""trading stamps"" in s. 322(b)
is exhaustive. The history of the Criminal Code dealing with trading
stamps shows that the first legislation by Parliament was enacted by c. 9 of
the Statutes of 1905, amending the 1892 Code by the introduction of ss. 526(a)
and 526(b). Until the amendments made to the Code, when it was revised
in 1953 (Statutes of Canada 1953–54, c. 51), the definition section read in
part:

""trading stamps"" includes, besides trading stamps
commonly so called, any form of cash receipt, receipt, coupon, premium ticket
or other device, designed or intended to be given to the purchaser of the goods
by the vendor…

[Page 142]

The definition section 322 inserted in the revision of
1953 deleted the underlined words. I can conceive of no object in deleting
these words except to make the present definition of trading stamps exhaustive.
Counsel for the appellant relies upon the statement of Lord Watson delivering
the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Dilworth v. New Zealand
Commissioner of Stamps3. He was there referring to ss. 2
and 3 of the Charitable Gifts Duties Exemption Act, 1883, as to which he
said:

Sect. 2 is, beyond all question, an interpretation clause,
and must have been intended by the Legislature to be taken into account in
construing the expression ""charitable devise or bequest"", as it
occurs in s. 3. It is not said in terms that ""charitable bequest""
shall mean one or other of the things which are enumerated, but that it shall
""include"" them. The word ""include"" is very generally used
in interpretation clauses in order to enlarge the meaning of words or phrases
occurring in the body of the statute; and when it is so used these words or
phrases must be construed as comprehending, not only such things as they
signify according to their natural import, but also those things which the
interpretation clause declares that they shall include.

However, Lord Watson continues:

But the word ""include"" is susceptible of another
construction, which may become imperative, if the context of the Act is
sufficient to show that it was not merely employed for the purpose of adding to
the natural significance of the words or expressions defined. It may be
equivalent to ""mean and include"", and in that case it may afford an
exhaustive explanation of the meaning which, for the purposes of the Act, must
invariably be attached to these words or expressions.

If authority were needed, the last part of Lord Watson's
statement shows that ""include"" may be an exhaustive definition and
for the reasons above stated that is the case in the present appeal.

Furthermore, a reference to the dictionaries mentioned by
counsel for the respondent and for the appellant shows that there is no general
accepted definition of ""trading stamps"". Certainly the stamp here in
question is not token currency; it is not used in the obtaining of goods; it is
not usable instead of money in procuring articles from the issuer of the
stamps, B.C. Premium Company. The stamp delivered to Hrycyk could be redeemed
only from the respondent from whom the tin of sardines had been purchased and
at the premises where it was sold; and the stamp shows upon its

[Page 143]

face the place where it was delivered and where it was
redeemable upon demand, and, in fact, where it was so redeemed.

In the Thomson case, the purchaser, Hrycyk, purchased a tin
of sardines from David Thomson, trading under the name and style of Niagara IGA
Grocery, and upon demand received one safety pin. Hrycyk had received a stamp
and a stamp saver book similar to the articles described in considering the
Loblaw appeal and the same or similar circumstances existed.

The appeals should be dismissed.

Fauteux
J.:—Respondents were charged under sub-section (2) of s. 369 Cr. C., 1953–1954,
c. 51:

(2) Every one who, being a merchant or dealer in goods, by
himself or his employee or agent, directly or indirectly gives or in any way
disposes of, or offers to give or in any way dispose of, trading stamps to a
person who purchases goods from him is guilty of an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

The expression ""trading stamps"" is defined as
follows in s. 322(b):

322 (b) ""trading stamps"" includes any form of cash
receipt, receipt, coupon, premium ticket or other device, designed or intended
to be given to the purchaser of goods by the vendor thereof or on his behalf,
and to represent a discount on the price of the goods or a premium to the
purchaser thereof

(i) that may be redeemed

(A) by any person other than the
vendor, the person from whom the vendor purchased the goods, or the
manufacturer of the goods,

(B) by the vendor, the person
from whom the vendor purchased the goods, or the manufacturer of the goods in
cash or in goods that are not his property in whole or in part, or

(C) by the vendor elsewhere than
in the premises where the goods are purchased; or

(ii) that does not show upon its
face the place where it is delivered and the merchantable value thereof; or

(iii) that may not be redeemed upon
demand at any time,

but an offer, endorsed by the manufacturer upon a wrapper or
container in which goods are sold, of a premium or reward for the return of
that wrapper or container to the manufacturer is not a trading stamp.

In essence, the question is whether this definition of
trading stamps is exhaustive, or whether, as contended for by both appellants,
it contemplates a class of trading stamps other than the one as to which
specifications are given.

[Page 144]

The word ""includes"", appearing in the first line
of the definition is, in the context, exclusively related to the words
""any form""; it is not referable to what the documents mentioned or
other devices must be as to substance in order to come within the prohibition.
While all-embracing or all-inclusive as to the forms which may possibly be
adopted for such documents or devices, the definition is exhaustive as to the
particular features required as constituent elements of the prohibited trading
stamps. The precise specifications as to substance, contained in (b)(i),.(ii)
and (iii) of the section as well as in the saving clause appearing at the very
end of it, do not justify the inference that Parliament intended, from the use
of the word ""includes"", to extend the definition in order to cover
any other documents or devices as to which it said nothing with respect to
features attending issuance, nature of benefit and redemption.

For the reasons given by the Chief Justice and the reasons
above, I would dismiss the appeals.

MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL.

Criminal law—Leave to appeal to Supreme Court of
Canada—Conspiracy to traffic in drugs—Sentence of 12 years—New Criminal Code
coming into force during period of offence—Leave to appeal from sentence
sought—Whether jurisdiction to entertain appeal—Criminal Code,

[Page 61]

1953-54(Can.), c. 51, ss. 408(1)(d), 597(1)(b)—Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, ss. 573, 1023—The Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c.
259, s. 41.

The appellant was convicted of conspiracy to traffic in drugs
and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment, pursuant to s. 408(1)(d) of the
new Criminal Code, which came into force during the period of time
within which the offence was committed. His appeal against the conviction was
dismissed by the Court of Appeal and leave to appeal to this Court from that
judgment was refused. His subsequent appeal against the sentence was also
dismissed by the Court of Appeal, and from that judgment he applied to this
Court for leave to appeal against the sentence on the question of law as to
whether s. 408(1)(d) was applicable, since, if it was not, the maximum
sentence for a conspiracy not specifically named in the former Code, as found
in s. 573, was 7 years. The Crown submitted that this Court was without
jurisdiction to grant leave. The appellant alleged an alteration of the prior
state of the law.

Held (Cartwright J. dissenting): This Court has no
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against a sentence imposed for the commission
of an indictable offence.

Per Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Ritchie JJ.: The
question whether this Court had any jurisdiction to entertain such an appeal
has always been negatively answered prior to the coming into force of the new
Code. Goldhamer v. The King, [1924] S.C.R. 290 and Parthenais v. The
King (1945) (unreported). An intent of Parliament to depart from this state
of the law could not be found either under the provisions of the new Code or
under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act.

As to the new Code. It is clear that no change has been made
as to the appellate provisions related to appeals to the Court of Appeal in
indictable offences. The distinction between an appeal against a conviction and
an appeal against a sentence still obtains. Both appeals are still separate
appeals as to substance and procedure and lead to two distinct judgments. As to
appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada, the true meaning of the expression
""whose conviction is affirmed by the Court of Appeal"" in s. 597(1)(b)
must be ascertained by reference to the appellate provisions related to an
appeal to the Court of Appeal. On these provisions, the ""conviction""
which the latter Court may affirm is a conviction within the narrow meaning of Goldhamer
v. The King. ""The judgment appealed from"", referred to in s.
597(1)(b), is the judgment against which an appeal is given under
s. 597(1); and, as nowhere but in the opening words of the section is an appeal
given, that judgment must be a judgment capable of coming within the language
of the opening words. Although the words ""in affirmance of the
conviction"", which were in s. 1024 of the former Code, do not appear in s.
597(1), they are clearly and necessarily implied in s. 597. No significance
could be attached to the fact that s. 1024 provided for an appeal at large
while under s. 597 the appeal is restricted to pure questions of law. Because
it may be said in certain cases that an applicant comes within the description
of a person to whom a right of appeal is given in the opening words of s. 597,
it does not follow that his application does so or in other words, that the
right given is a right to appeal against a conviction in the wider sense.

[Page 62]

As to s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act. The
inconsistencies flowing from the interpretations put by the appellant on s. 41,
clearly indicate that it was never intended by Parliament that the right of
appeal given under this section would extend to indictable offences, as
distinguished from non indictable offences. This is supported by the fact that,
under the Code, the appeals to this Court with respect to indictable offences
are dealt with in the appellate provisions related to appeal to this Court
under the Code. It is further supported by the clear contradiction which would
exist between the special appellate provisions under the Code and the general
appellate provisions under s. 41.

Per Cartwright J., dissenting: The
application falls within the literal meaning of the words in s. 597; and the
terms of ss. 583, 592 and 593 do not appear to require the Court to construe s.
597 in the limited sense contended for by the respondent. The case of Goldhamer
v. The King was distinguishable. One of the primary purposes of Parliament
in enacting s. 597 in its present form would be pro tanto thwarted if it
were held that this Court was without jurisdiction to deal with a pure point of
law as to whether a sentence imposed was or was not authorized by statute. No
sufficient reason has been advanced for interpreting s. 597 so as to refuse a
jurisdiction which appears to be conferred by the words of that section
construed in their ordinary and literal meaning.

Another line of reasoning leads to the same conclusion.
Reading s. 597 of the Code and s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act together
and as explanatory of each other, as should be done since they are in pari
materia, the word ""conviction"" in both sections should be read
""with a signification including the sentence"", giving thereby effect
to the apparent intention of Parliament that the jurisdiction of this Court in
criminal matters should be strictly limited to points of law and yet wide
enough to assure uniformity in the interpretation of the criminal law
throughout the country.

APPLICATION for leave to appeal from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming a sentence. Application refused,
Cartwright J. dissenting.

M. Robb, Q.C., for the appellant.

J. D. Hilton, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Ritchie JJ.
was delivered by

Fauteux J.:—This
is a motion for leave to appeal to this Court against a sentence, imposed by
the trial judge and subsequently confirmed by a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, on a conviction for an indictable offence.

Goldhar was indicted for having, in the city of Toronto and
elsewhere in the province of Ontario, between the 15th of March and the 6th of
August, 1955, conspired with

[Page 63]

others to commit the indictable offence of having in their
possession a drug for the purposes of trafficking. On this charge, he was found
guilty by a jury, on the 4th of May, 1956, and thereupon sentenced to twelve
years imprisonment, pursuant to s. 408(1)(d) of the Criminal
Code, 2-3 Elizabeth II, hereafter referred to as the new Code.

During the period of time, within which the offence charged
was committed, i.e. on the first day of April 1955, the new Code came into
force; and this fact gives rise to the question of law on which leave to appeal
is now sought. As formulated, on behalf of the applicant, the question is
whether s. 408(1)(d) of the new Code is applicable to the
conspiracy committed, since, if it is not, the maximum sentence for a
conspiracy not specifically named in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c.
36, is found under s. 573 of the said Statute, namely seven (7) years.

The point of law raised is undoubtedly one of substance and
may possibly, depending particularly of the evidence in the record, affect the
judgment rendered by the Court of Appeal, if leave is granted. However, the
primary and major question to be considered and determined is whether this
Court has any jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against a sentence imposed
for the commission of an indictable offence.

That such a question has always been negatively answered,
prior to the coming into force of the new Code, is not open to question.

In Goldhamer v. His Majesty the King1, the appellant, having
been found guilty of a criminal offence, was sentenced to pay a fine of four
hundred dollars or to be imprisoned during three months in default of payment.
After the fine had been paid, the Attorney-General appealed against the
sentence, under s. 1013 Cr. C; and by a majority judgment, the Court of Appeal,
in addition to the fine, condemned the appellant to be imprisoned for a period
of six months. On a further appeal to this Court, it was decided that there was
no jurisdiction in the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain an appeal in the
matter of

[Page 64]

sentence, the right of appeal being restricted to an appeal
against the affirmance of a conviction. At the time of the decision of this
Court, the relevant part of s. 1024, under which the appeal purported to be
based, read as follows:

1024.—Any person convicted of any indictable offence, whose
conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section ten hundred and
thirteen, may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of
such conviction: Provided that no such appeal can be taken if the Court of
Appeal is unanimous in affirming the conviction, nor unless notice of appeal in
writing has been served on the Attorney-General within fifteen days after such
affirmance or such further time as may be allowed by the Supreme Court of
Canada or a judge thereof.

It is pointed out, in the reasons for judgment of this
Court, that the word ""conviction"" in s. 1024 cannot perhaps be said
to be capable of only one necessarily exclusive meaning, but can be capable of
being employed with the signification including the sentence. The majority,
however, felt compelled to ascribe to the word the less technical sense which
excludes the sentence as distinguished from the conviction. The sole reason for
this interpretation and the decision consequential thereto is exclusively
founded on the clear distinction made in s. 1013, for the purposes of appeal in
indictable matters, between an appeal against a conviction and an appeal
against a sentence. The appellant in that case did not question the
appropriateness of the measure of the sentence but challenged, as a matter of
law, the right of the provincial Court of Appeal to interfere with a sentence
which had already been satisfied when the appeal to that Court was taken by the
Attorney-General. The nature of the ground, however, is entirely foreign to the
ratio decidendi. It is the right of appeal itself which was found not to
have been given by Parliament, in the matter of sentence.

Some twenty years after this decision, again the question
arose in the case of Parthenais v. The King2. Parthenais had entered an
appeal in this Court against a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal which
had increased the sentence imposed upon him on a plea of guilty to the charge

[Page 65]

of an indictable offence. At that time, the matter was
governed by what was then s. 1023 Cr. C., the relevant part of which read as
follows:

1023. Any person convicted of any indictable offence whose
conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section ten hundred and
thirteen may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of
such conviction on any question of law on which there has been dissent in the
Court of Appeal.

The point of law, upon which there was a dissent, was
whether the Attorney-General,—who took a more serious view of the facts of the
case than did the Crown prosecutor, in first instance,—could appeal to the
Court of Appeal against a sentence imposed upon a plea of guilty which had been
entered by the accused on the condition that the sentence, pre-agreed between
his counsel and counsel for the Crown, would be passed by the trial judge. The
distinction between an appeal against a conviction and an appeal against a
sentence, which had brought about the decision of this Court in Goldhamer,
supra, was still present in the appellate provisions related to appeals to
the provincial Courts. This Court followed the same course and, on the 2nd of
October, 1945, quashed the appeal for want of jurisdiction to entertain an
appeal against a sentence.

Such was the state of the law when the new Code was enacted
in 1954. The question is therefore whether an intent of Parliament to make such
a substantial departure from this state of the law, as would represent the
creation of a new right of appeal to this Court, can be found, as is suggested,
either under the relevant provisions of the new Code or under s. 41 of the Supreme
Court Act. In approaching the question, one must be mindful that a
legislature is not presumed to make any substantial alteration in the law
beyond what it explicitly declares, either in express terms or by clear
implication. This presumption against the implicit alteration of the law is
not, I think, of lesser moment where the new law, under which the alteration is
claimed, is of a nature such as that of the one here considered, to wit, a
revision of a Code.

The new Code. With respect to the appellate provisions
related to appeals to the Court of Appeal in indictable offences, it is clear
that no change has been made, in that,

[Page 66]

the distinction between an appeal against a conviction and
an appeal against a sentence still obtains. Both appeals are still separate
appeals as to substance and procedure, and lead to two distinct judgments. With
respect to the appellate provisions related to appeals to the Supreme Court of
Canada, the section of the new Code, relied on by counsel for the applicant as
a basis for his application and under which the alteration of the prior state
of the law is claimed, is s. 597(1)(b), which reads as follows:

597. (1) A person who is convicted of an indictable offence
whose conviction is affirmed by the Court of Appeal may appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada

(a)..............................................................................................................................
………………………………………………………………………………………………

(b) on any question
of law, if leave to appeal is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada within
twenty-one days after the judgment appealed from is pronounced or within such
extended time as the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof may, for
special reasons, allow.

The opening words of that section make it equally clear that
the right of appeal to this Court is given to one who is (i) a person who is
convicted of an indictable offence and (ii) whose conviction is affirmed by the
Court of Appeal. The true meaning of the expression, in (ii), ""whose
conviction is affirmed by the Court of Appeal"" must, of necessity, be
ascertained by reference to the appellate provisions related to an appeal to
the Court of Appeal. And again, on these provisions, the
""conviction"", which the latter Court may affirm, is a conviction
within the narrow meaning ascribed by this Court in Goldhamer, supra. If,
contrary to that decision, the word was here given the wider sense which
includes the sentence, it would follow that one ""whose sentence is affirmed
by the Court of Appeal"" would have a right of appeal to this Court,
while one, whose sentence is not affirmed but increased by the Court of Appeal,
would not.

Adverting now to the provisions of (a) and (b)
of s. 597(1). These provisions are related to the right of appeal given under
the opening words. In (a), they restrict the right of appeal to
questions of law. And, in (b), they condition the exercise of the
right to the obtention of a leave and prescribe the delay within which, after
""the judgment appealed from is pronounced"", such leave must be
granted.

""The judgment appealed from"", referred to in (b),
is the judgment against which an appeal is given under s. 597(1); and, as
nowhere, but in the opening words thereof, is an appeal given, ""the
judgment appealed from"" must be a judgment capable of coming within the
language of the opening words. On this language and for the reasons just
mentioned, such a judgment can only be a judgment in affirmance of a conviction
and not related to the matter of sentence.

Having considered the following points advanced in support
of the application, I must say, with deference, that I am unable to find that
they are valid.

Reference is made and significance is attached to two points
of difference emerging from a comparison of s. 1024, under which Goldhamer was
decided, with s. 597(1) of the new Code. The first is that the words ""in
affirmance of the conviction"", which were in the former section, do not
appear in the latter. In my view and for the reasons just mentioned, these
words are clearly and necessarily implied in s. 597. The second point is that
s. 1024 provided for an appeal at large while under s. 597, the appeal is
restricted to pure questions of law. The range or nature of the questions
raised in support of an appeal is foreign to the ratio decidendi in Goldhamer.
Furthermore, when the decision in that case was, twenty years later,
followed in Parthenais, the appeal to this Court was then, under the
relevant section, s. 1023, as it is to-day under s. 597(1), restricted to
questions of law.

It is then sought to ascribe to the word
""judgment"" in the phrase ""the judgment appealed from is
pronounced"", the usual meaning given to the word in a law dictionary.
This, I think, one is precluded to do for, in the context of s. 597, and in the
light of the other sections of the Code to which this particular section is
inextricably related, a judgment as to conviction and a judgment as to sentence
are, for the purposes of appeal, two separate judgments, each having a distinct
technical meaning under the Code.

It is also suggested that the applicant having been
convicted of an indictable offence and his conviction having been affirmed by
the Court of Appeal,—as, in fact, it was finally, prior to the launching of his
appeal to that Court, against the sentence,—his application falls within the
literal

[Page 68]

meaning of s. 597(1) (b). While, because of these
circumstances, it may be said that the applicant comes within the
description of a person to whom a right of appeal is given in the opening words
of the section, it does not follow that the application he makes does
so, or that, in other words, the right given to such a person is a right of
appeal against a conviction in the wider sense, as distinguished from a
conviction in the narrow technical sense given in Goldhamer. The premise
upon which this suggestion is predicated has no relevancy to the nature of the
right of appeal which is given under the section. It may also be added that, if
the interpretation contended for were accepted, in the result, Parliament would
have given a right of appeal against sentence to a person coming within the
language of the opening words of the section but would have refused a similar
right to a person who, having appealed to the Court of Appeal only against his
sentence, and not against his conviction, could never possibly come within that
language; for the Court of Appeal cannot affirm an unappealed conviction.

Finally, it is said that in enacting s. 597, in its present
form, one must find an apparent intention of Parliament to ensure uniformity in
the interpretation of criminal law throughout Canada and that such a purpose
would be, pro tanto, thwarted, if we were to hold that we are without
jurisdiction to deal with a pure point of law as to whether a sentence imposed
is or is not authorized by a statute. With respect to sentence, as
distinguished from conviction, I am quite unable, for the reasons above
indicated, to find such an intention of Parliament in s. 597. It also appears
that such an intent is negatived by the other appellate provisions related to
appeals to this Court. Under these appellate provisions, the right of appeal,
given to the Attorney-General, namely in s. 598, does not include the right to
appeal in the matter of sentence. For the implementation of this alleged intent
and purpose of Parliament, it is no less essential that a right, similar to the
one contended for on behalf of the applicant, be given to the Attorney-General;
but it has not been given.

[Page 69]

For these reasons, I am clearly of the view that nowhere in
the relevant provisions of the new Code, did Parliament indicate, either in
express terms or by clear implication, any intent to alter the prior state of
the law, under which there is no appeal to this Court in the matter of
sentence.

Section 41 of the Supreme Court Act. The relevant
parts of that section read as follows:

41. (1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the
Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other judgment of the
highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which
judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme
Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by
any other court.

(2) Leave to appeal under this section may be granted during
the period fixed by section 64 or within thirty days thereafter or within such
further extended time as the Supreme Court or a judge may either before or after
the expiry of the said thirty days fix or allow.

(3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this section
from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or
affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in
respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an
indictable offence.

To support applicant's contention that s. 41 confers
jurisdiction to this Court to entertain appeals in matters of sentence, imposed
in respect of indictable offences, the provisions of subsection (3) are assumed
to be subordinated to those of subsection (1)—in that, the latter states the
principle and the former, the exception—; and, on that assumption, the
following interpretation is given.

If matters of sentence are held to come within the language
of subsection (3), then, by force of the latter, they are excepted from the
operation of subsection (1); and, for this reason alone, this Court has no
jurisdiction.

If, on the contrary, matters of sentence are held not to
come within the language of subsection (3), then, not being excepted from the
operation of subsection (1), there is jurisdiction in this Court.

In both alternatives, however, this interpretation leads to
inconsistencies.

In the first alternative, while a judgment affirming a
sentence would be excepted from the operation of subsection (1) by force of
subsection (3), there are no words in the latter capable of excepting a
judgment increasing the

[Page 70]

sentence. And, in the result, this Court would have
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal when the sentence has been increased, but
would be without jurisdiction when it has been affirmed; and this, even if in
either case the question raised in support of the appeal be whether the
sentence is authorized or not by statute.

In the second alternative where, on the interpretation of
subsection (3), this Court would have jurisdiction in the matter of sentence,
the following inconsistencies would ensue. Contrary to what is the situation
with respect to every authorized appeal to this Court in criminal matters, the
appeal against sentence under s. 41 would not be restricted to pure questions
of law but would extend to questions of mixed law and facts and to pure
questions of fact. In addition, the delay within which leave to appeal must be
granted, being determined by subsection (2), would be, in the matter, far in
excess of the delay prescribed for the proper administration of justice in
criminal matters, for the obtention of leave to appeal to this Court against a
conviction or an acquittal.

I cannot think that Parliament ever intended or even
contemplated these inconsistencies flowing from either one of these
interpretations. And this, in my view, clearly indicates that it was never
intended by Parliament that the right of appeal given under s. 41 would extend
to indictable offences, as distinguished from non indictable offences.

This view is supported by the fact that, under the Criminal
Code, the appeals to this Court with respect to indictable offences are,
contrary to what is the case with respect to non indictable offences, dealt
with in the appellate provisions related to appeals to this Court under the
Code.

It is further supported by the clear contradiction which
would exist, on the view that Parliament intended to include indictable
offences in s. 41, between the special appellate provisions under the Code and
the general appellate provisions under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act.

Parliament is presumed to be consistent with itself and the
language of every Act must be construed as far as possible in accordance with
the terms of every other statute

[Page 71]

which it does not in express terms modify in a way avoiding
contradictions. It has been indicated above that, if s. 597 was interpreted as
giving a right of appeal as to sentences, inconsistencies would result and
that, on the contrary interpretation, there would not be any, the state of the
law remaining what it was prior to the enactment of the new Code. And it has
also been pointed out that inconsistencies would flow from the suggested
interpretation of s. 41. In these views, one cannot find, either under the Code
or under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, the explicit language required
to indicate an intent of Parliament to alter the prior state of the law as to
appeals to this Court in the matter of sentence imposed in respect of
indictable offences.

With great deference, I find it impossible to reconcile the
two Acts by interpreting the word ""conviction"" in both subsections
41(3) and 597(1) (b) as including sentence in indictable offences, for
each one of the subsections cannot be so interpreted without leading to
inconsistencies.

Under the former Code, appeals against sentence have always
been left to the final determination of the provincial Courts and there is
nothing, under the new Code or s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, indicating
a change of policy in the matter, with respect to indictable offences.

This Court is without jurisdiction to entertain the present
application which I would dismiss.

This being a matter of jurisdiction, all the Members of the
Court have been consulted and I am requested by the Court to say that all,
excepting our brother Cartwright, are in agreement with these reasons.

Cartwright J.
(dissenting):—This is an application for leave to appeal to this Court
from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, pronounced on May 29, 1959,
dismissing the applicant's appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by His
Honour Judge Macdonell on May 4, 1956. The appeal to the Court of Appeal was
brought pursuant to an order of that Court made on April 29, 1959, extending
the time for applying for leave to appeal and granting leave to appeal against
the sentence mentioned.

[Page 72]

On April 27, 1956, the accused was convicted before His
Honour Judge Macdonell at the sittings of the Court of General Sessions of the
Peace for the County of York on the charge that:

Jacob Rosenblat, Jack Goldhar (the applicant), Leonuell
Joseph Craig and Hannelore Rosenblum, at the City of Toronto, in the County of
York, and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario, between the 15th day of March
and the 6th day of August, in the year 1955, unlawfully did conspire together,
the one with the other or others of them and persons unknown, to commit the
indictable offence of having in their possession a drug, to wit,
diacetylmorphine, for the purpose of trafficking, an indictable offence under
the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, contrary to the Criminal Code.

On May 4, 1956, His Honour Judge Macdonell sentenced the
applicant to twelve years' imprisonment in Kingston Penitentiary.

An appeal against this conviction (but not against the
sentence imposed) was taken to the Court of Appeal for Ontario3 and was dismissed on February 13,
1957; leave to appeal to this Court from that judgment was refused4 on May 1, 1957.

The sentence of twelve years was imposed pursuant to s.
408(1)(d) of the Criminal Code, as enacted by 2-3
Elizabeth II, c. 51, which came into force on April 1, 1955, and is referred to
in these reasons as ""the new code"". Section 408 reads in part as
follows:

408(1) Except where otherwise expressly provided by law, the
following provisions apply in respect of conspiracy, namely,

* * *

(d) every one who conspires with any one to
commit an indictable offence not provided for in paragraph (a), (b)
or (c) is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to the same
punishment as that to which an accused who is guilty of that offence would,
upon conviction, be liable.

The maximum term of imprisonment for the indictable offence
of having possession of a drug for the purpose of trafficking is fourteen
years, as provided by s. 4(3) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act which
section came into force on June 10, 1954.

Under the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36,
hereinafter referred to as ""the old code"", the maximum term of
imprisonment which could have been imposed upon the

[Page 73]

applicant for the offence of which he was convicted would
have been seven years, as provided by s. 573 of the old Code which reads as
follows:

573. Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable
to seven years' imprisonment who, in any case not hereinbefore provided for,
conspires with any person to commit any indictable offence.

The question of law on which leave to appeal to this Court
is sought is stated in the notice of motion as follows:

Whether Section 408(1)(d) of The Criminal Code
1953-1954, Ch. 51 is applicable to the conspiracy committed, since if it is not
the maximum sentence for a conspiracy not specifically named in The Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1927, Ch. 36, is found under Section 573 of the said Statute,
namely seven (7) years.

On the merits, it is sufficient, for purposes of this
motion, to say that the ground of appeal sought to be raised is, in my opinion,
one of substance and difficulty; its importance is obvious; if the applicant's
contention is upheld he will have been sentenced to five years' imprisonment in
excess of the maximum term permitted by law.

Counsel for the respondent submits that we are without
jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
dismissing an appeal against the sentence passed by the trial Court.

Counsel for the applicant bases his application on s.
597(1)(b) of the new Code which reads:

597. (1) A person who is convicted of an indictable offence
whose conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada

* * *

(b) on any question of law, if leave to appeal
is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada within twenty-one days after the
judgment appealed from is pronounced or within such extended time as the
Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof may, for special reasons, allow.

It will be observed that this application falls within the
literal meaning of the words quoted. The applicant is a person who has been
convicted of an indictable offence whose conviction has been affirmed by the
Court of Appeal and he seeks leave to appeal to this Court on a question of
law. It is important to observe that the present section does not say ""may
appeal against the affirmance of such conviction"" as did its
predecessor. It is contended for the

[Page 74]

respondent, however, that other provisions of the Code, the
history of the legislation and the jurisprudence dealing with it require us to
construe s. 597 as giving a convicted person a conditional right of appeal
against his conviction only and not against his sentence. It is pointed out
that s. 583 which confers upon a person convicted of an indictable offence the
right of appeal to the Court of Appeal distinguishes between (a) an appeal
against conviction and (b) an appeal against sentence, and that this
distinction is maintained in sections 592 and 593 the former of which sets out
the powers of the Court of Appeal on an appeal against conviction and the
latter the powers on an appeal against sentence.

The respondent also relies on the decision of this Court in Goldhamer
v. The King5.
In that case the appellant had been found guilty of an indictable offence
and sentenced by the trial court to pay a fine of $400 and in default of
payment thereof to be imprisoned for six months; he immediately paid the fine;
the Attorney-General of Quebec appealed to the Court of King's Bench under s.
1013 of the Criminal Code and that Court increased the sentence by
adding thereto a term of imprisonment for six months; Bernier J. dissented but
gave no reasons for his dissent. The appellant thereupon appealed to this
Court. The question of jurisdiction was raised by the Court in the course of
the argument. Judgment was reserved and the appeal was in due course dismissed.
Duff J., as he then was, Mignault J. and Malouin J. were all of opinion that
there was no right of appeal and dismissed the appeal on that ground. Idington
J. was doubtful as to the Court's jurisdiction but thought that, in any event,
the appeal should be dismissed on the merits. He said in part at p. 292:

I cannot therefore confidently assert and hold that there is
no appeal possible under such circumstances as involved herein.

Maclean J. simply concurred in the dismissal of the
appeal. The ratio of the majority is found in the reasons of Duff J. at p. 293:

As my brother Idington points out, the word ""conviction""
cannot, perhaps, be said to be capable of only one necessarily exclusive
meaning, and it may be capable of being employed with a signification including

[Page 75]

the sentence. Section 1013 does, however, I think,
distinguish very clearly between the conviction and the sentence for the
purposes of appeal, and the Act of 13–14 Geo. V., by which the present section
was brought into force, made no change in section 1024. Accordingly, I think
the word ""conviction' in the last mentioned section should be read in its
less technical sense, and consequently that there is no right of appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment given by a court of appeal on an
appeal under subsection (2) of section 1013.

and in the reasons of Mignault J. (with whom Malouin J.
agreed) at pages 293 and 294:

Our jurisdiction is governed by article 1024 of the Criminal
Code, which states, with a proviso which need not be mentioned here, that any
person convicted of any indictable offence, whose conviction has been affirmed
on an appeal taken under article 1013, may appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada against the affirmance of such conviction.

As now amended, article 1013 gives a right of appeal against
a conviction, and against a sentence pronounced by the trial court against a
person convicted on indictment. Article 1024 was not amended by the 1923
statute and under it the right of appeal is restricted to an appeal against the
affirmance of the conviction. Reading it with article 1013, as amended, the
appeal from the sentence under paragraph 2 of article 1013 cannot be brought
before this Court.

When Goldhamer was decided the sections referred to
in the passages quoted, so far as relevant, read as follows:

1013 (1) A person convicted on indictment may appeal to the
court of appeal against his conviction—

(a) on any ground of
appeal which involves a question of law alone; and

(b) with leave of the
court of appeal, or upon the certificate of the trial court that it is a fit
case for appeal, on any ground of appeal which involves a question of fact
alone or a question of mixed law and fact; and

(c) with leave of the
court of appeal, on any other ground which appears to the court of appeal to be
a sufficient ground of appeal.

(2) A person convicted on indictment, or the Attorney
General, or the counsel for the Crown at the trial, may with leave of a judge
of the court of appeal, appeal to that court against the sentence passed by the
trial court, unless that sentence is one fixed by law.

* * *

1024. Any person convicted of any indictable offence, whose
conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section ten hundred and
thirteen may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of
such conviction: Provided that no such appeal can be taken if the court of
appeal is unanimous in affirming the conviction, nor unless

[Page 76]

notice of appeal in writing has been served on the Attorney
General within fifteen days after such affirmance or such further time as may
be allowed by the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof.

(2) The Supreme Court of Canada shall make such rule or
order thereon, either in affirmance of the conviction or for granting a new
trial, or otherwise, or for granting or refusing such application, as the
justice of the case requires, and shall make all other necessary rules and
orders for carrying such rule or order into effect.

The section now in force which corresponds with s. 1013
quoted above is s. 583 of the new Code reading as follows:

583. A person who is convicted by a trial court in
proceedings by indictment may appeal to the court of appeal

(a) against his conviction

(i) on any ground of appeal that
involves a question of law alone,

(ii) on any ground of appeal that
involves a question of fact alone or a question of mixed law and fact, with
leave of the court of appeal or upon the certificate of the trial judge that
the case is a proper case for appeal, or

(iii) on any ground of appeal not
mentioned in subparagraph (i) or (ii) that appears to the court of appeal to be
a sufficient ground of appeal, with leave of the court of appeal; or

(b) against the sentence passed by the trial
court, with leave of the court of appeal or a judge thereof unless that
sentence is one fixed by law.

For the purposes of the problem before us the differences in
wording between this section and s. 1013 are not significant.

When, however, s. 597 of the new Code is compared with s.
1024 under which Goldhamer was decided it will be observed that there
are the following points of difference; (i) as pointed out above, the words in
s. 1024 ""against the affirmance of such conviction"" have disappeared;
(ii) while under s. 1024 the appeal to this Court was at large, provided there
was a dissent in the Court below, the rights of appeal given by s. 597 are
restricted to questions of law; (iii) under s. 1024 the time for appealing ran
from ""such affirmance"" but under s. 597 it runs from the day when
""the judgment appealed from is pronounced""; the usual meaning of the
word ""judgment"" in criminal matters is, in my opinion, correctly
stated in the Dictionary of English Law by Earl Jowitt (1959) at p. 1025:

In criminal proceedings, the judgment is the sentence of the
court on the verdict of the jury, or on the prisoner pleading guilty to the
indictment. Where the jury acquits the prisoner, the judgment is that

[Page 77]

he be discharged; if he pleads guilty or is convicted, the
judgment declares the punishment which he has to suffer, e.g., death,
imprisonment, fine, etc.

These three differences appear to me to be sufficiently
substantial to prevent the decision in Goldhamer being regarded as
decisive of the question before us.

I have already indicated my view that this application falls
within the literal wording of s. 597; and the terms of ss. 583, 592 and 593 do
not appear to me to require us to construe s. 597 in the limited sense
contended for on behalf of the respondent.

If the meaning of the words used were ambiguous it would be
proper to consider the apparent intention of Parliament in enacting s. 597 in
its present form, as appearing from the history of the legislation. One of the
primary purposes appears to me to have been to confer upon this Court a
jurisdiction, to determine points of law arising in cases of indictable
offences, wide enough to ensure uniformity in the interpretation of the
criminal law throughout Canada. That purpose would be pro tanto thwarted
if we were to hold we are without jurisdiction to deal with a pure point of law
as to whether a sentence imposed is or is not authorized by statute.

In my opinion no sufficient reason has been advanced for
interpreting s. 597 so as to refuse a jurisdiction which appears to me to be
conferred upon the Court by the words of that section construed in their
ordinary and literal meaning.

There is another line of reasoning which leads me to the
same conclusion. Section 41 of the Supreme Court Act is in pari
materia with s. 597 of the new Code. Both sections deal with the
jurisdiction of this Court to grant leave to appeal from decisions of
provincial Courts.

In Rex v. Loxdale6,
Lord Mansfield said:

Where there are different statutes in pari materia though
made at different times, or even expired, and not referring to each other, they
shall be taken and construed together, as one system, and as explanatory
of each other.

[Page 78]

Section 597 of the Code has already been quoted.
Subsections (1) and (3) of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act read as
follows:

41 (1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the
Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other judgment of the
highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which
judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme
Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by
any other court.

* * *

(3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this section
from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or
affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in
respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an
indictable offence.

The words of subs. (1) unless they are cut down by the
opening phrase, ""Subject to subsection (3)"", are obviously wide
enough to confer jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal from the judgment of the
Court of Appeal affirming the sentence of 12 years' imprisonment passed upon
the applicant; it is a judgment, and indeed a final judgment, of the highest
court of final resort in the province in which judgment can be had in the
particular case, for ""judgment"" is defined in s. 2(d) as
follows:

(d) ""judgment"", when used with reference to
the court appealed from, includes any judgment, rule, order, decision, decree,
decretal order or sentence thereof;

If the words in subs. (3) ""the judgment of any court …
affirming a conviction … of an indictable offence"" are to be interpreted
as having the limited meaning ""affirming a verdict or finding of guilt
excluding the sentence imposed"" and not, to use the words of Duff J.,
quoted above, ""with a signification including the sentence"", it would
follow that the jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal from sentence is not
excluded by the words of subs. (3) from the wide power given by subs. (1). From
this in turn it would follow that under subs. (1) this Court would have
jurisdiction to give leave to appeal from a sentence and such an appeal would
not be restricted to questions of law. It appears to me extremely unlikely that
Parliament intended this result; it

[Page 79]

can be avoided by construing the words ""the judgment of
any court … affirming a conviction … of an indictable offence"" so as to
include the affirmation of the sentence.

When s. 597 of the Code and s. 41 of the Supreme Court
Act are read together it is my opinion that the word ""conviction""
in both sections should be read ""with a signification including the
sentence"" which construction gives effect to the apparent intention of
Parliament that our jurisdiction in criminal matters should be strictly limited
to points of law and yet wide enough to assure uniformity in the interpretation
of the criminal law throughout Canada.

It may be observed in passing that cases in which a sentence
can be questioned on a pure point of law are likely to be few and far between.

Having concluded that we have jurisdiction, I would, for the
reasons mentioned earlier, grant leave to appeal on the ground set out in the
notice of motion.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Narcotic drugs—Charge of trafficking—Evidence of association
with convicted drug addict—Alleged conspiracy by
police against accused—Whether acquittal on same
facts of charge of conspiracy to traffic raises question of res judicata—The Opium and Narcotic Drug
Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 201, s. 4, as re-enacted by 1953-54, c. 38.

The accused, who had
previously been acquitted on the same facts on a charge of conspiracy to commit
the same indictable offence, was convicted on the substantive charge of being
in possession of a drug for the purpose of trafficking. This conviction came at
a new trial ordered by the Court of Appeal. The conviction was affirmed by the
Court of Appeal, and the accused was granted leave by this Court to appeal on
six grounds.

Held (Cartwright J. dissenting):
The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Taschereau, Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: As held by the Court of Appeal, there
was no violation at the trial of the principle that the prosecution cannot
attack initially the character of the accused and that he is to be tried upon
the evidence pertaining to the crime with which he is charged.

[Page 187]

2. The evidence which the
accused sought to introduce for the purpose of attacking the credibility of the
witnesses, was not properly admissible. The accused wanted to show a conspiracy
on the part of the narcotic squad to prepare false reports and give false
evidence against him. It was proposed to lead evidence that two other persons,
at other hearings, had given inaccurate evidence, on the basis that such
evidence would be admissible because they were members of the same police squad
as the witnesses in this case and were “acting in concert” together. This was
proposed to be done by putting in evidence of a transcript of their testimony
at the other hearings.

3. The crown was under no
duty to call these two officers as they were not witnesses to the important
incidents related to this case. Consequently, there was no necessity for the
trial judge, in instructing the jury, to comment upon the fact that they had
not been called.

4. There was no substance
to the contention that the trial judge had failed adequately to present to the
jury the theory of the defence.








5. The submission that it
was wrong to permit the Crown to adduce evidence as to the movements of F (who
had been seen talking to the accused on the day of the offence) in the absence
of the accused, and as to F’s addiction to drugs and
his previous convictions for narcotic offences, could not be maintained. That
evidence was relevant to the charge of trafficking which was laid under s. 4(3)
(b) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. The clear purpose of s.
4(4) of the Act is that once there has been a finding of possession the onus then
rests upon the accused to prove that he was not in possession for the purpose
of trafficking. This cannot preclude the Crown from bringing evidence in its
case in chief to establish the purpose of trafficking, nor can defence counsel
preclude the leading of such evidence merely by stating, as was done in this
case, that the defence will be that the accused was not in possession of the
drug.

6. The accused contended
that the acquittal on the conspiracy charge must mean that the verdict resulted
from a finding that he was not in possession of the drug, that there was res
judicata in respect of the substantive charge and that he should have been
permitted to adduce evidence of the acquittal. That contention could not be
entertained. The essence of the charge of conspiracy is the agreement for that
purpose. The verdict of innocence only established his innocence in respect of
the conspiracy, and not that he was found not to be in possession. The
principle of res judicata enunciated in Sambasivam v. The Public
Prosecutor, Federation of Malaya, [1950] A.C. 458 at 479, only estops the
Crown in the later proceedings from questioning that which was in substance the
ratio of and fundamental to the decision of the earlier proceedings. The
acquittal in the earlier trial was not relevant to the charge which was the
subject-matter of this case and was not admissible in evidence.

Per Cartwright J., dissenting:
It was the duty of the trial judge to admit the evidence related to the
acquittal of the accused on the charge of conspiracy and to give to the jury an
unequivocal direction that in approaching the question of his guilt or
innocence they must give due weight to the facts thus conclusively established.
These facts were that during the period which included the date of the offence
of which the accused was convicted he was not engaged in a conspiracy with

[Page 188]

one J or others to have
possession of a drug for the purpose of trafficking; their relevance could not
be doubted as the Crown had elicited evidence tending to show that the
appellant was working in a conspiracy with J to have a drug for the purpose
mentioned. The matter fell within the reasoning of the Sambasivam case.
If an acquittal necessarily involves a finding of fact, which fact would be an
item of circumstantial evidence relevant to the question of guilt or innocence
on the subsequent trial on another charge of the person acquitted, that fact
may be proved in the last-mentioned trial, and is conclusively established by
proof of the acquittal. It was of no significance that in cross-examination,
the accused volunteered the information that he had been acquitted.

APPEAL from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the conviction
of the accused. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright J. dissenting.

M. Robb, Q.C., and C. Thomson,
for the appellant.

J.D. Hilton, Q.C., for the
respondent.



The
judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was
delivered by










MARTLAND
J.:—This is an appeal from a
judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario[2] affirming the conviction
of the appellant on a charge of being in possession of heroin for the purpose
of trafficking. The conviction was made following a trial by jury on November
18, 1958.



The
date of the offence alleged was September 18, 1955. The appellant was tried in
April, 1957, on a charge of conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of having
possession of heroin for the purpose of trafficking, and was acquitted. He was
tried before a jury on the substantive charge in October, 1957, and was
convicted, but, on appeal, the Court of Appeal[3] ordered a new trial,
following which the trial in question in these proceedings was held.



The
evidence on behalf of the Crown was mainly that of two RCMP officers, Corporal
Macauley and Constable Yurkiw. Briefly summarizedy, this was that at about 6.55
p.m. on September 18, 1955, the appellant was observed to make a throwing
motion near a hydro pole on Dupont Street in Toronto and then to depart. The
two officers then discovered a cigarette package near the pole, which contained

[Page 189]



fifty
capsules of heroin. Some of these were removed and then, after the package had
been initialled, it was replaced near the pole. As Yurkiw was about to replace
the package they saw one Fillmore, a convicted drug addict, walk past the pole.



Later,
at about 8.40 p.m., the appellant was seen to cross Dupont Street to the pole
and make a motion as though picking something up. The base of the pole was
subsequently searched and it was found that the package was gone. The police
officers then saw the appellant and Fillmore together about 240 feet away.



Later
they saw the appellant’s ear stalled in the middle
of the street on Lansdowne Avenue, about one block south of Dupont Street, and
being pushed by one Cook into a parking lot. The appellant then got into Cook’s car and drove away,
following which Macauley and Yurkiw found the appellant’s car on the parking lot.










Subsequently,
at about 9.30 p.m., the cigarette package, containing no narcotics, was found
on the lawn of a house about six to eight feet from the place where the
appellant and Fillmore had been seen earlier standing together.



Evidence
was given by Constable Webster of the RCMP that at about 11.30 p.m. he, in
company with Corporal LaBrash, saw the appellant and one Fred Walsh leave 180
Lansdowne Avenue, go to a parking lot and put something into the gas tank of
the appellant’s car. The appellant then
drove off.



Leave
to appeal to this Court was granted on six grounds of appeal, each of which was
fully argued.



The
first ground alleged was that the Crown led evidence and cross-examined the
appellant and other witnesses for the defence to show the appellant’s association with known
criminals, including persons with previous convictions for narcotic offences,
and to show that the appellant had committed other criminal acts of which he
had not been convicted. It was contended that the Crown had generally attacked
the appellant’s character, both before
and while he was in the witness box, and had sought to have it inferred that,
by reason of his alleged associations with persons of bad character, he was
likely to have committed the offence charged.

[Page 190]



With
respect to this point, I agree with what has been said concerning it in the
judgment of the Court of Appeal and am of the opinion that it fails.



The
second point argued was that counsel for the appellant had been prevented from
adducing the most substantial supporting aspects of his defence; namely, that a
small group of officers, acting in concert, were engaged in submitting false
reports and preparing false evidence to implicate the appellant in the traffic
of drugs during the period surrounding September 18, 1955.










The
evidence which counsel for the appellant sought to adduce was taken on the voir
dire, but was not given before the jury. In brief, it was that Constable
Tomalty of the RCMP, at the preliminary hearing, and Corporal LaBrash of the
RCMP, at the conspiracy trial, had testified to having seen the appellant in
the company of one Fred Walsh in the early hours of October 19, 1955,
whereas, in fact, the evidence was that Walsh was in custody at the No. 8
Police Station in Toronto, sometimes referred to as the Pape Avenue Station, at
the time in question.



The
contention of the appellant was that the Narcotic Squad of the RCMP in Toronto,
consisting of LaBrash, Macauley, Tomalty, Yurkiw and Webster, were “acting in concert” to prepare false reports
and give false evidence concerning the appellant and that the evidence above
referred to should have been admitted as being relevant to the establishment of
a conspiracy among them for that purpose.



It is
true that on a charge of conspiracy the acts and declarations of each
conspirator in furtherance of the common object are admissible in evidence as
against the rest. The same rule has been applied in civil cases. The rule is,
however, one which determines the admissibility of evidence as against a person
who is a party to legal proceedings.



In the
present case what is sought to be done is to introduce evidence of this kind,
not as against a person charged with conspiracy or sued in relation to a
conspiracy, but in respect of a witness who, it is alleged, was a party to a
conspiracy not the subject of these proceedings. In the one case the conspiracy
is in issue as a part of the case and the rule determines the kind of evidence
which may be adduced

[Page 191]



in
relation to that issue. In the present case it is proposed to lead such
evidence for the collateral purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness.










Facts
to establish bias on the part of a witness may be elicited on cross-examination
and, if denied, may be independently proved. It was open to the defence to
cross-examine Macauley and Yurkiw as to whether they were parties to a
conspiracy which sought wrongfully to obtain a conviction against the
appellant. If denied, evidence which directly implicated either of them as
being parties to a conspiracy for that purpose would be relevant because this
would relate directly to the establishing of bias. But the evidence sought to
be introduced here is not evidence of that kind. It was proposed to lead
evidence that two other persons, at other hearings, had given inaccurate
evidence, on the basis that such evidence would be admissible because they were
members of the same RCMP squad as the witnesses who gave evidence in this case
and were “acting in concert” together. This was
proposed to be done, not by calling these two persons themselves, but by
putting in evidence of a transcript of their testimony at the other hearings.
In my opinion this is not evidence which is properly admissible for the purpose
of attacking the credibility of the witnesses in this case.



The
third ground of appeal was that the Crown did not call as a witness either
LaBrash or Tomalty and that the learned trial judge did not instruct the jury
as to the inferences which they might draw from this fact.



That
counsel for the Crown was under no duty to call either Tomalty or LaBrash is, I
think, sufficiently established by the decision of this Court in LeMay v.
The King[4]. Neither LaBrash nor
Tomalty was a witness to the important incidents on Dupont Street on the
evening of September 18, 1955. Any evidence they could give related only to
collateral matters. This being so, I do not see why there was any necessity for
the learned trial judge, in instructing the jury, to make any comment upon the
fact that they had not been called to give evidence.

[Page 192]



The
fourth point submitted was that the learned trial judge failed adequately to
present to the jury the theory of the defence. I agree with the Court of
Appeal, that there is no substance to this contention.



The
fifth ground of appeal is that the Crown was permitted to adduce evidence as to
the movements of Fillmore in the absence of the appellant and as to Fillmore’s addiction to drugs and
his previous convictions for narcotic offences.



The
charge in this case was laid under s. 4(3) (b) of the Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act of being in possession of heroin for the purpose of
trafficking. The evidence relating to Fillmore was relevant to the question of
trafficking. The appellant contended, however, that, because of the provisions
of subs. (4) of s. 4 of that Act and because it had been stated by counsel for
the defence, at the outset of the trial, that the defence would be that the
appellant was not in possession of the drug at the time and place alleged, the
Crown was, therefore, not entitled to lead the evidence regarding Fillmore.



Subsection (4)
of s. 4 provides as follows:










In
any prosecution for an offence under paragraph (b) of
subsection (3), the court shall, unless the accused pleads guilty to the
charge, first make a finding as to whether or not the accused was in possession
of the drug; if the court finds that he was not in possession of the drug, the
court shall acquit him; if the court finds that the accused was in possession
of the drug, the court shall give the accused an opportunity of establishing
that he was not in possession of the drug for the purpose of trafficking, and
if the accused establishes that he was not in possession of the drug for the
purpose of trafficking, he shall be acquitted of the offence as charged but
shall, if the court finds that the accused was guilty of an offence under
subsection (1), be convicted under that subsection and sentenced
accordingly; and if the accused fails to establish that he was not in
possession of the drug for the purpose of trafficking he shall be convicted of
the offence as charged and sentenced accordingly.



The
clear purpose of this provision is that, in the case of a charge of being in
possession of a drug for the purpose of trafficking, once there has been a
finding of possession the onus then rests upon the accused to prove that he was
not in possession for the purpose of trafficking. I do not see how this can
preclude the Crown from bringing evidence in its case in chief to establish the
purpose of trafficking, or how defence counsel can preclude the leading of such
evidence

[Page 193]



merely
by stating that his defence will be that the accused was not in possession of
the drugs. The Crown must establish its case in respect of the charge laid.
Subsection (4) of s. 4 assists the Crown in proving its case once
possession has been established, but I cannot see how that subsection can
serve to prevent the adducing of evidence which is obviously relevant to the
charge as laid.



The
sixth point is that the appellant was not permitted to adduce evidence of his
previous acquittal on the charge of conspiracy, although the circumstances and
evidence upon which the conviction was sought in the conspiracy trial included
the incident upon which the substantive charge was based. It was contended by
the appellant that the learned trial judge refused to allow the defence to rely
on the findings of fact encompassed by the acquittal in the conspiracy charge
in so far as such findings might be relevant in relation to the substantive
charge of possession.










In
fact, on cross-examination the appellant did testify as to his acquittal on the
conspiracy charge, but counsel for the appellant was not permitted to lead
evidence otherwise to prove that acquittal. The learned trial judge was
obviously following the decision of the Court of Appeal made on the appeal
which had been taken in the first trial and which dealt with this specific
matter[5].



Counsel
for the appellant, on this phase of his argument, relied upon the statement of
the law regarding res judicata made by Lord MacDermott, who delivered
the reasons for the decision of the Privy Council in Sambasivam v. Public
Prosecutor, Federation of Malaya[6], as follows:



The
effect of a verdict of acquittal pronounced by a competent court on a lawful
charge and after a lawful trial is not completely stated by saying that the
person acquitted cannot be tried again for the same offence. To that it must be
added that the verdict is binding and conclusive in all subsequent proceedings
between the parties to the adjudication. The maxim “Res judicata pro veritate accipitur” is no less applicable to
criminal than to civil proceedings. Here, the appellant having been acquitted
at the first trial on the charge of having ammunition in his possession, the
prosecution was bound to accept the correctness of that verdict and was precluded
from taking any step to challenge it at the second trial. And the appellant was
no less entitled to rely on his acquittal in so far as it might be relevant in
his defence. That it was not conclusive of his innocence on the firearm charge
is plain, but it undoubtedly reduced in some degree the weight of

[Page 194]



the
case against him, for at the first trial the facts proved in support of one
charge were clearly relevant to the other having regard to the circumstances in
which the ammunition and revolver were found and the fact that they fitted each
other.



In that
case the accused had been tried on two charges, under the Emergency
Regulations, 1948, of carrying a firearm and of being in possession of
ammunition respectively. He was acquitted of the second charge, but a new trial
was ordered on the first one.



At the
second trial a statement of the accused was introduced which had not been in
evidence at the first trial. If accepted as the truth, it went to prove his
guilt on the second charge, of which he had been acquitted, as clearly as it
would establish his guilt on the first charge. The statement was admitted and
no intimation was given to the assessors of the fact that the accused had been
acquitted on the second charge and was, therefore, to be taken as innocent of
that offence.










In view
of these circumstances it was felt that the acquittal of the appellant on the
charge of being in possession of ammunition was relevant to the consideration
by the assessors in the second trial of the effect of this statement. It might
have been a ground for excluding the statement in its entirety, because it
could not have been severed satisfactorily. The result of the omission to refer
to the acquittal on the second charge was that the Crown was enabled to rely
upon the existence of facts in respect of which there had already been a
contrary finding in favour of the accused.



The
appellant does not contend that in every case an acquittal on a charge of
conspiracy must result in an acquittal on the substantive charge in respect of
the crime to which the alleged conspiracy related. His argument is that in a
case of the kind before us an accused could only become in wrongful possession
of narcotics as a result of a conspiracy with somebody. Therefore, he contends
that an acquittal on the conspiracy charge must mean that the verdict of
acquittal resulted from a finding that the accused was not in possession of the
drug. Consequently that finding is a bar to a conviction in respect of the
substantive offence.

[Page 195]



I do
not accept the validity of this reasoning. The conspiracy charge was in
relation to an alleged conspiracy to be in possession of drugs for the purpose
of trafficking. The essence of that charge is the agreement for that purpose.
The verdict of acquittal establishes, but only establishes, innocence in
respect of the conspiring. It does not establish that the appellant was found
not to be in possession of drugs. He could have been in possession of them
without being party to a conspiracy to have that possession for the purpose of
trafficking.



As I
see it, the principle of res judicata enunciated in the Sambasivam case
only estops the Crown in the later legal proceedings from questioning that
which was in substance the ratio of and fundamental to the decision in the
earlier proceedings. The use of the statement of the accused in that case
involved an allegation against the accused of guilt, in relation to the
possession of ammunition, which had already been decided in his favour. The
acquittal of the appellant, on the charge of having conspired with others to be
in possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking, did not decide in his
favour that he had not been in possession of drugs on September 18, 1955. This
being so, the acquittal in the earlier trial was not relevant to the charge
which was the subject-matter of the present proceedings and was not admissible
in evidence in those proceedings.



For the
foregoing reasons I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed, but
the time during which the appellant has been confined in prison pending the
determination of this appeal should count as part of the term of imprisonment
imposed pursuant to his conviction.










CARTWRIGHT
J. (dissenting):—The nature of this appeal
and the facts out of which it arises are stated in the reasons of my brother
Martland.



The notice
of motion for leave to appeal to this Court sought to raise six questions of
law and leave was granted as to all of them. I find it necessary, however, to
deal with only the following two of those questions:



2.
Whether the learned trial judge erred in law in preventing counsel for the
applicant from adducing the most substantial supporting aspects of his defence,
namely that a small group of officers acting in concert were

[Page 196]



engaged
in submitting false reports and preparing false evidence to implicate the
accused in the traffic of drugs during the period surrounding September 18th
1955, and whether the learned trial judge erred in law in not adequately
setting out to the jury the above theory of the defence?



* * *



6.
Whether the learned trial judge erred in law in refusing to allow counsel for
the applicant to adduce evidence of a previous acquittal of the applicant on a
charge of conspiring to possess narcotic drugs for the purpose of trafficking,
especially as evidence was led by the Crown of the applicant’s association with Victor
Jowett and certain other persons named and persons unknown during the period
under review, and erred in law in not charging the jury that such verdict of
acquittal was binding and conclusive in all subsequent proceedings between the
parties to the adjudication with respect to all facts which must necessarily
have been decided in favour of the applicant in order that the first verdict
could have been reached?



I
propose to deal first with the last-mentioned point.



In
September 1956 an indictment was preferred at the sittings of the Court of
General Sessions of the Peace for the County of York, count 1 of which read as
follows:



EDWIN
MCDONALD (the appellant) VICTOR JOWETT, JOSEPH NICOLUCCI, NORMAN LABRASSEUR,
SADIE MCINTOSH and FREDERICK WALSH, in the year 1955, at the City of Toronto,
in the County of York, and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario, unlawfully did
conspire together, the one with the other or others of them, and with Harry
Ross and persons unknown, to commit the indictable offence of having in their
possession a drug, to wit, diacetylmorphine, for the purpose of trafficking, an
indictable offence under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, contrary to the
Criminal Code.



Counts
2 to 5 inclusive charged Jowett, Nicolucci, Walsh, McIntosh and LaBrasseur with
having possession of the drug mentioned for the purpose of trafficking on or
about specified dates in the year 1955.










Count 6
read as follows:



6.
AND THE SAID JURORS FURTHER PRESENT that the said Edwin McDonald, on or about
the 18th day of September, in the year 1955, at the said City of Toronto,
unlawfully did have in his possession a drug, to wit, diacetylmorphine, for the
purpose of trafficking, contrary to Section 4(3) (b) of the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952, Chapter 201, and
amendments thereto.



In
December 1956, Jowett, Nicolucci, LaBrasseur, McIntosh and Walsh, were tried
together on count number 1, before His Honour Judge Forsyth and a jury and on
December 12, 1956, Jowett and Nicolucci were convicted and the other three were
acquitted.

[Page 197]



In
April, 1957, the appellant was tried on count number 1, before His Honour Judge
Forsyth and a jury and, on April 17, 1957, was acquitted.



In
October 1957, the appellant was tried on count number 6 before His Honour Judge
Factor and a jury and, on October 24, 1957, was convicted of having possession
of the drug mentioned for the purpose of trafficking; on the following day he
was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment.



On
March 3, 1958, the Court of Appeal[7] gave judgment quashing
this conviction and directing a new trial.



The new
trial was held before His Honour Judge Shea and a jury and resulted in a
conviction on November 18, 1958. On the following day the appellant was
sentenced to six years’ imprisonment. An appeal
was dismissed by the Court, of Appeal[8] on April 29, 1959, and it
is from that judgment that this appeal is brought.



In
order to deal adequately with question 6, it is necessary to say something as
to the course of the trial. It should first be mentioned that the indictment
was not placed before the jury; they were given only a copy of count 6.



In his
opening address to the jury Crown counsel said in part:










Now
the evidence began and it involves, as you heard from the charge, an incident
on the 18th of September 1955, that is quite a while ago, and that particular
day, pursuant to their instructions, two officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, Corporal Macauley and Police Constable Yurkiw, were proceeding, in
the course of an investigation, on Bloor St. in an easterly direction
some time shortly after supper, I think around 6.55. As they were proceeding
easterly, at the corner of Dundas and Bloor they were stopped for a stoplight
and they saw an automobile which they knew or believed was the automobile of
the accused Edwin McDonald, which was a red and black sedan, proceed in a
northerly direction on Dundas and make a sharp right hand turn to go east on
Bloor. Now in relation to their investigation they were interested in this
automobile, so when the light changed they took off after it.



After
outlining the incidents on Dupont St. in regard to the cigarette package
containing capsules of heroin described in the reasons of my brother Martland,
Crown counsel continued:



The
officers then went and got their car and started to go up and down the area to
see where they had gone, and a short time later working down through these side
streets got down to Bloor Street and as they

[Page 198]



were
coming in a westerly direction saw a car of one Cook, who was known to them,
go up Margueretta Street, made a left hand turn in front of them and they
went on past and went up Emerson Avenue, up the laneway, came across the stop
of Emerson Avenue ahead of the Cook car and paused at the top and allowed the
Cook car to pass them. I think they stopped about at the corner of Dufferin and
I forget the name of the street, Wallace I believe, and allowed the car to pass
them and they then followed this car and it came up and stopped back of the
McDonald car where it had been left on the north side of Dupont. McDonald got
out of Cook’s car, got into his own car
and drove it in a westerly direction on Dupont to Lansdowne.



* * *



McDonald
got again into the Cook car and proceeded into a house farther down Lansdowne
Avenue. Later that night, others observed, and the evidence will be how they
came back with other persons known to the Police and picked up the
McDonald car later on.



Counsel
for the appellant submits that the effect of these passages and particularly
the words I have italicized would be to convey to the jury that prior to the
date of the alleged offence the activities of the appellant and “others known to the police’’ were the subject of a
continuing investigation by the police, with the natural inference that the
appellant and these others were working in association.



The
first witness called by the Crown was Sergeant Gove who gave evidence as to the
taking of certain photographs and as to the examination he had made of the
cigarette package. In cross-examination, in the absence of the jury, counsel
for the appellant put the following questions to Sergeant Gove:










Q.
Now, Sergeant Gove, were you present at the trial of this same Edwin McDonald
at this same court room, in the Court of General Sessions of the Peace in the
County of York, held at Toronto, on the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 15th, 16th
and 17th days of April 1957 and did you give evidence at that trial on that
date?



* * *



Q.
And the next question, Sergeant Gove, is: was he, Edwin McDonald, there
acquitted of a charge of conspiracy with Victor Jowett, Joseph Nicolucci, Harry
Ross and persons unknown that at the City of Toronto, in the County of York,
and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario, in the year 1955 he did commit the
indictable offence of having in their possession a drug, to wit,
diacetylmorphine, for the purpose of trafficking, an indictable offence under
the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act.



* * *



Q.
And finally, Sergeant Gove, during that trial did you give substantially the
same evidence as you have given here with reference to the taking of
photographs at the general vicinity of Dupont and Emerson Avenues, Toronto, on
September the 19th and with respect to the handling of a cigarette package with
respect to fingerprints at some other time?

[Page 199]



All
these questions were objected to by Crown counsel and were disallowed by the
learned trial judge, who regarded himself as bound to follow this course by the
judgment of the Court of Appeal[9] on the appeal from the
conviction before His Honour Judge Factor.



In the
examination-in-chief of Corporal Macauley Crown counsel, referring to September
1955, brought out the following:



Q.
And who was living at 58 South Kingsway, Swansea, Ontario, at that time, to
your knowledge?



A.
The accused man Edwin McDonald and another man known to me as Victor Jowett.



In the
examination-in-chief of Constable Webster Crown counsel brought out that the
appellant had been seen at 58 South Kingsway with Frederick Walsh.



The
defence called a number of witnesses. Among these was Mrs. Near, a sister
of the appellant, who testified in chief that Corporal Macauley had made a
threat to the appellant some years prior to the date of the alleged offence at
a time when the appellant and his brother Alex were living with her, the
alleged threat being “I’ll get you yet”. In her cross‑examination by
Crown counsel the following appears:



Q.
And where is Alex now?



A.
Alex is living in Vancouver.










Q.
Is that all you know about Alex, do you not know—



A.
I beg your pardon?



Q.
Do you not know that he is in jail on the West Coast at the moment?



A.
No, I did not know that.



Q.
You didn’t? On a narcotics charge?



A.
No, I didn’t. He was here in July.



The
defence called Mary Olive Lehman who was living with the accused as his wife at
the time of the alleged offence to prove two things, (i) that he never went out
without her on Sundays during a period which included September, 1955, and (ii)
that he never went out without wearing a hat as he was sensitive about
premature baldness. In her cross‑examination, Crown counsel brought out
the fact that at the date of the alleged offence she and the appellant were

[Page 200]



living
in the same house with Jowett and his wife and that Jowett and the appellant
were working together in taking bets on horse-races. The cross-examination
continued:



Q.
Did you have, any knowledge at that time of any other source of income of this
man Jowett?



A.
I did not—I heard that he had sold
the odd car, that he was a car dealer or something like that.



Q.
But then you found out something else about him. What was that?



A.
Well I never found out anything until his court case came out, that I heard
anything about him.



Q.
What did you find out?



A.
Well that’s just what they said.



Q.
What was that?



A.
That he had something to do with narcotics, I don’t know. I still don’t know actually what it was
about.



Q.
That came as quite a surprise to you?



A.
Yes it did, because he seemed like a very nice man to me.



This
was the Jowett named in count 1 of the indictment.



The
effect of certain evidence given by police officers called by the Crown was
summarized as follows in the closing address of Crown counsel to the jury:










And
so much for all that my friend said in an, hour and a half this morning in
criticism of these officers. Why was the arrest not made for four months?
Staff-Sergeant Carson told you, the officers told you. This was one facet in a
larger investigation being carried on with great difficulty by these officers
in the interest of the public to stem the flow of illicit heroin into our city.
And it wasn’t important to pick up an
individual person who had a few “caps” but it was important, as
you all know from your general knowledge of Police activities and
investigations to find out what was the source, to get if they could the “top man”. And so they were
instructed to find out, not to arrest on that night but to find out where it
was that McDonald was getting his source of supply.



Following
the cross-examination of the witness Lehman and while she was still in the
witness box defence counsel again, in the absence of the jury, sought
permission to prove the fact that the appellant had been tried and acquitted on
count 1. Crown counsel again objected and again the learned trial judge refused
to allow this proof.



In my
opinion the evidence tendered should have been received. It was legally
admissible and was logically relevant to the question of the guilt or innocence
of the accused on count 6, the charge on which he was being tried, for as
between the Crown and the appellant his acquittal on count 1 conclusively
established the facts that foe was not on

[Page 201]



or
about September 18, 1955, or at any time in that year in conspiracy with Jowett
or any of the other persons described in count 1 to have in his possession a
drug for the purpose of trafficking. In my opinion it was the duty of the
learned trial judge to admit the evidence and having done so to give to the
jury an unequivocal direction that in approaching the question of the guilt or
innocence of the appellant they must give due weight to the facts thus
conclusively established.



I agree
with Mr. Robb’s submission that as a
matter of common sense it appears improbable, although not impossible, that the
appellant could have had the fifty capsules of heroin and dealt with them as
the officers testified he did unless he was engaged in a conspiracy such as that
of which he had been acquitted, and that therefore the fact that he was not so
engaged was relevant to the question which the jury were trying; but the matter
does not rest there; Crown counsel, as appears from what is set out above as to
the course of the trial, had elicited evidence having a tendency to show or at
least to suggest that the appellant was working in conspiracy with Jowett and
others, and the passage quoted from his closing address to the jury pointed
unmistakably in that direction.










In my
opinion the question falls within the reasoning contained in the passage from
the Sambasivam case quoted by my brother Martland and in the following
further passage at p. 480 of the report of that case:



The
fact appears to be—and the Board must judge of
this from the record and the submissions of counsel who argued the appeal—that the second trial ended
without anything having been said or done to inform the assessors that the
appellant had been found not guilty of being in possession of the ammunition
and was to be taken as entirely innocent of that offence. In fairness to the
appellant that should have been made clear when the statement had been put in
evidence, if not before.



Applying
this reasoning to the facts of the case at bar it is my opinion that in
fairness to the appellant the fact and the effect of his acquittal should have
been made clear to the jury when the Crown had adduced evidence of his
association with Jowett and of the latter’s conviction on a narcotic charge, if
not before.

[Page 202]



The
governing principle is that it an acquittal necessarily involves a finding of
fact, which fact would be an item of circumstantial evidence relevant to the
question of guilt or innocence on the subsequent trial on another charge of the
person acquitted, that fact may be proved in the last-mentioned trial, and is
conclusively established by proof of the acquittal.



It
follows that, in my view, question no. 6, quoted above, should be answered in
the affirmative, and this is fatal to the validity of the conviction.



I have
not overlooked the circumstance mentioned in the reasons of the Court of Appeal
that the appellant, in the course of his cross-examination, although not asked
about it, volunteered the information that he had been acquitted. In my opinion
this is of no significance. The appellant was entitled not only to have the
fact of the acquittal properly proved but also to have its effect clearly
explained to the jury by the learned trial judge in the manner I have indicated
above. Counsel agree that, in obedience to the ruling which the learned trial
judge had made, defence counsel made no reference to the acquittal in his
address to the jury.










Having
reached this conclusion it is not strictly necessary for me to deal with question
no. 2 but I wish to state briefly the principles on which, in my view, it would
fall to be decided if it were necessary to express a final opinion upon it. It
is clear that facts showing a witness to be biased may be elicited on
cross-examination or, if denied, independently proved; see R. v. Shaw[10] and Attorney-General v.
Hitch-cock[11]. Evidence showing that a
witness was a member of a conspiracy the object of which was to fabricate
evidence against a party would be admissible as it would be cogent evidence of
bias. I see no reason why in considering the admissibility of evidence tendered
to prove a witness to be a member of such a conspiracy the Court should not
follow the ordinary rule which is accurately stated in Phipson on Evidence, 9th
ed., p. 98, as follows:



On
charges of conspiracy, the acts and declarations of each conspirator in
furtherance of the common object are admissible against the rest; and it is
immaterial whether the existence of the conspiracy, or the participation
of the defendants be proved first, though either element is nugatory
without the other.

[Page 203]



Of
course the witness is not on trial, but once it is conceded that the question
whether or not he is a participant in such an alleged conspiracy may be
inquired into I see no reason why the rules of evidence which are applicable to
both civil and criminal combinations would not govern the admission of any
evidence tendered.



The
circumstance that where such evidence is offered much time might be expended at
a trial in inquiring into a collateral issue would not afford a sufficient
ground for refusing to receive it. To decide whether in the case at bar the
evidence tendered for the purpose of showing bias and rejected by the learned
trial judge was properly rejected would require a critical examination of the
record and as I have concluded that the appeal succeeds on another ground I do
not pursue this question further.



I would
allow the appeal and quash the conviction.



As the
view of the majority of the Court is that the appeal fails, nothing would be
gained by my expressing an opinion as to what further order should have been
made had the conviction been quashed.

Appeal dismissed,

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION..

Criminal law—Bribery—Reward given to government employee
in connection with dealings with Government—Disposition of bribe money—Criminal
Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 102(1)(b), 581(d), 584(1)(b), 595, 630(1),
(2).

The accused was acquitted at a non-jury trial of the
indictable offence of bribery under s. 102(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code. Subsequently, the trial judge issued an order directing the return to
the accused of the $400 bribe money, filed as exhibit in support of the charge.
On appeal by. the Crown, the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of
acquittal, directed that a verdict of guilty be entered and that the bribe
money remain in Court until further order. The accused appealed to this Court
against the conviction and the order.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Curiam: The appeal against the conviction
failed. The accused had dealings of some kind with the Government and the fact
that a trap was set had no bearing on the commission of the offence.

Per Kerwin C.J. and Abbott and Martland JJ.: Section
630(2) of the Code, under which the order of the trial judge for the return of
the money was made, had no application. The trial judge had acquitted the
accused and had not found that an indictable offence had been committed by
someone else. Nor was his jurisdiction assisted by

[Page 111]

Rule 909(2) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Alberta
respecting criminal appeals, since he did not make a special order as to the
custody or conditional release of any exhibit.

The submission that the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction
because no question of law was involved as required by s. 584 of the Code, must
fail. The trial judge purported to act under s. 630(2), and in view. of ss.
581(1) (d) and 595, the Crown could, by virtue of the extended meaning
of ""sentence"", appeal under s. 584(1) (b) with leave. It
should be taken that such leave was granted, as the Court of Appeal proceeded
to deal with the matter.

Even if there were jurisdiction in this Court to hear an
appeal from an order carrying those reasons—that the money should remain in
Court until further order—into effect, and whether it be a separate order or
part of one setting aside the acquittal and finding the accused guilty, there
was no substance in the appeal.

Per Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: This Court was without
jurisdiction to deal with the order in relation to the bribe money. The question
involved was not one coming within the ambit of any of the Criminal Code appellate
provisions related to appeals to this Court in indictable offences. Goldhar
v. The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 60.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate
Division1,
reversing a judgment of Primrose J. acquitting the accused. Appeal dismissed.

N. D. Maclean, Q.C., for the appellant.

H. J, Wilson, Q.C., and J. W.
Anderson, for the respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Abbott and Martland JJ.
was delivered by

The Chief Justice:—This
is an appeal against a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Province of
Alberta2
setting aside the acquittal of the present appellant on a charge that on
or about April 16th, A.D. 1958 at Edmonton he gave to an employee of the
Government of Alberta a reward as consideration for an act in connection with
dealings with the said Government of Alberta, contrary to the provisions of the
Criminal Code of Canada. The applicable provision of the Code is s.
102(1) (b) reading as follows:

102. (1) Every one commits an offence who

…………………………………………………………………………………...............…….

(b) having dealings of any kind with the government,
pays a commission or reward to or confers an advantage or benefit of any kind
upon an employee or official of the government with which he deals, or to any
member of his family, or to any one for the benefit

[Page 112]

of the employee or official, with respect to those dealings,
unless he has the consent in writing of the head of the branch of government
with which he deals, the proof of which lies upon him;

I agree with the reasons of Hugh J. MacDonald J.A., speaking
on behalf of the Appellate Division, that the appellant did have dealings of
some kind with the Government and that the fact that a trap was set has no
bearing on the commission of the offence and I have nothing to add. So far,
therefore, as the Appellate Division allowed the appeal from the trial judge
and directed a verdict of guilty to be entered, the appeal fails. We have not
been furnished with a copy of any formal order made by the Appellate Division
but we were advised that on or about May 6, 1959, in pursuance of its direction
the accused appeared before it and was fined $500 and that this amount has been
paid.

The Crown had also appealed to the Appellate Division from
an order of the judge of first instance made subsequent to the acquittal
directing that there be paid out to the appellant the sum of $400 which the
latter had given to two employees of the Government of the Province of Alberta.
The four bills comprising that sum had been made exhibits at the trial. The
argument of the present appellant that subs. (2) of s. 630 of the Code applied
found favour with the trial judge. That subsection reads as follows:

630. (2) Where an accused is tried for an indictable offence
but is not convicted, and the court finds that an indictable offence has been
committed, the court may order that any property obtained by the commission of
the offence shall be restored to the person entitled to it, if at the time of
the trial the property is before the court or has been detained, so that it can
be immediately restored to that person under the order.

The Appellate Division considered that this subsection
had no application and with that I agree. The trial judge had acquitted the
accused and had not found that an indictable offence had, been committed by
someone else. Counsel for the accused at the trial had suggested to the judge
that the two witnesses who had been paid had committed a fraud, but when
counsel for the Crown was arguing the trial judge asked him:

Do you mean to say that if the police improperly take money
from a person as I in fact found in this case, following the acquittal of that person
charged he is not entitled to get his money back?

[Page 113]

And later, this occurred:

THE COURT: It is an exhibit in court. This money was taken
by the police and. put in court as an exhibit. Now, do I lose my power to deal
with it?

MR. SHORTREED: You don't lose your power to deal with it,
you never had any when you found that no crime had been committed.

THE COURT: Oh, I think I have. I will order return of the
money following the expiry of the time for appeal.

In view of this it cannot be maintained that the Court
had found an indictable offence had been committed and the trial judge
therefore had no jurisdiction under s. 630(2) of the Code to make the order he
did. Nor is his jurisdiction assisted by one of the Rules of the Supreme Court
of Alberta respecting criminal appeals to which counsel for the appellant
referred. In his factum he sets out subs. (2) of Rule 910, Order LVI, but by an
amendment made some time ago the Rule is really subs. (2) of 909 although in
the same terms. It is as follows:

909. (2) The judge or magistrate who presided at the trial
of any person, or any judge of the Court in which he was tried, may at any time
after the trial make a special order as to the custody or conditional release of
any such documents, exhibits, or other things as the special circumstances or
special nature thereof may make desirable and proper, and upon such terms as he
may impose.

The trial judge did not make a special order as to the
custody or conditional release of any exhibit.

The appellant takes the position that s. 584 of the Code
giving the Attorney General the right to appeal against a judgment, or verdict
of acquittal on any ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone,
applies both to the judgment of acquittal and the order of payment out, whether
the order be considered part of the judgment, or supplementary to it; that in
neither case was a question of law involved, and that, therefore, the Appellate
Division had no jurisdiction. However s. 581(d) and s. 595 of the Code
provide:

581. In this Part,

…………………………………………………………………………………………………..

(d) ""sentence"" includes an order made under
section 628, 629 or 630 and a direction made under section 638; and;

[Page 114]

595. (1) Where an order for compensation or for the
restitution of property is made by the trial court under section 628, 629 or
630, the operation of the order is suspended

(a) until the expiration
of the period prescribed by rules of court for the giving of notice of appeal
or of notice of application for leave to appeal, unless the accused waives an
appeal, and

(b) until the appeal or
application for leave to appeal has been determined, where an appeal is taken
or application for leave to appeal is made.

(2) The court of appeal may order annul or vary an order
made by the trial court with respect to compensation or the restitution of
property within the limits prescribed by the provision under which the order
was made by the trial court, whether or not the conviction is quashed.

While I have already stated that I agree with the
Appellate Division that s. 630(2) is not applicable, the trial judge purported
to act under it. Therefore, by virtue of the extended meaning of
""sentence"", the Attorney General could appeal to the Court of Appeal
under s. 584(1)(b), with leave of the Appellate Division or a judge
thereof. It should be taken that such permission was granted, as the Appellate
Division proceeded to deal with the matter. Their reasons stated that the money
should remain in Court until further order.

Even if there were jurisdiction in this Court to hear an
appeal from an order carrying those reasons into effect, and whether it be a
separate order or part of one setting aside the acquittal and finding the appellant
guilty, there is no substance in the appeal and it should be dismissed.

Taschereau J.:—I
agree with the Chief Justice that the Appellate Division of the Province of
Alberta was right in allowing the appeal from the trial judge and directing a
verdict of guilty to be entered.

On the second branch of the case concerning the order of the
trial judge directing that there be paid out to the appellant the sum of $400,
which order was reversed by the Appellate Division, I agree with Mr. Justice
Fauteux that this Court has no jurisdiction on this matter.

The appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 115]

Fauteux J.:—Charged
with an indictable offence under s. 102(1) (b), the appellant was, on
September 24, 1958, acquitted by Primrose J., sitting without a jury, in the
Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta. The charge being:

That he, on or about the 16th day of April A.D. 1958,
at Edmonton, in said judicial district, did give to an employee of the
Government of Alberta, a reward as consideration for an act in connection with
dealings with the said Government of Alberta, contrary to the provisions of the
Criminal Code of Canada.

On October 3, 1958, he applied before the trial Judge
for an order directing the return to him of a sum of $400, filed as exhibit in support
of the charge, as being the reward given by him to an employee of the
Government. This application was granted and the order was issued.

Both the acquittal and the order were appealed by the Crown
to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta. This appeal was
allowed and the Court directed that a verdict of guilty of the offence charged
be entered, and directed the bribe money to remain in Court until further
order.

The appellant now appeals to this Court against this
judgment which set aside his acquittal, as well as the order of the trial
Judge.

For the reasons given by the Chief Justice, I agree that the
appeal against the conviction fails.

With respect to the order made by the Court of Appeal in
relation to the bribe money, I am of opinion that this Court is without
jurisdiction; for the question involved is not one coming within the ambit of
any of the Criminal Code appellate provisions related to appeals to this
Court in indictable offences. Goldhar v. Her Majesty the Queen3.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Offence triable in two ways—Effect of withdrawal of
information—Charge laid more than 6
months after commission of offence—Rights
of Crown counsel and accused.

The accused was charged
with failing to remain at the scene of an accident, which offence, under s.
221(2) of the Criminal Code, is triable either on indictment or on
summary conviction. The offence was alleged to have been committed on March 16,
1955, and the information was laid on January 17, 1956.

When the accused was
brought before a magistrate, Crown counsel, on being asked, stated that he
wished to proceed summarily. The accused pleaded not guilty and his counsel
immediately moved for dismissal of the charge on the ground that the
prosecution was barred under s. 693(2), the information having been laid more
than 6 months after the commission of the offence. The magistrate permitted
counsel for the Crown to withdraw the information and to lay a new one on which
a preliminary hearing was held, resulting ultimately in the conviction of the
accused.

The Court of Appeal set
aside the conviction on the ground that what had taken place before the
magistrate amounted to an acquittal on the first information and that the
accused was therefore entitled to succeed on a plea of autrefois acquit.

Held (Cartwright J. dissenting):
The conviction should be restored.

Per Kerwin C.J.: The Crown had
a right to withdraw the information and to change its election. There was no
formal acquittal by the magistrate and what occurred at that time did not
amount to an acquittal; to have this effect the first trial must have been
concluded by an adjudication or its equivalent.

Per
Taschereau
J.: The withdrawal of the first information did not amount to an acquittal and
the Crown could consequently proceed by indictment as it did. The accused was
not placed in jeopardy on the first occasion.

[Page 344]

Per Fauteux and Abbott JJ.: The
first information, considered as the institution of proceedings by summary
conviction, was bad on its face, and the Crown therefore had no right to
proceed by way of summary conviction, and the magistrate had no jurisdiction to
accept the Crown’s election and act upon it
by receiving a plea. The election and plea were therefore void and did not
constitute a bar to the subsequent proceedings by indictment.








Per
Cartwright
J., dissenting: In the circumstances of the case, the withdrawal of the
first information was tantamount to an acquittal, since counsel for the defence
was not raising a technical objection which would be a bar to the magistrate
adjudicating upon the charge but was bringing forward a defence in law to which
there was no answer. The magistrate should have dismissed the charge and his
action in permitting it to be withdrawn was, in the circumstances, the
equivalent of a dismissal.

APPEAL
from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] setting aside a
conviction. Appeal allowed.

W.B. Common, Q.C., and E.R.
Pepper, for the appellant. Stanley Smither, for the respondent.



THE CHIEF
JUSTICE:—The Crown had the right to
change its election before the magistrate and also the right to withdraw the
information. Assuming that the respondent raised the plea of autrefois
acquit before His Honour Judge Forsyth, there had certainly not been a
formal acquittal by the magistrate on January 24, 1956, and in my opinion what
occurred at that time did not amount to an acquittal. The first trial must have
been concluded by an adjudication, or what amounts thereto: Regina v.
Charlesworth[2]; Re Rex v. Ecker; Re
Rex v. Fry[3]. It has been held that
where a trial had commenced and the jury had been discharged and a new one
empanelled, the plea could not avail even if the discharge of the first jury
had been improper or if a Court of Error or Appeal considered that under the circumstances
the first jury should not have been discharged: Regina v. Charlesworth,
supra; Winsor v. The Queen[4]; Rex v. Lewis[5].



The
appeal should be allowed, the conviction restored and the case remitted to the
Court of Appeal so that the respondent’s
application for leave to appeal from the sentence may be dealt with.

[Page 345]



TASCHEREAU
J.:—I am of the opinion that
the withdrawal by the Crown of the first information did not amount to an
acquittal, giving rise to the plea of autrefois acquit, and that the
Crown could consequently proceed by indictment as it did. The respondent was
not in jeopardy.



I would
allow the appeal and restore the conviction, and remit the case to the Court of
Appeal so that the respondent’s application for leave to
appeal from the sentence may be dealt with.










CARTWRIGHT
J. (dissenting):—This appeal is brought,
pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario pronounced on November 29, 1956, quashing the conviction of the
respondent on September 21, 1956, at the General Sessions of the Peace for the
County of York and directing a verdict of acquittal to be entered.



The
proceedings against the respondent were commenced by the swearing of an
information on January 17, 1956, charging:



that
on the 16th day of March in the year 1955, at the City of Toronto, in the
County of York, owing to the presence of a vehicle bearing license nurnber
139675 (Saskatchewan) for the year 1954 on the highway, to wit, on Dundas
St. W. an accident had occurred to SAM PECALIS and that PETER KARPINSKI
the person having the care, charge or control of the vehicle with intent to
escape liability, either civil or criminal, failed to stop his vehicle, offer
assistance and give his name and address, contrary to the Criminal Code, section 221,
sub-section 2.



On
January 24, 1956, the respondent appeared before His Worship Magistrate Bigelow
to answer the charge. As the offence created by s. 221(2) may be dealt with
either as an indictable offence or as an offence punishable on summary
conviction, the clerk of the Court after reading the charge to the respondent
asked Crown counsel how he wished to proceed and he elected to proceed
summarily. The clerk then called upon the respondent to plead and he pleaded “not guilty”. After this plea and
before any evidence had been given counsel for the respondent moved to dismiss
the charge on the ground that the proceeding had been instituted more than six
months after the time when the alleged offence was committed and was
consequently barred by the provisions of s. 693(2) of the Criminal Code. The
learned magistrate then permitted counsel for the Crown to

[Page 346]



withdraw
the information against the protest of counsel for the respondent who submitted
that he was entitled to have the charge dismissed.



A new
information was then laid and read to the respondent and Crown counsel elected
to proceed by way of indictment. The respondent, having refused to elect as to
his method of trial on the ground that the proceedings were improper, was
committed for trial after a preliminary inquiry had been held by the learned
magistrate. In due course Crown counsel preferred a bill of indictment. The
grand jury returned a true bill. The trial was held on September 20 and 21,
1956, before His Honour Judge Forsyth and a jury.










At the
opening of the trial and before pleading counsel for the respondent moved to
quash the indictment on grounds which are summarized as follows in the factum
of counsel for the appellant:



(a)
The Crown had no right to change their election before the magistrate.



(b)
The Crown had no right to withdraw the information.



(c)
If the Crown withdrew the information without the consent of the accused, that
withdrawal was tantamount to a dismissal and the accused can successfully plead
autrefois acquit.



The
learned trial judge declined to give effect to the motion and proceeded with
the trial which resulted in the conviction which was quashed by the Court of
Appeal.



While
the point was not pressed, it was suggested that the respondent had failed to
raise the plea of autrefois acquit before His Honour Judge Forsyth.
There appears to have been some lack of formality in the proceedings, but the
record shows that before entering a plea of not guilty, counsel for the
respondent made it clear that he relied on the submission that his client was
entitled to be discharged on the plea of autrefois acquit and the matter
was argued at length before the learned trial judge. In my view the plea was
sufficiently raised.



It is
argued for the appellant that the respondent was not in jeopardy in the summary
proceedings before the magistrate, “that
there was no adjudication on the merits or otherwise, nor could there have
been, since the learned Magistrate was without jurisdiction”. I am unable to give
effect to this argument.

[Page 347]



Section 693(2)
which limits the time within which proceedings in respect of offences
punishable on summary conviction may be instituted is as follows:



(2)
No proceedings shall be instituted more than six months after the time when the
subject matter of the proceedings arose.



The
effect of this subsection is not, in my opinion, to deprive the magistrate
of jurisdiction in a case in which the subject matter of the proceedings in
fact arose more than six months before their institution but rather to afford a
defence to the charge. While no such difficulty arises in the case at bar, the
decisions collected in 21 Halsbury, 2nd ed. 1936, at p. 598 show that questions
of fact and law may well arise as to when the six months’ period commences to run in
a particular case.










In the
case at bar, after the information had been read, the Crown had elected to
proceed summarily, the respondent had been called upon to plead and had pleaded
“not guilty”, the learned magistrate
had jurisdiction over the accused and over the offence with which he was
charged and, as is pointed out by Laidlaw J.A., the trial had commenced. Prima
facie, it was the duty of the learned magistrate to proceed with the trial
as provided by s. 708(3) and s. 711 of the Criminal Code, reading as
follows:



708(3)
Where the defendant pleads not guilty or states that he has cause to show why
an order should not be made against him, as the case may be, the summary
conviction court shall proceed with the trial, and shall take the evidence of
witnesses for the prosecutor and the defendant in accordance with the
provisions of Part XV relating to preliminary inquiries.



711.
When the summary conviction court has heard the prosecutor, defendant and
witnesses it shall, after considering the matter, convict the defendant or make
an order against him or dismiss the information, as the case may be.



The
provisions of s. 697(3) emphasize the importance of the respondent having
pleaded. That subsection reads as follows:



(3)
Subject to section 698, in proceedings under this Part no summary
conviction court other than the summary conviction court by which the plea of
an accused is taken has jurisdiction for the purposes of the hearing and
adjudication, but any justice may



(a)
adjourn the proceedings at any time before the plea of the accused is
taken, or



(b)
adjourn the proceedings at any time after the plea of the accused is taken
for the purpose of enabling the proceedings to be continued before the summary
conviction court by which the plea was taken.

[Page 348]



I do
not find it necessary to determine in what circumstances, if any, a charge may
properly be withdrawn against the objection of the accused after the
commencement of a trial before a summary conviction court, as I have concluded
that Mr. Smither is right in his submission that in the case at bar the
withdrawal was tantamount to an acquittal.



On the
argument before us both counsel referred to the judgment of the Nova Scotia
Supreme Court in Re Bond[6], and relied upon the
following passage from the judgment of Graham J. at p. 515:



It
remains to consider whether the withdrawal should be construed under any other
rule of law to be an acquittal. The cases in other jurisdictions are not easy to
reconcile, and we are, therefore, thrown back on reason and the application of
principles.










The
withdrawal of a charge before any evidence is given may be tantamount to a
trial, and so may put an end to the complaint; but that can only be so when the
true inference from the circumstances is, that the magistrate permitted the
withdrawal, because he decided that there was not a proper case for trial or
that trial was unnecessary, and so passed upon the merits. The general law is
that to support the plea of autrefois acquit there must have been a
trial and an acquittal on the merits.



In Haynes
v. Davis[7], Lush J. said:



I
quite agree that “acquittal on the merits” does not necessarily mean
that the jury or the magistrate must find as a matter of fact that the person
charged was innocent; it is just as much an acquittal upon the merits if the
judge or the magistrate were to rule upon the construction of an Act of
Parliament that the accused was in law entitled to be acquitted as in law he
was not guilty, and to that extent the expression “acquittal on the merits” must be qualified, but in
my view the expression is used by way of antithesis to a dismissal of the
charge upon some technical ground which had been a bar to the adjudicating upon
it. That is why this expression is important, however one may qualify it, and I
think the antithesis is between an adjudication of not guilty upon some matter
of fact or law and a discharge of the person charged on the ground that there
are reasons why the Court cannot proceed to find if he is guilty.



Applying
the reasoning of the above passages to the facts of the case at bar, it appears
that in the course of the trial Mr. Smither brought to the attention of
the learned magistrate the undisputed fact that the alleged offence was
committed more than six months before the commencement of the proceedings. In
so doing he was not raising a technical ground which would be a bar to the
magistrate adjudicating upon the charge; he was bringing forward a

[Page 349]



defence
in law to which there was no answer. To use the words of Graham J., quoted
above, any further trial “was unnecessary”; the learned magistrate
was in a position to pass upon the merits as no evidence could have been given
that would have altered the result. In my respectful view, the learned
magistrate ought to have dismissed the charge, and his action in permitting it
to be withdrawn was, in the circumstances, the equivalent of a dismissal.



It may
be mentioned in passing that in actions for malicious prosecution the
withdrawal of a charge in open Court by the Crown Attorney, otherwise than in
pursuance of a compromise or agreement between the parties, has consistently
been held to constitute a termination of the criminal proceedings in favour of
the accused; see for example Fancourt v. Heaven[8], and the cases there
cited.










If it
should be suggested that, in the result, a man who was convicted on sufficient
evidence before a properly instructed jury goes free because of the decision,
perhaps made inadvertently, to proceed summarily before the magistrate, I would
recall the words of Viscount Sankey L.C. in Maxwell v. The Director of
Public Prosecutions[9], which although used in
different circumstances are of general application:



But
it must be remembered that the whole policy of English criminal law has been to
see that as against the prisoner every rule in his favour is observed... It is
often better that one guilty man should escape than that the general rules
evolved by the dictates of justice for the conduct of criminal prosecutions should
be disregarded and discredited.



The
general rule on which the respondent relies was not questioned. It is stated in
the following terms in Broom’s Legal Maxims, 10th ed.
1939, p. 223:



The
maxim nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa expresses a great
fundamental rule of our criminal law, which forbids that a man should be put in
jeopardy twice for one and the same offence. It is the foundation of the
special pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict. When a
criminal charge has been once adjudicated upon by a Court of competent
jurisdiction, that adjudication is final, whether it takes the form of an
acquittal or a conviction, and it may be pleaded in bar of a subsequent prosecution
for the same offence... Provided that the adjudication be by a Court of
competent jurisdiction, it is immaterial whether it be upon a summary
proceeding before justices or upon a trial before a jury.

[Page 350]



I have
already indicated my view that, in the circumstances of the case at bar, the
withdrawal of the charge before the learned magistrate was tantamount to an
acquittal.



I would
dismiss the appeal.



The
judgment of Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by



FAUTEUX
J.:—The circumstances giving
rise to this appeal are fully stated in the reasons for judgment of my brother
Cartwright and need not be related here to a similar extent.










A first
information, laid and sworn to on January 17, 1956, charged respondent with
having, on March 16, 1955, failed to stop at the scene of an accident, contrary
to s. 221(2) of the Criminal Code. Such an offence may be prosecuted by
way of indictment or of summary conviction at the option of the complainant.
The information here having been laid and sworn to more than six months after
the date of the alleged violation, proceedings in the latter form were then
barfed by the provisions of s. 693(2) reading:



693(2).
No proceedings shall be instituted more than six months after the time when the
subject matter of the proceedings arose.



Notwithstanding
the clear terms of this statutory prohibition, counsel for the Crown was
requested, upon arraignment of respondent, to elect and elected to proceed by
way of summary conviction. Whereupon respondent pleaded not guilty, and,
promptly invoking the statutory prohibition, moved for the dismissal of the
charge. The magistrate refused to grant this motion, permitting instead the
withdrawal of the information. Respondent was immediately arraigned upon a
fresh information, couched in terms similar to those of the first, and was
ultimately indicted and convicted.



The
submission of respondent, rejected by the trial judge but accepted in the Court
of Appeal, is that, the Crown having no right to change its election and
withdraw the information after the plea of not guilty, such withdrawal was
therefore tantamount to a dismissal giving rise to a plea of autrefois
acquit.

[Page 351]



In my
respectful view, it is unnecessary to deal with the merits of the conclusion of
this proposition, for the premises upon which it rests are not established. In
the circumstances of this case, there were no right for the Crown to, elect to
proceed by way of summary conviction and no jurisdiction for the magistrate to
accept and act upon the election by receiving a plea. On the face of the
information itself, it was manifest that more than six months had elapsed from
the date when the subject matter of the proceedings had arisen; and of its
nature the offence charged was not capable of being one having a continuing
character. Non‑compliance with the statutory requirement of s. 693(2) was
fatal to the validity of the election and plea, both of which were void.



Other
grounds of appeal were raised by the accused in the Court of Appeal but were
abandoned at the hearing before us.



I would
dispose of the appeal as proposed by my Lord the Chief Justice.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Parties to
offences—Carrying out common unlawful purpose—Attempt to commit robbery—Killing
by one participant—Charge to jury—The Criminal Code, 1953—54 (Can.), c. 51, ss.
21, 24, 201, 202.

G and C were jointly indicted for the murder of a police
constable, the Crown's case being that while the two men were engaged in an
attempt to rob the premises of W. Co., G shot the constable and that C,
""in complicity with [G], was a party with [G] to the said crime of
murder"". Both accused were convicted and appealed. G's appeal was
dismissed but a new trial was ordered for C on grounds of misdirection. The
Crown appealed.

Held (Locke and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): The appeal
should be allowed and the conviction should be restored.

Per Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.:
There was evidence that G and C formed an intention in common to carry out the
unlawful purpose of robbery with violence, and to assist each other therein,
that in carrying out that common purpose G committed murder, and that C knew,
or ought to have known, that murder would be a probable consequence. It was
unnecessary to decide whether the words ""in carrying out the common
purpose"" in s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code should be construed as
requiring acts going beyond mere preparation for an offence and amounting to an
attempt as defined in s. 24, because in this case the evidence disclosed that
the acts of the two accused did in fact amount to an attempt to rob.

Section 24(2) requires the presiding judge to determine, as a
matter of law, whether or not the acts of the accused constitute an attempt,
but that determination must be in substance a finding of fact. His function is
not merely to decide, in a given case, that there is no evidence of an attempt
and therefore withdraw that issue from the jury, but

[Page 267]

also to decide, as a question of fact and law, whether what
was done, if found by the jury, amounted to an attempt. Regina v.
Miskell, [1954] 1 W.L.R. 438 at 440, does not express the law of Canada
as laid down in s. 24(2).

There was no evidence from which the jury could have found
that the common intention had been abandoned before the constable was shot. In
any event, this issue was not withdrawn from the jury; it was left to them to
find whether it had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the common
intention persisted.

Per Rand J.: Assuming that the Crown, because of the
position taken by counsel in opening, was bound to prove an intent to rob W.
Co. rather than a mere intent to reconnoitre with or without an intent to rob
generally, the trial judge had made it clear to the jury that the intent that
they must find was the specific one to rob W. Co. It was by no means clear that
s. 21(2) was restricted to cases where an attempted offence had been reached
but, in any event, the trial judge's finding that the acts alleged, if the jury
found them to have been done, amounted to an attempt, could not be successfully
challenged. Although there was no direct evidence that it was part of the
common intention to overcome all resistance by force of arms, that intention
could be found as an inference from the total circumstances of the case. The
question of an abandonment of the intent to rob had not been withdrawn from the
jury.

Per Locke J., dissenting: It is not a necessary
element of liability under s. 21(2) that the acts done in carrying out the
common purpose should be such as to amount to an attempt, as defined in s. 24,
but what was said by the trial judge in this case amounted to taking away from
the jury the decision of the question of fact as to whether there had been an
attempt.

Further, there was evidence on which the jury might have found
that, even assuming that there had been an attempt, it had been abandoned at
the time of the shooting. Although the trial judge told the jury that this
question was for them, he also told them on two occasions that there was no
evidence that the attempt had been abandoned, and the effect of this would be
that the jury would not consider the matter.

Per Cartwright J., dissenting: If, as was
probable from the charge, the jury were directing their minds to s. 202 (d)
(i) in connection with C's guilt, it was of vital importance that they should
consider whether G caused the constable's death while committing or attempting
to commit robbery. Assuming, without deciding, that the trial judge was right
in telling the jury that if they found the facts which he outlined to them they
must accept his ruling that both the accused had committed the offence of
attempted robbery, he was wrong in withdrawing from them (as in fact he did)
the question whether the attempt had been abandoned before the firing of the
fatal shots. What he told them in effect was that if they once found that the
attempt to rob was made, they had no choice but to find that that attempt
continued up to the time of the shooting. Since there was evidence on which the
jury might have found that the attempt, if made, had been abandoned, the
verdict could not stand….

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1],
setting aside the conviction of the respondent for murder, and ordering a new
trial. Appeal allowed.

William A. Schultz, Q.C.,
for the appellant.

Norman D. Mullins, for the
respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and
Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—This is an
appeal by the Attorney-General for British
 Columbia from a decision of the Court
of Appeal for that Province [2],
setting aside the conviction of murder of the respondent Carey and directing a
new trial. The appeal is based upon the grounds of dissent of Mr. Justice
Sidney Smith.

Carey and Gordon were jointly
indicted for the murder of police constable Sinclair on December 7, 1955, at
the city of Vancouver, the allegation being that Gordon fired the bullet, or
bullets, which killed Sinclair and that Carey ""in complicity with the said
Joseph Gordon, was a party with the said Joseph Gordon to the said crime of
murder"". A motion by Carey for a separate trial was denied. Gordon called
witnesses and testified himself in an endeavour to prove an alibi but Carey
elected to call no witnesses and did not go into the witness-box. At the
conclusion of a very lengthy trial both accused were found guilty. Gordon's
conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal and his application for leave to
appeal to this Court was dismissed.

In his factum Mr. Mullins,
counsel for the respondent, set forth the three matters of dissent to which the
Crown was restricted in its appeal as:

(1) misdirection by the trial
judge ""with respect to preparation as opposed to attempt"";

(2) misdirection by the trial
judge ""in failing to distinguish between intent to rob generally and
intent to rob Watkins Winram"";

(3) misdirection by the trial
judge ""with respect to abandonment"".

Mr. Schultz, for the Crown, may
have put the points of dissent in a different form but the substance is the
same.

[Page 269]

So far as the events of December 7, 1955,
are concerned, the main, but not the only, evidence against the respondent
depended upon the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Nielson and of one Goll; and also
upon the testimony, apparently given unwillingly, as might be expected, of (a)
Noreen Lewry, who was living with the respondent although not married to him,
and (b) Robert Smith, a friend of both accused who accompanied them,
together with Mrs. Lewry and the six weeks' old child of her and the
respondent, to the vicinity of the fatal shooting. There was evidence that,
within the meaning of subs. (2) of s. 21 of the Criminal Code, 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, Gordon and the respondent formed an intention in common to carry
out an unlawful purpose (i.e., to rob with violence) and to assist each
other therein. There was also evidence that in carrying out that common purpose
Gordon committed the offence of murder and that the respondent knew or ought to
have known that murder would be a probable consequence of carrying out the
common purpose. Mr. Justice Davey considered that the trial judge erred in
omitting reference to the suggestion that Gordon had a strong personal motive
to kill and that, therefore, the shooting was not part of a common purpose.
While it is necessary for a trial judge to put to the jury any defence which is
open, I am unable to find in the present case any evidence to found such a
contention.

About 5.30 o'clock in the
afternoon of December 7, 1955, Gordon arrived at the premises where the
respondent lived with Mrs. Lewry and their child. The respondent and Mrs. Lewry
had just finished eating a meal when Gordon arrived. Shortly thereafter the
respondent left his suite and during his absence Gordon picked up a duster,
tied a knot in the top, and placed it over his head and Mrs. Lewry cut out two
eyeholes, thereby making a mask. Gordon stated to Mrs. Lewry that he needed
$2,000 by the afternoon of December 8, on which day he expected to be committed
for trial on a bank robbery charge and that he intended to obtain the $2,000 by
armed robbery. Gordon had in his possession a .38-calibre Webley revolver and
wrapped it in the mask and placed both in one pocket of his overcoat. A .45-calibre
semi-automatic pistol, which it was proved had been in the possession of the
respondent in the previous month, appeared on December 7 on the kitchen table
in

[Page 270]

the respondent's premises,
although Mrs. Lewry testified that she did not know how it had got there. Upon
the respondent's return to the kitchen Gordon took the .45 pistol from the
table and put it in the other pocket of his overcoat.

Mrs. Lewry, the baby and the
respondent left the latter's premises in an automobile driven by Gordon. On the
trip Mrs. Lewry noticed an automobile driven by Robert Smith, who left his car
and entered Gordon's. She had already testified that it had been agreed between
her and the accused that they should go to a friend's house for dinner in Burnaby, but
that would be to the east, whereas the car proceeded west. It stopped at
Skilling Brothers fuel office. Whatever may be the description of the attention
paid to those premises Gordon drove farther west and parked his car under the
new Granville Street bridge about 200 feet directly west of the rear of
Watkins-Winram fuel office, the front of which faced Granville Street. Before parking the car Gordon had driven north on Granville Street
past the front of the Watkins-Winram premises, which were lighted and wherein
two employees working in the office could be seen, together with a vault and a
safe.

Mr. and Mrs. Nielson saw two men,
who the jury might believe were Gordon and the respondent, examining the rear
of the Watkins-Winram premises. One of the men drew on a pair of white gloves
and the other man was seen to perform movements which indicated that he was
doing the same thing. One of the men placed a mask on his head. Two men
proceeded north on what is described as the north-south lane to Third Avenue.
It was as a result of a telephone message by Nielson that the police were
alerted and police constable Sinclair was shot and killed. After the shots
which killed Sinclair were fired, the respondent and Gordon ran in different
directions. Gordon's car which, in the meantime, had been moved by Smith to a
different location, but still generally speaking at the rear of the Watkins-Winram
premises, was, with Mrs. Lewry and the infant as passengers, driven by Smith
from its last position to Fourth Avenue where it stopped and shortly thereafter was entered
by the two accused. The car then proceeded to the northwest corner of Fifth Avenue
and Fir Street where the two accused alighted from the car and ran
in different directions.

[Page 271]

Before entering an apartment
building on west Fifth Avenue the respondent threw the .45-calibre semi-automatic
pistol on the lawn of adjoining premises, whence it was recovered within a half-hour
and bore no fingerprints. Gordon was taken into custody that same night but the
respondent was not located until a long time later in Toronto, Ontario.

The evidence was overwhelming and
the trial judge, in a charge that was necessarily lengthy, left it to the jury
to find, as regards the respondent, what was necessary in order to substantiate
his guilt, including an intention in common with Gordon to carry out an
unlawful purpose of robbing with violence, in general. In the course of his
able argument Mr. Mullins contended that the words in subs. (2) of s. 21 of the
Criminal Code ""in carrying out the common purpose"" should be
construed in the same way as the words in subs. (1) of s. 24, ""does or
omits to do anything for the purpose of carrying out his intention"", and
should be related to subs. (2) of s. 24:

The question whether an act
or omission by a person who has an intent to commit an offence is or is not
mere preparation to commit the offence, and too remote to constitute an attempt
to commit the offence, is a question of law.

It is not necessary to determine
that point because, even if the argument be sound, the evidence discloses that
in carrying out the common purpose of robbery much more than mere preparation
took place and in fact that there was an attempt. The charge to the jury was
sufficient upon the question of ""carrying out the common purpose"" of
robbery in general.

Because of the fact that the
accused and Gordon were being tried jointly and because of Gordon's defence of
an alibi, it was necessary that the trial judge should deal with the charge
against the two accused in a comprehensive manner. As to point no. 2, that he
failed to distinguish between intent to rob generally and the intent to rob
Watkins-Winram, some members of the Court of Appeal considered that in his
charge the trial judge after itemizing a number of events dealt with the matter
in such a way as to confuse the jury. In my opinion, with respect, this is not
so and the trial judge did in fact distinguish between the two cases. As to the
carrying out of the intention to rob Watkins-Winram,

[Page 272]

the trial judge told the jury
that in accordance with subs. (2) of s. 24 of the Code, he had determined as a
matter of law that certain facts relied upon by the Crown were not too remote
to constitute an attempt to commit the offence of robbing Watkins-Winram with
violence. Following the listing of the events referred to, the trial judge said
this, which is particularly objected to: ""It is not necessary that you
find positively all but at least if you find substantially all these facts have
been established beyond a reasonable doubt, then my instruction to you is that
there was an attempted robbery."" In my opinion the subsection requires the
presiding judge to determine as a matter of law the point mentioned but that
determination must be in substance a finding of fact. Mr. Justice Coady
considered that this would invade the province of the jury and referred to a
number of cases, none of which, however, in my view, so holds. In Regina v.
Miskell [3],
Hilbery J. stated:

Once it is decided by the
court that what the accused has done can be an attempt to commit the crime, it
is a question of fact for the jury whether what was done should be decided to
have been an attempt.

Even if that be so at common law,
it is not the position under subs. (2) of s. 24 of the Criminal Code.
The jury must, of course, decide the question of intention and consider any
other defence raised on behalf of the accused, but the question of attempt or
no attempt is for the judge. His function is not merely to decide in a given
case that there is no evidence of an attempt and, therefore, withdraw that
issue from the jury, but also to decide as a question of fact and a question of
law whether what was done, if found by the jury, was an attempt. There is
nothing inconsistent with this in the decision in Henderson v. The King [4],
or in any of the other cases referred to. Here it was left to the jury to
determine whether the facts had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. It is
said that the effect of his charge was to withdraw from the jury the
consideration of all the other circumstances but upon a careful reading of the
charge, in which at several points it was made clear that the jury was the
arbiter of facts, in my opinion this is not so.

[Page 273]

As to the third ground of
dissent, Mr. Justice Coady considered that there was some evidence for the jury
to consider, assuming the intention and attempt to rob Watkins-Winram was
established, that the two accused were not continuing their attempt but had
abandoned it. With respect, I can find no evidence of abandonment. Even if
there be such evidence, I am satisfied that it was left to the jury to find
whether it had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the common intention
either to rob generally or to rob Watkins-Winram persisted down to the time of
the firing of the shots by Gordon. The last sentence of the following extract
is relied upon as indicating that this point was removed from the consideration
of the jury:

Then counsel takes another
position: He says, ""If you think I was there and this venture was more
than a preparation, was actually an attempt, then we abandoned it; we didn't go
through with it, and if we have abandoned it, then the section won't apply,
because we were not engaging in attempting to commit a robbery."" Well,
that is a matter for you. The only evidence we have on that point is that two
men were seen, one with the mask, and then after they had looked in the window
of Watkins-Winram they came around the corner and along Third Avenue.
We have no evidence except the gun shot after that, two bullets. If you
conclude there was an attempt, we have no evidence that it was ever abandoned;
at least, I think that is the situation; it is a matter for you. But, to be
frank, I could not quite follow Mr. LePage in his argument that there was an
abandonment. I can recall no evidence that there was—if there was an attempt,
there was no evidence that that attempt was abandoned.

However, in view of the earlier
part where the judge told the jury that it was a matter for them and in view of
the many other places in the charge where he made it clear that they were the
judges of the facts, my conclusion is that the matter was not withdrawn from
their consideration.

When the trial judge was dealing
with the defences of provocation, accident and self-defence he left no doubt
that he was withdrawing them from the jury, as is shown by the following:

I accept the responsibility
of directing you that there is no evidence here that the offender acted in the
heat of passion caused by sudden provocation. Now, if there was some evidence I
would have to leave the matter with you. If I am convinced that there is no
evidence, then I take the responsibility, and I do take the responsibility,
there was no provocation. I likewise direct you that there is no evidence that
the shooting was done by accident or in self-defence. You are relieved from
considering provocation, accident and self-defence.

[Page 274]

The jury could not fail to be
impressed by a comparison between that language and what was said by the trial
judge in connection with the point of abandonment.

It was argued that the opening by
counsel for the Crown indicated that the Crown was proposing to prove only that
the common intention was to rob Watkins-Winram and not to rob generally and
that if that had not been understood the accused might have been put in the
witness-box. When one reads the indictment and the opening address of Crown
counsel it is impossible to say that the scope of the case alleged against the
respondent was restricted.

Mr. Mullins, as he was entitled
to do, referred to the following additional points which had been raised by him
on behalf of the respondent before the Court of Appeal but which were not dealt
with by the members of that Court, in view of the disposition made of the
appeal:

(a) Comment on the
character of the accused. None of the matters referred to in this heading
appear to me to have any substance.

(b) Comment on the
failure of the accused to testify. Having considered the extracts relied on
in connection with the entire charge, I am of opinion that there was no such
comment.

(c) Misdirection by
twisting, misinterpretation, and misconception of evidence. I can find no
evidence of this in the charge of the trial judge. If there was any slight
error as to what had been said by any of the witnesses, the trial judge made it
abundantly clear that the members of the jury were to rely upon their own
recollection as to the evidence and he pointed out that in case of any question
arising, reference could be had to the notes of the reporter.

(d) Misdirection by
deprecating and rebutting defence submissions and failing to put the defence as
fully and fairly as the Crown's case. I can find no basis for this
objection.

The appeal should be allowed, the
order of the Court of Appeal set aside and the conviction of the respondent
restored.

RAND J.:—I agree generally with
the reasons and conclusions of the Chief Justice, but in the particular
circumstances I think it desirable to state in my own words the considerations
which to me seem controlling.

[Page 275]

Mr. Mullins contended that the
prosecution had, on opening the case, bound itself to the view that both Gordon
and Carey, in carrying out their purpose, that is, to rob Watkins-Winram, had
been guilty of an attempt to commit that offence. As a result, it was said, of
having taken this position, the accused was not called as a witness and, on the
footing that attempt had not been reached, the Crown could not now urge that
the death could be inferred as a probable consequence of a general purpose to
rob.

I find it unnecessary to examine
this contention. I will assume, though I do not accept it, that the Crown is so
bound but for the reasons which follow the point ceases to be material.

The ground on which Davey J.A.
proceeded was based upon the absence in the charge of an adequate distinction
between the intent to reconnoitre with or without an intent to rob generally,
and the intent specifically to rob Watkins-Winram, and the relation of that
failure both to the question of attempt and of murder being a probable
consequence under s. 21(2). He seems, also, to have assumed the Crown to have
committed its case to the specific intent and that the acts done amounted to an
attempt. Thus he says [5]:

If there had been only an
intent to rob such likely victim as the prisoners might find during the
reconnaissance, and that intent had not crystallized into an intention to rob
Watkins Winram Ltd.—and it was open to the jury to so find—it would necessarily
follow that there had been no atempt to rob Watkins Winram Ltd. upon which the
Crown based its case against Carey, for without such intent there could be no
attempt to carry it out as required by s. 24(1).

When Manson J., in considering s.
24, stressed the intent to commit an offence, he made it abundantly clear that
what he meant was the offence of robbing Watkins-Winram; and his finding that
an attempt had been made was made equally clearly to depend upon that
crystallized and accompanying intent. The other interpretation of the facts,
that, in the critical period and circumstances, there was mere reconnaissance
for some future purpose, was also brought out plainly and distinctly. That was
the substantial defence and to imagine the jury to have lacked full
appreciation of it would be doing much less than justice to the intelligence of
its members. Limited to the specific

[Page 276]

sense of intent and to the
attempt, what was given the jury on the question of probable consequence under
s. 21(2)—and it was given on no other basis—was in fact more favourable to the
accused than seems to have been called for, because it is by no means clear
that s. 21(2) is restricted to cases where an attempted offence has been
reached. Assuming, as I think to be the case, the charge in relation to intent
in both aspects to have been unobjectionable, the finding by Manson J. that the
acts done did amount to an attempt cannot, in my opinion, be successfully
challenged.

Coady J.A. comments first upon
the statement in the opening address

…that it was a part of the
common intention to overcome all resistance by force of arms either whether
that resistance was encountered outside the premises or inside the premises and
to prevent arrest or detention by the police by shooting if necessary.

It is said that no evidence
relating to such an intention was offered; nothing direct, certainly, but that
it could not have been found as an inference from the total circumstances is,
in my opinion, untenable.

He then proceeds to consider the
manner in which the matter of attempt was dealt with and he concludes that the
trial judge improperly took that question from the jury. What the latter did
was to summarize the material facts with the direction that if they were found
against Carey and his acts had been carried out with the intent to rob Watkins-Winram,
they constituted an attempt to do that. It is said that other matters, not
specified, but relevant to the intent, were in effect excluded. The
interpretation of the main or significant facts as well as the intent obviously
had to be determined in the light and background of the entire situation. That
was reviewed in its details and their relevance to the determinative facts was
obvious. Under s. 24(2) it is for the judge to rule whether the act ""is or
is not mere preparation"", and having ruled that it was not, it necessarily
followed here that there was an attempt. What the judge determines is the
point, in the line of events between the first motion towards a criminal act
and its commission, at which preparation ceases; that done, in such
circumstances as we have here, I know of no intervening area between that stage
and attempt. The acts must be done in carrying out the purpose, admittedly, but
no question of that arises here

[Page 277]

where the intent to rob
specifically was required and has been found: with that intent accompanying
them, there could have been no other object than the specific purpose in doing
them. The direction in this respect is what is given every day to juries that
if they find certain facts, including intent, their verdict will be so and so.

The final submission was that if
there had been an attempt it had been abandoned. I cannot agree that that
question was withdrawn from the jury. What Manson J. said was that, in his
opinion, there was no evidence of it—a view in which I concur—but that it was
for them, the jury, to decide. The last remark in the paragraph quoted by my
brother Cartwright simply repeats what had previously been said and was
expressly qualified to be the trial judge's opinion only.

Unnecessary complication seems to
have been injected into the case. The broad features are simple and it tends
only to confusion to treat them as being subtly and intricately involved. The
second essential question, whether what happened was a probable consequence in
the carrying out of the common and unlawful purpose of robbing Watkins-Winram,
was left with the jury on these, among other, significant matters of evidence:
that the two men had been together alone for some minutes shortly after Gordon
entered Carey's home, that they had passed the front of the office of Watkins-Winram
on Granville Street through the window of which a safe and vault were visible,
that together, after parking their car a short distance to the west, they had
reached the scene of the alleged purpose in the rear of the premises, that
gloves were put on, that one at least was armed with a revolver, that they
looked through a rear window, that the accused had remained near a rear door
for several minutes with a hood on his head though not drawn down over his face
while Gordon went a short distance northerly toward adjoining premises, that
upon his return they walked northerly together on a lane to Third Avenue and
turned east toward Granville Street on which, as mentioned, fronted the Watkins-Winram
premises, a direction opposite to that of their car, and that both had fled the
point of the shooting. A mask was found on a pile of tires a few feet from that
point, and the gun from which the bullet was fired was traced to Gordon who was
in possession

[Page 278]

of it at the time to the
knowledge of Carey. On these damaging facts, supported as they were by those
going back to the arrival of Gordon at the Carey home, the charge, although
susceptible of minor criticism in parts of its order or structure, presented
the determinative issues in such a manner as could be grasped adequately by the
jury.

I would, therefore, allow the
appeal and restore the conviction.

LOCKE J. (dissenting):—The
charge of murder against the respondent Carey was based upon subs. (2) of s. 21
of the Criminal Code which reads:

Where two or more persons
form an intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each
other therein and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits
an offence, each of them who knew or ought to have known that the commission of
the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose
is a party to that offence.

It is not, in my opinion, a
necessary element of the offence thus defined that the acts done in carrying
out the common purpose referred to are such as to amount to an attempt, within
the meaning of that expression in the Criminal Code. It was, however,
made clear in the opening address to the jury on behalf of the Crown that it
was contended that the unlawful purpose was to hold up and rob the premises of
the Watkins-Winram company, to overcome any resistance by force of arms,
whether that resistance was encountered inside or outside the premises, and to
prevent arrest by the police by shooting if necessary and that at the time
Gordon and Carey encountered Sinclair the offence of attempted robbery had been
committed. In the concluding argument of counsel for the Crown the matter was
put rather differently, the unlawful purpose being then stated as that of
robbery generally, but it was repeated that an attempt had been or was being
made when it was interrupted by the arrival of the police officer.

Counsel for the present respondent
contended before the jury that it was an essential element of the offence
alleged that there had been an attempt to rob the Watkins-Winram company and
that the murder was committed while such attempt was being made and argued that
Gordon, who

[Page 279]

actually fired the shots which
killed Sinclair, was only making a reconnaissance of the premises, presumably
with the purpose of robbing them later.

It was necessary under these
circumstances that the jury should be charged as to what constituted in law an
attempt to commit an offence and it is the manner in which this was done which
constitutes one of the two main grounds upon which the Court of Appeal has
proceeded in directing that there should be a new trial.

Subsection (1) of s. 24 declares
that every one who, having an intent to commit an offence, does anything for
the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of an attempt to commit the
offence. Subsection (2) declares that whether an act or omission by a person
who has an intent to commit an offence is or is not mere preparation to commit
the offence and too remote to constitute an attempt is a question of law.

Before dealing with ss. 21 and 24
the learned trial judge explained to the jury the provisions of ss. 201 and
202. In so far as the accused Gordon was concerned, it would appear upon the
evidence that nothing more was required than to explain s. 201. In Carey's
case, however, s. 202 was of vital importance if there had been in fact an
attempt to rob, within the meaning of s. 24, and that attempt was continuing at
the time the men were intercepted by Constable Sinclair. Carey was shown to
have been aware that Gordon carried a loaded revolver and, if the attempt were
in progress when Sinclair was shot or if he and Gordon were in flight after attempting
to commit the offence of robbery, he would have been a party to the offence
defined in cl. (d) of s. 202, whether or not he knew that the commission
of the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common
purpose within subs. (2) of s. 21.

The learned trial judge informed
the jury that it was necessary for them to find whether or not there had been
an attempt in which Carey was involved and, after saying that an intention to
commit the offence of robbery was necessary in order to find guilt, explained
the difference between what was mere preparation and what would be in law an
attempt. The explanation given was in accordance with that given

[Page 280]

by Blackburn J. in Regina v.
Cheeseman[6], and
that approved in the judgment of this Court in John v. The Queen [7].
Thereafter, after reciting a number of the acts of Carey and Gordon before they
arrived at the premises of the Watkins-Winram company and while they were
there, the learned judge instructed the jury that if they found that
substantially all those facts had been established there had been an attempted
robbery. He did not include among the facts enumerated the fact that, after
whichever of the two men had worn the mask had removed it, they had gone north
in the lane and turned east on Third Avenue, a means by which they might have
reached the front of the premises, as an act done in the course of the attempt.

With the greatest respect for the
learned and experienced trial judge, I think that, for the reasons given by
Coady J.A., this really amounted to taking the decision of the question of fact
as to whether there had been an attempt from the jury. Whether the actions of
Carey and Gordon when they were at the rear of the premises and when they were
going east on Third Avenue when they met the police officer were merely to
reconnoitre the premises with the view of coming at some later time and robbing
the place, or whether they actually intended then and there to attempt to rob,
were matters for the jury alone.

I am further in agreement with
the majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal that the issue as to
whether, assuming there had been an attempt, that attempt had been abandoned at
the time of the shooting was in effect taken away from the jury. The passage
from the charge dealing with this matter is quoted in other reasons to be
delivered and it is unnecessary to repeat it. It is true that the learned judge
said that the matter was one for the jury, but the question as to whether there
was any evidence of abandonment was one of law and for him and not for the jury
and, in the passage quoted, the jury was told twice that there was no evidence
that the attempt was abandoned. In my opinion, the effect of this would be that
the jury would not consider the matter. While the evidence was that when the
two men reached Third Avenue they turned

[Page 281]

to the east, which was away from
the direction in which their waiting car stood, it was at least arguable that
by proceeding to the corner and going from there south on Granville Street they could more quickly reach their car than by proceeding west on
Third Avenue. In my view, the evidence of abandonment was weak, but there was
some, and that was a matter for the jury.

I would accordingly dismiss this
appeal.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—The
respondent was tried, jointly with one James Gordon, before Manson J. and a
jury on the following charge:

JOSEPH GORDON AND JAMES
CAREY stand charged:

THAT at the City of
Vancouver, in the County and Province aforesaid, on the seventh day of
December, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fifty-five,
they, the said JOSEPH GORDON and the said JAMES CAREY, unlawfully did murder
Gordon Sinclair, contrary to the form of the Statute in such case made and
provided, and against the peace of our Lady the Queen her Crown and Dignity, in
that, at the place and on the date aforesaid, the said JOSEPH GORDON did in
fact fire the bullet or bullets which killed the said Gordon Sinclair and did
thereby commit murder, contrary to the Criminal Code, while the said JAMES
CAREY, in complicity with the said Joseph Gordon, was a party with the said
Joseph Gordon to the said crime of murder.

Both accused were convicted.

A summary of the subsequent
proceedings and of the effect of portions of the evidence is given in the
reasons of other members of the Court and I shall endeavour to avoid
repetition.

In his factum, counsel for the
appellant summarizes the errors of law which he alleges are to be found in the
reasons of the majority in the Court of Appeal as follows:

It is submitted that the
Court of Appeal, the Honourable Mr. Justice Sidney Smith dissenting, erred in
holding:—

(1) That the learned trial
Judge misdirected the jury in his instructions on ""attempt"" under
section 24(2) of the Criminal Code, when the learned trial Judge directed the
jury that if the jury found certain enumerated facts to have been proved beyond
a reasonable doubt, then the acts constituted an attempt to commit robbery, as
distinguished from mere preparation to commit the offence and too remote to
constitute an attempt.

(2) That the learned trial
Judge misdirected the jury by instructing the jury that there was an attempt to
commit robbery under section 24(1) of the Criminal Code.

(3) That the Appellant's
case against the Respondent, under section 21(2), upon which the Appellant
chose to go to the jury was (a) that the common intention to carry out
an unlawful purpose

[Page 282]

was to rob Watkins Winram
Ltd. and (b) that murder of Sinclair occurred during an attempt to rob
Watkins Winram Ltd., so that the learned trial Judge misdirected the jury on
section 24(1) of the Criminal Code by failing to instruct the jury that the
jury must find an intent to rob Watkins Winram Ltd. specifically before the
jury was required to determine the facts of preparation or attempt under
section 24(2), in order to find an attempt to rob Watkins Winram Ltd.

(4) That the learned trial
Judge failed to put the theory and evidence of the defence relating to (3) in
the manner required by Azoulay v. The Queen, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495.

(5) That the learned trial
Judge withdrew from the jury the theory of ""abandonment"" of an
attempt to commit robbery.

(6) That there was any
evidence to support the theory of ""abandonment"" of an attempt to
commit robbery.

(7) That the foregoing (1)
to (6), inclusive, or any of them, constituted misdirection going to the
substance of any vital issue in the case of the Respondent under section 21(2)
of the Criminal Code, or misled the jury, so as to constitute a substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice, for which the Respondent should be granted a
new trial.

While Sidney Smith J.A. did not
deal separately with each of these points, he expressed the view that the
charge of the learned trial judge was accurate and adequate; and the right of
the Attorney-General to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 598(1) (a) of
the Criminal Code was not challenged.

After having put to the jury the
theory of the Crown that Gordon fired the fatal shots under such circumstances
that he was guilty of murder under s. 201 (a) (i) of the Code
in that he meant to cause Sinclair's death, the learned trial judge also dealt
with s. 202 and in so doing related the terms of that section particularly to
the respondent. He said in part:

Now we pass on to s. 202. That
is the section that you would fall back on so far as Gordon is concerned if you
had any doubt at all about his guilt under s. 201. Mind you, if you find that
Gordon was present and that he fired the shots, then you do not need to worry
about anything after 201, it seems to me. It is for you, of course. Gordon
would be, I am sure, found to be a person who intended to kill Sinclair.
However, he is not the only man who is charged here, and for that reason I want
to correlate 202 to the evidence.

The learned trial judge
instructed the jury that if Gordon while attempting to commit robbery used a
revolver or had it upon his person and the death of Sinclair ensued as a
consequence then Gordon was guilty of murder. This instruction was doubtless
correct under s. 202 (d) (i).

[Page 283]

When the learned judge came to
deal with s. 21(2) he made it plain to the jury that if they found that Gordon
and Carey formed a common intention to rob and to assist each other in so doing
and, while they were engaged in an attempt to rob, Gordon used a revolver and
Sinclair's death ensued as a consequence, then Carey as well as Gordon would be
guilty of murder if he knew or ought to have known that the commission by
Gordon of murder, as defined in s. 202 (d) (i), would be a probable
consequence of carrying out the common purpose to rob. After reading and
rereading the charge I think it most probable that it was on this view of the
evidence that the jury proceeded in finding Carey guilty. Certainly this may
have been the view on which they proceeded, for they had, in the passage quoted
above, been invited to direct particular attention to s. 202 (d)
(i) in considering their verdict as to Carey.

If, as I think probable, the jury
were directing their minds to s. 202 (d) (i) it was of vital
importance that they should consider the question whether Gordon caused
Sinclair's death while committing or attempting to commit robbery. It is
obvious that if the jury concluded that, at the crucial moment, the two accused
were still engaged in an attempt to rob they would answer this question
adversely to the respondent.

Assuming, without deciding, that
the learned trial judge was right in telling the jury that, if they found the
list of facts stated by him, they must accept and follow his ruling that both
accused had committed the offence of attempted robbery, he was, in my
respectful opinion, wrong in withdrawing from them the question whether the
attempt had been abandoned before the firing of the fatal shots.

I agree with the conclusion of
the majority in the Court of Appeal that the learned trial judge did withdraw
this question from the jury. He deals with it in only one passage in his
charge, which is as follows:

Then counsel takes another
position: He says, ""If you think I was there and this venture was more
than a preparation, was actually an attempt, then we abandoned it; we didn't go
through with it, and if we have abandoned it, then the section won't apply,
because we were not engaging in attempting to commit a robbery."" Well,
that is a matter for you. The only evidence we have on that point is that two
men were seen, one with the mask, and then after they had looked in the window
of Watkins Winram they came around the corner and along Third Avenue.

[Page 284]

We have no evidence except
the gun shot after that, two bullets. If you conclude there was an attempt, we
have no evidence that it was ever abandoned; at least, I think that is the
situation; it is a matter for you. But, to be frank, I could not quite follow
Mr. LePage in his argument that there was an abandonment, I can recall no
evidence that there was—if there was an attempt, there was no evidence that
that attempt was abandoned.

It is true that twice in this
passage the learned judge tells the jury that it is a matter for them; but, in
my opinion, the concluding words which I have italicized would be taken by the
jury as the final word of the judge that there was no evidence of abandonment
for them to consider and would prevent them from giving any further
consideration to the matter.

It appears to me that the learned
trial judge told the jury, in effect, that if they once found that the attempt
to rob was made, they had no choice but to find that such attempt was
continuing at the crucial moment.

I share the view of the majority
in the Court of Appeal that on the evidence in the record it was open to the
jury to find that if an attempt had been made it had been abandoned and so at
the moment the fatal shots were fired the accused were neither committing nor
attempting to commit robbery; and, consequently, I agree with their conclusion
that the verdict cannot stand.

This renders it unnecessary for
me to deal with any of the other matters which were discussed before us.

I would dismiss the appeal.

MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL.

Criminal law—Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada—Extension of time—”Special reasons”—The Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.),
c. 51, s. 597(1)(b), as re-enacted by 1956, c. 48, s. 19.

The discretionary power given to the Supreme Court, or a judge
of that Court, to extend the time within which leave to appeal may be obtained
under s. 597(1) (b) of the Criminal Code, as re-enacted in 1956,
is conditional upon the existence of “special reasons”. A mere agreement
between counsel, made for their own convenience, as to the date on which an
application for leave will be made does not come within the meaning of these
words.

APPLICATION for leave to appeal from two judgments of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario 1,
dismissing appeals from convictions.

C. L. Dubin, Q.C., for
the appellant, applicant.

W. M. Martin, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Fauteux J.:—The
appellant applied for leave to appeal from two judgments of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario. The first, pronounced on October 17, 1956 2, affirmed his conviction on an
indictment charging him with possession and sale of a drug, contrary to the
provisions of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. The second, delivered on
the 24th of the same month, affirmed his conviction as being an habitual
criminal. The grounds, upon which leave to appeal is applied for, admittedly
raise important questions of law involving conflicting judgments of other
Courts of Appeal.

The application, however, is made under s. 597(1) (b)
of the Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, as re-enacted in 1956 by
4-5 Eliz. II, c. 48, s. 19. The section provides for a right of appeal on any
question of law, if leave is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada within
21 days after the judgment appealed from is pronounced or within such
extended time as the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof may, for
special reasons, allow. Counsel for the

[Page 120]

applicant was therefore invited to indicate what special
reasons, if any, could afford a justification for this Court to extend, for a
period of nearly three months, the period of time within which the application
for leave was made in this case. It was intimated to us that immediately
subsequent to the pronouncement of these judgments, counsel for the appellant
informed counsel for the respondent of an intention to appeal and suggested
that the application for leave should be made at a time convenient to both. To
this suggestion, counsel for the Crown assented in view of the importance of
the questions and of the sentence of preventive detention.

It must be noted that the exercise of the discretionary
power given to this Court or to a member thereof to extend the period of time
within which an application for leave may be made under s. 597(1)(b), is
conditional upon the existence of special reasons. Mere agreements which, for
their own convenience, counsel may care to make, do not come within the meaning
of special reasons and are foreign to the diligence required in the
administration of justice and which the expression “special reasons” is
particularly meant to foster. It may be, as. it was intimated by both counsel,
that there was a misapprehension as to the practice before this Court. However,
with the concurrence of the Chief Justice, it is now emphasized that this
should” no longer be the case in the future. Under all the circumstances, we
feel that to do justice to this case, leave should not be refused on this point
which was raised by the Court.

Leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario affirming, on October 17, 1956, the conviction of the appellant, is
granted on the grounds numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the application.

With respect to the judgment of October 24, 1956, affirming
the conviction of being an habitual criminal, leave to appeal is granted
conditionally upon the appeal from the judgment of October 17, 1956, being
successful.

Leave to appeal granted.

1927, c. 59, s. 9—Criminal Code, ss. 923, 944, 1011, 1014(2).

The accused was found guilty of murder by a mixed jury. His
conviction was unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeal. His appeal from the
dismissal by a judge of this Court of his application for leave to appeal was
dismissed on the ground that this Court was without jurisdiction.

[Page 192]

Pursuant to s. 55; of the Supreme
Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, the Governor General in Council then
referred the following question to this Court: ""If the application made by
Wilbert Coffin for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada had been
granted on any of the grounds alleged on the said application, what disposition
of the appeal would now be made by the Court?""

Held: Kerwin C.J., Taschereau, Rand, Kellock and Fauteux
JJ. would have dismissed the appeal. Locke and Cartwright JJ. would have
allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and directed a new trial.

Per Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau J.: The evidence was
such that a legally instructed jury could reasonably find the accused guilty.

If the possession of recently stolen goods is not explained
satisfactorily, they are presumed to have. been acquired illegally. That
possession may, also indicate not only robbery, but a more serious crime
related to robbery. There is no doubt that the jury did not accept the
accused's explanations and that they could justly conclude that he was the
thief. Thus they could see therein a motive for the murder -and it was à; which they could legally take into account.

The judge was not obliged to tell the jury that they were not
entitled to convict of murder"" simply because they came to the conclusion
that he was guilty of theft. The recent possession not only created the
presumption, failing explanation, that he had stolen, but the jury had the
right to conclude that it was a link in the chain of circumstances which
indicated that he had committed the murder.

Any possible inaccuracies in the early part of the judge's
direction in regard to the nature of the evidence, was subsequently remedied.
The rule in the Hodge's case was entirely respected.

The evidence of the police officer that as the result of
""precise information"" toe searched for a rifle at the accused's camp,
was. not hearsay evidence. The witness was not trying to prove the truth of his
information but merely to establish the reason for his visit.

All necessary precautions to prevent irregularities were taken
to the judge's satisfaction when he allowed the jury to go to the cinema. All
the constables were under oath and it is not suggested that any indiscretions
were committed. Moreover, the judge was exercising his discretion when he gave
the permission after both parties had consented.

It is within the judge's discretion to grant a jury composed
exclusively of persons who speak the accused's language, but if he refuses, he
must grant a mixed jury. He must consider what will best serve the ends of
justice. The interests of society must not be disregarded. The judge decided
that the ends of justice would not be effectively served by granting the
accused's request, for that would have eliminated eighty-five per cent of the
population from taking part in the administration' of justice.

Even if there had been any irregularities concerning the list
of jurors, they would be covered by s. 1011 Cr. C.

There was nothing more logical, since a mixed jury was
concerned, than, to have the judge, counsel for the Crown and for the accused
address the jury in French and in English.

[Page 193]

Nothing in what counsel for the Crown said was such as to
suggest that the jury bring in a verdict based on sentiments and prejudices and
not exclusively on the evidence.

S. 9 of the Canada Evidence Act does not forbid
refreshing the memory of a witness by means of a previous testimony which he
has given. There was no attempt to discredit or contradict the witness Petrie. She admitted that her memory was better at the time
of the preliminary inquiry. Moreover, this is a question for the judge's
discretion.

Even if there had been some irregularities, s. 1014(c)
Cr. C. would apply, as no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred.
The evidence left the jury no alternative. It was entirely consistent with the
guilt of the accused and inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.

Per Rand, Kellock and Fauteux JJ.: The court has a
discretion, not open to review, to permit leading questions whenever it is
considered necessary in the interests of justice. Moreover, a witness may
refresh his memory by reference to his earlier depositions and s. 9 of the Canada
Evidence Act applies only when it is attempted to discredit or contradict a
party's own witness.

The contention that, because of the differences between the
addresses of counsel in one language and the other, and between the two charges
delivered by the trial judge, the accused was tried by two groups of jurymen,
and further that s. 944 Cr. C. requires that the jury be addressed by one
counsel only on each side, cannot succeed. The practice followed has been the
invariable one in Quebec since 1892. Neither the differences in the addresses
nor in the charges were of a nature to call for the interference of this Court.

The judge, in exercising his discretion under s. 923 Cr. C,
was right in his view that the ends of justice would be better served with a
mixed jury.

It cannot be said that the accused gave any reasonable
explanation of how he came to be in possession of the things as to which he
even attempted to make an explanation. There was, therefore, abundant evidence
from which the jury could conclude, as they have done, that the possessor of
the money and other items was the robber and murderer as well.

Per Locke J.: The evidence of the police officer that
he acted on ""precise information"" in searching for a rifle in the
vicinity of the accused's camp, was, clearly hearsay evidence and, therefore,
improperly admitted. That evidence, to which so much importance was attached by
counsel for the Crown and by the trial judge when the matter was presented to
the jury, was on a point material to the guilt or innocence of the accused. It
cannot, therefore, properly be said that there has been no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice and consequently, s. 592 Cr. C, has no application. (Makin
v. A.G. for New South Wales [1894] A.C. 57 and Allen v. The
King 44 S.C.R. 331 followed).

Per Locke and Cartwright JJ.: The evidence that the
police officer had information that a rifle was concealed in a precisely
indicated spot near the accused's camp, was inadmissible as being hearsay
evidence. Proof that an accused has suppressed or endeavoured to suppress
evidence is admissible, but, here, the foundation of the whole incident on
which

[Page 194]

the jury were invited to find that he had suppressed evidence
was this inadmissible hearsay evidence. It related to a vital matter and in
view of the way it was stressed at the trial, counsel for the Crown cannot now
be heard to belittle its importance.

The transcript of the evidence given at the preliminary
inquiry by the witness Petrie was used not for the
purpose of refreshing her memory but for the purpose of endeavouring to have
her admit that she was mistaken or untruthful in giving her evidence at the
trial. The cross-examination of this witness was unlawful and was attended by
further error in that no warning was given to the jury that any evidence of
what she had said at the preliminary inquiry was not evidence of the truth of
the facts then stated but could be considered by them only for the purpose of
testing the credibility of the testimony which she had given at the trial.

Although there is no evidence to suggest that any improper
communication took place on the occasion of the visit to the cinema, this
unfortunate incident falls within the principle stated in Rex v. Masuda
106 C.C.C. at 123 and 124. There is no escape from holding that the
incident was fatal to the validity of the conviction.

The judge did not direct his mind to the question whether the
ends of justice would be better served by empanelling a mixed jury. The reasons
given for the exercise of his discretion under s. 923 Cr. C. were irrelevant.
Whether the empanelling of a jury of the sort requested by the accused would be
attended with difficulty or whether the language of the accused was or was not
that spoken by the majority of the population of the district were irrelevant
considerations. The record has. failed to disclose any ground sufficient in law
to warrant the accused being denied his right to a jury composed entirely of
persons speaking his language. The error is not cured by s. 1011 Cr. C.

S. 1014(2) does not avail to support the conviction as it is
impossible to affirm with certainty that if none of the above errors had
occurred the jury would necessarily have convicted; furthermore, even if this
could be affirmed, the error in law in admitting the hearsay evidence as to the
rifle was so substantial a wrong that the sub-section can have no application,
as the accused was deprived of his right to a trial by jury according to Jaw.
The errors pertaining to the episode of the cinema and to the empanelling of
the mixed jury are also such as cannot be cured by the sub-section.

The Chief Justice:—For
the reasons given by Mr. Justice Taschereau, my answer to the question referred
to the ] Court is that I would have dismissed the appeal.

Taschereau J.:—L'appelant a été traduit devant le tribunal de Percé, district
judiciaire de la Gaspésie, pour répondre à l'accusation d'avoir, au début de
juin , assassiné Richard de Holidaysburg, Pennsylvanie, U.S.A.

Le procès, présidé par l'honorable Juge Gérard
Lacroix, s'est instruit devant un jury de langue française et de langue
anglaise, et l'appelant a été trouvé coupable dans le cours du mois d'août . Ce
verdict a été confirmé unanimement par la Cour du Banc de la Reine de la
province de Québec 1,
et, s'autorisant alors des dispositions du Code Criminel, l'appelant s'est
adressé à l'un des juges en chambre de cette Cour pour obtenir une permission
spéciale d'appeler.Cette permission a été refusée par l'honorable Juge Abbott,
mais les procureurs de l'appelant ont tout de même demandé à cette Cour de
réviser ce jugement de M. le Juge Abbott et d'entendre son appel au mérite. La
Cour en est venue unanimement à la conclusion qu'elle n'avait pas dans
l'espèce, et a en conséquence refusé la demande.

L'appelant a ensuite fait parvenir une requête
au Ministre de la Justice, demandant qu'un nouveau procès lui soit accordé. Le
Gouverneur Général en Conseil, en vertu des dispositions de l'article de la Loi
de la Cour Suprême du Canada, a demandé l'opinion de cette Cour afin de
savoir quel aurait été le jugment rendu, si celle-ci avait entendu l'appel à son
mérite.

La preuve révèle que Hunter Lindsay, accompagné
de son fils Richard, et d'un ami de ce dernier, Frederick Claar, tous trois de
Holidaysburg, Pennsylvanie, quittèrent leur résidence le juin , pour se rendre
faire la chasse à l'ours en Gaspésie. Le voyage qui s'effectuait en camionnette
devait durer environ une dizaine de jours, et les chasseurs projetaient de
revenir chez-eux vers le juin.

Le 8 juin, à Gaspé, ils obtinrent tous trois
leur permis de chasse et de circulation dans la forêt. A la même date, ils

[Page 196]

achètent diverses épiceries chez les marchands
locaux, et le soir, ils s'engagent dans la forêt de Gaspé. Un garde-feu du nom
de Patterson raconte qu'au sud-ouest de Gaspé, sur une petite route qui longe
le nord de la Rivière St-Jean, leur camionnette s'est enlisée dans la vase d'un
ruisseau qu'ils avaient tenté de traverser, et qu'à cause de l'humidité le
moteur avait cessé de fonctionner. Comme ne réussit pas à les remettre sur la
route pour leur permettre de continuer leur voyage, il retourna seul à Gaspé,
situé à quelque dix milles seulement, et leur envoya de l'aide, soit Thomas et
Oscar et Wellie , qui arrivèrent à bord de leur camion le matin du juin et les
tirèrent du ruisseau. On remit le moteur en marche, et le midi du , on revit
les trois chasseurs à Gaspé même. Evidemment, ils sont revenus sur leur chemin,
et déclarent à un marchand local d'essence qu'ils désirent retourner aux camps ,
25 et , situés à l'ouest de Gaspé, mais cette fois non pas en longeant le côté
nord de la Rivière St-Jean, mais par une route différente.

Le lendemain, soit le 10, un garagiste revoit
à Gaspé le plus jeune des trois chasseurs en compagnie de lui-même, dans un
camion d'une demi-tonne et de marque Chevrolet, et portant une licence
canadienne. Le jeune , qui était accompagné de ffin, informa le garagiste
qu'ils sont venus tous trois en Gaspésie faire la chasse à l'ours, mais que
contrairement à leurs habitudes ils n'ont pas eu cette fois recours aux
services d'un guide. Quant à , alors qu'il est seul avec le témoin, il explique
qu'il est revenu avec un individu au village pour faire réparer une pompe à
gazoline défectueuse. Dans un bar où il achète une demi-douzaine de bouteilles
de bière, il reconte qu'en se rendant prospecter dans la forêt, il a rencontré
les trois chasseurs dont la camionnette était en panne. dit qu'il a décelé une
défectuosité dans la pompe et qu'il a remené les américains à Gaspé à bord d'un
, que Billy Baker lui aurait prêté. Le même jour, se rend chez un nommé
Napoléon Gérard, un garagiste, accompagné du jeune , et achète une pompe à
gazoline au prix de $8.80. Coffin n'a demandé à personne de réparer la pompe
défectueuse.

Evidemment, Coffin et les trois sont retournés
immédiatement dans là forêt, dans le camion conduit par , et le , Coffin est revu
à Gaspé dans le même camion, et un

[Page 197]

témoin affirme avoir vu dépasser le canon
d'une carabine. Quant aux voyageurs, on n'en a plus eu de nouvelles. La période
de vacances qu'ils s'étaient fixée s'écoula, et les familles et Claar n'en
entendent plus parler.

La preuve révèle que tard dans la soirée du
juin, T a quitté Gaspé dans
le camion antérieurement emprunté de Baker, mais sans la permission de ce
dernier pour ce nouveau voyage. Avant de partir cependant, il se procura un
permis de conducteur, paya quelques dettes contractées depuis quelque temps,
acheta à divers endroits plusieurs bouteilles de bière, paya l'un des vendeurs
avec un billet américain de $20 et exhiba un canif à usage multiple, plus; tard
identifié comme étant la propriété du jeune . Il se rendit chez sa soeur madame
Stanley à qui il montra le même canif. Il se changea de vêtements et quitta sa soeur
sans mentionner sa destination. Dans la nuit du au juin, vers :30 heure du
matin, il arrêta chez un nommé Earle Turzo de York Centre, à qui il remit une
somme de $10, empruntée cinq semaines auparavant, et se fit remettre un
revolver qu'il avait donné en garantie. Il paya la, traite au whisky à Turzo
ainsi qu'à la mère de celui-ci. A :30 heures .M., près de Percé, son camion
tomba dans le fossé. Un nommé Elément lui aida à en sortir et se fit payer en
billets américains.

A six heures du matin, le 13, Coffin est rendu
à Percé. Il fait son plein d'essence et fait réparer ses freins. Le coût de la
réparation s'élève à $8. Coffin remet au garagiste un billet américain de $20 et
se fait remettre $10, laissant la différence comme pourboire. Il expliqua au garagiste
qu'il lui fallait se rendre à Montréal, ayant reçu un appel téléphonique en
rapport avec une prétendue compagnie américaine, et qu'il ne pouvait
transmettre ses informations ni par téléphone ni par lettre.

Coffin se rend ensuite vers la Vallée de la
Matapédia. Il s'arrête près de où il fait monter à bord de sa camionnette un
nommé Diotte. Là, il s'arrête chez le coiffeur où il ""paye la
traite"". Il donne $10 à Diotte pour acheter un paquet de cigarettes.
Pendant ce temps, il se fait tailler la barbe, couper les cheveux, laver la
tête, et verse la somme de $3 en paiement quand il ne devait que $1.50. Au
cireur de chaussures qui lui demande $0.15, il lui fait cadeau de $1. Vers
midi, le juin, il arrive à

[Page 198]

St-Charles Caplan, verse dans un fossé. Un
camionneur vient lui aider et tire d'un porte-feuilles bien garni, de couleur
brune, un billet américain de $20 et ne demande que $10 de change. A Black
Cape, il fait de nouveau son plein d'essence chez un nommé Campbell, et lui
laisse un pourboire de $1. Il arrête ensuite, vers trois heures de
l'après-midi, à Maria dans le comté de Bonaventure, où il s'endort au volant de
son camion. Un nommé Audet vient le réveiller, invite à entrer chez-lui où in prend
un repas. lui donne $2 et $1 à l'un des enfants. Entre cinq et six heures, il
part en direction de Québec. Le dimanche matin, il est rendu à St-André de
Kamouraska chez un nommé Tardif où il déjeûne, et paye avec un billet de $20 de
dénomination américaine. Comme on ne peut faire la monnaie, il laisse $5 refusant
de recevoir la balance. Apparemment, il a aussi laissé $10 sous une chaise.
Madame Tardif a constaté qu'en payant, il avait tiré de sa poche un gros paquet
de billets. A Montmagny, il tombe de nouveau dans un fossé. Un nommé Chouinard
de Rivière-du-Loup le tire de ce fossé, et lui laisse $5 sur un billet de $10. A
St-Michel de Bellechasse où il couche, il repart le lendemain matin vers sept
heures, et malgré qu'on lui demandait la somme de $2.50, il laisse à l'hôtelier
$5. L'hôtelier remarque que le porte-feuilles est bien garni de papier-monnaie.
Le dimanche , il arrive à Montréal chez sa ""common law wife"" Marion Petrie
. Dans la camionnette de Baker qu'il conduisait toujours, Petrie remarque des
œufs contenus dans une boîte de biscuits soda et une bouteille de sirop ""Old
Type"", précisément une boîte semblable à celle acquise par les chasseurs
chez un épicier de Gaspé, et une bouteille portant la même marque que celle
achetée au même endroit. Petrie voit également une pompe à gazoline qui n'a jamais
été utilisée, et qui est évidemment celle achetée à Gaspé pour les américains.
Dans une valise placée également dans le camion et que les détectives
retrouvent plus tard chez madame Stanley, sœur de , et qui est identifiée comme
appartenant au jeune Claar, on y trouve des serviettes, deux paires de
salopettes que la mère du jeune Claar reconnaît comme étant la propriété de son
fils. Evidemment, ces objets avaient été apportés par le jeune Claar pour aller
faire la chasse au camp , et sont demeurés

[Page 199]

dans le camion de Coffin qui est allé le
reconduire. apporta également à Montréal une paire de jumelles appartenant
aussi à Claar.

Coffin séjourna à Montréal durant environ dix
jours où il achète des épiceries, huit à dix bouteilles de bière
quotidiennement, et dépense sans travailler. En quittant Montréal, il se rend à
Val d'Or, rencontrer un nommé Hastie, courtier en valeurs minières, et celui-ci
consent à se rendre en Gaspésie avec pour y examiner certains dépôts de cuivre.
Le juillet, le lendemain de son arrivée à Gaspé, informe Hastie qu'il lui est
impossible de l'accompagner, car il lui faut aider les policiers dans leurs
recherches commencées depuis quelque temps déjà.

Avant l'arrivée de , on avait retrouvé vers le
juillet la camionnette des chasseurs à un demi-mille du camp , et dans laquelle
se trouvent une carabine et une paire de pantalons. 

Le lendemain de la découverte de la
camionnette, les recherches se poursuivent. Les camps sont visités et, le juillet,
d'importantes découvertes sont faites. Entre les camps et séparés d'une
distance d'environ trois milles, on voit des traces de roues de camions, et du
côté gauche de la route on découvre divers objets, et le lendemain on en
découvre d'autres dissimulés dans les feuillages et d'autres reposant dans le
lit de la rivière qui coule à environ cinquante pieds du chemin. Entre autres,
on y trouve un poèle, un réservoir à essence, un coupe-vent de couleur bleue,
un sac de couchage, qui appartenaient aux américains. On constate aussi la
présence d'un contenant un film qui n'a pas été entièrement exposé, et qui en
est rendu à la cinquième pose sur un total de huit. Il était la propriété du
jeune Claar. On retrouve également un étui à jumelles dans lequel on peut facilement
introduire les jumelles que madame a identifiées, et que l'on trouvera plus
tard dans la forêt à proximité des ossements du jeune ; on trouve également
l'étui à carabine qui a été retrouvé aux environs du camp , non loin des
ossements du jeune Claar. Tous ces objets ont été retrouvés à au delà de trois
milles où la camionnette abandonnée par les américains a été localisée. Le
juillet, une carabine et divers autres objets sont retrouvés. Dans le bois de
cette carabine ony voit une impression laissée par un coup qui

[Page 200]

semble avoir été le résultat d'une balle d'une
autre arme à feu. Le magasin de cette carabine était plein de cartouches, et le
cran de sûreté était à la position ""sure"".

Près de cent pieds plus loin, de l'autre côté
de la rivière qui est large de quinze à vingt pieds, on trouve un squelette
humain complètement décomposé, et le Docteur Roussel-ayant transporté ces
restes à Montréal, conclut qu'il s'agit là des restes d'une personne de sexe
masculin, mesurant environ cinq pieds sept pouces, âgée d'au delà de quarante
ans et dont la mort remonte à au moins un mois depuis l'examen. On trouve
également un porte-feuilles identifié comme appartenant à père, avec certains
documents qui lui appartiennent, mais il n'y a plus un seul sou des $650 qu'il
avait apportés avec lui en billets américains. Il n'est certainement pas permis
de douter qu'il s'agit là du cadavre de père.

Les officiers de police ont continué leurs
recherches afin de trouver les cadavres du jeune Claar et du jeune , et ce
n'est que le juillet, aux environs du camp qui se trouve à deux milles et demi
du camp , où ont été trouvés les ossements de père, que sont découverts les
restes des deux autres américains. A proximité on y relève des pièces de
vêtements, une. paire de jumelles qui appartenait au jeune , et madame la mère
a identifié d'autres vêtements trouvés sur les lieux comme appartenant à son
fils. On a produit en outre à l'enquête un gilet blanc et une chemise de
couleur verte à travers lesquels on aperçoit un trou entouré d'une tache
noirâtre. Tout près, on voit dissimulée une veste de cuir à fermeture éclair,
propriété du jeune , et dont les poches sont retournées et vides. Il est en
preuve que les taches qui entourent les perforations sont du sang humain et que
les trous portent des traces de plomb. Leur site correspond au poumon et au
coeur, et il est logique de conclure qu'il s'agit de perforation produite par
un projectile d'arme à feu. Le Docteur Roussel témoigne que dans les deux cas
il s'agit des cadavres de deux jeunes gens de moins de vingt-cinq ans dont la
date de la mort remonte à la même période que la date de la mort de père. Sur
la chemise du jeune Claar on y aperçoit également des perforations au niveau du
bassin et autour desquelles la présence de dépôts métalliques indique qu'elles
sont attribuables à un projectile

[Page 201]

d'arme à feu. Les mêmes constatations ont été
faites au niveau de la poitrine, par conséquent au niveau d'organes vitaux.

Coffin n'est revenu en Gaspésie qu'après la
découverte de la camionnette et des ossements de père, et ce n'est que le
juillet que les détectives peuvent l'interroger. Ses réponses ne sont pas
satisfaisantes. Ses explications des faits sont boiteuses, contradictoires et
incomplètes, et le récit de ses allées et venues dénote une obstination
persistante à vouloir voiler la vérité. Ainsi, il prétend n'être jamais allé au
camp , et après s'être repris, il soutient qu'il n'est pas allé aux camps et , les
deux endroits où ont été trouvés les ossements, quand il est en preuve que ceci
est faux.

Le matin du 10 après être revenu avec
MacDonald du bois, et avec qui il est entendu qu'il doit retourner, il lui
fausse compagnie, et repart seul dans la direction des chasseurs.Il explique
qu'il préférait faire de la prospection seul. Mais au lieu d'aller faire de la
prospection à la fourche sud de la Rivière St-Jean, il se rend au camp 21. Il
est certain que quand il est retourné, il avait une carabine, car, elle est vue
le soir du 12 par MacGregor. Sur ces points, il ne: fournit pas d'explications.
Comment s'est-il procuré tout cet argent américain, qu'il distribue à
profusion? Oùa-t-il pris les épiceries, cette valise, les vêtements, les
jumelles, le canif, la pompe à gazoline, tous la propriété des chasseurs? Il
n'explique pas qu'il ait emprunté une carabine d'un nommé Eagle, qui n'a jamais
été retournée, et qui n'a jamais été retrouvée. Il ne dit pas non plus la
raison de son voyage à Montréal le soir du 12, ni pourquoi il est parti sans
avertir personne.

Coffin prétend, évidemment pour détourner les
soupçons, que deux autres américains sont allés à la chasse à l'ours avec les
victimes. Personne cependant n'a eu connaissance de leur séjour à Gaspé ou
ailleurs dans la région, à cette période. Aucun permis ne leur aurait été donné,
et on ne retrouve aucune de leurs traces. Ce qui est vrai, c'est que deux
autres américains sont venus à la chasse, en ""jeep"" de marque , et
sont entrés dans la forêt 27 le mai par York River, et qu'ils ont quitté Gaspé
le juin, c'est-à-dire plusieurs jours avant l'arrivée de et de ses compagnons.
De plus, ces chasseurs entendus comme témoins, ont juré n'être jamais allés aux
camps,21, 24, 25 et .26

[Page 202]

Au cours des recherches dans le bois avec les
détectives, qu'il a consenti à accompagner, il feint de ne pas connaître les
lieux. Au camp 24, accompagné des chercheurs, il demande au cours du repas, où
est la source pour aller j chercher l'eau, lui qui est né et a vécu dans ce
pays, et qui le 8 au soir s'était rendu à ce même camp 24 avec MacDonald, et
qui le matin du 9, sur le bord du ruisseau, avait allumé un feu. Il est en
preuve que jamais il ne porte ses regards du côté gauche de la route,
précisément aux endroits où les cadavres ont été trouvés, et où évidemment leur
ont été enlevés tous les objets trouvés en la possession de Coffin.

Avec cette preuve, le jury légalement
instruit, et maître des faits, pouvait raisonnablement trouver l'accusé
coupable. C'est donc avec raison que devant cette Cour, le procureur de
l'accusé a abandonné l'un de ses moyens d'appel, qui était à l'effet qu'il n'y
avait pas de preuve suffisante pour justifier un verdict de culpabilité. La
question de savoir si la ""common law wife"" de , Marion Petrie, était
en vertu de l'article de la Loi de la Preuve du Canada, un témoin compétent à
témoigner contre l'accusé, a été abandonnée également, et n'a pas été soumise à
la considération de cette Cour. Il en est de même d'un grief concernant la
possession récente des objets volés, et se rapportant aux objets qui auraient
été volés et n'appartenant pas à la victime, que est accusé d'avoir assassinée.
On a aussi abandonné le point concernant une prétendue preuve illégale, se
rapportant aux photographies des ossements des victimes, ainsi que celui
relatif à la réplique, exercés par l'un des avocats de la Couronne.

Il reste donc à être déterminés par cette
Cour, les points suivants, que je reproduis en anglais, la langue dans laquelle
ils nous ont été soumis:—

1: Did the Learned Trial Judge err
in respect to the instructions he gave to the jury ""with reference to the
doctrine of recent possession in the following manner:—

(a) Should .the jury have
been permitted to apply the doctrine at all?

(b) Were the jury
misdirected with reference to the burden resting on the Appellant to explain
his possession of items allegedly stolen?

2. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in failing to instruct
the jury that they were not entitled to convict the Appellant of murder simply
because they came to the conclusion that he was guilty of the theft of the
various articles proved to have been the property of the victim, Richard
Lindsay, and his associates?

[Page 203]

3. Did the Learned Trial Judge err by instructing the jury
in a manner that would indicate the statements and declarations made by the
Appellant to various witnesses were not to be regarded as circumstantial
evidence and evidence therefore to which the rule in Hodge's case should be
applied?

4. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in admitting evidence
concerning a certain rifle the property of one Jack Eagle?

5. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in permitting the jury to
attend a moving picture theatre in the company of two police officers who were
subsequently called as witnesses for the Crown?

6. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in refusing the
application made on behalf of the Appellant to be tried by a jury composed
entirely of English-speaking citizens?

7. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial according to law by
reason of the failure of the Sheriff of the County in which the Appellant was
tried to comply with the provisions of the Quebec Jury Act (1945, 9 George VI,
Chap. 22)?

8. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial according to law by
reason of the improper mixture of the English and French language?

9. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial according to law by
reason of the fact that Crown Counsel in their addresses to the jury used
inflammatory language?

10. That Marion Petrie, being a
Crown Witness, was submitted to a cross-examination by the Crown counsel,
although she was not declared hostile.

Au soutien de son premier point, le procureur
de l'accusé prétend que le jury n'aurait pas dû appliquer la doctrine de la
possession récente, pour établir que l'accusé était l'auteur des vols commis,
et que le juge a donné des instructions erronées concernant le fardeau qui
repose sur l'accusé, d'expliquer la possession des objets volés.

La doctrine et la jurisprudence enseignent que
si une personne est en possession d'objets volés peu de temps après la
commission du crime, elle doit expliquer cette possession, et si elle ne
réussit pas à le faire de façon satisfaisante, elle est présumée les avoir
acquis illégalement. De plus, c'est aussi la doctrine et la jurisprudence que
la possession d'effets récemment volés, peut indiquer non seulement le crime de
vol, mais aussi un crime plus grave relié au vol. (Rex v. Langmead
2; Wills pages 61 et
62; Regina v. Exall 3).

Dans le présent cas, je n'ai pas de doute que
le jury n'a pas accepté les explications données par l'accusé aux policiers, et
que le jury pouvait justement conclure que était l'auteur du vol. En concluant
ainsi, le jury

[Page 204]

pouvait y voir un motif du crime de meurtre,
et c'était une circonstance dont il pouvait légalement tenir compte. Je ne vois
rien dans la charge du juge qui soit de nature à vicier le procès sur ce point.

Je crois également le second point non fondé.
Je suis d'opinion que le juge ne devait pas dire au jury ce qu'on lui reproche
d'avoir omis. Le fait pour d'avoir en sa possession des effets récemment volés,
faisait naître non seulement la présomption, faute d'explication, qu'il les
avait volés, mais le jury avait le droit de conclure que c'était un lien dans
une chaîne de circonstances, qui indiquait qu'il avait commis le meurtre.Dans Regina
v. Exall (supra page ) Pollock C.B. dit:—

And so it is of any crime to which the robbery was incident,
or with which it was connected, as burglary, arson, or murder. For, if the
possession be evidence that the person committed the robbery, and the person
who committed the robbery committed the other crime, then it is evidence that
the person in whose possession the property is found committed that other
crime.

Il est certain que le juge en adressant le
jury leur a dit que la Couronne avait offert deux sortes de preuve, soit la
preuve circonstancielle, et la preuve de conversations ou paroles dites par
l'accusé. Après avoir défini la preuve circonstancielle, et avoir énoncé aux
jurés les principes de la cause de Hodge, il ajouta:—

Il est évident que sur l'ensemble de ces
faits, l'on ne trouvera aucune preuve directe nulle part et c'est précisément
là que l'on vous demande d'extraire des circonstances, la ou les conclusions
que, dans votre estimation, vous devez voir comme résultant de ces faits.

Je suis fermement convaincu que s'il a pu y
avoir quelques incorrections au début de ses remarques, sur ce point, le juge y
a complètement remédié par les dernières paroles que je viens de citer. Les
règles contenues dans la cause de Hodge ont en conséquence été
totalement respectées.

J'ai signalé déjà que avait emprunté une
carabine d'un nommé John Eagle, qui n'a jamais été remise à ce dernier, et qui
n'a jamais été retrouvée. Quand l'accusé est revenu du bois dans la soirée du
juin, on a remarqué dans son camion la présence d'une carabine. On sait aussi
qu'il n'en avait pas le , quand il est allé dans le bois avec MacDonald pour
prospecter, et qu'il n'en avait pas non plus le , quand il est retourné seul
dans la forêt. Il me semble nécessaire que la Couronne fît des efforts pour

[Page 205]

trouver cette arme. En revenant le 12, Coffin n'a
pas laissé la carabine chez son père où il vivait, et il ne l'avait pas avec
lui quand il est parti pour Montréal le soir du 12. La théorie de la Couronne
est que le soir du , tel que prouvé par MacDonald qui l'accompagnait, est allé
à son camp situé à l'ouest de Gaspé, pour y chercher la carabine, et qu'il
l'avait retournée au même endroit après la commission du crime. Cette théorie
est d'autant plus vraisemblable, qu'un jour, alors qu'il était détenu au mois
d'août à la prison de Gaspé, eut une entrevue avec son frère, et dans la même
nuit, un camion s'est rendu au camp de , dont le conducteur n'a pas demandé
d'ouvrir la barrière qui conduit dans la forêt. Au contraire, cette barrière a
été contournée, et des traces fraîches sur la route indiquaient le passage
récent d'un camion que l'on croit être d'une capacité d'une tonne, comme celui
du frère de . Ces traces indiquent que le camion s'est rendu au camp et en est
revenu en contournant toujours la barrière.

Au mois d'août, le sergent Doyon s'est rendu
au camp de , y a constaté les mêmes traces, et au cours de son témoignage, il a
dit qu'ayant reçu une ""information précise"", il s'était rendu faire
des recherches au camp de , essayant de trouver quelque preuve qui lui aiderait
à retrouver cette carabine. On prétend que cette preuve est illégale vu qu'il
s'agirait de ouï-dire. Je ne puis admettre cette prétention. A mon sens, il ne
s'agit nullement de ouï-dire, car quand Doyon a dit qu'il avait agi après avoir
reçu une ""information précise"", il n'entendait pas prouver la
véracité de son information, mais bien établir la raison de sa visite au camp. Comme le dit Roscoe prius, page 53:—

When hearsay is introduced not as a medium of proof in order
to establish a distinct fact, but as being in itself part of the transaction in
question and explanatory of it, it is admissible, words and declaration are
admissible.

A la page 55, il ajoute:—

It has been justly remarked by recent text writers that many
of the above cases are not strictly instances of hearsay (i.e. second hand
evidence) though commonly so classed. The res gesta in each case is original
evidence and the accompanying declaration being part of it is also original.

[Page 206]

Phipson (hearsay) page 223:—

In some cases a verbal act may be admissible as original
evidence although its particulars may be excluded as hearsay. Thus, though the
fact that the prosecutor made a communication to the Police, in consequence of
which they took certain steps, is allowed to be proved, yet what was actually
said is excluded as hearsay, is a very dangerous form.

Dans la cause de Rex v. Wilkins 4, M. le Juge Erle dit:—

Half the transactions of life are done by means of words.
There is a distinction, which it appears to me is not sufficiently attended to,
between, mere statements made by and to witnesses, that are not receivable in
evidence, and directions given and acts done by word?, which are evidence. The
witness, in this case, may say that he made inquiries, and in consequence of
directions given to him in answer to those inquiries, he followed the prisoners
from place to place until he apprehended them.

Les détectives agissent souvent comme
conséquence d'informations qu'ils reçoivent, et le fait de dire qu'ils ont été
""informés"" ne constitue nullement une preuve illégale. Ce n'est pas
un moyen de preuve de nature à établir un fait particulier.

Un autre grief de l'accusé, est que le juge a
erré en permettant aux jurés, durant le procès, d'assister au cinéma,
accompagnés de plusieurs officiers de police, qui furent subséquemment appelés
comme témoins de la Couronne. Je suis satisfait que toutes les précautions
nécessaires ont été prises, à la satisfaction du juge pour que rien
d'irrégulier ne s'est passé. Tous les ont été assermentés, et il n'est pas
suggéré qu'aucune indiscrétion n'ait été commise. D'ailleurs, cette permission
d'assister au cinéma a été donnée par le juge lui-même, exerçant sa discrétion,
après qu'il eût obtenu le consentement de l'avocat de la Couronne et de celui
de l'accusé.

En ce qui concerne le 6ème grief, il est
nécessaire en premier lieu de citer l'article du Code Criminel, qui
détermine les droits d'un accusé à un jury mixte, ou composé entièrement de
personnes parlant la langue française ou anglaise. Cet article se lit ainsi:—

923. Dans ceux des districts de la province de
Québec où le shérif est tenu par la loi de dresser une liste de petits jurés
composée moitié de personnes parlant la langue anglaise, et moitié de personnes
parlant la langue française, il doit, dans son rapport, mentionner séparément
les jurés qu'il désigne comme parlant la langue anglaise, et ceux qu'il désigne
comme parlant la langue française, respectivement; et les noms des jurés ainsi
assignés sont appelés alternativement d'après ces listes.

[Page 207]

2. Dans tout district, le prisonnier peut,
lorsqu'il est mis en jugement, demander par motion, d'être jugé par un jury
entièrement composé de jurés parlant la langue anglaise, ou entièrement composé
de jurés parlant la langue française.

3. Sur présentation de cette motion, le
juge peut ordonner au shérif d'assigner un nombre suffisant de jurés
parlant la langue anglaise ou la langue française, à moins qu'à sa
discrétion il n'apparaisse que les fins de la justice sont mieux servies par la
composition d'un jury mixte.

Je suis fermement d'opinion qu'il n'y a pas eu
d'erreur de la part du juge en ordonnant un jury mixte. Quand un accusé demande
la composition d'un jury exclusivement composé de personnes parlant sa langue,
comme la chose a été faite 'dans le cas présent, il est à la discrétion du
juge d'accéder à cette demande, mais s'il la refuse, il doit accorder un
jury mixte. Le droit de l'accusé à douze jurés de sa langue, n'est pas un droit
absolu, et le juge devra prendre en considération ce qui doit le mieux servir
les fins de la justice. Malgré que dans un procès criminel, l'intérêt de l'accusé
soit primordial, l'intérêt de la société ne doit pas être méconnu. (Alexander
. Regem 5; Mount .
Regem 6; Bureau v. Regem 7; Duval v. Regem 8). Dans la présente cause, exerçant sa discrétion le juge a décidé que les
fins de la justice ne seraient pas utilement servies, en: accordant la demande
de l'accusé, car il aurait ainsi éliminé % de la population française, à la
participation de l'administration de la justice. Il n'appartient pas à cette
Cour d'intervenir dans l'exercice de cette discrétion.

Je disposerai brièvement du grief N° 7, où
l'on prétend que les dispositions de la loi (1945, 9 Geo. VI, c. 22) concernant
la; liste des jurés n'ont pas été suivies. Ainsi, et c'est le grief qu'on
invoque, les jurés doivent être choisis dans un rayon de milles de la
municipalité (art. ) et ils l'ont été, non pas dans un rayon de 40 milles, mais
bien jusqu'à une distance de 40 milles, mesurés sur la route.

Même s'il y avait là une irrégularité, elle
serait couverte par l'article C. Cr. qui dit:—

1011. Nulle omission dans l'observation des
prescriptions contenues dans une loi à l'égard de la compétence, du choix, du
ballotage ou de la répartition des jurés, ou dans la préparation du registre
des jurés, le choix des listes des jurys, l'appel du corps des jurés d'après
ces listes, ou la convocation de jurys spéciaux, ne constitue un motif
suffisant pour infirmer un verdict, ni n'est admise comme erreur dans un appel
à interjeter d'un jugement rendu dans une cause criminelle.

[Page 208]

Je trouve que cette objection ne repose sur
aucun fondement sérieux.

Le grief N° 8 ne me semble pas plus sérieux.
On reproche au juge, aux avocats de la Couronne, comme d'ailleurs pas ricochet
aux avocats de la défense d'avoir adressé le jury en français et en anglais. Y
avait-il rien de plus logique d'agir de la sorte quand il s'agit d'un jury
mixte? D'ailleurs, il semble qu'on peut facilement disposer de cette objection
en référant à la cause de Veuillette v. Le Roi 9, et
particulièrement aux raisons de M. le Juge Brodeur à la page 424:—

Ce serait, suivant moi, un droit bien
illusoire si, malgré le droit qu'aurait un anglais, par exemple, de choisir un
jury mixte, il était permis à la couronne de faire entendre les témoins en
langue française et de ne pas traduire leurs témoignages en anglais de manière
à ce que la teneur de ces témoignages fût comprise par les jurés de langue
anglaise. Cela constituerait un grave déni de justice.

Il en serait de même pour le résumé (charge)
du juge. Ce dernier devrait voir à ce que son allocution soit comprise de tout
le jury.

Il est vrai que la loi est silencieuse sur la
manière dont une cause devra être conduite devant un jury mixte. Mais je ne
veux pas de meilleure interprétation de la loi que cette pratique, constamment
suivie depuis plus de cent cinquante ans, que dans le cas de jury mixte les
dépositions de témoins sont traduites dans les deux langues et le résumé du.
juge est également fait ou traduit en anglais et en français.

Et M. le Juge Mignault s'exprime de la même
façon aux pages 430 et 431.

Je ne crois pas nécessaire de discuter le 9ème
grief, car je ne trouve pas que les procureurs de la Couronne, s'ils ont parlé
avec énergie, ont employé un langage enflammé. Rien dans ce qu'ils ont dit
était de nature à suggérer aux jurés de rendre un verdict non pas exclusivement
basé sur la preuve, mais aussi sur les sentiments et les préjugés.

Il reste donc le dernier motif d'appel qui est
à l'effet que Petrie, appelée comme témoin de la Couronne, aurait été
transquestionnée par le procureur de la Couronne, sans avoir été déclarée
hostile. L'objection est basée sur l'article 9 de la loi de la Preuve du
Canada. Il se lit ainsi:—

9. La partie qui produit un témoin n'a pas la
faculté d'attaquer sa crédibilité par une preuve générale de mauvais
réputation, mais si le témoin est, de l'avis de la cour, défavorable à la partie
en cause, cette partie dernière peut le réfuter par d'autres témoignages, ou,
.avec la permission de la cour, peut prouver que le témoin a en d'autres
occasions fait une déclaration incompatible avec sa présente déposition; mais
avant de

[Page 209]

pouvoir établir cette dernière preuve, les
circonstances dans lesquelles a été faite là prétendue déclaration doivent être
exposées au témoin de manière à désigner suffisamment l'occasion en
particulier, et il doit lui être demandé s'il a fait ou non cette déclaration.

On voit; donc, que ce. que défend cet article
est de discréditer ou contredire son propre témoin, mais nullement de
rafraîchir la mémoire d'un témoin, au moyen de témoignages antérieurs qu'il a
rendus. Quand l'avocat de la Couronne a questionné madame Petrie sur la
bouteille de sirop d'érable, la pompe à gazoline, la présence des deux autres
américains, retournés aux Etats-Unis avant l'arrivée de et de ses compagnons,
comme ses réponses ne concordaient pas entièrement avec celles données à l'enquête
préliminaire, elle a lu elle-même ses réponses pour se rafraîchir la mémoire.
Elle admet que sa mémoire était meilleure au temps de l'enquête préliminaire
une année auparavant. Je ne vois aucune tentative de discréditer le témoin oude
la contredire. Il s'agissait seulement de savoir quelle était la véritable
version, et le témoin a accepté celle de l'enquête préliminaire. C'est là
d'ailleurs une question de discrétion pour le juge, qui décide suivant les
circonstances et; l'attitude du témoin.

Je suis donc d'opinion que j'aurais rejeté cet
appel, si la Cour avait eu pour l'entendre. Il y a dans toute la preuve qui a
été faite un faisceau de circonstances telles que même si j'avais trouvédans
les griefs soulevés par le procureur de l'accusé, non pas des erreurs
fondamentales, auxquelles on ne peut remédier, mais quelques irrégularités
affectant le procès, je n'aurais pas hésité à appliquer l'article (c) du
Code Criminel, car il ne s'est produit aucun tort réel, ni déni de
justice. Allen v. The King 10.
Les circonstances établies, ne laissaient aucune alternative au jury. Elles
sont entièrement compatibles avec la culpabilité de l'accusé, et incompatibles
avec toute autre conclusion rationnelle.

Ma réponse, en conséquence, à la question
posée par Son Excellence la Gouverneur Général en Conseil est que j'aurais
rejeté l'appel.

Rand J.:—For the reasons given by my brother Kellock, my answer to
the question referred to the Court is that I would have dismissed the appeal.

[Page 210]

Kellock J.:—The
appellant first contends that while the jury were properly charged as to the
treatment of circumstantial evidence, the learned trial judge removed from the
ambit of such evidence all statements made by the accused himself to the
various witnesses.

Initially that is so but the learned trial judge had
previously told the jury that, with respect to both direct and circumstantial
evidence, the Crown must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the
accused who had committed the crime for which he was indicted, and immediately
following the direction objected to, proceeded to particularize the evidence of
""the circumstances"" and included therein not only what had been
stated by the various witnesses as to the conduct of the appellant but also the
statements made by him. Not only so, but he told the jury that
""considering the whole of these facts, no direct proof can be found
anywhere"" and charged them that if they were not convinced by the evidence
""beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused has committed the offence for
which he stands indicted, this doubt must work in his favour and it is your
duty to discharge him."" In these circumstances, all basis for any
objection on the above ground, in my opinion, disappears.

The appellant further contends that the examination on
behalf of the Crown of the witness Petrie, with respect
to whom the learned judge had refused an application to declare her a hostile
witness, amounted to cross-examination and was for that reason inadmissible,
and, in particular, that the use made by counsel for the Crown of her previous
depositions was illegal.

In the course of her examination as to articles which Coffin
had brought to Montreal, the witness stated that she had seen a certain maple
syrup bottle while giving evidence at the preliminary hearing a year before.
She went on to say that it was ""like"" the one produced at the trial
but smaller ""as far as I can remember"". Crown counsel agreed that
""we are talking about evidence that had been given over a year ago""
and asked the witness if she would care to refresh her memory, to which she
responded that she ""wouldn't mind"". After having read her depositions
to herself, she stated what she had said at the earlier hearing and agreed that
her earlier memory was to be preferred.

[Page 211]

Similarly, on a question as to her having seen a gas pump
with Coffin, the witness at first said she had seen only the box in which it
was contained. But on refreshing her memory by reference to her depositions,
she said her memory had been better on the former occasion and that she had
seen the pump.

Evidence had already been given at the trial of a statement
made to the police by Coffin that when he had last seen the Lindsay party, two
other Americans, driving a yellowish-coloured jeep, were with them. Evidence
had also been given that two Americans driving a vehicle of the above
description had been in the Gaspé some days earlier but
had recrossed the border to the United States on June 5, the day the Lindsay
party had left Pennsylvania. This was the only evidence of the presence in the
district at any time of any similar American party.

On this subject the witness Petrie deposed
that Coffin had, a few days after his arrival, told her the same story he had
told the police but not on the night of his arrival, when he had told her the
other things. She also said, in answer to; a question to that effect, that she
had not made such a statement on any previous occasion, including an occasion
when she had given a statement to the police. She was then asked as to her
memory of the facts at the time of the preliminary inquiry. Having answered
that it was ""a little better than they are now"", she looked at her
depositions and testified that she had previously said that Coffin had told her
only of the Lindsay party. She said that her memory when she had thus testified
was ""not too bad I guess"". In my opinion, in this answer the witness
was adopting as the fact what she had said at the preliminary inquiry and her
evidence is to be taken accordingly.

It is quite true that the initial answers made by the
witness as to these three matters were not ""accepted"" by counsel for
the Crown but while, as a general rule, a party may not: either in direct or
re-examination put leading questions, the court has a discretion, not open to
review, to relax it whenever it is considered necessary in the interests of
justice, as the learned judge appears to have considered was the situation in
the case at bar; ex parte Bottomley 11;
Lawder v. Lawder 12.
Moreover, the authorities

[Page 212]

make it clear that a witness may be allowed to refresh his
memory by reference to his earlier depositions and that it is only where the object
of the examination is to discredit or contradict a party's own witness that s.
9 of the Canada Evidence Act applies. In the present case it is evident
that the object was to show that the mention by the appellant to the police of
having left the Lindsay party in the company of two other persons was an
afterthought which had not occurred to him when he gave his earlier account to
the witness Petrie. did not wish, therefore, to
discredit Petrie to obtain from her the evidence she
had given in her depositions if, on bringing the depositions to her attention,
her memory would permit her to adopt them.

In Reg. v. Williams 13,
à for the prosecution, having replied in the negative
to a question put to him, was permitted by Vaughan Williams J., to have his
depositions put into his hands, and, after having looked at them, to answer the
question. Similarly, in Melhuish . Collier 14,
a witness for the plaintiff was asked by the plaintiff's counsel as to whether
or not she had not made a certain answer in previous proceedings before the
magistrate. The question being objected to on the ground that it went to
discredit the party's own witness, the learned trial judge ruled that the
question was a proper one. Upon a rule nisi a new trial, the rule was
discharged. At p. 496, Coleridge J., said:

A witness from flurry or forgetfulness may omit facts and on
being reminded may carry his recollection back so as to be able to give his
evidence fully and correctly, and a question for that purpose may properly be
put.

As to the difference between a question directed to
refreshing memory and contradicting one's own witness, the learned judge continued:

But as to the first point it is objected that the object of
the question put here was to contradict and not to remind a witness and that
therefore it could not be put. It is certainly very difficult to draw the line
of distinction in practice and I am not now disposed to do it. In the present
case I do not think the question objected to went further than was proper

See also The King v. Laurin 15,
distinguishing R. v. Duckworth 16.

[Page 213]

In the case at bar the learned trial judge, having come to
the conclusion that the witness was not hostile in the legal sense land having
therefore refused to permit her to be cross-examined, was, nevertheless,
entitled, in his discretion, to permit leading questions to be put, and,
similarly, was right in allowing the memory of the witness to be refreshed by
reference to her previous statements. As in each case the witness adopted what
she had previously said, no such situation arose as in Duckworth's case,
ubi cit, or Rex v. Darlyn 17,
where the earlier statements were not adopted.

The very fact that the learned judge did not regard the
witness as hostile, i.e., as not giving her evidence fairly and with a desire
to tell the truth because of a hostile animus toward the prosecution, would
seem to indicate the propriety of his permitting the examination to proceed and
the attention of the witness to be called to her statements when her memory as
to the matters to which she deposed was, as she herself said, much better than
at the time of the trial, a year later.

A further objection made is that two of the guards attending
the jury at a moving picture theatre during an adjournment of the trial,
subsequently gave evidence for the Crown. The evidence given was of a statement
made by the appellant to his father during the coroner's inquest that
""They are not men enough to break me."" Only one of the witnesses
could depose as to what was said. The other did not understand English and
could testify only that Coffin had spoken to his father on the occasion in
question.

The jury had been permitted to attend the theatre by the
learned trial judge upon the consent of counsel for the
accused as well as the Crown. The guards were provincial police and all took
the usual oath as to communication with the jury. It is not suggested that
there was any breach of, this oath on the part of the witness nor any of the
other members of the guard. It would appear from the procès-verbal
the selection of the guard and the administering of the oath was
left by all concerned to the clerk of the court, and that the. inclusion of the
two constables was a pure oversight by him. In these circumstances, I see no
reason for assuming that either constable

[Page 214]

was guilty of any impropriety in communicating, in breach of
his oath, with the jury on the subject of his prospective evidence, any more
than it would be assumed that any constable in attendance at a trial, during
the course of which he is required to guard a jury during an adjournment, had
discussed with them anything he had heard at the trial or from any other source.
We have been referred to reported cases involving facts in which the courts
there concerned considered a new trial called for but I cannot agree that the
present circumstances call for such a result.

The appellant further calls attention to the fact that the
trial took place before a mixed jury, the evidence being translated from one
language into the other; that the learned trial judge charged the jury in both
languages, and that one counsel for the prosecution as well as one for the
defence addressed the jury in one language while his associate in each case
addressed the jury in the other. It is contended that because of differences
between the addresses in one language and the other and between the charges
delivered by the. learned judge, the result is that the appellant was really
tried by two groups of jurymen composed of six men each. It is also contended
that s. 944 of the Criminal Code.
requires that the jury be addressed by one counsel only on each side.

When it is remembered (as we were told by Crown counsel
without contradiction) that the practice followed with respect to translation,
the charge and the addresses has been the invariable practice in the Province
of Quebec since 1892 at least, when the Code was first enacted, and that
during all of that- time s. 944 has been in its present form, the contention,
in so far as it is based on that section, cannot, in my opinion, succeed.

In Veuillette v. The King 18,
the appellant, being tried on an indictment for murder, stated through counsel
that the language of the defence was French. The jury impanelled was a mixed
jury, each of the French-speaking members stating to the court on his selection
that he understood and spoke both languages. The proceedings were carried on
throughout in English and the summing up was in English only. It was held by
this court that even assuming there was any error in law in so proceeding, no

[Page 215]

substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had been thereby
occasioned to the appellant. In the course of his judgment, Mignault J. said at
p. 430:

Revenant maintenant à la disposition de la loi
-28 Vict. ch. , il est clair que cette disposition serait illusoire si, dans un
procès instruit devant un jury mixte, les témoignages n'étaient pas traduits du
français en anglais, et réciproquement, et si l'adresse du juge présidant le
procès n'était pas faite, du moins quant à ses parties essentielles, dans
ces deux langues. Telle a toujours été la pratique en la province de Québec, …

At p. 431, the same learned judge
said:

Je suis bien d'avis qu'il a été fait quelque
chose de non conforme à la loi pendant le procès, c'est-à-dire que l'accusé
avait droit à ce que le procès fût instruit dans les deux langues, et à ce que
l'adresse du juge au jury fût faite ou traduite, au moins dans ses parties
essentielles, dans les deux langues, …

In my opinion, neither the
differences to which we were referred as between the address on behalf of the
prosecution in the one language and the other, nor the charges, were of a
nature to call for the interference of this Court in the grant of a new trial.

It is next contended that the trial judge erred in refusing
the appellant's application under s. 923 of the Code to be tried by ah
exclusively English-speaking jury. The foundation for this contention is
certain evidence given by the sheriff that in preparing ""the list of
jurors"", only the names of those who resided within a distance of forty
miles by road from the court-house were included. The appellant relies
upon the interpretation section of the Jury Act, 9 Geo. VI (Quebec) C.
22, s. 1, para. (a), which defines ""municipality"" as any
municipality situated wholly or in part within a radius of forty miles,
and he says that ""it would appear from the evidence of the Sheriff that
had this method of selection been used, a larger number of jurors of English
tongue could then have been obtained.""

The appellant therefore submits that

when it was brought to the attention of the trial judge that
the Jurors had not been selected in the manner prescribed by the Jurors'
Act, that it was the duty of the trial judge to order the sheriff to
summons a sufficient panel of jurors speaking the English language under the
provisions of s. 923, ss. (3) and that in the circumstances there was no
proper exercise by the trial judge of his discretion in the instant case, and
the appellant was thus deprived of a trial according to law.

The italics are mine.

While the definition of ""municipality"" is as
above, the statute provides, by s. 6 and following, for the preparation

[Page 216]

of a permanent jury list in each judicial district by a
""special officer"", from extracts furnished to him by the
secretary-treasurer of each municipality. Upon the completion of this list, the
special officer is required, by s. 23, to submit it for approval to a judge of
the Superior Court, which approval ""shall render the list valid and
incontestable"" and upon its deposit in the office of the sheriff, s. 18
provides that it shall be the ""only"" list in force in the judicial
district.

It is from the list thus prepared that the sheriff is
required to prepare the panel of jurors for any particular sittings but the
sheriff has nothing to do with the preparation of ""the list"" itself.
That duty falls upon the special officer and the Superior Court judge. The
contention of the appellant under this head is therefore founded upon a
complete misconception of the statute. Moreover, it is provided by s. 1011 of
the Criminal Code that

No omission to observe the directions contained in any Act
as respect … the selecting of jury lists, the drafting of panels from the jury
lists … shall be a ground for impeaching any verdict or shall be allowed for
error upon any appeal to be brought upon any judgment rendered in any criminal
case.

On this reference we are, as is the appellant, restricted to
a consideration of ""the grounds alleged"" upon the application for
leave. If, however, anything is open under this head of objection which is not
disposed of by what I have already said, I am of opinion that there was, in the
circumstances of this case, no error on the part of the learned judge in
exercising his discretion under s. 923 of the Code against the motion.
The learned judge took the view that, even if a full panel of English-speaking
jurors could be obtained from the list, which appeared extremely unlikely,
""the ends of justice"" would be better served by a trial with a mixed
jury, as to do otherwise would exclude eighty to eighty-five per cent of the
population of the district who were French-speaking from all participation in
the administration of justice so far as that trial was concerned.

The ground of objection concisely put is that ""the ends
of justice"" could only be ""better served"" by what the accused
conceived to be in his interests. In my opinion, the section is not to be so
construed. It is to be noted that the statute does not say ""the interests
of the accused"" but the ""ends of justice."" In my opinion, the
interests of the

[Page 217]

accused are gathered up in the larger interests of the
administration of justice. I do not think, therefore, that in the exercise of
his discretion under the section for the purposes of this trial, the learned
judge took into consideration any matter which can be said to be outside the
scope of what was proper in the due administration of justice.

It is next contended that certain comment by counsel for the
Crown while addressing the jury in French with respect to the statement by the
appellant to his father already referred to, was inflammatory. Having
considered that comment, however, I am unable to say that it was not one which
might not fairly be made.

The appellant also contends that the address of Crown
counsel was inflammatory in its reference to the responsibility resting upon
the jury in a case which had undoubtedly received international attention, as
indeed the appellant in his factum expressly states. Having read the portion of
the address referred to, the impression made upon my mind is best expressed in
the language of Duff J., as he then was, in Kelly v. The King 19,
as follows:

… although some of the observations of the learned Crown
counsel were no doubt excessive heightened, it is impossible to think that in the
circumstances of this case the accused could suffer in consequence of them.
Such expressions could not deepen the effect of a bare recital of the facts in
the story which the officers of the Crown had to put before the jury.

It is also contended that evidence relating to a rifle
borrowed by the appellant from one Eagle, was irrelevant and inadmissible and
of so prejudicial a nature as to call for a new trial.

In May, 1953, the appellant had borrowed from Eagle a 32-40
rifle and Eagle also gave him eighteen or twenty cartridges for it. Eagle
subsequently gave the police other cartridges of this kind. He further said
that early in June, Coffin had told him he had the rifle at his home at York
Centre. Eagle, who was quite obviously an unwilling witness for the Crown,
further testified that he had had a conversation with Coffin in August
following but that the subject of the rifle was not mentioned.

An expert witness called by the Crown testified that in the
case of the bullet holes found in the clothing of

[Page 218]

Lindsay Jr., and the bullet mark on the stock of the rifle
of Lindsay Sr., there was no deposit of potassium nitrate, which deposit,
according to the expert evidence, is found in the case of all calibres of rifle
excepting the .32-40. It was also proved that the cartridges Eagle had given to
the police, when fired in the type of rifle he had loaned to Coffin, did not
leave such a deposit either. None of the four rifles possessed by the Lindsay
party were of this calibre.

While, according to the evidence of MacDonald, the appellant
did not have a rifle with him on June 8th or 9th, and while the appellant
stated to the police that he had not had a rifle with him in the bush between
June 10th and 12th, the witness MacGregor saw the muzzle of a rifle in the back
of the truck which Coffin was driving immediately upon his coming out of the
bush on the evening of the 12th,

Coffin had a camp of his own some ten miles from Gaspé a bush road which led nowhere beyond that point but
faded out into the bush. Access to this road was protected by a gatekeeper, as
in the case of the other roads in the neighborhood leading into the forest
area. The gatekeeper testified that on June 9 Coffin had passed the gate going
toward his camp. This could only have been after his return from the bush that
day.

Coffin told the police that he had left for the bush very
early on the morning of the 10th. This according to MacDonald, was in breach of
Coffin's agreement with MacDonald of the day before to go back into the bush
with him at 6.00 a.m. on the 10th. It was also shown that while Coffin had left
his home around midnight on June 12 without telling anyone of his plans, he
had, by 3.00 a.m., progressed only about thirteen miles on the way to Montreal.
He had, therefore, plenty of opportunity to visit his camp in the interim, had
he so desired, and to place the rifle there if he did not wish to leave it at
his home in York Centre. On arrival in Montreal in the early morning of June
15, he did not have a rifle.

On the 27th of August the appellant, while in custody, was
visited by a brother who parted from the appellant in tears. The following
morning the police went to Coffin's camp and made a search for the rifle,
without result. They, however, found tracks in the soft earth of a vehicle
which had preceded them, which they were able to follow to the

[Page 219]

camp, where the vehicle had turned about and gone back. The
night of August 27-28 had been a very wet night and: the marks, of the truck
were clearly visible in the soft ground. The gatekeeper and his wife deposed
that late on the evening of the 27th or the early morning of the 28th, sounds
of a vehicle rushing past the barrier had been heard. The driver did not stop
to have either his entrance or exit cleared, as was required. The tracks of the
vehicle around the barrier, were clearly visible. When the police arrived at
the camp, they made a search for the missing rifle but found nothing. Had there
been no other evidence with regard to the rifle it might be that the evidence
of the visit of the police, as well as that of the nocturnal visitor who
preceded them, should be considered too remote to be properly admissible. But
there was other evidence.

Eagle testified that when he ""lost"" the rifle
loaned to Coffin he bought another in its place in October, 1953. It is a
legitimate inference from this evidence, and one the jury were entitled to
draw, that Mr. Eagle had learned, from some; source, that his rifle was
irrevocably gone when he spent his money on a new one. It is also a fair
inference that when; the rifle was not mentioned between them when Eagle was
talking to Coffin on the occasion of the August interview, the realization of
his ""loss"" must have come to him subsequently. When it is realized
that no person would have any business at Coffin's camp except the appellant
himself or someone under his direction or with his permission, it is also a
fair inference that the object of the police officers and that of the nocturnal
visitor of August 27-28, was the same, namely, the rifle. All of the above
evidence is part of a whole, which, in my opinion, was admissible, its weight,
of course, being a matter for the jury. Moreover, all of this evidence was
merely incidental to the main fact deposed to by the witness MacGregor that the
latter had seen a rifle in Coffin's truck immediately upon his coming out of
the bush on the evening of June 12, as well as to the fact that the rifle
loaned to Coffin by Eagle was not accounted for.

In Blake v. Albion 20,
Cockburn C.J., said at p. 109:

… with a few exceptions on the ground of public policy … all
which can throw light on the disputed transaction is admitted—not of course
matters of mere prejudice nor anything open to real, moral or sensible
objection, but all things which can fairly throw light on the case.

[Page 220]

In my opinion, however, that portion of the evidence of the
police officers that it was because of having obtained ""precise""
information that they had gone to the appellant's camp to make the search, was
not proper. For reasons to be given, however, I am satisfied that, in the
circumstances of this case, neither the admission of this statement nor the
reference to it in the judge's charge produced any substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice.

It is next said for the appellant that the learned judge did
not instruct the jury in accordance with the principle in Schama's case 21,
with reference to such account as Coffin gave of his possession of the property
of the deceased hunters. In so far as the early part of his charge is
concerned, I think there is room for objection. However, the learned judge went
on to point out to the jury that the appellant had given no explanation at all
to account for his possession of some of the articles and, after putting before
them such explanation as the appellant did make with regard to others, he asked
the jury to consider whether the explanation given was ""likely"".
Also, after asking the jury to consider which of the respective contentions of
counsel for the Crown and the appellant as to the appellant's conduct they
considered ""the most logical, the most plausible, the most likely and the
most reasonable, according to the facts"" which had been proved, the
learned judge again returned to the appellant's possession of articles
belonging to the deceased, of American money and his story of having been paid
by Lindsay Sr., as well as his failure to make any explanation at all as to
certain articles, and, placing before the jury the theory of the prosecution
and the defence; concluded:

Gentlemen, you have two theories which are opposed to one
another. Is one more likely than the other? Does the theory of the Crown rest
on a body of evidence which points beyond any reasonable doubts towards Coffin
and towards his guilt as to the crime he stands indicted? Does the theory of
the Defence spring reasonably from the same facts, and may it cause you
to believe in the incompatibility of the proven circumstances with the guilt of
Coffin and their compatibility with his innocence?

In re R. v. Garth 22,
Lord Goddard C.J., in reference to the decision in Abramovitch, said, at p.
101, that ""a much more accurate direction to the jury is: 'if the
prisoner's account raises a doubt in your minds, then you

[Page 221]

ought not to say that the case has been proved to your
satisfaction.'"" See also Richler v. The King 23,
per Sir Lyman Duff C.J. In my opinion, the charge of the learned judge, on this
subject, when read as a whole is not open to the objection which the appellant
takes. If it could be said to fall short of what is required, I would, in any
event, be of opinion that, in the circumstances of this case, no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred because of it.

The appellant further contends that the learned trial judge
erred in failing to direct the jury that they were not entitled to convict of
murder ""simply because they came to the conclusion that he was guilty of
theft"" of the various articles. In his factum the appellant says:

While the jury might well have seen fit to conclude that the
appellant had stolen the items found in his possession from the abandoned truck
of the victims there was nothing in the evidence to compel them to conclude
that he had killed the deceased tourists and had stolen from their persons.

In this connection it is necessary to refer to the
evidence at some length.

The deceased, with his father, Eugene Lindsay, and another
youth, Frederick Claar, left their homes in Pennsylvania on June 5, 1953,
intending to return by the 15th of that month. As they did not return, a search
was instituted and ultimately the remains of all three were found. Little more
than bones remained as the bodies had been eaten by bears and other wild
animals. According to the expert evidence, the death of each had occurred not
later than June 17.

The country where the remains were found is a forest area
adjoining a bush road which, some distance to the east of the locality in
question, has two branches which commence at what is called the ""Mine
Road"", which runs from Gaspé Murdockville. The
westerly end of this bush road again meets the Mine Road approximately six
miles to the east of Murdockville. This country is, so far as the evidence
shows, completely uninhabited, and resorted to only by prospectors and hunters.

Approximately midway between the point where the two
branches join and the point where its westerly terminus meets the Mine Road,
there are four hunting camps- used

[Page 222]

spasmodically by hunting parties, the camps being numbered,
from east to west, 21, 24, 25 and 26. They are approximately three miles apart.
Access to the bush road is obtained only through barriers for which a pass must
be presented to the attendants in charge.

On July 10, the truck of the deceased was found abandoned on
the bush road at a point about three miles east of camp 21. On July 23, the
remains of Lindsay Jr., were found in a heavily wooded area at a distance of
approximately 175 feet from Camp 26. With them were found a sweater and two
shirts, each perforated by a bullet hole in what would have been the vicinity
of the heart had the clothing been worn at the time of the death. Undoubtedly
they had been so worn as the bullet holes were in the same place in each
garment. There was also found nearby a watch, a? silver ring, and a cigarette
lighter, all belonging to the deceased, as well as his rifle, the muzzle being
buried in the earth, suggesting that as he fell the rifle had been pushed into
the ground. The left pocket of the trousers of the deceased had been turned
inside out and his wallet was missing. It was proved that he had had a wallet
made of brown leather.

In a locality of the same character approximately 200 feet
away, the remains of Claar we're also found the same day. Nearby there were
some of his clothing, boots, a camera, as well as his rifle. Beneath a large
stump, under which it had been stuffed, a leather windbreaker belonging to
Claar was also found, as was also his wallet which had been rifled. Holes in
the bones of the lumbar region of Claar were similar to the bullet holes found
in the clothing of Lindsay Jr., but the experts were not able to swear
positively that they were bullet holes.

The remains of Lindsay Sr. had previously been found on July
15, at a distance of approximately one hundred and fifty feet from Camp 24,
near the bank of a small stream. On July 27, his wallet was discovered in the
bed of this stream. The zipper had been pulled open and most of the documents
it contained were partly pulled out, but the wallet was empty of money. When
the deceased had left his home on the 5th of June, he had with him at least
$650. On the butt of his rifle, which was found approximately fifty feet from
his remains, there was evidence of blood and

[Page 223]

human hair, and there was more hair on the ground. In
addition, there was a mark on the butt suggesting it had: been caused by being
grazed by a bullet.

In the vicinity of Camp 24 also, there were first discovered
a sleeping bag containing some bread, a camera case and a couple of jackets.
The sleeping bag had been tightly rolled up and tucked under some trees in the
bush away from the road. This discovery led to a further examination in the
vicinity with the result that, spread over an area of approximately one hundred
feet in the bush, other articles were found including a camp stove, the legs of
which were in the branches of the trees, while the stove itself was down below
in the bushes. All these articles were proved to have belonged to one or other
of the deceased. It was apparent to the searchers from the places in which they
were found that these latter articles had been thrown away. In addition to the
three rifles mentioned, another was found in the abandoned truck, from which
nothing else appeared to have been taken. None of the rifles had been recently
fired. The Lindsay party had taken with them four rifles only.

It is reasonably apparent from the articles not taken, and
the jury could so conclude, that the motive for the killing was robbery and
that it was money which the robber chiefly wanted.

Coffin, with one MacDonald, had been in the area in question
on the 8th and 9th of June, had spent the night at Camp 24 and had gone as far as
a mile and a half west of Camp 26 before returning to Gaspé on
afternoon of June 9, arranging to meet MacDonald next morning at
Coffin's home at six o'clock for the purpose of returning to the area for
prospecting purposes. Coffin did not, as already mentioned, keep this
appointment. Instead, according to his own story, very early on the morning of
June 10, he set out for Camp 21 alone in the truck which he had borrowed from
one Baker and which he and MacDonald had used on the two preceding days. He told
the police that he had come upon the three Americans about three miles east of
Camp 21 and had had breakfast with them.

According to Coffin, Lindsay Sr., had requested him to go to
Gaspé Lindsay Jr., to have the gas pump of the Lindsay
truck, which Coffin said was not working, repaired. He did so and the presence
of the two in Gaspé day was independently proved. On
arrival at Gaspé, Coffin said

[Page 224]

they found it impossible to repair the pump and young
Lindsay purchased a new one. They then returned, reaching the others about four
or five o'clock that afternoon. At this time, according to Coffin's story to
the police, there were the two other Americans there with a yellowish plywood
jeep. Coffin said he was introduced but did not remember their names.

Coffin stated that Lindsay Sr. took out his wallet and paid
him $40 in American currency, a $20 bill and two $10 bills. Coffin stated that
after having a meal with the Americans, he left for Camp 21 and that he
prospected in the vicinity until June 12, when he set out on the return trip to
Gaspé. On the place where he had left the five
Americans on the evening of the 10th, he said the Lindsay truck was there but
no person. After waiting some time, he went on, reaching the home of MacGregor,
a neighbour, in the early evening. Subsequently and about midnight, he left for
Montreal, where he remained until on or about July 14.

On arrival in Montreal, Coffin had in his possession a knife
having a number of attachments, the property of Lindsay Jr., as well as a pair
of binoculars, the property of Claar's father, which the latter had lent his
son for the purposes of the trip. These binoculars had a value of $65. Coffin
had also the gas pump and a valise of Claar Jr., which contained a shirt, two
pairs of shorts, two pairs of socks, a pair of blue jeans and two towels.
According to the witness Petrie, Coffin told her that
the knife and the binoculars had been given to him as souvenirs by some
Americans he had helped in the Gaspé . He made no
explanation to her or to anyone else with respect to the valise or any of its
contents nor as to the pump. When Coffin returned to Gaspé had
the valise and the knife with him. The valise was unpacked by his sister, Mrs. Stanley,
who found in it the two towels and thé pair jeans. He
made the same statement to her with regard to the knife as he had made to Petrie but nothing about any of the other articles.

As already pointed out, the appellant concedes that there
was sufficient evidence of the theft of the various articles but not of any
connection between the theft and the killing.

[Page 225]

With respect to Coffin's account of his possession of the
knife and the binoculars, it is to be kept in mind that he made no attempt to
explain to anyone his possession of the other articles. That Coffin would be
paid $40 for going back to Gaspé Lindsay Jr. on June 9
would, taken by itself, seem likely to cause some raising of eyebrows among the
jury, but when that story is coupled with the further statement that Coffin
had, in addition, been ""given"" binoculars of a value of $65, a gift
which no one but Claar Sr., who was in Pennsylvania could make, and the knife,
which was of a special character and which had been a special gift to young
Lindsay, the limits of credulity are surely overpassed. It cannot, therefore,
be said, in my opinion, that the appellant gave any reasonable explanation of
how he came to be in the possession of the things as to which he even attempted
to make an explanation; R. v. Curnock 24.

Moreover, if the jury did not believe the story that Coffin
had been ""paid"" $40 by Lindsay Sr., it was established out of his
own! mouth that he was in possession on June 10 of part, at least, of money
belonging to Lindsay Sr.

In my opinion, therefore, there was abundant evidence from
which the jury could conclude that the possessor of the money and the other
items was the robber and the murderer as well. I think they have done so.

In Regina v. Exall 25,
Pollock C.B., said at 924:

The principle is this, that if a person is found in
possession of property recently stolen, and of which he can give no
reasonable account, a jury are justified in coming to the conclusion that
he committed the robbery.

And so it is of any crime to which the robbery was incident,
or with which it was connected, as burglary, arson, or murder. For, if the
possession be evidence that the person committed the robbery, and the person
who committed the robbery committed the other crime, then it is evidence that
the person in whose possession the property is found committed that other
crime.

The law is, that if recently after the commission of the
crime, a person is found in possession of the stolen goods, that person is
called upon to account for the possession, that is, to give an
explanation of it, which is not unreasonable or improbable.

In a note to the above case at p. 850 of vol. 176 of the
English Reports, the editor refers to the case of R. v. Muller at
p. 385 of the same volume, where the murder in question had occurred in a
railway carriage on a Saturday

[Page 226]

evening and on the following Monday the prisoner was found
in possession of the watch of the murdered man which he said he had bought off
a pedlar at the London docks. The question arose as to whether, supposing the
jury were not satisfied of the accused's guilt upon the evidence apart from the
recent possession of the hat and watch, such possession would be sufficient
proof of the prisoner's guilt of the murder. The note reads:

That it would have been sufficient, if no explantion at all
had been offered, would be conceded. For the absence of explanation would have
amounted to an admission.

In the case at bar the evidence which I have thus far
discussed, does not stand alone.

Very shortly after Coffin came out of the bush on the
evening of June 12, he went to see the witness Boyle and paid him an ""old
debt"" of $5.25. The same evening, also, he went to the hotel of the
witness White where he purchased a case of ale, in payment for which he
tendered a $20 American bill, and on being told that he owed White $5
""from last year"", he paid that. Change was given to him in Canadian
money.

At 1.30 a.m. on June 13, before he had left York Centre for
Montreal, he also visited one Tuzo and paid him $10 which the latter had loaned
him approximately five weeks earlier.

About 3 a.m. on the same morning, Coffin got into the ditch
at a place called Seal Cove about twelve miles on the road to Montreal from Gaspé was helped out by the witness Element, who was paid by
Coffin $2 in American bills.

At about 6.30 a.m. the same day, the witness Despard testified
that he had filled the tank of Coffin's truck at Percé repaired
the brake at a cost of $8, for which Coffin tendered a
$20 American bill, asking for only $10 in change, thereby tipping him $2.

Later, at a place called Chandler, Coffin received a haircut,
a shave and a hair wash at the barber shop of the witness Poirier
at a cost of $1.50. In. addition to paying this, he left a tip of $1.50,
and paid $1 for a shoeshine. He also paid for the haircut of another customer
in the shop and left as well a tip of $1.75.

[Page 227]

Later the same morning, Coffin got into the ditch again near
a place called St-Charles de Caplan, out of which he
was assisted by the witness J. P. Poirier, to whom he
tendered another $20 American bill. Poirier testified
that Coffin took the money out of a brown wallet which was filled with
bills to a depth of approximately half an inch.

At noon the same day, at Black Cape, Gaspé,
appellant incurred a small garage bill and left the proprietor a tip of
$1. About 8.30 a.m. on June 14, he went to the home of the witness Tardif St-André de Kamouraska he purchased toast and coffee
and seven bottles of beer, for which he paid $5. After he had left, a $10
Canadian bill was found under the chair which he had occupied.

Prior to leaving York Centre for Montreal, the only money
which Coffin was known to have had was $20 which he had received from MacDonald
on the evening of the 9th of June to enable him to buy gas and other supplies
for their return trip into the bush. This is apart from the $40 in American
funds which he alleged he had received from Lindsay Sr. Coffin's last known
employment was in May but how long he had worked or how much money he had was
not shown.

The character of the above expenditures was such as to call
as much for explanation as the recent possession of stolen goods; Wills on
Circumstantial Evidence, 7th ed., p. 105.

On Coffin's return from Montreal on July 20, when the
remains of Lindsay Sr. had been found but the search for the others was
proceeding, he was asked by the police to assist. He went with them the next
day and it was then that he gave the account of his movements between June 10
and 12 to which I have already referred.

Coffin told the police, also, that on his visit from June 10
to 12 inclusive, he had not gone beyond Camp 21 but on July 21, when the search
party were having lunch at Camp 24, Gold water was asked for and Coffin went
out to get it. He had, however, gone only five or ten feet beyond the door when
he turned and asked ""Where is the brook?"", and did not go farther.
The brook was within sixty feet of the shanty and readily visible. Upon Coffin
saying this, one of the other men of the party, one Adams, said to him

[Page 228]

that he knew the country as well as Adams did himself. To
this Coffin made no answer. Moreover, MacDonald testified that he and Coffin
had eaten a meal within ten feet of that brook on June 9. It will be remembered
that it was in the bed of this brook that the rifled wallet of Lindsay Sr. was
later found on July 27. When the search party reached Camp 24, Coffin said he
remembered having ""come up to"" Camp 24 with MacDonald. According to
the latter, he and Coffin had gone beyond Camp 26 about a mile and a half on
June 9.

Members of the search party testified that Coffin participated
on a small scale in the search, during which he kept away from the sides of the
road where the various articles thrown into the bush had been found.

As was said by Cockburn C.J., in Moriarty v. Ry.
Co. 26:

… it is evidence against a prisoner that he has said one
thing at one time and another at another, as shewing that the recourse to
falsehood leads fairly to an inference of guilt.

This is clearly applicable to the case at bar, which, in my
opinion, is completely covered by the principle stated by Lord Tenterden C.J.,
in R. v. Burdett 27:

No person is to be required to explain or contradict, until
enough has been proved to warrant a reasonable and just conclusion against him,
in the absence of explanation or contradiction; but when such proof has been
given, and the nature of the case is such as to admit of explanation or
contradiction, if the conclusion to which the proof tends be untrue, and the
accused offers no explanation or contradiction; can human reason do
otherwise than adopt the conclusion to which the proof tends?

This being so, the circumstances, in my opinion, are such as
to call for the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by s. 1014(2) of the Criminal
Code, notwithstanding error in the proceedings as already mentioned.

The effect of the sub-section has been variously expressed
but the underlying principle was thus stated by Viscount Simon in Harris v.
Director of Public Prosecutions 28:

If it could be. said that a' reasonable jury after being
properly directed would, on the evidence properly, admissible, without doubt
have convicted …, the proviso should be applied. This is the test laid down by
this House in Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecutions, 1914
A.C., 315 at 321.

Similar language had previously been used by Anglin J., as
he then was, in delivering the judgment of the majority

[Page 229]

in Kelly v. The King 29,
where the decisions of the Privy Council in Makin v.
Attorney General of New South Wales 30
and Ibrahim y. The King 31,
were referred to. It may be observed that in the latter case, Lord Sumner, at
p. 616, called attention to the former, as follows:

Even in Makin's case, however, reservation was made of cases
""where it is impossible to suppose that the evidence improperly admitted
can have had any influence on the verdict of the Jury,"" and this
reservation is not to be taken as exhaustive.

Again, in Stein v. The King 32,
Anglin C.J.C., after referring to Makin's case, Ibrahim's case, Allen
v. The King 33
and Gouin v. The King 34,
said:

It may be that sometimes objectionable testimony as to which
there has been misdirection is so unimportant that the court would be justified
in taking the view that in all human probability it could have had no effect
upon the jury's mind, and on that ground, in refusing to set aside the verdict.

In that case the court considered the section
inapplicable as the trial judge had erred in a most vital matter. In my
opinion, the error in the case at bar was confined to matter of a comparatively
minor character. Even where there has occurred misdirection in a material
matter, the section is applicable if the court is satisfied that the jury,
properly directed, must have reach the same conclusion: Boulianne v.
The King 35.

In the case at bar, the evidence being as above reviewed
with no explanation attempted by the appellant as to some of the articles in
his possession and no explanation as to the others that could reasonably be
true, no reasonable jury could, in my opinion, have done ""otherwise than
adopt the conclusion to which the proof tend(ed).""

Accordingly, if the application made by Wilbert Coffin for
leave to appeal had been granted on any of the grounds alleged on the said
application, I would have dismissed the appeal.

Locke J.:—The
facts, so far as it is necessary to consider them, are stated in the reasons
for judgment to be delivered by my brother Cartwright which I have had the
advantage of reading.

[Page 230]

As to the fourth ground of appeal, that portion of the
evidence of Sergeant Doyon as to the ""precise information"" on which
he acted in searching for the rifle in the vicinity of Coffin's camp was
clearly hearsay. During the course of the argument of counsel for the Crown, he
was asked if he could suggest any meaning which could be given to the language
employed, other than that some one (unnamed) had given the witness information
that the rifle was to be found there. He was unable to do so. I also find
myself unable to attribute any other meaning to the words. The answer made by
Constable Synnett that:—

We proceeded to the place where Sergeant Doyon had got his
information from—where the indicated spot was supposed to be, and we got there
at the indicated place, and the rifle was not there.

amounted to repeating the inadmissible evidence of
Doyon.

The fact that the learned trial judge and both of the
counsel who presented the case of the Crown to the jury accentuated its
importance in determining the issue of the guilt or innocence of the accused
appears to me to be decisive of the question as to the material nature of the
evidence.

In Allen v. The King 36,
this Court considered an appeal, by a person convicted of murder in British
Columbia, upon a reserved case, the basis for the appeal being that evidence
had been improperly admitted at the trial. At the time Allen's Case was
considered, s. 1019 of the Criminal Code (c. 146, R.S.C. 1906), dealing
with appeals in criminal cases to a court of appeal, read:—

No conviction shall be set aside nor any new trial directed,
although it appears that some evidence was improperly admitted or rejected, or
that something not according to law was done at the trial or some misdirection
given, unless in the opinion of the court of appeal, some substantial wrong or
miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the trial.

It was contended for the Crown that this section should
be applied in disposing of the appeal. Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J., with whom
Duff J. (as he then was) agreed, said in reference to this (p. 339):—

It was argued that the section of our Code, upon which the
Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal relied, specially provides that the appeal
shall be dismissed even where illegal evidence has been admitted, if there is
otherwise sufficient legal evidence of guilt. I cannot agree that the effect of
the section is to do more than, as I said before, give the judges on an appeal
a discretion which they may be trusted to exercise only where

[Page 231]

the illegal evidence or other irregularities are so trivial
that it may safely be assumed that the jury was not influenced by it. If there
is any doubt as to this the prisoner must get the benefit of that doubt propter
favorem vitœ. say that we are in this case
charged with the duty of deciding the extent to which the improperly admitted
evidence may have influenced some of the jurors would be to hold, as I have
already said, that Parliament authorized us to deprive the accused in a capital
case of the benefit of a trial by jury.

Having said this, the Chief Justice said that the law on the
point had been laid down by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1893
in Makin v. Attorney General for New
South Wales 37,
and quoted the following extract from the judgment of Lord Chancellor
Herschell:—

It was said that if without the inadmissible evidence there
were evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict and to shew that the accused
was guilty, there has been no substantial wrong or other miscarriage of
justice. It is: obvious that
the construction transfers from the jury to the court the determination of the
question whether the evidence—that is to say, what the law regards as
evidence—established the guilt of the accused. The result is that, in a case
where the accused has the right to have his guilt or innocence tried by a jury,
the judgment passed upon him is made to depend not on the finding of the jury,
but on the decision of the court. The judges are in truth substituted for the
jury, the verdict becomes theirs and theirs alone, and is arrived at upon a
perusal of the evidence without any opportunity of seeing the demeanour of the
witnesses and weighing the evidence with the assistance which this affords.

It is impossible to deny that such a change of the law would
be a very serious one, and the construction which their Lordships are invited
to put upon the enactment would gravely affect the much-cherished right of
trial by jury in criminal cases. The evidence improperly admitted might have
chiefly, affected the jury to return a verdict of guilty, and the rest of the
evidence which might appear to the court sufficient to support the conviction
might have been reasonably disbelieved by the jury in view of the demeanour of
the witnesses. Yet the court might, under such circumstances, be justified, or
even consider themselves bound to let the judgment and sentence stand. These
are startling consequences. … 

Their Lordships do not think it can properly be said that
there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice where, on a point
material to the guilt or innocence of the accused, the jury have,
notwithstanding objection, been invited by the judge to consider, in arriving
at their verdict, matters which ought not to have been submitted to them. In
their Lordships' opinion, substantial wrong would be done to the accused if he
were deprived of the verdict of a jury on the facts proved by legal evidence,
and there were substituted for it the verdict of the court founded merely upon
a perusal of the evidence.

The language above quoted was followed by the
following, which was the concluding paragraph of the Lord Chancellor's
judgment:—

Their Lordships desire to guard themselves against being
supposed to determine that the proviso may not be relied on in cases where it
is

[Page 232]

impossible to suppose that the evidence improperly admitted
can have had any influence on the verdict of the jury, as for example where
some merely formal matter not bearing directly on the guilt or innocence of the
accused has been proved by other than legal evidence.

While this was not quoted by the Chief Justice, it was
clearly adopted by him in the passage from his judgment above recited.

Anglin J., saying that to accept the construction of s. 1019
urged on behalf of the Crown would be, in effect, to substitute the court for
the jury in determining the question whether the evidence which was admissible
established the guilt of the accused, quoted that passage from the judgment of
the Lord Chancellor in which it was said that in their Lordship's opinion
substantial wrong would be done to the accused if he were deprived of the
verdict of a jury on the facts proved by legal evidence and there were
substituted for it the verdict of the court founded merely upon the perusal of
the evidence. While both the Chief Justice and Anglin J. noted that the
enactment considered in Makin's Case differed from the language of s.
1019 in that it read:—

Provided that no conviction or judgment thereon shall be
reversed arrested or avoided on any case so stated unless for some substantial
wrong or other miscarriage of justice.

both clearly were of the opinion that there was no real
distinction between the statutory provisions.

S. 592(1) (b)(iii) of the new Code which
applies to the disposition of the present matter by virtue of s. 746 provides
that the court may dismiss the appeal, notwithstanding that it is of the
opinion that, on any question of law, the appeal might be decided in favour of
the appellant if ""it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has occurred."" The meaning of the language quoted
is indistinguishable from that of the section 1019 considered in Allen's
Case. In my opinion, we are bound by the decision of the Judicial Committee
in Makin's Case and by that of the majority of this Court in Allen's
Case. It cannot, in my opinion, be said that the evidence in question, to
which so much importance was attached by the learned trial judge and by Crown
counsel when the matter was presented to the jury, was evidence of the nature
referred to in the concluding passage of the Lord Chancellor's judgment above
referred to. Once it is determined that the evidence improperly admitted is on
a point

[Page 233]

material to the guilt or innocence of the accused, it cannot
properly he said that there has been no substantial wrong ] or miscarriage of
justice and the section has, in my opinion, no application.

The decision of this Court in Schmidt v. The King
38,
was not in a case in which there had been an improper admission of evidence of
this character and was not intended to be at variance with Allen's Case, in
my opinion.

On all of the other questions discussed by my brother
Cartwright I agree with his conclusions and with his reasons for those
conclusions.

If leave to appeal had been granted on those grounds
advanced on the application for leave to appeal, dealt with by my brother
Cartwright and by me, it would have been my opinion that the appeal should be
allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed.

Cartwright J.:—On
August 5, 1954, following his trial at Percé the
Province of Quebec before Lacroix J. a jury, Wilbert
Coffin was convicted of having, between June 1, 1953 and July 23, 1953,
murdered Richard Lindsay. He appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal
Side) 39,
and his appeal was dismissed without dissent. He then applied to a Judge of
this Court for leave to appeal to this Court upon a number of questions of law;
this application having been dismissed, he appealed to the Court from such
dismissal; and the Court, being of opinion that it was without jurisdiction,
dismissed the appeal.

His Excellency the Governor General in Council has referred
the following question to the Court:—

If the application made by Wilbert Coffin for leave to
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada had been granted on any of the grounds
alleged on the said application, what disposition of the appeal would now be
made by the Court?

We have had the assistance of full and able arguments
by counsel for the Attorney General of Quebec and for Coffin.

The grounds alleged on the application for leave to appeal
to this Court which were argued before us are as follows:—

1. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in respect to the
instructions he gave to the jury with reference to the doctrine of recent
possession in the following manner:—

(a) Should the jury have been permitted to apply the
doctrine at all?

[Page 234]

(b) Were the jury .misdirected with reference
to the burden resting on the Appellant to explain his possession of items
allegedly stolen?

2. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in failing to instruct
the jury that they were not entitled to convict the Appellant of murder simply 'because
they came to the conclusion that he was guilty of the theft of the various
articles proved to have been the property of the victim, Richard Lindsay, and
his associates?

3. Did the Learned Trial Judge err by instructing the jury
in a manner that would indicate the statements and declarations made by the
Appellant to various witnesses were not to be regarded as circumstantial
evidence and evidence therefore to which the rule in Hodge's case should be
applied?

4. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in admitting evidence
concerning a certain rifle, the property of one Jack Eagle?

5. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in admitting the evidence
of one Marion Petrie Coffin, common law wife of the
Appellant?

6. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in permitting the jury to
attend a moving picture theatre in the company of two police officers who were
subsequently called as witnesses for the Crown?

7. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in refusing the
application made on behalf of the Appellant to be tried by a jury composed
entirely of English-speaking citizens?

8. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial according to law by
reason of the failure of the Sheriff of the County in which the Appellant was
tried to comply with the provisions of the Quebec Jury Act (1945, 9 George VI,
Chap. 22)?

9. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial according to law by
reason of the improper mixture of the English and French languages?

10. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial according to law
by reason of the fact that Crown Counsel in their addresses to the jury used
inflammatory language?

The evidence indicated that Richard Lindsay, aged 17
years, his father, Eugene Lindsay and a friend Frederick Claar left their home
in Pennsylvania on June 5, 1953, in a truck to go on a hunting trip in the
District of Gaspé which they never returned. Their
remains were discovered by search parties in July 1953, those of Eugene Lindsay
on July 15 about 150 feet from a camp known as Camp 24 and those of Richard
Lindsay and Claar, about two hundred feet apart, in a heavily wooded area in
the vicinity of a camp known as Camp 26 which is distant about two and a half
miles from Camp 24. Camp 24 is about 60 miles from Gaspé. medical
evidence was that their deaths had occurred not later than June 17.

[Page 235]

As is pointed out by Hyde J. the Crown's case against Coffin
was based on circumstantial evidence. The main circumstances claimed to be
established were:—

(a) that Richard Lindsay was shot;

(b) that property belonging to him and his two
deceased companions was stolen;

(c) that Coffin had an opportunity to commit the
crime;

(d) that a weapon (Eagle's rifle), which
could have been used to shoot Richard Lindsay, was loaned to Coffin prior to
the date of the crime and was never returned to its owner;

(e) that when Coffin came out of the bush on
June 12 the muzzle of a rifle was seen in his truck;

(f) that the motive of the murder was theft;

(g) that Coffin had possession of
articles which were the property of the three deceased;

(h) that as to some of these he gave no
explanation and as to others no reasonable explanation of having them in his
possession;

(i) that when he left home Eugene Lindsay
had about $650 in cash but that when his wallet was found there was no money in
it;

(j) that after June 12 Coffin had possession of
a substantial amount of money although prior to that date he was shewn to owe
some small debts;

(k) that Coffin made contradictory statements as
to his actions during the period when the murder was committed;

(l) that Coffin's conduct during the search for
the remains of some of the deceased, in which he took part, was suspicious;

(m) that Coffin, after being arrested,
arranged to have Eagle's rifle made away with.

Coffin did not testify and no witnesses were called for the
defence. Statements which he had made to police officers and to Marion Petrie , who was described as his common law wife, were
proved as part of the Crown's case. Some parts of these statements, if true,
were exculpatory; they contained no admission of guilt. This brief

[Page 236]

summary, while far from complete, is, I think, sufficient to
indicate the evidentiary background against which the questions of law raised
for decision must be considered.

Ground 4.

I propose to deal first with ground 4 above. There was
evidence that in May 1953 the witness Eagle had loaned his Marlin .32-40
calibre rifle to Coffin; that up to the time of the trial the rifle had not
been returned to him; and that the holes in the clothing of Richard Lindsay,
indicating that he had been shot, could have been made by a bullet of the
calibre of Eagle's rifle. It was part of the theory of the Crown that Coffin
had shot Richard Lindsay with Eagle's rifle. The evidence objected to was
introduced in an endeavour to establish that at some time after the murder and
probably before leaving for Montreal on June 13 Coffin had hidden this rifle
near his camp; that on August 27 he had told his brother Donald Coffin where he
had hidden it and that in the night of August 27 Donald Coffin had gone in a
truck to Wilbert Coffin's camp, got the rifle and made away with it.

Coffin's camp is in wooded country about 14 miles from Gaspé. On forest road leading to this camp there is a barrier
at which persons going into the bush to hunt are required to obtain a permit.
Coffin had been taken into custody on August 10. On August 27 he was allowed to
have a private interview with his brother Donald at Police Headquarters in Gaspé. came out from this interview in tears. In the early
morning of August 28 the sound of a motor vehicle was heard rushing past the
barrier on the road leading to Coffin's camp. Later on the morning of August 28
Sergeant Doyon and Police Constable Synnett went to Coffin's camp; they saw
marks on the road of the tires of a truck. It was said that Donald Coffin had a
truck but there was no evidence as to whether the marks of its tires were
similar to those seen on the road. Doyon and Synnett made a search in the
vicinity of Coffin's camp but found no rifle.

The evidence objected to is found in the following passages
in the evidence in chief of Sergeant Doyon and Police Constable Synnett.

[Page 237]

Sergeant Doyon—

Q Maintenant, il y a un monsieur Eagle qui a
été entendu au sujet d'une carabine qu'il avait prêtée à . Voulez-vous dire à
la Cour et à messieurs les jurés si vous avez fait quelques recherches au sujet
de cette carabine?

R Oui, j'avais eu une information précise, et
j'ai fait certaines recherches aux alentours du camp de Coffin à la grande
fourche, et plus précisément …

Q A quelle date?

R En date du 28 août.

Q Etait-ce quelle partie de la journée?

R A bonne heure le matin.

Q Et avec qui avez-vous fait ces recherches?

R Avec l'agent Synnett de la Police de la
Route.

Q Alors, où vous êtes-vous rendus?

R De Gaspé, nous nous sommes rendus jusqu'au
petit camp de Coffin à l'endroit appelé Grande Fourche.

Q Et quelle partie avez-vous visitée ou
fouillée?

R Plus précisément, à environ quarante à
cinquante pieds au nord du petit camp de Coffin.

Q Qu'est-ce que vous avez fait, là?

R J'ai fait des recherches avec Synnett dans
cette partie de la forêt, principalement près de petits sapins.

Q Et puis, combien de temps avez-vous cherché
comme ça?

R A partir de sept heures et demie du matin
aller jusqu'à onze heures de l'avant-midi, je crois.

Q Et avez-vous trouvé quelque chose?

R Non monsieur.

Q Pour aller au camp de et à l'endroit où vous
avez fait des recherches sur l'information précise que vous aviez obtenue,
est-ce qu'il faut passer par une barrière?

R Oui, il y a une barrière à environ un
demi-mille de la route nationale, qui conduit de Percé à Gaspé.

Police Constable Synnett—

Q. Now, Mr. Synnett,
had you the occasion to accompany Mr. Doyon in
order, to make any searches in the vicinity of a camp belonging to Coffin?

A. Yes, we went there on the day of the last Coroner's
inquest, or the day following the last Coroner's inquest.

Q. Do you remember what date it was?

A. On the 28th day of August.

Q. Now, will you tell us in what circumstances you made that
trip, and what you noticed at that occasion?

A. We were going to look for a rifle.

Q. Do you know to whom belonged that rifle?

A. Yes, I did, at the time.

Q. Who?

A. John Jack Eagle.

Q. Will you go on?

[Page 238]

A. We proceeded to the place where Sergeant Doyon bad got
his information from—where the indicated spot was supposed to be, and we got
there at the indicated place, and the rifle was not there.

Q. How long did you spend for your search?

A. About an hour.

In my view all those parts of these passages which shewed
that Doyon had information that Eagle's rifle was concealed in a precisely
indicated spot in the neighbourhood of Coffin's camp were inadmissible as being
hearsay evidence. Their meaning is not doubtful; and the jury could only
understand them as a statement that someone, unnamed and not called as a
witness, had told Doyon that Eagle's rifle was concealed near to some small fir
trees 40 or 50 feet to the north of Coffin's cabin and had given Doyon precise
information as to its hiding-place. On this illegal foundation there was erected
and placed before the jury the theory that Coffin had told his brother Donald
where the rifle was and had prevailed on him to get it and make away with it
and that Donald was"" the driver of the vehicle heard to rush past the
barrier in the early morning of August 28. Without evidence that Eagle's rifle
was in fact hidden near Coffin's camp prior to the night of August 27/28 the
whole incident was of negligible probative value and connected with the accused
so remotely, if at all, as to be inadmissible because irrelevant; but with
evidence that the rifle was so concealed counsel for the Crown was in a
position to ask and did ask the jury to infer a conspiracy between Coffin and
his brother to destroy what was, in the Crown's theory, the murder weapon. Evidence
that an accused has suppressed or endeavoured to suppress evidence is
admissible circumstantial evidence against him, but here the foundation of the
whole incident on which the jury were invited to find that he had suppressed
evidence was the inadmissible hearsay evidence dealt with above.

In my view, the admission of this hearsay evidence was a
grave error in law. I do not think that counsel for the Crown can be heard to
say that the evidence was unimportant for it was forcibly put to the jury, in
the address of counsel, as a circumstance pointing to Coffin's guilt and
throwing upon the defence the onus of calling Donald Coffin as a witness which
they had not done.

[Page 239]

When he came to charge the jury the learned trial judge did
so firsi in English and then in French. His charge in English concluded at
12.15 p.m. and the Court adjourned; on resuming at 2.15 p.m. the learned judge
addressed the jury in English as follows:—

Gentlemen, before I address you in French, I want to make
certain corrections. There is an incident in the evidence which I had noted and
I intended to draw your attention to, and I unfortunately overlooked it this
morning.

I told you that on the occasion of that trip in the bush,
MacDonald had declared! that he had not seen any rifle in the equipment, and
that on the 12th of June MacGregor at Murray Patterson's place, had testified
to the fact that he had seen a rifle in the pick-up which was driven by Coffin.

Now, maybe something could be said to complete that part of
the evidence, because there is the testimony of Doyon who later went to
Coffin's camp, following what he declared to be a precise information, the
nature of which has not been established, though; and he says that he had not
found any rifle at that place.

And you have then the conversation which on the previous day
Coffin would have had with his brother at Gaspe, and during that night the gate
keeper's wife, on the road leading to Coffin's camp, would have heard the noise
of an automobile, and the following morning, they saw tracks that didn't cross
on the highway through the gate, but went around.

You will give to these facts the interpretation that should
be given in the light of your judgment and the evidence.

The learned trial judge dealt with the incident in
substantially similar terms when he charged them in French. We find therefore
that inadmissible testimony which had been vigorously stressed by Crown counsel
was again brought to the attention of the jury by the learned trial judge with
an instruction that they should consider it.

In my view the following words of Anglin C.J.C., giving the
unanimous judgment of the Court in Stein v. The King 40,
are applicable to the case at bar:—

It is impossible to say that in the case now before us there
has been no miscarriage of justice. It may be that sometimes objectionable
testimony as to which there has been misdirection is so unimportant that the
court would be justified in taking the view that in all human probability it
could have had no effect upon the jury's mind, and, on that ground, in refusing
to set aside the verdict. But it is impossible so to regard this case, where,
in a most vital matter, the learned judge did not merely fail to warn the jury
to disregard the objectionable matter contained in the statements which had
been admitted in evidence, but actually stressed it.

It is my view that this hearsay evidence in the case at
bar related to a vital matter and, as I have already mentioned,

[Page 240]

I do not think that, in view of the way in which they
stressed it to the jury, counsel for the Crown can now be heard to belittle its
importance. Allegans contraria non est audiendus.

Ground 5.

I will deal next with
ground No. 5. In the memorandum filed on the application for leave to
appeal, this ground was extended to read as follows:—

It is respectively submitted that the crucial testimony
given by Marion Petrie inadmissible for two reasons:—

(a) Her testimony was
privileged by virtue of the provisions of section 4 of the Canada Evidence Act;
and

(b) She was submitted to a
severe cross examination by Crown Counsel notwithstanding the fact that the
Trial Judge had refused the application of Crown Counsel to have her declared a
hostile witness.

Before us, Mr. Maloney did not argue ground (a),
on which the authorities seem to be conclusive, but pressed ground (b).

The witness Marion Petrie was called
by the Crown; she was shown to have lived with Coffin for some years as his
wife. According to her evidence he arrived at her residence in Montreal at
about 2.00 a.m. on June 15 and remained for some days. Some of her evidence
assisted the Crown's case, for example she deposed that Coffin had possession
of articles which other witnesses testified had belonged to the deceased. Her
evidence in chief reads, in part, as follows:—

… When we were talking, he told me about when he went in the
woods, he met three Americans, they had their truck that was broke down, and he
took one of the fellows down to Gaspe to get a gas line or something fixed; he
brought the fellow back, they gave him a pair of binoculars and a knife as a
souvenir. He didn't mention anything about any money.

Q. Did he say he had left the three Americans in the bush?

A. Yes, when he came back, he left the other fellow with the
other two.

Q. You mean the one …

A. The one that he had taken down to Gaspe, he brought back.

Q. That he had left him in the bush with the other two?

A. With the other two.

Q. Is that all he said?

A. Oh, when I asked him if they got the truck fixed, he said
there was another two chaps there the last time he seen them.

Q. Did he say who those fellows were?

[Page 241]

A. He just: said he left them with another two friends, he
didn't say who, and I didn't bother to ask him.

Q. He gave you no more details on that?

A. No, I was not interested.

* * *

Q. So, when did Coffin mention for the first time that there
were two others but the three Americans that we are interested in?

A. Well, it was a few days after he had arrived, I had asked
him, it was just something that was going through my head, and I asked him if
they got the truck fixed. When I asked him if they got the truck fixed, he
said: ""The last time I seen them, there was two chaps with them.""

It is obvious from the record that Crown counsel did not
accept as truthful the witness' statement, that Coffin had told her that when
he last saw them he had left the Lindsays and Claar in company with two other
Americans; and counsel proceeded, against the repeated objections of defence
counsel and in spite of the definite refusal of the learned trial judge to
declare Miss Petrie an witness, to conduct a
cross-examination, in the course of which he referred her to a statement she
was alleged to have made to a police officer and to the evidence she had given
at the preliminary inquiry. The examination of this witness by Crown counsel
concludes as follows:—

Q. Do you recall having been heard as a witness at the
preliminary. inquiry ?

A. Yes sir.

Q. And that was about a year ago?

A. Yes sir.

Q. Was your memory fresh over the facts we are concerned
about, at the time?

A. A little better than they are now. Q. Now, would you like
to refresh your memory?

A. ………….

Q. What did your memory tell you at the time?

Mr. Raymond Maher,

For the Defence:

OBJECTED to the way of putting the question.

Mr. Paul Miquelon, Q.C.

For the Prosecution:

Q. What did your memory tell you at the time?

A. He just said three; he mentioned the three when he went
out with them.

OBJECTION BY Mr. Francois Gravel,

For the Defence:

Mr. Paul Miquelon, Q.C.

For the Prosecution:

Q. How did your memory serve you at the time?

A. Not too bad, I guess.

[Page 242]

Q. Well, what did it say?

A. He just said ""three"", he mentioned the three
when he went out with them.

Q. To what question did you give that answer at the time?

A. Did he talk about one American hunter or a second group
or a party.

Q. And, to that question, the answer was the one you just
gave us?

A. He just said three.

Q. And that answer was?

A. He just said three, he mentioned the three when he went
out with them.

It was argued before us that, whether or not counsel was
entitled to cross-examine his own witness, he was entitled to have her refresh
her memory by reading inaudibly to herself the evidence which she had given at
the preliminary inquiry. In Lizotte v. The King 41,
the question whether a witness may refresh his memory by referring to the
transcript of his evidence at the preliminary hearing was left open after
attention had been called to the views expressed by eminent writers and I do
not find it necessary to decide that question in this case, as it seems clear
from reading the record that the transcript of the preliminary hearing was used
not for the purpose of refreshing the memory of the witness, who had already
without assistance testified as to her conversations with Coffin, but for the
purpose of endeavouring to have her admit, (i) that at the preliminary inquiry
she had not referred to any statement by Coffin that he had left the three
deceased with two other Americans, and (ii) that she must have been mistaken or
untruthful in her evidence at the trial in saying that Coffin had made such
statement to her.

When all of the evidence of this witness is read it does not
appear to me that there was any unexplained difference between her evidence at
the preliminary inquiry and that which she gave at the trial; but the jury may
well have taken a different view as they were invited to do by Crown counsel as
appears from the following passages in his address:—

Now, I am not here to judge Coffin's personal life, nor his
wife's personal life, but on the other hand you know that that person who goes
around as Mrs. Coffin is not Mrs. Coffin, they live as man and wife, I could
not expect, and neither could you expect her to come here and tell us the whole
story. I could not expect that, and she wouldn't be his wife, common wife or otherwise,
and even if she did deny that Coffin confessed everything to her, but there is
one other important point, after

[Page 243]

many contradictions, she admits—and keep that in mind—she
admits that Coffin never mentioned two other American and she, at the last part
of her testimony, she came back to what she had said at the preliminary inquiry
when she told us her memory served her much better, that he only mentioned
three Americans, and remember that later on, when we get Coffin back in Gaspe,
because if there is one person in the world to whom he should have confided
during that night, it was Mrs. Coffin, not his mother but his common-law wife.

* * *

Did Coffin try to point those two Americans as possible
culprits? I know he did, we brought them here to tell us their story. Do you
think that story is true when you have heard the story of Marion Petrie whom he never mentioned, according to her own
testimony—and you can believe that woman when she comes up and says anything
that would hurt Coffin—I don't say she should be believed as easily when she
says something in favour of Coffin, but when she states something against
Coffin, it is because she has to say it and can't get out of it.

In my view the cross-examination of this witness by
Crown counsel was unlawful, and was attended by a further error in that no
warning was given to the jury that any evidence of what the witness had said at
the preliminary inquiry was not evidence of the truth of the facts then stated
but could be considered by them only for the purpose of testing the credibility
of the testimony which she had given before them at the trial. Similar errors
were treated as grounds for quashing a conviction in Rex v. Duckworth
42
and in Rex v. Darlyn43.

Ground 6.

I will deal next with
ground No. 6. It appears that during the course of the trial the jury asked
permission to attend a moving picture theatre. The learned trial judge
consulted counsel and a consent in the following terms was signed by Coffin and
his counsel:—

Nous soussignés consentons que les jurés se
rendent au cinéma à ce 27e jour de juillet , sous les conditions suivantes:

1. Que six gendarmes aient la charge des
jurés, sous la direction du sergent Cassista;

2. Que la représentation ne représente aucun
procès quelconque;

3. Que les jurés et les gendarmes soient tenus
complètement à part du public dans le théâtre et à la sortie.

Six constables were sworn to escort
the jury to and from the moving: picture theatre at Chandler, the journey being
made in automobiles. The record does not disclose the oath administered to the
constables. There is. nothing in the

[Page 244]

record to suggest that during the
course of this excursion any of the jury had communication with any member of
the public or that there was an improper conversation between the constables
and the members of the jury; but a few days later two of these constables were
called and examined as Crown witnesses. One of them, Poirier, did
not give evidence of any importance, but the other, Pépin, evidence
of a conversation between Coffin and his father which took place after Coffin
had been in custody for about 17 days. As to this Pépin:—

A. Well, all I heard was this: Mr. Coffin, Wilbert's father,
said: ""are they treating you well?"" He says: ""Yes, I am
well."" He says: ""don't worry Dad, I'll be home soon,"" and before
he left, the accused: ""they are not man enough to break me.""

In the Court of Queen's Bench, Hyde J. after quoting
the above answer continues:—

This is certainly not one of the essential links in the
chain of circumstances. I do not regard it as necessarily incriminating but
certainly, looked at in a certain light, it could be prejudicial to the
Appellant.

At the trial however it had been stressed by Crown
counsel in the following terms:—

Et je terminerai par ce dernier mot qui a été
également l'un des derniers de la preuve, celui-là qu'il a prononcé lui-même
devant les hommes de police à l'adresse de son père: ""They are not man
enough to break me."" Ils ne sont pas assez hommes pour me casser ou me
briser.

Messieurs, est-ce là le langage d'un innocent?
Est-ce là le langage d'une personne qui n'a rien à se reprocher? Est-ce là le
langage d'une personne qui ne fuit pas la justice? Est-ce là le langage d'une
conscience qui véritablement est en paix? .

Je vous pose la question, et je crois que ces

profondeurs des bois où j'ai abattu ces trois Américains; la vérité n'éclairera

and in his charge the learned trial judge invited the jury to consider whether or not Coffin's statement to his father indicated a guilty mind. I
mention this not to suggest that either the learned judge or counsel for the
Crown made improper use of this piece of evidence but to shew the importance
assigned to it in the conduct of the Crown's case at the trial. While, as
mentioned above, there is no

[Page 245]

evidence to suggest that any improper communication in
fact took place between this officer and any member of the jury, this
unfortunate incident appears to me to fall within the principle stated by Sloan
C.J. in Rex v. Masuda 44,
as follows:—

Stripped to its bare essentials, there can be no escape from
the fact that three Crown Witnesses dined with the jury during a murder trial.
It seems to me that to countenance such a situation as is thus presented,
violates two essentials of justice. The one is that the jury must be kept
completely free from any opportunity of communication during the trial, except
under the most exceptional circumstances calling for a direction from the
Court; and, secondly, that nothing must occur during the trial of a case from
which a suspicion may arise that any taint attaches to the proper and meticulous
fairness which must always surround the administration of public justice, more
especially when a man is on trial for his life.

* * *

Moreover, if Crown witnesses are permitted to join the jury
in an atmosphere of sociability during the adjournment of a murder trial, the
confidence of the public in our present system of trial by jury would be
shaken. The Courts are the custodians of that confidence and it must be upheld
and not weakened. Thus it appears to us that the opportunity for communication,
while a factor for consideration, is not the whole test to be applied in the
circumstances. The test, in our opinion, is that enunciated by Lord Hewart,
C.J. in R. v. Sussex Justices, (1923) 93 L.J.K.B. p. 129 at p. 131
wherein he said: ""Nothing is to be done which so much as creates even a
suspicion that there has been an improper interference with the course of
justice"", and ""it is … of fundamental importance, that justice should
not only be done, but be manifestly and undoubtedly seen to be done.""

I agree with everything that was said by the learned
Chief Justice in the passages quoted; and I am unable to find any such
essential difference between the circumstances under which the jury were in
company with the Crown witness in the case before us and those in the case with
which the learned Chief Justice was dealing as would justify our refusing to
apply the principle which he enunciated. In my view, unless we are prepared to
overrule the judgment in Rex v. Masuda, there is no escape from
holding that the incident on which this ground of appeal is founded was fatal
to the: validity of the conviction.

Ground 7.

I will deal next with ground No. 7. It appears from the Procès-verbal Coffin's trial commenced at Percé on 15, 1954, and that on, May 29, 1954 a notice had
been

[Page 246]

served on the Attorney General of Quebec and the Clerk of
the Queen's Bench, Criminal Assize Division, Percé, on of
Coffin, indicating that he could not speak or understand the French language and
that he would ask at his trial for a jury of his own tongue. On his arraignment
on July 15, 1954 the defence moved that Coffin be tried by a jury composed
entirely of jurors speaking the English language. On this motion Crown counsel
called as a witness the Sheriff of the district of Gaspé deposed
that of the jurors on the list of those qualified for the district about twelve
to fifteen per cent were English-speaking and the remainder were
French-speaking. The learned trial judge reserved judgment on the motion and
gave judgment the' following day rejecting the motion and ordering that the
trial proceed before a mixed jury. The reasons for this decision are set out in
full in Volume I of the record at pages 25 to 30 inclusive. As I read these
reasons the decision of the learned judge was based upon the following
considerations: (i) that the persons whose names appeared upon the list of
jurors who were English-speaking was twelve to fifteen per cent of the total,
the remainder being French-speaking; (ii) that because of exemptions granted by
the Court and the anticipated challenges, either for cause or peremptory, it
appeared almost impossible to obtain a jury composed entirely of persons
speaking the language of the accused; (iii) in the words of the learned judge:—

CONSIDERING that it does not seem to be in the spirit of the
law that to exercise its discretion, in the sense of paragraph 3, Section 923,
the Tribunal must eliminate eighty-five to eighty-eight per cent of the
qualified talesmen in one district;

Section 923 of the Criminal Code, in force at the
date of the trial, reads as follows:—

923. In those districts in the province of Quebec in which
the sheriff, is required by law to return a panel of petit jurors composed,
one-half of persons speaking the English language, and one-half of persons
speaking the French language, he shall in his return specify separately those
jurors whom he returns as speaking the English language, and those whom he
returns as speaking the French language respectively; and the names of the
jurors so summoned shall be called alternately from such lists.

2. In any district, the prisoner may upon arraignment move.
that he be tried by a jury entirely composed of jurors speaking the English
language, or entirely composed of jurors speaking the French language.

[Page 247]

3. Upon such motion the judge may order the sheriff to
summon a sufficient panel of jurors speaking the English or the French
language, unless in his discretion it appears that the ends of justice are
better served by impanelling a mixed jury.

This section was considered by this Court in Piperno
v. The Queen 45
After re-reading the judgment of the majority in that case, delivered by my
brother Fauteux, and all the authorities to which reference is made therein, it
is my view that the proper construction of s. 923 as applied to the facts of
the case before us is as follows. Coffin having moved that he be tried by a
jury entirely composed of jurors speaking the English language, and it being
conceded that English is his mother tongue and that he does not I speak the
French language, was prima facie entitled to be so tried and could be
required to stand his trial before a mixed jury only if it appeared to the
learned judge presiding at the trial in his discretion that the ends of justice
would be better served by empanelling a mixed jury. Provided the learned judge
exercised his discretion on relevant grounds and in accordance with the law an
appellate court would not interfere with his decision; but, with respect, it
appears to me that he did not direct his mind to the question whether the ends
of justice in the case before him would be better served by empanelling a mixed
jury; that the three reasons, set out above, which he assigns for exercising
his discretion in the way he did, and particularly the last mentioned of these
reasons, were irrelevant considerations; and that, in the result, Coffin was
deprived of a right of which he could only be lawfully deprived by the learned
judge exercising his discretion on relevant and legal grounds.

On a proper construction of s. 923 of the Criminal Code the
question which the learned judge was required to put to himself was whether in
the case which he was about to try the ends of justice would be better served
by empanelling a mixed jury rather than one composed entirely of jurors
speaking the language of the accused, and not whether the empanelling of a jury
of the sort last mentioned would be attended with difficulty or whether the
language of the accused was or was not that spoken by the majority of the
residents of the district in which he was on

[Page 248]

trial for his life. I respectfully
agree with the following passage in the judgment of Langlais J. in Rex v.
Twyndham and McGurk 46:

If I refer to s. 923 of the Criminal Code, subsection (2), I
read: ""In any district, the prisoner may upon arraignment move that he be
tried by a jury entirely composed of jurors speaking the English language, or
entirely composed of jurors speaking the French language.""

Therefore the prisoner when English or French has a right to
move for a jury of his own tongue. It is his privilege and unless there are
special grounds not to grant him such a motion he has an absolute right to it.

Is there a restriction and what is it?

We find it in subsection (3) of the same section which reads
as follows: ""Upon such motion the judge may order the sheriff to summon a
sufficient panel of jurors speaking the English or the French language, unless
in his discretion it appears that the ends of justice are better served by
impanelling a mixed jury."" 

That subsection gives a discretion to the presiding Judge.

Then it is quite clear that the general rule favours
granting the motion unless there are special reasons to refuse it.

In Piperno v. The Queen (supra)
at page 295 my brother Fauteux said:—

Ce qui est sanctionné par la loi, c'est une
faculté donnée à un prévenu, dans la province de Québec, de demander à être
jugé par des jurés familiers avec la langue qu'il parle lui-même—pourvu que ce
soit le français ou l'anglais—et le droit d'obtenir alors au moins un jury
mixte si, dans la discrétion du Juge, il apparaît que les fins de la Justice
soient ainsi mieux servies qu'en faisant droit à sa demande.

There was no need in that case to consider the nature
of the grounds on which the exercise of the discretion given to the trial judge
by s. 923 (3) can lawfully be based. An examination of the record in the case
before us has failed to disclose any ground which appears to me to be
sufficient in law to warrant the accused being denied a jury composed entirely
of persons speaking his language.

This error does not appear to be cured by the provisions of
s. 1011 of the Criminal Code. It was, in my respectful view, an error in
law on the part of the learned trial judge in deciding how the case should be
tried. If the provisions of s. 1011 were an answer in this case they would
equally have been an answer to the objection to which effect was given in Alexander
v. Regem 47,
which was one of the decisions approved in Piperno v. The Queen. Had
this ground alone been raised it would, in my opinion, require

[Page 249]

the setting aside of the verdict; and consequently I do not
find it necessary to consider the related grounds numbers 8 and 9.

Ground 3.

I will deal next with
ground No. 3. What is here complained of is not that the learned trial judge
failed to direct the jury in the manner required by the rule in Hodge's case
but rather that, having properly instructed them as to how they should approach
a case resting solely on circumstantial evidence, he mistakenly gave them to
understand that the case against Coffin did not consist solely of
circumstantial evidence, as, in fact, it clearly did. The passages which are
chiefly objected to are as follows:—

In the present case, the evidence which has been adduced by
the Crown is of two distinctive kinds.

There is: 1) The circumstantial evidence which I have
explained; and 2) The declarations which would have been made by the accused.

* * *

We can say, I believe, that the evidence offered by the
Crown can be divided in two kinds:

1. Circumstantial evidence.

2. Evidence of conversation or words spoken by the accused.

It is argued by counsel for the Attorney General that any
harm done by these passages was remedied later in the charge and particular
reference is made to the following passage:—

It is evident that considering the whole of these facts, no
direct proof can be found anywhere and it is precisely there where you are
asked to extract from the circumstances the conclusions which, in your
estimation, you must take as the result of these facts.

It should tie borne in mind, as was pointed out by
Middleton J.A. in Rex v. Comba 48
and by some members of this Court in Boucher v. The Queen 49,
that the rule in Hodge's case is quite distinct from the rule requiring
a direction on the question of reasonable doubt; and if, on reading the charge
as â , I came to the conclusion that the jury were left
in doubt as to whether the rule in Hodge's did not apply to all the
evidence in the case before us I would have regarded this as serious error.
When the charge is read as a whole I incline to the view that the jury were not
misled in the way suggested; but, as on several other grounds I have concluded
that there should be a new

[Page 250]

trial, I do not pursue this further.
For the same reason I find it unnecessary to deal with grounds numbers 1, 2 and
10 and I express no opinion in regard to them.

Mr. Miquelon, while maintaining that there had been no error
in law at the trial, argued, alternatively, that, even if we should be of
opinion that any of the errors alleged by Coffin's counsel were made out, the
legally admissible evidence was overwhelming and that, had such errors not
occurred, the jury must inevitably have reached the same verdict; and that the
Court should apply the provisions of s. 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code and
dismiss the appeal. That the Crown's case was a very strong one cannot be
denied but I find myself unable to affirm with certainty that if none of the
matters which I regard as errors had occurred the jury must necessarily have
convicted. Reading the written record we cannot say to what extent each witness
weighed with the jury or how much importance they attached to one or another of
the items of evidence; and, to borrow the words of Viscount Sankey in Maxwell
v. Director of Public Prosecutions 50,
it may well be that the hearsay evidence as. to Eagle's rifle or the effect
which the jury were invited to give to the unlawful cross-examination of Marion
Petrie may have been the last ounce which turned the
scale against the accused. But the matter does not rest here. Section 1014 (2)
reads as follows:—

The court may also dismiss the appeal if, notwithstanding
that it is of opinion that on any of the grounds above mentioned the appeal
might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is also of opinion that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

This sub-section has often been considered by this
Court and its meaning is stated in the following passage in the judgment of
Kerwin J., as he then was, in Schmidt v. The King 51:

The meaning of these words has been considered in this Court
in several cases, one of which is Gouin v. The King, from all of
which it is clear that the onus rests on the Crown to satisfy the Court that
the verdict would necessarily have been the same if the charge had been correct
or if no evidence had been improperly admitted. The principles therein set
forth do not differ from the rules set forth in a recent decision of the House
of Lords in Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecutions, i.e.,
that the proviso that the Court of Appeal may dismiss the appeal if they
consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred

[Page 251]

in convicting the accused assumes a situation where a
reasonable jury, after being properly directed, would, on the evidence properly
admissible, without doubt convict.

It will be observed that, once error in law has been
found to have occurred at the trial, the onus resting upon the Crown is to
satisfy the Court that the verdict would necessarily have been the same if such
error had not occurred. The satisfaction of this onus is a condition precedent
to the right of the Appellate Court to apply the terms of the sub-section at
all. The Court is not bound to apply the sub-section merely because this onus
is discharged. Even if the onus referred to could be regarded as having been
satisfied by the Crown in the case before us it would nonetheless be my opinion
that the error in law which I have dealt with under ground 4 above was so
substantial a wrong that the verdict could not be saved by the application of
s. 1014 (2). To hold otherwise would, I think, be contrary to the principles
enunciated in Makin v. Attorney General for New South Wales 52,
Allen v. The King 53,
Northey v. The King 54
and the judgment of my brother Locke in Boucher v. The Queen 55.

In Makin's
case at page 70 Lord Herschell L.C. said in dealing with; a
provision similar to s. 1014 (2):—

Their Lordships do not think it can properly be said that
there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, where on a point
material to the guilt or innocence of the accused the jury have,
notwithstanding objection, been invited by the. judge to consider in arriving
at their verdict matters which ought not to have been submitted to them.

In their Lordships' opinion substantial wrong would be done
to the accused if he were deprived of the verdict of a jury on the facts proved
by legal evidence, and there were substituted for it the verdict of the Court
founded merely upon a perusal of the evidence. It need scarcely be said that
there is ample scope for the operation of the proviso without applying it in
the manner contended for.

This passage is I think applicable to the case before
us.

What I have said as to s. 1014 (2) has been related
primarily to the grounds other than grounds numbers G and
7. As to ground 6 the passages which I have quoted from the reasons of Sloan
C.J. seem to me to show that the conviction must be set aside on this ground
even if the Court should be of the view that there was in fact neither
substantial; wrong nor miscarriage of justice because one

[Page 252]

of the main grounds of the decision of Sloan C.J. rests on :
the importance of justice being not merely done in fact but being plainly seen
to be done.

As to ground 7, I think that the error which occurred is such
that by its very nature it cannot be cured by the application of s. 1014 (2).

In the result, if leave to appeal had been granted on those
grounds advanced on the application for leave to appeal with which I have dealt
above, it would have been my opinion that the appeal should be allowed, the
conviction quashed and a new trial directed.

Fauteux J.:—For
the reasons given by my brother Kellock, my answer to the question referred to
the Court is that I would have dismissed the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Habitual criminals—Procedure—Impropriety of judge
hearing evidence as to previous record before commencing enquiry—The Criminal Code, 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, ss. 660, 662.

[Page 769]

The appellant was convicted
by a jury of theft. Notice had been served on him, pursuant to s. 662(1) of the
Criminal Code, that the prosecutor would ask to have him found to be an
habitual criminal. Immediately after the jury’s verdict the trial judge heard
representations as to sentence, and had before him a probation officer’s report setting out the
appellant’s previous history,
including numerous convictions. Before actually sentencing the appellant on the
theft charge, the trial judge held an enquiry in respect of the allegation that
the appellant was an habitual criminal, and at the end of that enquiry, having
found the allegation proved, he sentenced the appellant to preventive
detention, as well as to two years’
imprisonment on the conviction for theft. The accused appealed against the
finding that he was an habitual criminal, and the sentence of preventive
detention.

Held: The appeal should be
allowed and the sentence of preventive detention should be quashed.

The provision in s. 662(2)
that an application under Part XXI shall be heard and determined before
sentence is passed for the primary offence, requires that that hearing be
opened immediately after the accused is found guilty, which enables the trial
judge to enter upon the enquiry without previous knowledge of the accused’s past conduct. By
considering the probation officer’s
report before commencing the enquiry, and then relying upon it in finding that
the accused was an habitual criminal, although it was not proved on that
hearing, the trial judge had acted contrary to the provisions of the Code, and
the proceedings on the enquiry were a nullity. In the circumstances the appeal
could not be dismissed under s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Code.

APPEAL from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing an appeal
against a sentence of preventive detention. Appeal allowed.

E.P. Hartt, for the
appellant.

W.B. Common, Q.C., for the
Attorney-General for Ontario, respondent.










TASCHEREAU
J.:—The appellant was convicted
on June 7, 1955, at St. Thomas, Ontario, by His Honour Judge Grosch
and a jury, upon the following charge:—



That
Joseph Wilfred Parkes, at the Township of Bayham, in the County of Elgin, on or
about the 8th day of February in the year 1955, unlawfully did steal one
automobile the property of Basil Nevill, contrary to the Criminal Code of
Canada.



Previous
to that conviction, an application, with the consent of the Attorney-General,
had been made by the Crown prosecutor pursuant to s. 660 of the Criminal
Code, to have the accused declared a habitual criminal. This
section reads as follows:—



660.
(1) Where an accused is convicted of an indictable offence the court may, upon
application, impose a sentence of preventive detention in addition to
any sentence that is imposed for the offence of which he is convicted if

[Page 770]



(a)
the accused is found to be an habitual criminal, and



(b)
the court is of the opinion that because the accused is an habitual
criminal, it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to
preventive detention.



(2)
For the purposes of subsection (1), an accused is an habitual criminal if



(a)
he has previously, since attaining the age of eighteen years, on at least three
separate and independent occasions been convicted of an indictable offence for
which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more and is leading
persistently a criminal life, or



(b)
he has been previously sentenced to preventive detention.



Section 662
enacts certain provisions which apply to applications of this kind, and s-s.
(2) says:—



(2)
An application under this Part shall be heard and determined before sentence
is passed for the offence of which the accused is convicted and shall be
heard by the court without a jury.



(The
italics are mine.)










It is
clear from the record, that before hearing this application His Honour Judge
Grosch, instead of hearing it immediately as required by law (vide
Rex v. Triffitt[2]), considered a detailed
probation report on the accused, obviously for the purpose of determining the
sentence to be imposed on the theft charge. He then proceeded to hear the
application under s. 660, found the accused to be a habitual criminal as
defined by s-s. (2). He ordered him to be confined to a penitentiary for an
indeterminate period and sentenced him to two years on the charge of theft. The
Court of Appeal confirmed the order of preventive detention, and we are
concerned only with that particular appeal.



I am of
the opinion that the learned trial judge did not follow the proper procedure in
considering the probation report before hearing and determining the application
made under s. 660. I entertain no doubt that this report, covering a period of
twenty-five years, influenced him considerably in reaching the conclusion that
the appellant was a habitual criminal and was leading persistently a criminal
life. The latter suffered a prejudice such that I cannot see the possibility of
applying s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code. I am not
satisfied that the judgment on the application would have necessarily been the
same if the provisions of the law had been followed.

[Page 771]



I would
allow the appeal and quash the order for preventive detention.



RAND
J.:—This is an appeal from the
affirmance by the Court of Appeal for Ontario of a determination by a county
court judge that the appellant was an habitual criminal.



The Criminal
Code deals with this matter in s. 662, the relevant provisions of which are
as follows:



662.
(1) Notice of application. The following provisions apply with respect to
applications under this Part, namely,



(a)
an application under subsection (1) of section 660 shall not be heard
unless



(i)
the Attorney General of the province in which the accused is to be tried
consents, 



(ii)
seven clear days’ notice has been given to
the accused by the prosecutor specifying the previous convictions and the other
circumstances, if any, upon which it is intended to found the application, and 



(iii)
a copy of the notice has been filed with the clerk of the court or the
magistrate, as the case may be; and



(b)
an application under subsection (1) of section 661 shall not be
heard unless seven clear days’ notice thereof has been
given to the accused by the prosecutor and a copy of the notice has been filed
with the clerk of the court or with the magistrate, where the magistrate is
acting under Part XVI.



(2)
An application under this Part shall be heard and determined before sentence is
passed for the offence of which the accused is convicted and shall be heard by
the court without a jury.










Several
grounds were raised which were said to go to the invalidity of the conviction,
among them the following: that the trial judge had heard evidence of a police
record of the accused for the purposes of the sentence on the primary
conviction before entering upon the subsidiary charge; that the proof of the
prior convictions by way of certificate was defective because they had not been
signed by the authorized officer of the court of conviction and that the
description of the conviction was insufficient in omitting in each case the
name of the court and the sentence given; that in the notice to the accused
there was a similar failure to specify the court and the sentence imposed; that
the notice failed to set forth the particulars of conduct to be adduced to show
that the accused was “leading persistently a
criminal life”. The question also of the
powers of the Court of Appeal in such an appeal was raised, that is

[Page 772]



whether
the appeal given by s. 667 and the reference in s-s. (3) to the provisions of
Part XVIII “with respect to procedure
on appeals” enables the court to deal
with the appeal as fully as in the case of an appeal from a conviction for an
indictable offence.



I do
not find it necessary to examine more than the first ground.
Section 660(2) expressly requires that the application shall be heard and
determined before sentence is passed for the main offence. The reference to
sentence means before any step is taken toward the pronouncement of sentence
and it embraces what has come to be a practice of submitting to the court a
record or information showing the conduct, character, reputation, events, and
circumstances of the life of the accused. What is the consideration behind this
requirement of the subsection?



The
question has been raised in England in a number of cases. In Rex v. Turner[3] Channell J., delivering
the judgment of the court, at p. 363 says:—



The
facts which are to be proved on the charge of being a habitual criminal are the
same as those with reference to which the Court at a trial always desires
information before passing sentence, and it is therefore impossible that the
Legislature could have intended that sentence must be passed before those facts
are inquired into.



This
was followed in Rex v. Coney[4]. At p. 129 the Lord Chief
Justice said:—










Counsel
for the prosecution then called witnesses with reference to appellant’s previous convictions and
character, and counsel for the appellant addressed the Court, putting forward
reasons why he should not be sent to penal servitude. If that procedure is
followed, the jury, and other jurors waiting in Court, may hear all that is
relevant about a prisoner’s antecedents given to
enable the Court to decide whether a sentence of penal servitude should be
imposed. All kinds of statements adverse to the prisoner and relevant to his
punishment may be given in evidence in the presence of those who, on different and
more limited grounds, may afterwards be called upon to decide whether he is a
habitual criminal… It was never intended that
the persons who, upon the particular grounds set out in the statute, might have
to decide whether a prisoner was a habitual criminal, should have in their
minds all the material necessary to enable a Court to decide whether a sentence
of penal servitude should be imposed.

[Page 773]



In Rex
v. Triffitt[5], in which the conviction
and sentence on the main charge were made and pronounced by one court and the
subsequent application dealt with by another, Humphreys J., speaking of
the ground now being considered and referring to Rex v. Jennings[6], quotes the headnote of
that case with approval:—



An
indictment for being a habitual ‘criminal
under the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908, must be tried immediately after the
primary charge.



Finally,
in Rex v. Vale[7], a case somewhat similar
to Triffitt in which, however, only the plea of guilty had been received
by the first court, Branson J. at p. 356, dealing with language of Humphreys J.
in Triffitt, observes:—



“Follow immediately” means dealing with the
case without hearing the man’s previous history and
before sentencing him.



In the
proceeding before us the police record of the accused was handed to the judge
immediately after he had found the accused guilty of the principal offence, and
the latter was questioned on it as a preliminary to the sentence. This brought
into the mind of the judge the very information the subsection was aimed
to keep out. It goes to the substance of the proceeding and is fatal to the
subsequent determination.










On the
other questions I should add generally that there is no reason why a complete
description of each conviction with particulars should not be set forth both in
the notice given to the accused and in the certificate which likewise should be
signed by the appropriate officer of the court of conviction. The grounds of
conduct, evidence of which it is intended to adduce to show the criminal life
being persistently followed by the accused to the time of the notice, should be
furnished by at least general description such as persistence in petty
offences, association with disreputable characters and other characteristics of
criminal habit, sufficient to enable the accused reasonably to know what he is
to meet.



There
seems to be a tendency to treat a proceeding under the section as one in
which strict compliance with the express requirements of the Code is not to be
insisted on. That is altogether a mistake. Under such a determination.

[Page 774]



a
person can be detained in prison for the rest of his life with his liberty
dependent on the favourable discretion of a minister of the Crown. The
adjudication is a most serious step in the administration of the criminal law
in relation to which it is well to recall the words of the Lord Chief Justice
of England in Martin v. Mackonochie[8], quoted by Meredith
C.J.C.P. in Rex v. Roach[9]:—



It
seems to me, I must say, a, strange argument in a court of justice, to say that
when, as the law stands, formal proceedings are in strict law required, yet if
no substantial injustice has been done by dealing summarily with a defendant,
the proceeding should be upheld. In a court of law such an argument à
convenienti is surely inadmissible. In a criminal proceeding the question is
not alone whether substantial justice has been done, but whether justice has been
done according to law. All proceedings in pœnam are, it need scarcely be
observed, strictissimi juris; nor should it be forgotten that the formalities
of law, though here and there they may lead to the escape of an offender, are
intended on the whole to insure the safe administration of justice and the
protection of innocence, and must be observed. A party accused has the right to
insist upon them as a matter of right, of which he cannot be deprived against
his will; and the judge must see that they are followed. He cannot set himself
above the law which he has to administer, or make or mould it to suit the
exigencies of a particular occasion. Though a murderer should be taken
red-handed in the act, if there is a flaw in the indictment the criminal must have
the benefit of it. If the law is imperfect, it is for the legislature to amend.
The judge must administer it as he finds it. And the procedure by which an
offender is to be tried, though but ancillary to the application of the
substantive law and to the ends of justice, is as much part of the law as the
substantive law itself.










Mr. Common,
with his customary fairness, conceded the importance of some of these omissions
but took the position that, in view of all that had taken place before the
judge including admissions drawn out, some by the judge in questioning the
accused on his police record for the purpose of the first sentence, there could
not by any possibility be a miscarriage of justice, the ground on which the Court
of Appeal acted. For the reasons given, that submission cannot be accepted. In
such a case form is substance and if the loose practice followed in the present
proceedings were tolerated, the clear intention of Parliament to surround this
new and extreme power over the individual with specific safeguards would be
nullified.



I
would, therefore, allow the appeal and quash the conviction.

[Page 775]



LOCKE
J.:—The appellant was on June
7, 1955 found guilty of stealing an automobile, by a jury in the Court of
General Sessions at St. Thomas.



In
advance of this hearing the Crown had caused a written notice to be served on
the appellant, which appears to me to comply with the requirements of s. 662 of
the Criminal Code, informing him that, if he should be convicted of the
charge of theft referred to, an application would be made under s. 660(1) for a
sentence of preventive detention, in addition to any sentence that should be
imposed for the offence of which he was then convicted. 



The
grounds for the proposed application as stated in the notice were that, since
the age of eighteen years on at least three separate and independent occasions,
the appellant had been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was
liable to imprisonment for five years or more and that he was leading
persistently a criminal life.



Section 662(2)
of the Code requires that an application under Part XXI for preventive
detention shall be heard and determined before sentence is passed for the
offence of which the accused is convicted and shall be heard by the court
without a jury.



Upon
the jury returning its verdict, before proceeding with the Crown’s application a discussion
took place between the presiding judge and counsel for the Crown and for the
prisoner, which was relevant only to the consideration of the sentence to be
imposed for the theft, in the course of which a document entitled “Probation Office
Presentence Report”, signed by a probation
officer, was handed to the judge by the Crown prosecutor. This report,
apparently prepared under the provisions of s. 2 of The Probation Act, R.S.O.
1950, c. 291, contained an extensive review of the previous career of the
convicted person including information as to the criminal record of one of his
brothers, the fact that he had some 22 years earlier abandoned his wife and
four children, information as to his general habits and a detailed history of
his criminal record said to have been taken from reports of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police and covering a period from 1929 to 1954. In addition to
convictions for some comparatively minor offences, this report showed that
during the previous period








[Page 776]



of 25
years the appellant had been convicted and imprisoned for not less than 12
indictable offences for which he might have been imprisoned for periods of five
years or more. During the discussion that took place, counsel acting for the
appellant appears to have admitted three of the four convictions mentioned in
the notice served upon the appellant in advance of his trial.



After
the appellant’s long and unfavourable
criminal record had been discussed, the learned judge proceeded to hear the
Crown’s application under s.
660(1). Counsel for the prisoner was asked if he had admitted three of the four
convictions mentioned in the notice given to the prisoner and, referring to
what had taken place during the discussion regarding sentence on the theft
charge, counsel said that he had. Proof which appears to me to be in
satisfactory form was then given of the fourth of these convictions which had
been made at St. Thomas on July 15, 1952, on a charge of theft preferred
under s. 377 of the Code, for which a penalty of two years’ imprisonment had been
imposed. Other than the evidence afforded by these four convictions during the
past ten years, the only evidence given on behalf of the Crown in support of
the contention that the appellant was “leading
persistently a criminal life” within the meaning of s.
660(2) (a) was that of a police constable who had first seen the accused
when he was tried in 1952 on the offence above mentioned and who, when asked as
to his general reputation in the community in which he lived, said that it was
bad.



The
appellant gave evidence on his own behalf, saying that he had been trying to
straighten up but that whenever he got a job he lost it as soon as his criminal
record became known. He was asked as to whether he was convicted of forgery at
Whitby in 1929 but declined to admit the fact. He was not cross-examined as to
the other convictions which had been referred to in the probation officer’s report, other than in
regard to the offence of breaking and entering for which he had been given five
years’ suspended sentence in
January of 1955.



Part
X(A) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, dealing with habitual
criminals, was first enacted in 1947, by c. 55, s. 18. Sections 575A to
575D were taken almost verbatim from s. 10 of the Prevention of
Crime Act, 1908,

[Page 777]










8 Edw. VII
(Imp.), c. 59. If
the person sought to be declared an habitual criminal was first tried for an
indictable offence and found guilty by a jury, the issue as to whether or not
he was an habitual criminal was tried by a jury. When these
subsections were re-enacted in the new Code, this procedure was
changed. Section 662(2), in addition to requiring that the application
should be heard before sentence was passed for the offence of which the accused
had then been convicted, directed that it should be heard by the court without
a jury. There was no change in the requirement that upon the application,
unless the accused person had previously been sentenced to preventive
detention, it was necessary to show that since attaining the age of eighteen
years, on at least three separate and independent occasions he had been
convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for
five years or more and was leading persistently a criminal life.



As
pointed out by Channell J. in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal
Appeal in Rex v. Turner[10], dealing with the
requirement of s. 10(2) (a) of the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908, that
if it is to be found that he is “leading
persistently a dishonest or criminal life”:—



 
. . .the evidence against him must be brought down to date—that is the important thing
and that is necessary.



This
applies with equal force to the language of s. 660(2) (a).



In the
case of Brusch v. The Queen[11], decided under the
sections of the Code applicable at that time, it will be noted that
the Crown did not content itself with proving the three convictions but
asserted that the accused had been “leading
a persistently criminal life in that you have been an associate of criminals,
prostitutes, drug addicts and have had no regular employment or occupation”, and called evidence in
support of these statements. The sufficiency of the evidence in the present
matter to justify a finding that

[Page 778]



the
present appellant should be found to be an habitual criminal is, in my opinion,
a matter of grave doubt. I, however, do not consider that the present appeal
should be disposed of on that ground.










The
judgment delivered by the learned judge upon the application showed clearly
that, in arriving at his conclusion that the appellant was an habitual
criminal, he had considered the statements made in the probation officer’s report purporting to
cover a period of 25 years prior to the trial. None of this was evidence that
was properly before him. Evidence of this long previous criminal record was
doubtless admissible on the application but it was not given and, in basing his
decision at least partly upon it, the learned judge acted upon matters outside
the record.



In
these circumstances there is, in my opinion, no justification for applying the
provisions of s. 592(1) (b) (iii). As to this, I refer to what was
said by Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J., with whom Duff J. (as he then was)
agreed, in Allen v. The King[12]:—



It
was argued that the section of our Code, upon which the Chief Justice in
the Court of Appeal relied, specially provides that the appeal shall be
dismissed even where illegal evidence has been admitted, if there is otherwise
sufficient legal evidence of guilt. I cannot agree that the effect of the
section is to do more than, as I said before, give the judges on an appeal
a discretion which they may be trusted to exercise only where the illegal
evidence or other irregularities are so trivial that it may safely be assumed
that the jury was not influenced by it. If there is any doubt as to this the
prisoner must get the benefit of that doubt propter favorem vitae.



While
the trial referred to in Allen’s Case was before a jury, these remarks, in
my opinion, apply with equal force to a hearing such as this before a single
judge where the reasons delivered indicate that he relied, at least in part,
upon evidence which was not properly before him.



Following
the finding made, the learned judge sentenced the appellant to a term of
imprisonment on the charge of theft and, accordingly, nothing further can be
done under the application for preventive detention. I would quash the finding
that the appellant was an habitual criminal and the direction that he be held
in preventive detention.



The
judgment of Fauteux and Nolan JJ. was delivered by

[Page 779]










FAUTEUX
J.:—Whether or not an accused
is a habitual criminal and by reason of this fact should, for the protection of
the public, be sentenced to detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate
period, involves an important issue of fact which must be heard and determined
according to law. Under the imperative provisions of s. 662(2) of the Criminal
Code, the hearing and determination of this issue must take place before
sentence is passed for the offence of which the accused is convicted. The
reason for this order of precedence established in the procedure is to assure
the effective operation of all the safeguards which, both by the method of
inquiry and by the rules of evidence, attend the trial of any issue and, more
particularly, to exclude definitely any possibility that the judge entrusted
with the matter be, until it is finally determined, adversely influenced in any
degree by facts or representations of which, once an accused is convicted, he
may, without the same safeguards, be apprised for passing a sentence.



In the
present instance, the sentence for the offence of which the appellant was
convicted was actually pronounced after the hearing and determination of the
issue related to preventive detention. However, prior to such hearing, the judge,
for the purpose of determining what sentence he should impose, received from
the prosecution and exacted from the defence, in a most exhaustive manner,
information of a character highly damaging to the accused. In the result, when
the subsequent hearing of the issue related to preventive detention commenced,
his mind was no longer free, in the measure it should have been, had the
provisions of s. 662(2) been complied with, and the effective exercise of the
right which the appellant had, on the hearing of such issue, to remain silent
and hold the prosecution strictly to its obligation to prove its case according
to rules of procedure and rules of evidence, was thenceforward jeopardized.



Counsel
for the respondent admitted the violation of s. 662(2), attempting however, but
in my view unsuccessfully, to show that “no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has occurred”. The trial of the issue
conducted in violation of the imperative provisions was wholly invalid and such
defect is not one contemplated under the curative provisions of s. 592(1) (b)(iii).

[Page 780]



The
appeal should be allowed; the finding that the appellant was a habitual
criminal and the direction that he be held in preventive detention should be
quashed.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OP QUEEN'S BENCH (APPEAL SIDE) FOR
THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Common gaming houses—Slot machines—Machine
vending only amusement or ""services""—The Criminal Code, 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, ss. 168, 170, 176.

A machine that vends only ""services"" or amusement (the
terms are synonymous) is within the definition of ""slot machine"" in
s. 170(2) of the Criminal Code, if the result of one of any number of
operations is

[Page 799]

a matter of chance or uncertainty to the operator. The
difference in wording between s. 170 and s. 986(4) of the old Code has
changed the law as laid down in Laphkas v. The King, [1942] S.C.R. 84.
The finding of such a machine therefore gives rise, under s. 170(1), to a
conclusive presumption that the place where it is found is a common gaming
house, as defined in s. 168, and renders the keeper of the premises liable to
the penalties prescribed by s. 176.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench
(Appeal Side) for the Province of Quebec 1,
reversing an acquittal by a magistrate. Appeal dismissed.

Dollard Dansereau, Q.C., and Rosario
Richer, for the appellant.

André Tessier, for the
respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke, Fauteux,
Abbott and Nolan JJ. was delivered by

Taschereau J. :—M. le Juge municipal Pascal Lachapelle a rendu, le 27 juillet 1955,
un jugement acquittant l'appelant, d'avoir, le 26 mai 1955, tenu une maison de
jeu publique à Montréal, utilisée pour l'opération de ""Bingo Pin Ball
machines"". Dans son jugement, le juge au procès se base sur les raisons
qu'il a données dans une cause similaire de Roland Beausoleil, pour rejeter la
plainte. Ce dernier jugement a été produit au dossier. La Cour d'Appel 2 a renversé cette décision, et le
prévenu veut la faire rétablir.

Les arts. 170 et 176 du Code Criminel sont
ceux qui s'appliquent dans la présente cause. L'article 170 se lit ainsi:—

170. (1) Aux fins des procédures prévues par
la présente Partie, un local que l'on trouve muni d'un appareil à sous est de
façon concluante présumé une maison de jeu.

(2) Au présent article, l'expression
""appareil à sous"" signifie toute machine automatique ou appareil à
sous

a) employé ou destiné à être employé pour toute fin autre que la vente de
marchandises ou services; ou

b) utilisé ou destiné à être utilisé pour la vente de marchandises ou
services

(i) si le résultat
de l'une de n'importe quel nombre d'opérations de la machine est une affaire
de hasard ou d'incertitude pour l'opérateur;

[Page 800]

(ii) si, en
'Conséquence d'un nombre donné d'opérations successives par l'opérateur, l'appareil
produit des résultats différents; ou

(iii) si, lors
d'une opération quelconque de l'appareil, celui-ci émet ou laisse échapper des
piécettes ou jetons.

L'article 176 est dans les termes suivants:—

176. (1) Est coupable d'un acte criminel et
passible d'un emprisonnement de deux ans, quiconque tient une maison de jeu ou
une maison de pari.

(2) Est coupable d'une infraction punissable
sur déclaration sommaire de culpabilité, quiconque

a) est trouvé, sans excuse légitime, dans une maison de jeu ou
une maison de pari; ou

b) en qualité de possesseur, propriétaire, locateur, locataire,
occupant ou. agent, permet sciemment qu'un endroit soit loué ou utilisé pour
des fins de maison de jeu ou pari.

A l'art. 168 on y voit les définitions
suivantes:—

e) ""maison de désordre"" signifie une maison de débauche, une
maison de pari ou une maison de jeu;

f) ""jeu"" signifie un jeu de hasard ou un jeu où se mêlent
le hasard et l'adresse.

Dans cette cause de Beausoleil, identique à la
présente, M. le Juge Lachapelle a dit ce qui suit:—

Cette machine ne paye aucune monnaie, ne distribue
aucune marchandise ou jeton et ne procure au gagnant que le seul choix de jouer
l'appareil de nouveau avec un certain nombre de points enregistrés tel que déjà
décrits. Les possibilités de chance du joueur sont laissées au caprice et
hasard fixés d'avance par un mécanisme électronique compliqué, et l'habileté du
joueur n'y est pour rien.

Et plus loin dans son jugement, il s'exprime
de la façon suivante:—

La machine sous saisie est certes plus
dispendieuse à jouer que celle étudiée dans la cause de Adam 3, mais comme résultat elle ne
fait que procurer un divertissement et un amusement au joueur.

Dans la cause de Laphkas v. The King 4, la machine qui faisait l'objet
du litige a été déclarée légale parce qu'elle ne faisait que procurer un
amusement légitime au joueur en retour d'une modique somme d'argent. Dans cette
même cause, cette Cour a également décidé, qu'en vertu de l'ancien texte du Code
Criminel (art. 986(4)), lorsqu'une machine ne vendait que des ""services"",
elle n'était pas illégale et que le mot ""services"" avait
la même signification que le mot

[Page 801]

""amusements"". Le savant juge de
première instance a conclu que la machine en question dans la présente cause,
ne faisait que vendre des ""amusements"" et a, en conséquence,
déclaré l'opération de la machine légale.

Je ne puis m'accorder avec cette conclusion,
et je partage entièrement les vues de M. le Juge Hyde de la Cour du Banc de la
Reine qui, parlant au nom de tous ses collègues, en est arrivé à une conclusion
contraire. Il signale en effet, avec raison, que la loi a été amendée depuis le
jugement dans l'affaire Laphkas, et que la machine est illégale si elle
est utilisée pour la vente de marchandises ou services, si le résultat
de l'une de n'importe quel nombre d'opérations de la machine est une affaire
de hasard ou d'incertitude pour l'opérateur. (C. Cr., art. 170.)

On voit donc que lorsqu'une opération dépend
du hasard, et que même si le résultat ne fournit que des ""services""
ou ""amusements"", deux mots qui ont le même sens, l'appareil est
illégal, et la maison où il se trouve est présumée de façon concluante être une
maison de jeu. Il ne fait aucun doute que, dans le cas présent, le résultat des
opérations de cette machine est exclusivement du domaine du hasard, et fournit
un amusement au joueur, comme résultat de l'une de n'importe quel nombre
d'opérations. C'est à cette conclusion qu'en sont arrivés le juge au procès
et la Cour du Banc de la Reine. Ceci fait tomber ce genre d'appareil sous le
coup de la prohibition du statut.

Quant au point soulevé concernant l'absence
d'un acte formel d'accusation, pour les raisons données dans la cause de Beauvais
v. The Queen 5,
je ne le crois pas fondé. Il s'agit en effet d'une dénonciation où le magistrat
a juridiction absolue, et en conséquence, l'absence d'un acte formel
d'accusation ne vicie pas les procédures. (C. Cr., arts. 467 et 176.)

L'appel doit donc être rejeté avec, cependant,
une modification qui devra être faite au jugement de la Cour du Banc de la
Reine. Cette dernière Cour, comme elle avait le droit de le faire en vertu des
dispositions de l'art. 638 (C. Cr.), a suspendu la sentence, à condition
que le prévenu souscrive un engagement, sans caution, selon la formule 28 (C. Cr.).

[Page 802]

Cet engagement devra être souscrit pour la
durée d'une année à compter de la date du présent jugement, et non à compter de
la date du jugement de la Cour d'Appel.

Rand J. :—The machine in question here, subject to one added feature,
can be taken to be as described by the language of the magistrate quoted by the
Chief Justice of this Court in DeWare v. The Queen 6. The added feature is that by
inserting in the machine not a five-cent piece which will initiate an operation
but a sum reaching as high as $1 in coins a chance is created of having the
normal scores increased by a quantity related to the amount deposited but
dependent on a fortuitous relationship of results in the individual's
operations. No person is obliged to make the additional deposit, but the
machine is offered for that as well as for its ordinary use.

The issue is whether the device is within s. 170 of the Criminal
Code. Since the use is entertainment within the meaning given the word
""services"" in Laphkas v. The King 7 and as no slug or token is
discharged or emitted, the machine must, if at all, come within para. (b)(i)
or (ii) of subs. (2) which defines ""slot machine"" as follows:—

(2) In this section ""slot machine"" means any automatic
or slot machine …

(b) that is used or
intended to be used for the purpose of vending merchandise or services if

(i) the result of one of any
number of operations of the machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the
operator, [or]

(ii) as a result of any given
number of successive operations by the operator the machine produces different
results.

The Court of Queen's Bench interpreted the finding of the
magistrate to mean that the operations were essentially governed by chance,
that whatever the skill exercisable in the control of the plunger or the
flippers, there was not that degree which, although probably sufficient to
exclude the machine from the category of the automatic, is insufficient to
qualify the condition of chance in producing results. This interpretation was
challenged by counsel for the appellant who took the finding to be related to
the added feature

[Page 803]

only. But as the section includes ""intended"" as
well as actual use this does not help the appellant; and admittedly the bonus
operation is pure chance. This brings the case within para. (b)(i).

I think it should be said that not every degree of
influencing skill can be taken to eliminate or modify the contingent nature of
results and that the scope for skill should be of such character and degree as
to be capable of enabling an effectiveness to be maintained over the average of
the unskilled.

But the machine comes also within the language of cl. (ii).
The results are the scores and different results are different scores. The
contention faintly advanced was that ""different results"" are in
relation to their nature and not mere dimensions in the same nature; that, for
example, different results must exhibit, say, scores, prizes and goods as
against differences in scores and that the paragraph does not apply. But I see
nothing to support that contention. The scores are the objects aimed at and
accomplished and in ordinary parlance they are as fully capable of exhibiting
differences as other results provided by these or similar machines.

A further ground challenged the validity of the conviction
in the absence of an indictment, but on this I agree with my brother
Taschereau.

I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
QUEEN’S BENCH (APPEAL SIDE) FOR
THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal Law—Trials by magistrates for
indictable offences—Sufficiency of information
and complaint without formal indictment—The Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c.
51, ss. 467, 478.

Where an accused is brought
before a magistrate charged with an indictable offence that is within the
magistrate’s absolute jurisdiction to
try, there is no necessity for the preparation of an indictment. The magistrate’s jurisdiction is absolute
and does not depend upon the consent of the accused, under s. 467 of the Criminal
Code, where the accused is “charged in an information”, and s. 478, requiring the
preparation of an indictment in Form 4, applies only where the accused has
elected under s. 450, 468 or 475 to be tried by a judge without a jury. Ship
v. The King (1949), 95 C.C.C. 143 at 150, approved.

While it is true that
criminal prosecutions must be conducted in the name of the Crown, and not in
that of the informant, this requirement is sufficiently satisfied if the
information is headed “Au Nom de Sa Majesté la
Reine”.

[Page 796]

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Queen’s Bench (Appeal Side) for
the Province of Quebec, affirming, without written reasons, a conviction made
by a judge of the Municipal Court of Montreal. Appeal dismissed.

Antonio Lamer, for the
appellant.

André Tessier, for the
respondent.



The
judgment of the Court was delivered by



TASCHEREAU
J.:—L’appelante a été poursuivie en vertu
des dispositions de l’art. 182 du nouveau Code
Criminel qui stipule que toute personne qui tient une maison de débauche,
est coupable d’un acte criminel et
passible d’un emprisonnement de deux
ans.










Le 17
juin 1955, soit après l’entrée en vigueur du
nouveau Code Criminel, un juge municipal de la ville de Montréal a émis
un mandat de perquisition, à la demande du constable Louis Desjardins, l’autorisant à entrer et à
perquisitionner les lieux occupés par l’appelante. Tel que la loi l’autorise (C. Cr., art.
171), après s’être rendu compte que la
maison en question était véritablement une maison de débauche, le constable
procéda à l’arrestation de l’appelante. Le lendemain il
logea une plainte formelle, et la dénonciation fut dûment signée par lui et
assermentée devant M. le Juge Henri Monty de la Cour Municipale de Montréal.
Après enquête, l’appelante fut trouvée
coupable et condamnée à être détenue dans la prison commune du district de
Montréal durant une période de six mois. L’appel à la Cour du Banc de la Reine
fut rejeté.



L’appelante a obtenu la permission
d’appeler à cette Cour pour
le motif suivant:—



Les
tribunaux inférieurs ont-ils erré en décidant que la dénonciation de Louis
Desjardins, constable de la Cité de Montréal, était suffisante sans qu’il y ait un acte d’accusation formel, au nom
de Sa Majesté la Reine?



C’est la seule question que
nous avons à décider pour déterminer le présent litige.



Il est
certain qu’il n’y a pas eu d’acte formel d’accusation et que M. le
Juge Monty a entendu la cause sur la seule dénonciation du constable
Desjardins.

[Page 797]



L’appelante soutient qu’il fallait de toute
nécessité un acte d’accusation écrit en vertu
des dispositions de l’art. 491 du Code
Criminel, qui dit qu’un acte d’accusation est suffisant s’il est sur papier et rédigé
d’après la formule 3 ou 4
suivant le cas.



Les
formules 3 et 4 exigent évidemment que l’acte d’accusation soit au nom de Sa Majesté
la Reine. En outre, l’art. 478 édicte que lorsqu’un prévenu choisit, en
vertu des arts. 450, 468 ou 475, d’être
jugé par un juge sans jury, un acte d’accusation selon la formule 4 doit
être présenté par le procureur général ou son représentant.



En
premier lieu, on peut disposer de ce grief de l’appelante qui prétend que la
dénonciation a été faite au nom du constable lui-même, et non pas au nom de Sa
Majesté la Reine. La lecture de la dénonciation établit clairement le
contraire, car elle porte comme titre “Au
Nom de Sa Majesté la Reine”.



Cependant,
le juge municipal avait-il le droit d’entendre
ce procès sur cette dénonciation, sans qu’il y ait eu un acte d’accusation au nom de Sa
Majesté la Reine?










Il est
essentiel de ne pas oublier que, dans le cas qui nous occupe, la juridiction du
magistrat est absolue et ne dépend pas du consentement du prévenu. Lorsqu’en effet un inculpé est
traduit devant le tribunal comme conséquence d’une dénonciation d’avoir commis certaines
offenses, et entre autres d’avoir tenu une maison de
débauche, son consentement est immatériel (C. Cr., art. 467). L’article 478 ne couvre que
les cas prévus aux arts. 450, 468 et 475 où le consentement du prévenu est
requis pour donner juridiction au magistrat. Il est alors impératif qu’il y ait, en outre de l’information, un acte formel
d’accusation au nom de Sa
Majesté la Reine.



Tel n’est pas le cas qui se
présente, et quand la compétence du magistrat est absolue les tribunaux ont
décidé qu’il n’était pas nécessaire qu’il y ait un acte d’accusation formel, et je ne
vois pas de motif sérieux qui nous justifierait de changer cette jurisprudence
constante.

Ainsi,
dans Snow’s Criminal Code of Canada,
6e éd. 1955, p. 409, l’on
voit ce qui suit:—



An
information and complaint in a summary trial case is often used as the formal
charge or indictment and care should be taken to see that it properly describes
the offence mentioned in s. 467…

[Page 798]



Dans Ship
v. The King[1] M. le Juge Barclay de la Cour
du Banc du Roi de Québec, parlant pour toute la Cour, s’est exprimé de la façon suivante:—



Where
the Magistrate has absolute jurisdiction… “before calling on the person charged
for any statement which he wishes to make, shall state to such person the
substance of the charge against him”,
it has been held that it is not necessary under this provision that there be a
written charge…



La
cause actuelle est bien différente de celles qui nous ont été citées par l’appelante, Woo Tuck v.
Scalen[2]; Gaboury v. Gagné; Fortier
v. Gagné[3]; Lavoie v. La Reine[4]. Dans ces trois arrêts la
Cour d’Appel de Québec a justement
réaffirmé le principe que les poursuites criminelles doivent être prises au nom
de Sa Majesté. Elle a conclu dans les trois cas que les accusés devaient être
libérés parce que les dénonciations avaient été poursuivies par les plaignants
eux-mêmes, sans la participation du Souverain.



L’appel doit être rejeté.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Appeals to Supreme Court of
Canada—Questions of law alone—Admissibility of confession—Court of Appeal holding confession
inadmissible on mistaken ground of law—The
Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 598(1)(a).

Where a Court of Appeal
orders a new trial on the ground that a statement by the accused was wrongly admitted
at the trial, and there is dissent on this point, there is a right of appeal by
the Crown if the difference of opinion between the majority and the minority
was based, not on any question in respect of the evidence or the inferences to
be drawn from it, but on differing views of the law applicable to the
situation, and different interpretations of decided cases; the question of the
admissibility of the statement is in such circumstances one of law alone.

Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright
J. (dissenting) were of opinion that there was no dissent in the Court of
Appeal on any question of law.

Evidence—Confessions—Admissibility—Test of voluntary nature of
statement—Effect of decisions—Questioning by police
officers—Suggested “cross-examination”—Intimation that previous
statement not believed.

The decision in Boudreau
v. The King, [1949] S.C.R. 262, did not extend in any way the rule laid
down in Ibrahim v. The King, [1914] A.C. 599 at 609, as to the
admissibility of confessions in evidence at the trial. It is still the law that
a statement is admissible in evidence if it is shown to have been voluntary “in the sense that it has
not been obtained…either by fear of prejudice
or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority”, and the Crown need go no
further than this, even in a case where questions have been asked by the police
of a person in custody. In particular, the Crown is not required to show that
the statement was not otherwise influenced by the course of conduct adopted by
the police, or that it was “self-impelled” in any sense other than
that it was not induced by fear or hope.

The accused, having been
taken to the police station early in the morning, and there given an account of
his movements on the previous evening, was left there all day, not formally
under arrest. About 5 p.m. the police officers returned and told the accused
that they had been working all day on the case (one of murder) and that they
had discovered further facts indicating that what he had told them in the
morning was untrue. The accused thereupon “blurted out” a damaging statement, whereupon he
was stopped and given a formal warning in respect of a charge of murder, after
which he made a statement, obtained in the form of question and answer, that
was reduced to writing and signed by him.








[Page 959]

Held: There was nothing in the
circumstances to make either the oral statement or the written one that
followed it inadmissible in evidence, and the trial judge had rightly admitted
them both.

Criminal law—Trial judge’s charge to jury—Whether defence adequately
put to jury—Murder.

The accused was charged
with the murder of a young girl by choking her, the theory of the Crown being
that the killing took place during the commission of a rape. The principal
ground of defence, based on a statement made by the accused to the police, was that
sexual intercourse had taken place with the full consent of the girl, and that
the act that resulted in her death had taken place some time later, and was in
no way connected with the act of intercourse.

Held: This defence had been
adequately put to the jury by the trial judge, and there was no ground for
interfering with the conviction.

APPEAL by the
Attorney-General for Ontario from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario[1] ordering a new trial on an
indictment for murder. Appeal allowed and conviction restored.

W.B. Common, Q.C., and W.C.
Bowman, Q.C., for the appellant.

D.G. Humphrey, and J.G.J. O’Driscoll, for the accused,
respondent.



THE
CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):—The
respondent’s conviction of murder was
set aside by the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 and the
Attorney-General for that Province now appeals based on the dissent of Roach
J.A. on two points, as to one of which Aylesworth J.A. agreed with him. The
majority ordered a new trial on both grounds. As to the question of the
admissibility of the oral and written statements of the accused, my view is
that the dissent was on a question of fact and therefore we are without
jurisdiction. According to my interpretation of the reasons in the Court of
Appeal there is no difference as to the law, but merely as to its application
to the circumstances. The evidence on the voir dire was uncontradicted
and, in my opinion, the reasons of the majority and minority in the Court of
Appeal are based on conflicting views as to the proper inferences to be drawn
from that evidence. Such inferences are questions of fact.



However,
the majority of the members of this Court read the reasons delivered in the
Court of Appeal differently and are of opinion that this Court has
jurisdiction. Since

[Page 960]










that is
to be the judgment of the Court, I conceive that I should do what I would not
otherwise do—express my opinion upon
both points. I am unable to discern any error in the trial judge’s charge and particularly
that he had not presented all aspects of the accused’s defence to the jury. As to the other
point, in view of the decision of this Court in Boudreau v. The King[2] I deem it unnecessary to
restate the law as there enunciated, and applying that rule I agree with Roach
J.A. that the trial judge correctly interpreted and applied it.



As the
majority of the Court are of opinion that there is jurisdiction, the appeal is
accordingly allowed and the conviction restored.



TASCHEREAU
J.:—The respondent was
convicted by the Honourable Mr. Justice Treleaven and a jury at the
Toronto assizes on April 27, 1956, on the following indictment:—



The
jurors for our Lady the Queen present that Robert George Fitton on or about the
18th day of January in the year 1956, at the city of Toronto in the county of
York, murdered one Linda Lampkin, contrary to the Criminal Code.



The
respondent was found guilty and sentenced to be executed, but the Court of
Appeal, Mr. Justice Roach dissenting, allowed the appeal and directed a
new trial[3]. The majority of the Court
reached the conclusion that there had been misdirection of the jury by the
learned trial judge in matters of law under ss. 201 and 202 of the Criminal
Code, and that the theory of the defence was not adequately explained to
the jury.



The
Chief Justice of Ontario, Laidlaw J.A. and Schroeder J.A. held that the oral
admission and the signed statement of the respondent were improperly admitted
at the trial, and allowed the appeal and also directed a new trial on this
ground. Mr. Justice Aylesworth (dissenting on this ground) as well as
Mr. Justice Roach, held that the learned trial judge did not err in law in
holding that the oral admission and the signed statement of the accused were
admissible in evidence at the trial, and would have dismissed the appeal on
this point.

[Page 961]



Her
Majesty the Queen now appeals to this Court pursuant to the provisions of s.
598 (1) (a) of the Criminal Code, which reads as follows:—










598.
(1) Where a judgment of a court of appeal sets aside a conviction, pursuant to
an appeal taken under paragraph (a) of section 583 or dismisses an
appeal taken pursuant to paragraph (a) of section 584, the Attorney
General may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada



(a)
on any question of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents.



The
evidence might be summarized as follows:—



At
approximately 9 p.m. on January 18, 1956, the respondent, who is an employee of
a cartage agency under contract with the Post Office Department, took the
deceased Linda Lampkin for a ride in his mail truck, and two hours later left
her dead body on Commissioners Street in south central Toronto. When the body
was discovered, the underclothing was ripped and torn, and it is in evidence
that this young girl of 13 years old, had been the subject of sexual
intercourse. Around her neck was a deep groove in the flesh tissue, which
corresponded in size to the width of a scarf which she was wearing. The
evidence reveals that she died of asphyxia due to strangulation.



After
having discovered the body, the Toronto police force, as a result of their investigation,
took the respondent Fitton into custody the next morning. During the day,
Fitton made oral admissions and signed a statement, and it is the admission of
this statement, which has been allowed by the trial judge, which is the first
point in issue in the present appeal.



I must
admit that I am at a loss to understand the contradictory position taken by the
respondent on this matter. This written statement was admitted without
objection, and constitutes the only defence raised by the respondent. It is now
said that it has been illegally admitted as not having been made freely and
voluntarily. With this last contention I cannot agree, and I fully share the
views of my brother Fauteux who holds that it was admissible and that this case
must be governed by the rules laid down by this Court in Boudreau v. The
King[4].

[Page 962]



I am
also of the opinion, for the reasons given by my brother Fauteux, that the
rejection or admissibility of this statement is not merely a question of fact,
but raises a question of law, conferring jurisdiction on this Court, in view of
the dissenting opinions in the Court below.










I
further endorse what has been said by Mr. Justice Roach in his dissenting
judgment as to the exposition of the theory of the defence by the trial judge,
and as to the use that could be made of the expert evidence of Dr. McLean and
as to the obligation of the jury to reject any of his opinions which he was not
qualified as an expert to give.



I would
allow the appeal and restore the conviction.



The
judgment of Rand and Kellock JJ. was delivered by



RAND
J.:—The rule on the admission
of confessions, which, following the English authorities, was restated in Boudreau
v. The King[5], at times presents
difficulty of application because its terms tend to conceal underlying
considerations material to a determination. The cases of torture, actual or
threatened, or of unabashed promises are clear; perplexity arises when much
more subtle elements must be evaluated. The strength of mind and will of the
accused, the influence of custody or its surroundings, the effect of questions
or of conversation, all call for delicacy in appreciation of the part they have
played behind the admission, and to enable a Court to decide whether what was
said was freely and voluntarily said, that is, was free from the influence of
hope or fear aroused by them.



The
inference one way or the other, taking all the circumstances into account, is
one for drawing which the trial judge is in a position of special advantage;
and unless it is made evident or probable that he has not weighed the
circumstances in the light of the rule or has misconceived them or the rule,
his conclusion should not be disturbed.



The
Chief Justice of Ontario, speaking for the majority of the Court of Appeal, has
treated the expression “freely and voluntarily”, used in Boudreau v.
The King, as if it connoted only a spontaneous statement, one unrelated to
anything as cause or occasion in the conduct of the police officers; but with
the greatest respect that is an erroneous

[Page 963]










interpretation
of what was there said. The language quoted must be read primarily in the light
of the matters that were being considered. As the opening words show, there was
no intention of departing from the rule as laid down in the authorities
mentioned; the phrase “free in volition from the
compulsions or inducements of authority”[6] means free from the
compulsion of apprehension of prejudice and the inducement of hope for
advantage, if an admission is or is not made. That fear or hope could be instigated,
induced or coerced, all these terms referring to the element in the mind of the
confesser which actuated or drew out the admission. It might be called the
induced motive of the statement, i.e., to avoid prejudice or reap
benefit. As Professor Wigmore intimates, the terms promise or threat may be
reduced to the word “inducement”, but that again may raise
a question of meaning; and the justification of the illustrative use of other
words is that together they indicate the general conception of influence of a
certain kind producing the admission. Even the word “voluntary” is open to question; in what case can
it be said that the statement is not voluntary in the sense that it is the
expression of a choice, that it is willed to be made? But it is the character
of the influence of idea or feeling behind that act of willing and its source
which the rule seizes upon. Nothing said in Boudreau v. The King was
intended to introduce a new quality of that influence.



But it
was with an enlarged view of what that case decided that the Chief Justice held
the questions, express or implied, of the police officers, taken to be of the
nature of cross‑examination, that is, as I understand it, that they
suggested several items of his earlier statement to be false, and put without a
warning, ipso facto, as having “instigated” it, ruled out the
statement. In this I think he has, and in a matter of law, erred. The accused
was not at the time under formal arrest although he had been requested to stay
in the police station and, for the greater part of the time, remained in the
general office, and the earlier questions were such as the police might have
addressed to any person in the remotest way drawn into the enquiry. Ques-

[Page 964]



tions
without intimidating or suggestive overtones are inescapable from police
enquiry; and put as they were here, they cannot by themselves be taken to
invalidate the response given. The question still remains: was the statement
made through fear or hope induced by authority?



The
rules adopted in England relating to this matter express, no doubt, the wisdom
of long experience; but they in fact contemplate questioning after the arrest
has been decided on and a warning given; and there is discretion in the trial
judge to admit a statement notwithstanding their non-observance. In this
country they have no other force than what their innate good sense may suggest
in individual determinations, as considerations to be kept in mind in weighing
the total circumstances.










On the voir
dire no attempt was made by counsel to show by cross-examination either
coercion or inducement, and it was frankly conceded that the admission of the
evidence, if not facilitated, was not seriously challenged for the reason that
the statement contained the only evidence upon which the defence intended to
rely. Not only, then, was the testimony of the officers accepted by the trial
judge and unopposed on behalf of the accused, but its admission was looked on
as for the benefit of the defence. In that situation I should say that there is
nothing to warrant a finding that the statement was not shown to have been
voluntary; and the ruling in appeal, on this view, also, is on a question of
law.



I am,
therefore, in agreement with Roach J.A. and Aylesworth J.A. that the admission
of the statement by the trial judge should not have been disturbed.



The
second ground of dissent was from the holding of the Court that the charge was
inadequate in presenting the case for the defence. That defence was extremely
simple and it was contained in two or three sentences of the statement. It was
to the effect that after the sexual intercourse had taken place and after the
accused had proceeded on his route to another mail-box,



she
started kibitzing around again and I just went out of my head. I grabbed her by
the scarf and she just went limp. She didn’t breathe no more, then I continued
with the rest of my mail run.

[Page 965]



The act
causing death was thus represented to have been completely divorced from the
sexual act. The trial judge, after making it clear that the jury could believe
any part of the evidence and disbelieve any other part, applied this rule to the
statement. He contrasted this direct evidence with the circumstantial facts
which could be held to show that death from strangulation had been immediately
connected with the act of intercourse; and his final reference to the statement
was in these words:



Now
gentlemen, as I see it, if I may put this very briefly to you, I would think
that you would take that statement of the accused, consider it very carefully,
and if you conclude that it is the truth or if you really have an honest doubt
as to whether it is the truth or not, he is entitled to the benefit of that
doubt and you would not find him guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.










Counsel
urged before us that this paragraph in some way deals with strangulation accompanying
ravishment but I cannot so construe it. It is, strictly, more favourable to the
accused than was justified: in effect it says, if you think the circumstances
of tightening the scarf were as he puts them, you are to find manslaughter.
This rules out intent in the act within s. 201(a) (ii) or (c) of
the Criminal Code.



I think
we must credit the jury with ordinary intelligence. The defence had been
elaborated to them by counsel, it was set forth on the statement which they had
in the jury-room and they were told how to deal with it. There was no
complication in the facts or their interpretation or in the distinction between
the two views of the facts put to them, and I have not the slightest doubt that
they came to their verdict with an intelligent appreciation of both.



I
would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the conviction.



The
judgment of Locke and Nolan JJ. was delivered by



NOLAN
J.:—The respondent was
convicted of murder at a trial before a judge sitting with a jury. On appeal to
the Court of Appeal for Ontario the appeal, by a majority judgment, was
allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial ordered[7]. This is an appeal by the
Attorney‑General for Ontario pursuant to the provisions of s. 598 (1) (a)
of the Criminal Code.

[Page 966]



At
about 7.45 p.m. on January 18, 1956, the deceased, Linda Lampkin, left a
dancing-school at 40 Wellesley Street East in the city of Toronto and at
approximately 8.30 p.m. she boarded a Jane Street bus at Jane and Bloor Streets
and shortly afterwards left it at Jane and Annette Streets. At approximately
8.45 p.m. a young girl was seen talking to the driver of a Royal Mail truck at
Jane Street and St. John’s Road.



The
respondent was employed by the Bacon Cartage Company Limited as a Royal Mail
truck-driver and his route on the day in question covered the area in which the
deceased was last seen alive. The respondent turned in his truck at the Bacon
Cartage garage at 104 Berkeley Street at 10.57 p.m., although his usual time
was between 9.30 and 10 p.m.










At
approximately 11.05 p.m. on January 18, 1956, the body of the deceased was
found on Commissioners Street in the city of Toronto. Her wool skirt and
underslip were pulled up around her waist. The three pairs of underpants she
was wearing were torn, exposing her thighs and genitalia, and her brassiere was
torn, exposing her breasts. One shoe was missing. A red truck, similar to the
one driven by the respondent, was seen, during the evening of January 18,
parked on Commissioners Street in the vicinity of the place where the body was
found.



A post-mortem
examination disclosed that the deceased had been a virgin and that death
had been caused by asphyxia due to strangulation resulting from the application
of extreme force to a silk scarf which was knotted around her neck. There was a
mark almost encircling the neck which showed a complete ring of bruising, with
the exception of a gap under the right ear where the bruising was reduced. It
was the opinion of the pathologist that such force would have to be applied for
several minutes to cause death. The deceased had been the subject of a
completed act of sexual intercourse. There was a tear in her hymen and in her
vagina which, in the opinion of the pathologist, would have caused great pain.
Her face was dark with acute congestion of blood and there were tiny

[Page 967]



haemorrhages
in the skin of the face, the forehead, the ears and the mucous membrane of the
eyes. Bloodstained froth had issued from the nose and mouth.



On the
morning of January 19, 1956, two officers of the Toronto police force went to
the Globe and Mail garage, at which time the respondent was putting mail-bags into
a truck. The truck was searched and a paper bag containing two apples, a bobby
pin and a tube of lipstick were found inside. This lipstick was, in evidence,
identified and admitted by counsel for the respondent to have been the property
of the deceased. The respondent was observed to be collapsing or fainting.










The
respondent was taken by Detective Sergeant O’Driscoll and Detective Coghill to
police headquarters, where he was interrogated by Detective-Sergeant O’Driscoll, and a T-shirt, a
pair of trousers and a windbreaker were taken from the person of the
respondent. An examination of the clothing disclosed that there was human blood
on the trousers and the leather jacket. The detective‑sergeant told the
respondent that he was “investigating the rape and
murder of a girl by the name of Linda Lampkin” and that she lived on Brookside
Avenue. This was the first time her name had been mentioned. The respondent
said that he knew the deceased and that the last time he saw her was about 5.15
in the afternoon of January 17. He denied that he had seen her on January 18.
He gave an account of his movements on January 18 until he stopped work at
night. The discussion, which contained no reference to Linda Lampkin, lasted
until approximately 9 a.m. and no caution was given. The discussion was not
taken down in writing. O’Driscoll and Coghill left
to be present in court at 10 a.m. and the respondent was left in the custody of
Detective Smith, who told the respondent that he wanted to get on paper a
record of his movements on January 18. Detective Smith had typed about one
paragraph when he was relieved by Detective Sergeant Simmonds, who typed the
statement as it was related to him by the respondent. When it was finished the
respondent read it, made certain changes and signed it. No objection as to its
admissibility was made at trial and it was admitted in evidence.

[Page 968]



In his
statement the respondent said that about the end of June he had met the
deceased when he was collecting mail on his route and about a week later had
taken her, at her request, for a drive around part of his route; that he had
seen her three times since then, but only to say “hello”. The statement relates his movements
during January 18 and concludes by stating that he did not know anything about
a lipstick or how it got in the truck.



Detective
Sergeant Simmonds then asked the respondent for a list of the box clearances on
his route, which was given and typed on a sheet of paper, which was admitted at
trial. He had a sandwich and milk brought in for the respondent for lunch.



At
approximately 5 p.m. Detective Sergeant Simmonds and Detective McNeely again
interviewed the respondent, who had been kept in the main detective office
since the morning interview. What took place at this afternoon interview is
described in the evidence of Detective Sergeant Simmonds:—



We
took our coats and hats off and hung them up and Detective McNeely and I went
up to the accused and I told him, I said, “I want to have another word with you.
Would you come over to the office with us?” He stood up and followed us out. We
went over to the small room off the main detective office and into the office
there.



I
told the accused to sit down and he sat down at a desk, at a chair opposite a
desk, and I said to him, I said, “You
know who I am. I was talking to you this morning” or words to that effect. I said, “This is Detective McNeely,
my partner.” I then sat down at the
desk opposite him and Detective McNeely sat to my right.



I
said to the accused man, “Bob, you have been sitting
in the office here this afternoon and I haven’t seen you since I left you around
noon when you told me where you were last night and your movements last night.” I said, “You have had all afternoon
to think over where you were last night.”










He
said, “What I told you this
morning was true.” I said, “Well, it no doubt was true
as far as your work with the post office was concerned but,” I said, “we have been out going over
the area in the west end of the city where you worked and we have been working
pretty hard this afternoon,” and I said, “I have received information
to the effect that you were seen last night with Linda Lampkin at St. John’s Road and Jane about 8.45
p.m.”



He
was sitting in the chair, which has arms on it, and he had his elbows on the
arms and his hands crossed in front of him and he was looking at me and at this
moment he looked down to the floor, he put his head down. I was just about to
say something else to him when McNeely spoke up, and McNeely said to him, “Yes, Bob, we have been
working since 5 o’clock this morning. It may
be necessary for us to take you out

[Page 969]



with
us in the police car and have you show us just how you do your work in the west
end in the area that you work in. There may be other witnesses out there—we don’t know—who may have seen things.
We don’t know. But the lipstick
that was found in your truck this morning has been identified.” He then said, “And along with this
information that we obtained this afternoon, it indicates that you may have
been seen with Linda Lampkin last night. We don’t believe what you have been telling
us.”



At
this point the accused who was still looking at the floor paused and—or he just seemed to just
sit there, he didn’t say anything, and at this
point he said, “I was just thinking of my
wife and my kids. I didn’t mean to do it. She
started kibitzing around and I grabbed her by the scarf and she didn’t breathe no more.”



At
this moment I said, “Just a minute, Bob,” and I pulled the drawer
open in the desk and there was a pad of what we call caution sheets in the
drawer and I put them on the table. I wrote some detail on the top of this
caution sheet which has a printed form at the top, including the fact that I
was at headquarters and the date and my name, the name of the accused and his
age, and the charge. And I read from the sheet to the accused man.



The
learned trial judge ruled that the inculpatory oral statement made in the
course of this interview,



I
was just thinking of my wife and kids. I didn’t mean to do it. She started kibitzing
around and I grabbed her by the scarf and she didn’t breathe no more.



was
voluntary and admissible in evidence.



As soon
as the respondent had made this statement he was immediately stopped, charged
with the murder of the deceased and cautioned.



The
written statement was obtained by question and answer and was written down in
longhand by Simmonds. When it was completed the respondent was asked to read it
aloud, including the caution, which he did, and then he signed it.



In the
written statement the respondent said that he had seen the deceased on the
evening of January 18; that she had come over to his truck and asked if she
could go for a ride, he had said she could and she had gotten into the truck.










The
statement further says:



I
parked up on Gooch Ave. to empty my small mail bag and tie up my big one and
she started necking and then I had intercourse with her and then I went on a
ways and did my other box and she started kibitzing around again and I just
went out of my head, I grabbed her by the scarf and she just went limp. She
didn’t breathe no more, then I
continued with the rest of my mail run and dropped my mail off and drove down
to

[Page 970]



Cherry
St. and took in my CODs I had left. She still wasn’t breathing so the best thing I
thought was to get rid of her. I drove to Commissioner St., I don’t know Commissioner
St. very well, I took her out of the truck and put her on the ground
there. Then I took the truck back to Berkeley St. and went home.



At
about 8.10 p.m. Detectives Simmonds, McNeely and Sellar drove the respondent
out to the west end of the city to try to find the missing shoe. It was found
underneath a truck on a vacant lot in the downtown area on Berkeley Street. A
broken compact was found in the shoe. The girl’s wallet was found by the police stuck
in a sewer-grating on a street in the vicinity of a garage where the mail
trucks were stored.



The
learned trial judge held that the last-mentioned written statement was
voluntary and it was admitted in evidence.



The
majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario (Pickup C.J.O. and Laidlaw
and Schroeder JJ.A.), reversing the learned trial judge, held that[8]:



…the Crown has failed to
show that the oral statement made by the appellant, or the written statement
made by him immediately afterwards, was free and voluntary. Therefore the
learned judge, in my opinion, should not have admitted either of those
statements in evidence. The erroneous admission in evidence of these
incriminating statements is in itself sufficient to warrant this Court
directing a new trial.



It is contended
by counsel for the respondent that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain
the appeal on the question of the admissibility of the second statement, as it
is not a strict question of law, but rather a question of fact, or at least a
question of mixed law and fact. Section 598 (1) of the Criminal Code, under
which the appeal on this ground is taken, reads as follows:



598.
(1) Where a judgment of a court of appeal sets aside a conviction pursuant to
an appeal taken under paragraph (a) of section 583 or dismisses an
appeal taken pursuant to paragraph (a) of section 584, the Attorney
General may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada










(a)
on any question of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents, or



(b)
on any question of law, if leave to appeal is granted by a judge of the Supreme
Court of Canada within twenty-one days after the judgment appealed from is
pronounced or within such extended time as the judge may, for special reasons,
allow.

[Page 971]



If the
decision as to the admissibility of the oral and second written statements
turned upon the inferences to be drawn from the evidence, it would seem clear,
from the decisions of this Court, that that was not a question of law alone and
consequently this Court would be without jurisdiction.



In a
case in which a statement is received in evidence over the objection of counsel
for the accused and the point is raised that the statement is not free and
voluntary, having been obtained by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage held
out by a person in authority, the Court must weigh the evidence and determine
the credibility of the witnesses. The correctness of such a decision could not,
I think, be raised before this Court on an appeal on a question of law alone.



In the
present case entirely different considerations arise. The statements were
admitted in evidence without objection. Indeed, it may be said that the second
statement contained the defence of the respondent to the charge. No conflict
arose as to the manner in which the statements were obtained, no suggestion was
made that they had been improperly instigated or induced, and that they were
free and voluntary appears to have been unchallenged.



In
other words, the voluntary nature of the statements was not in dispute at
trial. There was no evidence of any previous threat or promise and nothing in
law to warrant their exclusion. To hold them to be inadmissible would, in my
view, be contrary to established legal principles and would raise a question of
law alone.



Assuming
that this Court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal as to the admissibility of
the oral and second written statements of the accused, it remains to be
determined, as a question of law alone on which there has been dissent, whether
they were properly admissible in evidence.



It was
contended by the respondent in this Court that the statements obtained by the
police officers were not freely and voluntarily made, but were obtained as a
result of cross‑examination calculated to induce admissions.










On the
other hand the Crown contended that, even though there was cross-examination
(which was not conceded), failure to give a warning, or other violation of the

[Page 972]



usual
rules relating to the proper securing of statements, such violation or failure
does not, of itself, necessarily render such statements inadmissible.



In Regina
v. Gavin et al.[9], it was held (per Smith
J.) that when a prisoner is in custody the police have no right to ask him
questions. This decision was overruled by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex
v. Best[10], which was a case in
which, while the prisoner was in custody and had been cautioned, he was
searched and a sum of money was found in his possession. The constable
thereupon asked the prisoner where the money came from. Lord Alverstone C.J. at
p. 693 said:



There
is no ground for interfering in this case. It is quite impossible to say that
the fact that a question of this kind has been asked invalidates the trial.
There are many cases in which the prisoner is entitled to give an explanation
as to anything found on him, and the question might give him an opportunity of
saying and shewing that the thing found was his own property. In our opinion Reg.
v. Gavin is not a good decision, and it is commented on in a note
printed at the end of the report. The decision has certainly not been followed
to its full extent. As set out in the report the statement of the law is too
wide and requires qualification.



In Rex
v. Voisin[11], the Court of Criminal Appeal
considered the effect of the decision in Rex v. Best, supra, and at p.
539 A.T. Lawrence J. said:—



We
read that case as deciding that the mere fact that a statement is made in
answer to a question put by a police constable is not in itself sufficient to
make the statement inadmissible in law. It may be, and often is, a ground for
the judge in his discretion excluding the evidence; but he should do so only if
he thinks that the statement was not a voluntary one in the sense above
mentioned, or was an unguarded answer made in circumstances that rendered it
unreliable, or unfair for some reason to be allowed in evidence against the
prisoner.



In the
present case there was no evidence of inducement or coercion, no evidence of
threat or promise of reward.










In my
view it would be quite impossible to discover the facts of a crime without
asking questions of persons from whom it was thought that useful information
might be obtained. Indeed, such questions might give the suspected person an
opportunity of demonstrating that the suspicion of guilt attaching to him was
without foundation. The questioning must not, of course, be for the purpose of

[Page 973]



trapping
the suspected person into making admissions and every case must be decided
according to the whole of the circumstances.



The
question of the admissibility of a statement made by an accused person was
fully discussed in the judgment of this Court in Boudreau v. The King[12]. In that case the
appellant Boudreau was convicted of murder and the point of dissent on which he
came before this Court was the improper reception of two written statements,
the first containing an admission of intimacy with the wife of the murdered man
and the second, in addition to a repetition and an elaboration of the first
admission, a full confession of the deed itself. At the time of making them the
appellant was held under a coroner’s
warrant as a material witness. There was no more than a suspicion against him
when, in the first conversation with police officers in which questions were
asked him, he purported to detail his movements on the two or three days before
the death and admitted the intimacy. Boudreau having consented to make the
statement in writing, a justice of the peace was summoned and the statement was
made out, signed and sworn to by him. Before the signing the justice read out
the words of the usual warning, which were printed across the top of the paper.
Two days later, after a formal warning, a further discussion took place with
two police officers and, while one of them was momentarily out of the room and
after a reference had been made to his mother, Boudreau suddently burst out
with the words: “J’aime autant vous le dire, c’est moi qui l’a tué.” The second statement was
put in writing, with the consent of the appellant, and was signed and sworn to
by him. The trial judge ruled that these statements were admissible in evidence
and the majority of the Court of King’s
Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec, agreed with him.



In this
Court, Kerwin J. (as he then was), at p. 267, states that the fundamental
question is whether a confession of an accused offered in evidence is voluntary
and goes on to point out that the mere fact that a warning was given is not
necessarily decisive in favour of admissibility, but, on the other hand, the
absence of a warning should not bind

[Page 974]










the hands of the Court so as to compel
it to rule out a statement. Accordingly, the presence or absence of a warning
is a factor and, in many cases, an important one.



Rand
J., at p. 269, points out that no doubt arrest and the presence of officers
tend to arouse apprehension which a warning may or may not suffice to remove.
The rule is directed against the danger of improperly instigated, or induced,
or coerced admissions and the statement should be that of a man “free in volition from the
compulsions or inducements of authority”.



Kellock
J., at p. 276, states that in all cases the question is whether the Crown has
satisfied the onus that the statement has, in fact, been made voluntarily and
that in none of the cases is it laid down that a statement made by a person in
custody, in answer to questions put by a person in authority, is, as a matter
of law, inadmissible.



In Boudreau
v. The King the Court followed the governing principle as stated by
Viscount Sumner in Ibrahim v. The King[13]:



It
has long been established as a positive rule of English criminal law, that no
statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it is
shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement, in the sense that
it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of
advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority.



The
principle laid down in Ibrahim v. The King was followed by this Court in
Prosko v. The King[14], where, at p. 237, Anglin
J. pointed out that the two American detectives who had the custody of the
appellant were persons in authority and that the appellant was in the same
plight as if in custody in extradition proceedings under a warrant charging him
with murder and that no warning had been given, and that while these facts did
not, in themselves, suffice to exclude the admissions, they were undoubtedly
circumstances which required that the evidence tendered to establish their
voluntary character should be closely scrutinized.



Applying
the principles contained in the authorities to the facts of the present case, I
am of the opinion that the statements were properly admissible in evidence.

[Page 975]










It was
contended by the respondent that there was misdirection and non-direction
amounting to misdirection on the part of the learned trial judge in that he had
failed to lay the theory of the defence adequately before the jury and failed
to direct the jury as to how the law in relation to murder should be applied to
the facts that they might find.



The
majority of the members of the Court of Appeal, that is Pickup C.J.O. and
Laidlaw, Aylesworth and Schroeder JJ.A., upheld this contention. The appeal was
allowed and a new trial was directed.



Roach
J.A., dissenting, held that there was no misdirection or non-direction
amounting to misdirection by the learned trial judge in such matters of law and
that there was no failure to lay the theory of the defence adequately before
the jury and no failure to direct the jury as to how the law in relation to
murder should be applied to the facts, and would have dismissed the appeal.



The
main theory of the defence is that the respondent had sexual intercourse with
the deceased with her consent and, although the act of sexual intercourse was
completed, the deceased was not sexually satisfied and wanted it repeated; that
she then commenced to annoy the respondent and that, without intending to do
her any harm, he grabbed her scarf and “she just went limp”. This theory is based upon
the evidence that there was haemorrhaging from injury to her private parts and
consequently the deceased was not dead when the act of sexual intercourse took
place. Put shortly, the intercourse and strangling were independent acts.



The
Crown contended that the deceased had been raped and strangled and that the act
of strangulation was done in furtherance of the act of rape.



In my
view, the real problem which presented itself to the jury was the difficulty in
reconciling the written statement of the respondent with the other evidence in
the case. In other words, did the respondent cause the death of the deceased
under the circumstances as set out in his statement, or did her death ensue as
a result of bodily harm intentionally inflicted by him to facilitate the act of
sexual intercourse?

[Page 976]










I agree
with the opinion of Roach J.A. that the learned trial judge placed the two
opposing theories fairly before the jury, so that they could not fail to
understand the issue they had to decide. I am further in agreement with Roach
J.A. that the fact of haemorrhaging is equally consistent with the Crown’s theory that the respondent
was throttling the girl while he was attempting, or engaging in, the act of
intercourse as it is with the theory of the defence that the intercourse was
completed and the strangling occurred subsequently.



The
defence that the act of sexual intercourse was voluntary on the part of the
deceased was rejected by the jury and, in view of the evidence relating to the
disarray of the clothing of the deceased when her body was found, the
pathological evidence as to the description of her injuries, together with the
photographs which were entered as exhibits at the trial showing the condition
of her neck and head, in my opinion it was properly rejected.



At the
trial objection was quite properly taken to the evidence of the pathologist,
Doctor McLean, where he stated that the deceased had been raped. This was a
matter for the jury, but, on cross‑examination, the doctor made it quite
clear that he was not prepared to venture an opinion, based on his medical
observations, as to whether the deceased had or had not consented to having
sexual intercourse with the respondent.



I have
nothing further to add to the reasons of Roach J.A. on the appeal on the ground
of misdirection.



In the
result, in my view, the charge was adequate and there was no misdirection or
non‑direction amounting to misdirection and, in any event, no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.



I would
allow the appeal and restore the conviction.



CARTWRIGHT
J. (dissenting):—On April 27, 1956, the
respondent was convicted before Treleaven J. and a jury at the Toronto assizes
of having murdered one Linda Lampkin on or about January 18, 1956. He appealed,
and applied for leave to appeal, to the Court of Appeal on a number of grounds.
His appeal was heard on June 18 and 19, 1956, the Court being composed of
Pickup C.J.O. and Laidlaw, Roach, Aylesworth and Schroeder JJ.A. At the
conclusion

[Page 977]



of the
argument the learned Chief Justice announced that the appeal was allowed, the
conviction quashed and a new trial directed, with Roach J.A. dissenting, and
that written reasons would be delivered later. These were delivered on June 27[15].










Pickup
C.J.O., with whom Laidlaw and Schroeder JJ.A. agreed, was of opinion that the
appeal should be allowed on two grounds, (i) that the Crown had failed to show
that an oral statement made by the respondent to two police officers between 5
and 6 p.m. on January 19 and a written statement made by him immediately
afterwards were free and voluntary; and that the erroneous admission in
evidence of these statements was in itself sufficient to require the quashing
of the conviction, and (ii) that, even assuming for the purpose of dealing with
the sufficiency of the charge of the learned trial judge to the jury that the
statements were admissible, the learned trial judge had failed to lay the
theory of the defence adequately before the jury and had failed to direct them
as to how the law in relation to murder should be applied to the facts as they
might find them.



Roach
J.A. was of opinion (i) that the learned trial judge was right in holding that
the written statement referred to above was admissible, and, while he does not
say so expressly, it is, I think, implied in his reasons read as a whole that
he was also of opinion that the oral statement which preceded it was
admissible, (ii) that, while not saying that the charge of the learned trial
judge was a perfect charge, he was satisfied “that it was entirely adequate; that
there was no misdirection and no non-direction amounting to misdirection, and
that in any event no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred”.



Aylesworth
J.A. agreed with the reasons and conclusion of Pickup C.J.O. on the ground of
the inadequacy of the charge to the jury; but as to the admissibility of the
statements he said[16]:—



I
do not, however, agree that the statements given to the police by the appellant
were inadmissible. On the contrary, I think they were admissible and were
properly received in evidence at the trial. I concur in the reasons of my
brother Roach in this respect and I have nothing to add to those reasons.

[Page 978]



It
would appear from the paragraph quoted that Aylesworth J.A. read the reasons of
Roach J.A. as deciding that the oral as well as the written statement was
admissible.



In the
result Aylesworth J.A. agreed with the order proposed by Pickup C.J.O.










On June
28, 1956, the Attorney-General for Ontario gave notice of appeal to this Court.
In the view which I take of this case it is necessary for me to deal only with
the point relating to the admissibility of the statements made by the
respondent and therefore I quote only those parts of the notice of appeal which
refer to that point. These are as follows:—



In
regard to the second statement of the Respondent filed as Exhibit 53 at the
trial [i.e., the written statement referred to above], the Chief Justice
of Ontario, Laidlaw and Sohroeder, JJ.A., held that the learned trial Judge
erred in law in holding that the said statement was admissible in evidence at
the trial and allowed the appeal also on this ground.



Mr. Justice
Roach and Mr. Justice Aylesworth (dissenting on this ground) held that the
learned trial Judge did not err in law in holding that the said statement was
admissible in evidence at the trial.



The
Attorney-General for Ontario appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada upon the
following grounds:...



2.
There was dissent on a question of law by the Honourable Mr. Justice Roach
and the Honourable Mr. Justice Aylesworth from the majority judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario which erred in law in holding that the trial
Judge erred in holding that the second statement of the Respondent, filed as
Exhibit 53 at the trial, was admissible in evidence at the trial.



Counsel
for the respondent moved at the opening of the hearing before us to quash the
appeal on the ground that ground of appeal no. 2, quoted above, did not raise a
strict question of law alone. The Court decided to hear the argument of the
motion with the argument of the appeal.



In my
opinion the motion should be granted. After reading all the evidence and
everything that was said by counsel and by the learned trial judge during the
hearing and disposition of the issue raised as to the admissibility in evidence
of the oral and written statements above referred to and everything said on the
point in the reasons for judgment delivered in the Court of Appeal I am unable
to discern any dissent on, or indeed any difference of opinion as to, any point
of law. The difference of opinion was as to whether the proper inference to be
drawn from the evidence

[Page 979]



as to
the primary facts leading up to and surrounding the making of the statements
was that the Crown had satisfied the onus of showing that the statements in
question were freely and voluntarily made. In the circumstances of the case at
bar the question whether or not that inference should be drawn was, in my
opinion, one of fact.










The
evidence of the witnesses on the voir dire as to what I have called the
primary facts was not conflicting nor was its veracity attacked in
cross-examination and all of the learned judges in the Courts below have
proceeded on the basis that it contained an accurate account of what occurred.
The effect of that evidence is set out in some detail in the reasons delivered
in the Court of Appeal (vide [1956] O.R. 696). I propose to give a
comparatively brief summary of it.



The
lifeless body of Linda Lampkin was found on Commissioners Street late in the
evening of January 18, 1956, and the police immediately commenced an
investigation. At about 7 a.m. on January 19, police officers visited the place
in which a truck which had been driven by the respondent on the previous
evening was standing. They examined the truck and found in it a bobby-pin and a
lipstick said to have belonged to the deceased. On seeing the lipstick the
respondent collapsed and the officers rendered some assistance to him. When he
had recovered his composure Sergeant-Detective O’Driscoll and Detective Coghill asked
him to accompany them to police headquarters. On arrival there he was
questioned by these two officers in a small room, called the
interrogation-room, until about 9 a.m. During this period police officers took
from him a windbreaker, a shirt, a pair of pants, scrapings from his finger‑nails
and some hairs taken from his head and body. Shortly after 9 a.m. these
detectives left and Detective Simmonds proceeded to obtain a statement from the
respondent which was later typewritten and was signed by the respondent about
noon. There was nothing in this statement of an incriminating character. It
contained a denial of having seen the deceased on January 18. Just after this statement
was signed and completed, Sergeant-Detective O’Driscoll and Detective Coghill entered
the interrogation-room, and Detective Simmonds left them there with the

[Page 980]










respondent.
They remained for a short time. The respondent was given a sandwich and a glass
of milk for lunch. The respondent was kept in the general detective office
during the afternoon, under close supervision, while Detective Simmonds and
Detective McNeely continued their work of investigation elsewhere. About 5 p.m.
they returned to headquarters and again took the respondent into the
interrogation-room where he had been in the morning. They told the respondent
that they had been working since 5 o’clock
in the morning, that they had been working pretty hard, that they had received
information that he was seen with the deceased on the previous day about 8.45
p.m., that it might be necessary for them to take him out with them in the
police car to the west end in the area that he worked in, that there might be
other witnesses out there who might have seen things, that the lipstick that
was found in his truck had been identified and that they did not believe what
he had been telling them. It was at this point that the respondent made the
oral incriminating statement. He was at once formally cautioned and then made
the longer statement which was reduced to writing and signed by him.



After a
full recital of this evidence, the learned Chief Justice of Ontario quotes from
the judgment delivered in this Court in Boudreau v. The King[17], and continues[18]:—



The
principle as set forth in that case is a positive rule of English criminal law.
It has been applied in many subsequent cases to which I need not refer, because
the ruling which ought to be made by the Court depends on the evidence and
particular circumstances disclosed therein in each case. I simply direct my
mind and consideration to the fundamental question: Were the statements in
question in the instant case freely and voluntarily made?



After a
further review of the facts and another reference to the Boudreau case
the learned Chief Justice continues[19]:—



Applying
that principle to the particular facts in this case, I have reached the
conclusion that the Crown has failed to show that the oral statement made by
the appellant, or the written statement made by him immediately afterwards, was
free and voluntary. Therefore the learned

[Page 981]



judge,
in my opinion, should not have admitted either of those statements in evidence.
The erroneous admission in evidence of these incriminating statements is, in
itself, sufficient to warrant this Court directing a new trial.



Roach
J.A. opens the portion of his reasons dealing with this point as follows[20]:—



In
my opinion the learned trial judge was right in holding that it was admissible.
The question before him and now before this Court may be stated thus: Was that
statement freely and voluntarily made or was it obtained from the appellant
either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out to him
by the detectives? If it was a free and voluntary statement it was admissible:
if it was not it should have been barred.



There
can be no doubt as to the rule.










The
learned justice of appeal then refers to Ibrahim v. The King[21], quoting a passage on
which, amongst others, the judgments in this Court in Boudreau’s Case were founded. He stresses
the fact that the respondent had not given evidence on the voir dire, attaches
great weight to the caution given immediately before the taking of the written
statement, points out that there had been no threats or promises and in concluding
says[22]:—



In
determining whether the answers made are admissible or not, the Court
inevitably must come back to the primary question: Were they made voluntarily
in the sense described in the rule as laid down by Viscount Sumner, supra?



On
reading and rereading the reasons of Pickup C.J.O. and Roach J.A. I look in
vain for any difference as to the applicable law.



It was
suggested in argument that the learned Chief Justice of Ontario had held as a
matter of law that the fact, if established, that police officers “cross-examined” the respondent while in de
facto custody and under suspicion required the trial judge as a matter of
law to reject the statements. I can find no such ruling in his reasons. He
regarded the fact that certain questions were put as one of the relevant
circumstances to be weighed in deciding the question before the Court which he
had already accurately described in words, which I have quoted above, which do
not differ in any matter of substance from those used by Roach J.A.

[Page 982]



There
is no suggestion in any of the reasons that the learned trial judge misdirected
himself on the law on this branch of the case. His conclusion on the evidence
before him was that the statements were shewn to be voluntarily made. The
minority in the Court of Appeal reached the same conclusion but the majority
were of the contrary opinion. It is not relevant to inquire which conclusion I
would have reached on the evidence, for such a conclusion is one of fact and
not of law.



No
doubt there may be cases in which the question whether a statement made by an
accused is admissible in evidence becomes one of law; but, in my opinion, the
case at bar is not such a case. I conclude that we are without jurisdiction to
deal with ground 2, quoted above from the notice of appeal of the
Attorney-General. This being so it follows that the appeal cannot succeed as it
is clear from the portion of the reasons of the learned Chief Justice of
Ontario secondly quoted above that in dealing with this ground the majority
decided that the erroneous admission of the statements in question was in
itself sufficient to require the directing of a new trial.










If,
contrary to the view that I have expressed, it could be asserted that (i) there
is a difference of substance between the statement of the principles of law
which are to be applied in determining whether a statement by an accused is
admissible made by Pickup C.J.O. and that made by Roach J.A. and (ii) that
there was error in the former statement, it would not follow that so far as
this ground of appeal is concerned the appeal should be allowed and the
conviction restored. Before restoring the conviction this Court would, at
least, have to be satisfied that it could safely be affirmed that but for the
supposed error in law the majority in the Court of Appeal would necessarily
have concluded that the statements were admissible. As is pointed out by Lord
Sumner in Ibrahim v. The King, supra, at pp. 609-10, the question
whether it has been shewn by the prosecution that the statement of an accused
was voluntary in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by
fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in
authority is one of fact to be

[Page 983]



decided
by the trial judge. The Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to weigh the evidence
as to the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement and to
substitute its decision for that of the trial judge. This Court has no
jurisdiction to re-weigh the evidence and substitute its opinion for that of
the Court of Appeal. In view of the rule that the onus of proving a statement
by an accused to have been voluntary in the sense mentioned rests upon the
prosecution, I find difficulty in accepting the view that it can ever be said
as a matter of pure law that the question whether that onus has been satisfied
must be answered in the affirmative. However in view of the conclusion which I
have reached above as to our lack of jurisdiction in this case, I do not pursue
these questions further.



I would
quash the appeal.










FAUTEUX J.:—This is an appeal from a majority
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[23] setting aside the
conviction of the respondent for the murder of one Linda Lampkin and ordering a
new trial. The appeal is taken under the provisions of s. 598(1) (a) of
the Criminal Code and the questions of law as to which a dissent is
alleged are (i) whether, as held by Pickup C.J.O., with the concurrence of
Laidlaw and Schroeder JJ.A., Roach and Aylesworth JJ.A. dissenting, a written
statement, filed as ex. 53, and an oral statement immediately prior thereto,
both made by the respondent, were illegally admitted in evidence, and (ii)
whether, as held by Pickup C.J.O., with the concurrence of Laidlaw, Aylesworth
and Schroeder JJ.A., Roach J.A. dissenting, the trial judge failed to lay the
theory of the defence adequately before the jury and direct them as to how the
law in relation to murder should be applied to the facts.



Dealing
with question (i): it is the submission of counsel for the respondent that this
Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this ground of appeal for the reason
that it does not involve a question of law in the strict sense, but a pure
question of fact or at the most a question of mixed law and fact. With this
submission I am unable to agree. Whether or not evidence is admissible is
always a question to be determined in the light of what the law is with respect
to

[Page 984] 



the
particular nature of the evidence tendered. While as to certain subject-matters
of evidence such as confessions, this determination requires a prior
examination of the facts which, if judicially found to foe within the rule of
law governing the admission of such evidence, will render the same admissible,
any question as to what the rule is in the matter involves a question of law in
the strict sense. Hence a divergence of views between the majority and minority
members of a Court of Appeal as to what the law is clearly gives jurisdiction
to this Court to examine the point and satisfy its statutory duty to determine the
matter. With reference to the rule of law governing the admissibility of the
extrajudicial admissions made by the respondent in the present instance, Roach
J.A., for the minority, said[24]:—



There
can be no doubt as to the rule. It was stated by Viscount Sumner in Ibrahim
v. The King, [1914] A.C. 599 at 609, as follows: “It has long been established as a
positive rule of English criminal law, that no statement by an accused is
admissible in evidence against him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to
have been a voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been
obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or
held out by a person in authority.”



* * *



There
is no positive rule of evidence that if improper questions are asked of a
prisoner in custody the answers to them are, merely on that account,
inadmissible. The cases are reviewed by Kellock J. in Boudreau v. The King, [1949]
S.C.R. 262 at 270 et seq., 94 C.C.C. 1, 7 C.R. 427, [1949] 3 D.L.R. 81.
I do not review them here. In determining whether the answers made are
admissible or not, the Court inevitably must come back to the primary question:
Were they made voluntarily in the sense described in the rule as laid
down by Viscount Sumner, supra.



(The italics are mine.)










On the other hand, Pickup C.J.O., for
the majority, stated[25]:—



In
my opinion, the Crown does not discharge the onus resting upon it by merely
adducing oral testimony showing that an incriminating statement made by an
accused person was not induced by a promise or by fear of prejudice or hope of
advantage. That statement of the rule of law is too narrow. The admissions must
not have been “improperly instigated or
induced or coerced”: per Rand J. in Boudreau
v. The King, supra, at p. 269. The admissions must be self-impelled and the
statement must be the statement of a man “free in volition from compulsions or
inducements of authority”.

[Page 985]



Thus it
appears that Roach J.A., with the concurrence of Aylesworth J.A., held the view
that the decision of this Court in Boudreau v. The King did not change
the law as stated by Viscount Sumner and that a declaration made by an accused
is a voluntary statement if it has not been obtained from him either by fear of
prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority.
In the view of Pickup C.J.O. and Laidlaw and Schroeder JJ.A., this statement of
the rule is too narrow and in addition to proving that the statement has not
been obtained by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage, the prosecution must
further show that the statement was not otherwise influenced by the course of
conduct adopted by the police, that it must be self-impelled, failing which it
is not a voluntary one in the sense required by law. The merit of each of these
views of the law is, of course, foreign to the consideration of our
jurisdiction to entertain this ground on appeal, for it is the precise point
which this Court will have to determine on the appeal itself. The above
difference in the statement of the law applied is essentially what gives
jurisdiction to this Court. It may be added, before parting with the
consideration of this preliminary objection, that none of the cases invoked by
the respondent supports it or conflicts with the views here expressed.










On the
merits of ground (i): as to what the law is in the matter, I agree with the
views held by Roach and Aylesworth JJ.A. As I read the reasons for judgment of
the majority in this Court in Boudreau v. The King, supra, I find
nothing to suggest an intention to modify the rule of law as stated by Viscount
Sumner. With respect to the English “Judges’ Rules” as to questions put by
police officers, it has been repeatedly and again recently said that they are
administrative rules for the guidance of police officers but not rules of law
and that a breach thereof does not per se render the statement
inadmissible if the true test of voluntariness laid down by Viscount Sumner is
met: Regina v. Wattam[26]; Regina v. May[27]; Regina v. Bass[28]; Regina v. Harris-Rivet[29]. As to all the evidence in

[Page 986]



this
case and particularly that related to the circumstances prior to and
contemporaneous with the impugned statements, it is extensively reviewed in the
reasons for judgment of Roach J.A. in the Court below[30], and need not likewise be
related here. In brief, while the law‑enforcement officers were apprising
the respondent at police headquarters, where he had agreed in the morning to
accompany them, that, as a result of further investigation, they could not
believe some of the declarations he had there made in the morning, he was
preoccupied in mind, eventually breaking his silence by saying:—



I
was just thinking of my wife and kids. I didn’t mean to do it. She started kibitzing
around and I grabbed her by the scarf and she didn’t breathe no more.










He was
immediately stopped and informed that he was arrested on a charge of murder,
and having been given the customary warning, he proceeded to make the
declarations reduced in writing in ex. 53, which he signed. The above attitude
and utterances of the respondent are no evidence that his mind was in any way
affected by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage. On the evidence, led in the
cross‑examination of the police officers relating the event, the thoughts
of the respondent throughout the day had been directed to his wife and
children, and he was explaining that it was on account of them that he had
made, in the morning, some false declarations. Indeed it was never suggested by
counsel for the respondent at any stage of the trial, including that of the
procedure on voir dire, nor can it be implied from any of the questions
or answers appearing in any part of the whole of the evidence, that the
impugned statements were not voluntary in the sense indicated by Viscount
Sumner or that the burden of the Crown to meet that particular test had not
been discharged. As the issue was tried before, and left, to, the jury, these
impugned statements, on the unchallenged information given at the hearing
before this Court by counsel for the respondent, were represented by the
defence to be voluntary in any sense of the word and truthful. The submission
that these particular statements were inadmissible was raised for the first
time for the purpose of the appeal, not in the original, but in a supplementary
notice of appeal. That these statements were voluntary under the rule stated by
Viscount Sumner

[Page 987]



is not
challenged by the majority in the Court below which found it necessary to hold
as a matter of law that the statement of the rule was too narrow and, on the
law they applied, found as a fact, not that fear of prejudice or hope of
advantage was exercised or held out by the police, but that the course of
conduct they adopted precluded any conclusion that the statements were
self-impelled. Assuming that it could be said that the conduct of the police in
the circumstances of this case was not in accordance with the “Judges’ Rules”, it was, particularly
under the authorities above quoted, within the discretion of the trial judge,
if otherwise satisfied that the test of voluntariness stated by Viscount Sumner
had been met, to admit these statements in evidence. Again, while the defence
objected successfully to the admissibility of certain declarations made
subsequent to the signing by the accused of ex. 53, it did not invite the Court
to reject the impugned statements. And if, on the view the trial judge formed
on the voir dire, the occasion arose for him to exercise this
discretionary power, I find it impossible to say that he failed to do so
judicially in admitting them in evidence.



Dealing
with question (ii): the theory of the Crown was that Linda Lampkin had been
strangled in furtherance of the act of rape. The theory of the defence,
contained in the statement filed as ex. 53, was that, sexual intercourse having
taken place with her full approval and consent, Linda Lampkin not being
sexually satisfied began to annoy the accused who then grabbed her scarf
without intending any harm, “and she didn’t breathe no more”. The evidence with respect
to the condition both of the body of the victim and of her clothing is
violently inconsistent with any suggestion of consent on her part. On the
evidence, the cause of death was asphyxia due to strangulation resulting from
the forceful tightening during a continuous period of 3 to 5 minutes of a
knotted scarf she had around her neck, producing thereby a deep groove in the
flesh-tissue corresponding in size to the width of the scarf. The fact that

[Page 988]



death
actually occurred subsequent to the rape does not necessarily show that this
forceful and continuous tightening of the scarf, which brought death by
strangulation, was divorced from the act of rape. As Roach J.A. puts it[31]:—










That
theory [the theory of the defence] rested on the foundation that the act of
sexual intercourse was voluntary on her part and that she wanted it repeated.
Remove that prop from beneath that theory and it would collapse. It was her
persistence, so the accused said, in wanting the act repeated that caused him
to take hold of the scarf. That was his explanation. If that explanation should
be rejected then he must have taken hold of it for some other purpose. What was
that other purpose? That other purpose, according to the Crown’s theory, was to overpower
her so that against her will he could have sexual intercourse with her.



That
the accused killed the girl there was no doubt. He said so. What the jury had
to decide was: Did he slay her under the circumstances contained in his
explanation or did her death ensue as the result of bodily harm intentionally
inflicted by him to facilitate him in having sexual intercourse with her?



Weak as
it was, the theory of the defence was put to the jury and I agree with Roach
J.A. that the two opposing theories were fairly and squarely explained to them
in such a manner that they could not fail to understand the issue they had to
decide according to law.



There
remains to consider two other grounds of appeal raised by the respondent before
the Court of Appeal and with which the majority did not find necessary to deal
in view of their conclusions as to the two points already heretofore
considered. It is the respondent’s
submission that the learned trial judge failed to instruct the jury (i) as to
what use could be made of the expert evidence of Dr. Chester McLean and (ii) of
their obligation to reject any of his opinions which he was not qualified as an
expert to give.



These
objections are dealt with in the reasons for judgment of Roach J.A. and I am in
respectful agreement with the manner in which he disposed of them.



I am
also of the opinion that, on all the evidence in this case, no jury properly
instructed could, if true to their oath, return any other verdict than that the
accused was guilty as charged.



I would
allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario,
and restore the verdict of the jury.

[Page 989]



ABBOTT
J.:—A question which has caused
me some difficulty is that raised by respondent in his motion to quash the
appeal, namely, whether or not, in connection with the ground of appeal
relating to the admissibility of certain oral and written statements made by
respondent, there was dissent on a question of law. I have reached the
conclusion that there was.










As to
the admissibility of the incriminating oral and written statements made by the
accused, in his reasons in the Court below, Roach J.A. (speaking for himself
and Aylesworth J.A.) has stated the rule of law to be applied in the following
terms[32]:—



Was
that statement freely and voluntarily made or was it obtained from the
appellant either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held
out to him by the detectives?



(The
italics are mine.)



It is
to be noted that he has used the precise words of the rule as laid down by Lord
Sumner in Ibrahim v. The King[33], with the exception that
he has substituted the words “the detectives” for “a person in authority”.



The
Chief Justice of Ontario, speaking for the majority and referring to the rule
in question, held that[34]:—



In
my opinion, the Crown does not discharge the onus resting upon it by merely
adducing oral testimony showing that an incriminating statement made by an
accused person was not induced by a promise or by fear of prejudice or hope of
advantage. That statement of the rule of law is too narrow. The admissions must
not have been “improperly instigated or
induced or coerced”: per Rand J. in Boudreau
v. The King, supra, at p. 269. The admissions must be self-impelled, and
the statement must be the statement of a man “free in volition from the compulsions
or inducements of authority”. The statement must be “freely and voluntarily made”.



This
difference between the dissenting judgment and that of the majority is in my
view clearly a question of law, which gives this Court jurisdiction.



Moreover,
referring to the statements made by the respondent, Roach J.A. said[35]:—



The
appellant did not give evidence either on the voir dire or in defence to
the charge. To put it otherwise he has not at any time said in evidence that in
making the statement he felt under any compulsion or that it was induced by any
fear of prejudice or hope of advantage held out to him. When he blurted out the
words “I was just thinking of my

[Page 990]










wife
and kids”, and so forth, he was
immediately stopped by the detectives and cautioned. He said he understood that
caution. If he understood it then he understood that he was not obliged to say
anything, because in administering the caution to him he was told “you are not obliged to say
anything unless you wish to do so”.
In my respectful opinion the statement could be held inadmissible only on the
theory that he did not understand the caution, in the face of his statement,
not denied, that he did, or that, though he understood it, he still felt under
some compulsion induced by some improper external stimulus to make it.



I
do not think it should now be held that he did not understand the caution, in
the face of his statement that he did. If he understood it then I can see no
room for the suggestion that, despite his understanding, he still felt some
compulsion. It would have been quite a different matter if, on the voir
dire, he had gone into the witness-box and stated either that he did not
understand the caution or that, understanding it, he nevertheless made the
statement because he was fearful that if he did not he would be prejudiced, or
hoped that if he did it might be to his advantage. In the absence of such a
complaint or explanation coming out of his mouth, to hold now either that he
did not understand the caution or that, understanding it, he felt under some
compulsion, would in my respectful opinion be to act on sheer speculation, and
would not be justified by the evidence.



It
was not suggested on cross-examination of the officers on the voir dire, in
the argument submitted by counsel for the accused to the trial judge, or in the
argument presented to this Court, that what the detectives said to the
appellant with respect to the information they had obtained that afternoon was
not true and that by pretending that they had such information they had tricked
the accused into making an admission of guilt. If I understood the argument of
counsel for the appellant in this Court it was simply this, that when the
detectives told the accused that as a result of their investigations they had
received some information to the effect that he had been seen with the deceased
on the previous night at St. John’s
Road and Jane Street, and that they did not believe what he had told them to
the contrary in the morning, they thereby invited him to make some reply. I
concede that that is so. It is true that what the detectives said consisted of
affirmative statements and was not interrogatory, but I think there could have
been no other reason for them to make those statements than to invite a reply.
The detectives did not know what the reply might be. It might be a denial or an
explanation, or it might be an admission. Let me assume for the moment that the
detectives hoped that it would be an admission of guilt. The fact remains that
they made no threats that may have raised any fear in the mind of the
appellant, nor did they hold out any promise or hope of advantage if he
admitted his guilt nor did they suggest to him that he might be prejudiced if
he did not.



As I
read this passage, the learned judge has held that in his opinion there was no
evidence to justify a finding that the respondent’s statements were obtained from him “either by fear of prejudice
or hope of advantage exercised or held out to him”



 by the
two detectives. This is a question of

[Page 991]



law
upon which I share his view. I am therefore in agreement with Roach and
Aylesworth JJ.A. that the statements in question were properly admitted by
the trial judge.










As to the other ground of dissent, I
am in respectful agreement with Roach J.A. that there was no misdirection and
no non-direction amounting to misdirection. There is nothing which I could
usefully add to his reasons for judgment.



I would
allow the appeal and restore the conviction.

Appeal allowed and
conviction restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Habitual criminals—Matters to be proved by
prosecution—Proof that accused “is leading persistently a
criminal life” at time of primary offence—The Criminal Code, now
1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 660(2)(a).

Before a person can be
found to be an habitual criminal the Crown, in addition to proving the
prescribed number of previous convictions, must satisfy the onus of proving
beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time of committing the primary offence
the accused was “leading persistently a
criminal life”. This onus is not
satisfied by showing that since his release from imprisonment he has done no
work and has no visible means of earning an honest livelihood, and on the other
hand the fact that he has done some honest work since his last release is far
from conclusive proof that he is not an habitual criminal, although it is an
important consideration. Rex v. Stewart (1910), 4 Cr. App. R. 175 at
178; Rex v. Baggott (1910), 4 Cr. App. R. 67 at 70; Rex v. Lavender (1927),
20 Cr. App. R. 10, quoted or referred to.

There are cases in which an
accused’s criminal record, coupled
with the conviction for the substantive offence, may form a sufficient basis
for the finding that he is an habitual criminal. But Parliament did not intend
that a man should be found to be an habitual criminal merely because he has a
number of previous convictions against him. Rex v. Jones (1920), 15 Cr.
App. R. 20 at 21, agreed with. In all the cases in which this has been held
sufficient the substantive offence has been of such a nature as to show
premeditation and careful preparation, and in this way to constitute in itself
evidence of leading persistently a criminal life. Rex v. Keane and Watson (1912),
8 Cr. App. R. 12 at 14; Rex v. Heard (1911), 7 Cr. App. R. 80
at 83, quoted. If the circumstances of the primary offence are consistent with
the view that the accused yielded to a sudden temptation, and do not establish
premeditation or a plan, the fact of that offence, even when coupled with a
lengthy criminal record, does not constitute sufficient evidence to support a
finding that the accused is an habitual criminal.

APPEAL from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing an appeal from a sentence of
preventive detention imposed on the appellant as an habitual criminal. Appeal
allowed.

The
judgment of the Court was delivered by










CARTWRIGHT
J.:—This is an appeal, brought
pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from an order of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, dated May 26, 1953, affirming the finding of His Honour Judge
Lovering dated February 26, 1953, that the appellant was an habitual criminal.



On
February 26, 1953, the appellant was tried before His Honour Judge Lovering,
without a jury, on the charge of having, on October 4, 1952, stolen from the
person of Hugh McCulloch a wallet containing $107 in money and personal papers.
The learned judge convicted the appellant on this charge and then proceeded
with the hearing to determine whether or not he was an habitual criminal, with
the result indicated above.



In view
of the dates of the proceedings the questions raised on this appeal are to be
determined under the provisions of Part X (A) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1927, c. 36, as enacted by 1947, c. 55, s. 18.



The
notice required by s. 575C(4)(b) was given to the appellant. In it the
grounds upon which it was intended “to
found the charge of being an habitual criminal” were specified as follows:



1.
That since attaining the age of eighteen years you have been convicted of the
following indictable offences for which you were liable to at least five years
imprisonment, that is to say,



(a)

steal one carton containing thirty pounds of tea the property of the Toronto
St. Catharines Transport, value under $25.00, contrary to the Criminal
Code, and that you were sentenced to imprisonment for 60 days.



(b)
On the 11th day of May in the year 1936, in the County of York Magistrate’s Court, you were convicted

unlawfully did receive in your possession eighteen cartons of beer, the
property of Reinhardt Brewery and theretofore stolen, then well knowing the
same to have been so stolen, value over $25.00, contrary to the Criminal Code,
section 399, and you were sentenced to a definite term of 6 months in the
Ontario Reformatory.

[Page 5]










(d)
On the 27th day of October A.D., 1937, in the County Court Judge’s Criminal Court of the
County of York, you were convicted for that at the City of Toronto in the

possession one cuff link, the property of W.G. Richards, 9 Brook Street, before
then stolen, well knowing the same to have been stolen, contrary to
Section 399 of the Criminal Code, and you were sentenced to imprisonment
for a term of 12 months.



(f)
On the 15th day of November, A.D., 1938, in the County Court Judge’s Criminal Court of the
County of York, you were convicted for that at the City of Toronto in the
County of York, on or about the 1st day of October in the year 1938, you broke
and entered the shop, warehouse, store or storehouse of Dominion Stores Ltd.,
situate and known as number 497 Parliament Street, in the said city, and stole
therein a quantity of cigarettes and other articles, the property of Dominion
Stores Ltd., contrary to the Criminal Code;



(g)
And further at the time and place last above mentioned, you were also convicted
for that at the City of Toronto on or about the 1st day of October in the year
1938, you robbed Benjamin Pearson of a revolver, and at the time of or
immediately before or immediately after such robbery, wounded, beat, struck or
used personal violence to the said Benjamin Pearson, contrary to the Criminal
Code;



(h)
And further at the time and place last above mentioned, you were also convicted
for that at the said City of Toronto, on or about the 9th day of October in the
year 1938, you robbed one Alex Thompson of the sum of two hundred and eight
dollars, ($208.00) in money, a wrist watch and a fountain pen, and at the time
of or immediately before or immediately after such robbery, wounded, beat,
struck or used personal violence to the said Alex Thompson, contrary to the
Criminal Code.



(i)
On the 21st day of November, 1938, you were sentenced to imprisonment in
Kingston Penitentiary for three years for each of the offences mentioned in
paragraphs f, g, and h above, the sentences to run concurrent.



(j)
On the 4th day of June, A.D., 1946, at the sittings of the County Court Judge’s Criminal Court of the
County of York, you were convicted for that at the City of Toronto in the
County of York, on or about the 9th day of June in the year 1945, you
unlawfully did steal the sum of three hundred and eighteen dollars ($318.00),
the property of Kenneth Adair, contrary to the Criminal Code and that you were
sentenced to imprisonment in Kingston Penitentiary for two years.










(k)
On the 20th day of June, A.D., 1946, at sittings of the County Court Judge’s Criminal Court of the
County of York, held at the City of Toronto, you were convicted for that at the
City of Toronto in the County of York, in or about the month of May in the year
1946, you unlawfully did steal three suitcases and two week-end bags and
contents,

[Page 6]



the
property of Albert Catalone, Irma Wolfe, Margaret L. Clark and Eli Van Dirlin,
contrary to the Criminal Code and that you were sentenced to serve a term of
three years in Kingston Penitentiary.



(l)
On the 15th day of December, A.D., 1949, at a sittings of the County Court
Judge’s Criminal Court of the
County of York, held at the City of Toronto you were convicted for that at the
City of Toronto in the County of York, in the month of October in the year
1949, you broke and entered the dwelling house of Wilfred Deschamp, situate and
known as number 338 Bloor Street East, in the said City, by night, with intent
to commit an indictable offence therein, to wit, theft, contrary to the
Criminal Code, and that you were sentenced to imprisonment in Kingston
Penitentiary for three years.



2.
That since the expiration of your last term of imprisonment you have been doing
no work and you have no visible means by which to earn an honest livelihood.



3.
You are charged with being a persistent criminal because shortly after your release
from Kingston Penitentiary, you committed the fresh offence that you are
now charged with.



The
convictions as set out in items (a) to (I) of para. 1 of
this notice were proved at the hearing. It appears from the certificates of
conviction, which were filed as exhibits, that the sentences imposed under
items (b) and (c) were to run concurrently as was
also the case in regard to those imposed under items (d) and (e),
those imposed under items (f), (g) and (h) and
those imposed under items (j) and (k).



There
was evidence that in November 1937 the appellant had stated his age to be 19
and that in September 1945 he had stated it to be 27.



We were
informed by counsel that the appellant was released from the penitentiary on
April 4, 1952, so that exactly six months elapsed between the date of his
release and that of the commission of the substantive offence of which he was
convicted by His Honour Judge Lovering. The only evidence given for the
prosecution as to the activities of the appellant during this period was that
in July and August 1952 he was seen in the village of Belle Ewart assisting
from time to time in a booth operated by his sister in which refreshments were
sold.



The
defence called William Dineen, a nephew of the appellant, who testified that
the latter had helped the mother of the witness in the operation of the booth
at Belle Ewart; that the appellant had tried to get employment at the Canadian
National Exhibition in August 1952 but could not do so as he was not a union
member; that








[Page 7]



the
witness and his wife then took the appellant into their home and that he helped
with digging the cellar and with some reconditioning and decorating of their
house; that the appellant got some odd jobs as a stevedore; that the appellant
was “living for free at home” and getting some money
from his sister, the mother of the witness; and that during the war years the
appellant had worked at war-work but that the witness knew of this only by
hearsay as he was in the armed services at that time.



The
learned County Judge gave no reason for his finding that the appellant was an
habitual criminal and the Court of Appeal gave no reasons for their decision
that the appeal from that finding should be dismissed.



While
the grounds of appeal were expressed in varying terms in the memorandum filed
on behalf of the appellant, the main ground argued before us was that on the
evidence the Crown had failed to satisfy the onus of proving that at the time
of the commission of the substantive offence the appellant was leading
persistently a criminal life. We were informed by counsel that this ground was
not urged in the Court of Appeal. It must be borne in mind that, leave to
appeal having been granted under s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952,
c. 259, our jurisdiction is not restricted to questions of law alone: vide the
judgment of this Court granting leave to appeal in Parkes v. The Queen[1].



Section 575C(1)
so far as relevant to the question now before us read as follows:



(1)
A person shall not be found to be a habitual criminal unless the judge… finds on evidence,



(a)
that since attaining the age of eighteen years he has at least three times
previously to the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment, been
convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to at least five
years’ imprisonment, whether any
such previous conviction was before or after the commencement of this Part, and
that he is leading persistently a criminal life;



Part
X(A) of the Criminal Code, first enacted in 1947, is in its wording
similar to, although not identical with, Part II of the Prevention of Crime
Act, 1908, 8 Edw. VII, c. 59, and counsel in the course of their full and
helpful

[Page 8]










arguments
discussed a number of the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in cases
arising under the last-mentioned statute.



In my
opinion it is established by these decisions, and I would so hold on the
wording of s. 575C(1) if the matter were devoid of authority, that before
an accused can be found to be an habitual criminal the Crown, in addition to
proving the prescribed number of previous convictions, must satisfy the onus of
proving beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time when he committed the
indictable offence referred to in s. 575B the accused was leading persistently
a criminal life. It is true that a finding that a person is an habitual
criminal is not a conviction of a crime: vide Brusch v. The Queen[2] and Parkes v. The Queen[3]; but, as was said by Rand
J. in Parkes v. The Queen[4] when the finding that
Parkes was an habitual criminal was quashed:



Under
such a determination a person can be detained in prison for the rest of his
life with his liberty dependent on the favourable discretion of a
minister of the Crown. The adjudication is a most serious step in the
administration of the criminal law.



and, in
my opinion, the rule requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt applies to such
an adjudication as fully as in the case of any criminal charge.



In the
case at bar there is no evidence that during the six months following his
release from the penitentiary in April 1952 the appellant had done anything
unlawful or dishonest. Such evidence as there is goes to show that he was
trying to obtain work, albeit without much success, and was doing such work as
he was able to get. Ground no. 2 set out in the notice required under s.
575C(4)(b) and quoted above is not made out on the evidence but if it
had been it would not have required a finding adverse to the appellant. It was
said by Jelf J., giving the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex
v. Stewart[5],



It
does not follow, because he is not getting an honest living, that it must be a
dishonest one—he may be doing nothing.

[Page 9]



and by
Pickford J. giving the judgment of the Court in Rex v. Baggott[6]:










He
refused the work of stone-breaking that had been offered him by the guardians.
It is said that you can infer criminality from this. But the evidence was that
the appellant was living on the charity of his relations. Therefore the choice
was not stone-breaking or stealing, but stone-breaking or charity. He chose the
latter.



I agree
with the view expressed in a number of cases in the Court of Criminal Appeal
that the mere fact that the prisoner has done some honest work since his last
release is by no means conclusive proof that he is not an habitual criminal:
see, for example, Rex v. Lavender[7]; although the fact of his
having done such work is an important consideration.



It was
argued on behalf of the respondent that the appellant’s criminal record coupled with the
conviction of the substantive offence formed a sufficient basis for the finding
that he was an habitual criminal. As to this I agree with the view expressed by
Lord Reading L.C.J. giving the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex
v. Jones[8]:



The
legislature never intended that a man should be convicted of being a habitual
criminal merely because he had a number of previous convictions against him.



There
have however been cases in which the Court of Criminal Appeal has upheld a
finding that a prisoner was an habitual criminal on the ground that the nature
of the substantive offence viewed in the light of his previous record was in
itself evidence that he was leading persistently a criminal life. For example
in Rex v. Keane and Watson[9], Channell J. in giving the
judgment of the Court said:



The
point is whether, at the time when he commits the offence then being dealt
with, he is leading persistently a dishonest or criminal life. The verb
is in the present tense. If he has done some honest work but has given it up and
committed another crime, it may well be that he has returned to a life of crime
and is then a habitual criminal, and the nature of the most recent crime may
itself be evidence that at the time he commits it he is persistently leading a
dishonest or criminal life. In Baggott’s case, which was relied on for the
appellants but is really an authority against them, the offence of coining was
given as an illustration of such a crime. But the present case is another
illustration which will do equally well. The appellants, who must have planned
the crime

[Page 10]



together,
broke into this dwelling-house by means of a jemmy and stole bracelets and
rings and other property from the bedrooms. We think that when they were
committing this offence, they must then have been leading persistently a
dishonest and criminal life. In our opinion, therefore, there was sufficient
evidence to support the verdicts of the jury… 










I have
examined all the cases of this class to which we were referred by counsel and
find that in each of them the substantive offence was of such a nature as to
show premeditation and careful preparation. I shall refer to only one example.
In Rex v. Heard[10], Hamilton J., speaking for
the Court, said:



Where
the interval between the last known fact against the prisoner and the
commission of the substantive crime is considerable—and six or nine months are a
considerable interval—there should be additional
evidence. In this case there was such evidence, for the crime was carefully
planned, was committed in association with another habitual criminal, and was
carried out with skill, so the jury, with the facts before them, were justified
in convicting… 



In the
case at bar the transcript of the evidence given at the trial on the charge of
the substantive offence was not before the Court of Appeal nor was it before us
at the argument. In considering the matter, after judgment had been reserved,
this Court was unanimously of the opinion that this transcript should have formed
part of the material in the Court of Appeal, and requested the Attorney-General
to furnish it to us unless counsel should desire to make any submission that it
should not be before us. No objection was made and we have now received the
transcript.



The
evidence of McCulloch whose wallet was stolen is uncontradicted. He was walking
north on Jarvis Street about midnight after watching television in a hotel.
There had been a collision and an argument was in progress as a result.
McCulloch had stopped to observe this and was having a conversation with the
appellant during the course of which he offered the appellant a cigarette. He
does not say who started the conversation. He says in part:



Anyway,
we talked for about a minute or two and he said, “All right sir, you are a good sport”, and gave me a pat on the
shoulder and walked off across the street.



A
moment later, on putting his hand in his pocket to get his handkerchief,
McCulloch noticed that his wallet which had been in his left hip pocket was
gone. He ran after

[Page 11]



the
appellant calling for the police and the appellant was seen to drop the wallet.
The appellant did not give evidence.










In my
opinion, the offence thus committed by the appellant is not of such a nature as
to warrant the inference that he was leading persistently a criminal life. The
circumstances are consistent with the view that, yielding to a sudden
temptation, he availed himself of the opportunity afforded by his chance
meeting with McCulloch following the collision. It may be said that the
circumstances are not inconsistent with the view that the appellant had gone
out that night for the express purpose of picking someone’s pocket if the opportunity
offered, but so to hold would be mere speculation. Bearing in mind that the appellant
is entitled to the benefit of every reasonable doubt it is my opinion that
there is not sufficient evidence to support the finding of the learned County
Court Judge that the appellant was an habitual criminal. As pointed out above
we are not restricted to a consideration of the question of law whether there
was any evidence on which such a finding could have been made and I express no
final opinion upon it although it is my present view that there was no such
evidence.



I do
not intend in anything I have said above to minimize the seriousness of the
substantive offence of which the appellant was convicted, and for which he has
been punished by two years’ imprisonment; but that
offence was not, in my opinion, of such a nature as, without more, to furnish
evidence that he was leading persistently a criminal life.



I would
quash the finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal and the direction
that he be held in preventive detention.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Evidence—Admissibility—Res gestae—Conduct of accused driver
immediately after accident—Relevance to issue of
anterior negligence.

Criminal law—Criminal negligence—Admissibility of evidence
of driver’s conduct immediately after
accident.

Evidence of the conduct of
an accused person immediately after an accident, if it is of such a nature that
it may reasonably be thought sufficient, if believed, to warrant an inference
upon the issue of criminal negligence, may be properly received in evidence and
considered by the jury in determining that issue.

On a trial for causing
death by criminal negligence evidence was admitted that the accused’s car, immediately after
striking another car, “skidded and swerved up the
street” and “as soon as it got under its
right control it picked up speed”
and disappeared. The trial judge told the jury that they were entitled to
consider this evidence in determining whether or not the accused had been
guilty of criminal negligence.

Held (Cartwright J. dissenting):
The evidence was properly admitted and there was no misdirection. It was open
to the jury, in the circumstances of the case, to draw an inference from the
subsequent conduct of the accused as to his wantonness and reckless disregard
for the lives or safety of other persons at the time of and immediately before
the accident. The whole conduct was part of the res gestae.

Gudmondson v. The King (1933), 60 C.C.C. 332,
distinguished.

Per Cartwright J., dissenting:
Criminal negligence, as defined by s. 191 of the Criminal Code, must
be shown to have existed prior to or at the instant of the accused’s car striking the other
car, and although the fact that the driver fled from the scene was a relevant
item of circumstantial evidence, it was essential that it be made plain to the
jury that his conduct after the accident was relevant only in so far as it
assisted them to determine by inference the nature of his conduct before it,
and whether or not he had, before the impact, been driving with wanton or
reckless disregard for the lives or safety of others. Without such a warning
(which was not given) there was grave danger of their convicting because in
their opinion the accused had acted with that disregard after the impact.








APPEAL by the accused from
the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming his conviction,
before Ferguson J. and a jury, of causing the death of one Lawrence Vipond by
criminal negligence. Appeal dismissed.

[Page 21]

J.G.J. O’Driscoll and Patrick
Galligan, for the appellant.

W.B. Common, Q.C., for the
respondent.



THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—This appeal should be
dismissed. As to the second ground of appeal, I agree with the reasons of
Mr. Justice Kellock and merely add that, in addition to the references by
him to the charge of the trial judge, it might be pointed out that the latter, at
several earlier stages, had referred to the fact that “this is a hit-and-run case”—and necessarily so, since
one of the main matters in dispute was as to the identification of the driver
of the automobile. The subsequent conduct of the driver relied upon by the
Crown occurred immediately after the impact and could be treated as part of the
res gestae as accompanying those earlier acts as to which it was
contended that the driver had been criminally negligent in doing, or omitting
to do, anything which it was his duty to do, showing wanton, or reckless,
disregard for the lives or safety of other persons. Unquestionably no
appreciable time elapsed between the automobile striking Vipond and the
skidding, swerving and picking up speed.



The first point upon which leave to
appeal was granted is:



Was
the verbal statement attributed to the appellant by the investigating police
officer improperly admitted in evidence?



Whether
or not one considers that at the time of the making of this statement the
appellant was under arrest on any charge, the rule laid down by this Court in Boudreau
v. The King[1], was not infringed.
Although the evidence as to this verbal statement was given before the voir
dire, and the trial judge was apparently of the view that it should not
have been so given, at that time, and although he ruled against the
admissibility of a subsequent written statement, there is nothing, considering
all the circumstances, to take the case out of the rule so established.



The
judgment of Kellock, Locke and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by










KELLOCK
J.:—When the sequence of events
is properly understood, I do not think the ruling of the learned trial

[Page 22]



judge,
confirmed, as it was, by the Court of Appeal, as to the admissibility of the
oral statement of the appellant to the police officer, can be questioned.



With
regard to the second ground of appeal, it is contended that there was
misdirection on the part of the learned trial judge in instructing the jury
that in determining the issue as to criminal negligence, they were entitled to
take into consideration the conduct of the appellant in leaving the scene after
the accident.



The
evidence was that of two witnesses, who testified as to seeing the appellant’s car immediately after the
accident, one of them stating that “it
skidded and swerved up the street; as soon as it got under its right control it
picked up speed” and disappeared. The
learned trial judge instructed the jury:



This,
you see, is a hit-and-run case and you have to consider that in considering
whether this was a reckless disregard for the lives and safety of other people.
Is the conduct of the person who hit Vipond consistent with anything but a
reckless disregard for the lives and safety of other people?



And
again:



Ask
yourselves, how could he have failed to see this car; how did he get over in
front of the door? You will ask yourselves about these questions. If he had any
regard for the life and safety of people on the street would he not have
stopped after he came in collision with this door? It is for you to say. In
order to convict him you must be able to say that he showed a reckless and
wanton disregard for the lives and safety of other people.



In my
opinion, evidence of the conduct of an accused person immediately after an
accident, if of such a nature that it may reasonably be thought sufficient, if
believed, to warrant an inference upon the issue of criminal negligence, may be
properly received in evidence. The appellant’s subsequent conduct was, therefore, a
proper consideration for the jury in the case at bar.










Counsel
for the appellant referred to the decision of this Court in Gudmondson v.
The King[2], as supporting a contrary
view. In that case there was evidence on behalf of the Crown that the car which
had struck the deceased kept on going after the accident and in order to get
away, drove around another car which had been stopped in the middle of the
highway in an effort to bring it to a stop.

[Page 23]



In addition,
there was evidence on behalf of the accused that his conduct in not stopping
was due to panic and that in any event, his brakes were gone and he could not a
bring the car to a stop. The learned trial judge had charged the jury that the
conduct of the accused after the accident was relevant on the issue of criminal
negligence from the standpoint of “similar
facts” and had told them: “There is no doubt he fails
by hitting and running away in this case. As far as I am concerned I will tell
you that has been established by the evidence.”[3] It was in these
circumstances that this Court said, at p. 333:



Having
said what he did upon this matter, he ought at least to have added a warning to
the jury that such conduct, however reprehensible, could have no more than an
indirect bearing upon the issue before them. He had already virtually withdrawn
from them the charge of intoxication; but, in view of his other observations,
he should have told them that they ought to be very cautious in imputing to the
accused a consciousness of guilt, because of actions which, on reflection, they
might think capable of explanation as due to panic.



In the
case at bar there was no evidence with regard to the conduct of the appellant
after the accident apart from that to which I have already referred. In my
view, therefore, what the learned trial judge said to the jury was not
objectionable from the standpoint which this Court considered objectionable in
the case to which I have referred and, in my opinion, it was open to the jury
in the circumstances of this case to draw an inference from the subsequent
conduct of the appellant as to the wantonness and reckless disregard for the lives
or safety of other persons at the time of and immediately prior to the accident
here in question. The whole conduct was part of the res gestae.



I do
not think the charge is open to the construction that the jury were told they
could draw from the mere fact that the appellant ran away from the scene of the
accident, the inference that his driving at the time of the accident amounted
to criminal negligence. The learned judge had already instructed the jury with
considerable care as to the elements of negligence of that character.



I would dismiss the appeal.








[Page 24]



CARTWRIGHT
J. (dissenting):—-The appellant was tried at
the assizes at Brantford before Ferguson J. and a jury and, on January 16,
1956, was convicted on the charge that at the town of Paris, on November 12,
1955, he did by criminal negligence cause the death of Lawrence Vipond,
contrary to s. 192 of the Criminal Code. On April 9, 1956, the Court of
Appeal for Ontario unanimously dismissed his appeal.



On
April 24, 1956, Abbott J. granted leave to appeal on the following questions of
law:



1.
Was the verbal statement attributed to the appellant by the investigating
police officer improperly admitted in evidence?



2.
Did the learned Trial Judge misdirect the jury when he instructed them that in
determining whether or not the appellant was guilty of criminal negligence they
were entitled to take into consideration his subsequent conduct, namely,
leaving the scene of the accident?



As in
my opinion there should be a new trial I will refer to the evidence only so far
as may be necessary to make clear the reasons for the conclusion at which I
have arrived.



At
about 11.20 p.m. on November 12, 1955 Lawrence Vipond and a Miss Pfeiffer were
standing on Dundas Street in the town of Paris on the south or right-hand side
of an automobile which was parked facing easterly on the north side of the
street. The right‑hand door of this automobile was open. A motor vehicle
driven westerly struck the open door and the right rear fender of the
stationary automobile with considerable violence. Vipond suffered injuries from
which he died shortly afterwards. Miss Pfeiffer was seriously injured and was
found 14 feet west of the stationary automobile. The motor vehicle which struck
Vipond did not stop and none of the witnesses could identify its driver or say
whether it was driven by a man or a woman.



The
theory of the Crown was that the appellant was the driver of the motor vehicle
which struck the deceased. There was circumstantial evidence to support this
theory and the Crown also relied on an oral statement said to have been made by
the appellant to a police officer after he had been arrested on a charge of
vagrancy on the day following the fatality.

[Page 25]










It is
to the admissibility of this oral statement that the first question is
directed. I do not find it necessary to answer this question. Unfortunately the
statement in question was given in evidence by the police officer in the
presence of the jury without any preliminary enquiry or ruling as to its
admissibility. The learned trial judge appears to have been at first inclined
to the view that the statement was inadmissible and that a mistrial would
result; but as he did not discharge the jury and in his charge invited them to
consider the statement, it must be taken that at the conclusion of the evidence
he had decided that it was admissible, although he ruled against the
admissibility of the written statement said to have been made by the appellant
immediately afterwards. It will be for the judge presiding at the new trial to
decide the question of admissibility upon the evidence then given as to the
circumstances in which the statement was made.



Turning
to the second question, it was, of course, incumbent upon the prosecution to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt not only that the appellant was the driver of
the car which struck Vipond but also that he was criminally negligent in
driving it. In dealing with this question I will assume that the jury found
that the appellant was the driver of the car.



Criminal
negligence is defined in s. 191 of the Criminal Code, which reads as
follows:



191.
(1) Every one is criminally negligent who



(a)
in doing anything, or



(b)
in omitting to do anything that it is his duty to do, shows wanton or reckless
disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.



(2)
For the purposes of this section, “duty” means a duty imposed by
law.



The
appellant while driving was under a legal duty to take reasonable care to avoid
injuring any persons on the highway; but, in view of the definition quoted, he
could be found guilty only if the jury were satisfied not merely that he failed
to perform this duty but also that his failure showed wanton or reckless
disregard for the lives or safety of others. Such wanton or reckless disregard
must be shown to have existed prior to or at the instant of the car striking
Vipond.

[Page 26]










Counsel
for the respondent argues that the jury were entitled to infer the existence of
such disregard from the facts that it was a clear night, that the parking
lights of the stationary car were on, that it was parked between two street
lights, that there was nothing to prevent the driver of the car which struck
Vipond from seeing the stationary car, that the impact was violent, and that
the driver fled from the scene. I agree that all of these were relevant items
of circumstantial evidence. But, in my opinion, it was of vital importance that
the jury should be carefully instructed that they must consider the fact of
flight only for the purpose of reaching a decision as to the manner in which
the driver was driving up to the instant of the impact, and particularly as to
whether up to that instant he was driving with wanton or reckless disregard for
the lives or safety of other persons. Without such a warning there would be a
grave danger of the jury convicting the appellant because in their opinion he
had immediately after the impact acted with such wanton or reckless
disregard. In other words, it was essential that it be made plain to the jury
that the conduct of the accused subsequent to the impact was relevant only in
so far as it assisted them to determine by inference the nature of his conduct
prior to the impact.



Far
from giving any such direction the learned trial judge used words which the
jury may well have understood, and which, in my opinion, they would have understood,
to mean that they might convict the appellant if satisfied that he had
immediately after the impact acted with a reckless disregard for the lives or
safety of others. I refer to the following passage in the charge of the
learned trial judge, and particularly to the sentences which I have italicized:



If
you decide it was negligence, was it the kind of negligence I described? that
is, was it criminal? This, you see, is a hit-and-run case and you have to
consider that in considering whether this was a reckless disregard for the
lives and safety of other people. Is the conduct of the person who hit
Vipond consistent with anything but a reckless disregard for the lives and
safety of other people? The car had crossed the bridge; there was not very much
traffic on Dundas Street; the street lights were on; the driving conditions, as
you have heard, were good; this is a fairly wide street; yet whoever drove this
car crashed into the door of Kennedy’s
car and crushed these two young people.

[Page 27]



Miss
Verna Farr said they flew through the air, and Miss Pfeiffer was found fourteen
feet beyond the rear of Kennedy’s car, and Vipond was found
with his feet sort of underneath the rear wheel. The car skidded, according to
Miss Farr, and then speeded up when it righted and after swerving, passed on.
You will ask yourselves how could a driver driving under those conditions with
the car parked between these two lights—someone gave the exact distance the
car was from the easterly light, and as you can see there is seventy-six feet
from Burwell Street to the first light, and then there is some distance from
the first light to the car—so that whoever passed
Burwell Street and crossed this corner had, as I recall it, some ninety feet
before he would come to this door. Ask yourselves, how could he have failed to
see this car; how did he get over in front of the door? You will ask yourselves
about those questions. If he had any regard for the life and safety of
people on the street would he not have stopped after he came into collision
with this door? It is for you to say. In order to convict him you must be able
to say that he showed a reckless and wanton disregard for the lives and safety
of other people.










I am
unable to find anything elsewhere in the charge of the learned trial judge
which would make it clear to the jury that they must not convict unless
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was driving prior to or at
the moment of impact with a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or
safety of other persons.



In
considering the likelihood of the jury having been misled it is well to bear in
mind the natural tendency towards a feeling of indignation at the conduct of a
person who, having struck another down, leaves him lying on the roadway and
flees from the scene. That Parliament takes a stern view of such conduct is
evidenced by the penalty prescribed by s. 221 (2) of the Criminal Code;
but the appellant was not on trial for an offence against that section.



In my
opinion the second question on which leave to appeal was granted should be
answered in the affirmative.



I would
allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a new trial.

Appeal dismissed,

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE
OF QUEBEC

Criminal
law—Accomplice—Misdirection—Corroboration—Improper statement of Crown counsel.

The appellant was convicted by a jury of having broken and
entered a garage and stolen property therein. His appeal was dismissed by the
Court of Appeal.

The Crown's case rested chiefly on the evidence of an
accomplice whom, according to the Crown's theory, the appellant had agreed to
drive to the locality of the crime for the purpose, known to the appellant, of
committing the crime. It is conceded that the accomplice did himself commit the
crime. The appellant's case was that he had driven the accomplice without any
knowledge of his guilty purpose, had left him at his destination and had
returned home alone. There was some evidence which was capable of being
regarded as corroboration of the evidence of the accomplice.

Held: The appeal should be allowed, the conviction
quashed and a new trial directed.

It was misdirection for the trial judge to charge the jury
with words from which they would normally understand that there lay an onus on
the appellant to satisfy them of his innocence.

The trial judge failed also to direct the jury adequately as
to the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice and
as to what constitutes corroboration; and particularly failed to explain that
facts although independently proved could not be regarded as corroborative of
the accomplice's evidence if they were equally consistent with the truth of the
appellant's evidence.

The trial judge failed also to point out to the jury what was
the theory of the defence and to tell them that they should acquit if, on all
the evidence, they entertained a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt.

The statement of Crown counsel in the presence of the jury
that he was going to have the appellant arrested for perjury on the following
morning or that afternoon, was improper and could scarcely fail to prejudice
the fair trial of the appellant.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench,
appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the conviction of the appellant.

J. Vernier for the appellant.

G. Normandin, Q.C. for the respondent.

[Page 96]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by:—

Cartwright J.:—The
appellant was convicted at his trial before Rhéaume J. and
a jury of having, during the night of October 26 to 27, 1953, broken and
entered the garage of Gaétan Poisson at Rougemont and
stolen therein property of the said Gaétan Poisson of the
value of about $125. His appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, was
dismissed by a unanimous judgment for which no written reasons were given.

Pursuant to section 1025 (1) of the Criminal Code leave
was granted to the appellant to appeal to this Court on the following questions
of law:—

1. Did the learned trial judge err in failing to direct the
jury correctly with reference to the burden resting upon the Crown to prove the
guilt of the appellant beyond any reasonable doubt?

2. Did the learned trial judge err (a) in failing to
direct the jury as to the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence
of an accomplice? (b) in failing to direct the jury that the Crown
witness Chaput was an accomplice or as to what, in law, constitutes an
accomplice? (c) in failing to direct the jury as to what constitutes
corroboration? (d) in failing to direct the jury that evidence which is
equally consistent with the evidence of an accomplice and that of the accused
is corroborative of neither?

3. Did the learned trial judge err in failing to place the
theory of the defence fully and fairly before the jury?

4. Did the learned trial judge err in failing to explain to
the jury the application of the law to the facts?

5. Was the appellant deprived of a trial according to law by
reason of the fact that at the conclusion of the evidence given by the
appellant in his defence the Crown counsel stated in the presence of the jury
that he was going to have the appellant arrested for perjury either on the
following morning or that afternoon?

At the conclusion of the hearing the Court gave judgment
allowing the appeal, quashing the conviction and directing a new trial and
stated that written reasons would be delivered in due course.

As there is to be a new trial I will refer to the facts and
the evidence only so far as is necessary to make clear what is involved in the
questions submitted for decision.

The case for the Crown was that the accused had agreed with
one René Chaput to. drive the latter from Montreal to
Rougemont for the purpose, made known to the accused at the time of the
agreement, of committing the crime charged and which it is conceded that Chaput
did himself commit. It is not suggested that the accused entered the garage or
ever had possession of any of the stolen articles. His alleged

[Page 97]

participation in the commission of the
offence consisted in driving Chaput to Rougemont with guilty knowledge of his
purpose. No doubt such participation would, if proved, be sufficient, under the
provisions of s. 69 (1) (b) of the Criminal Code, to render the
appellant guilty of the offence committed by Chaput. Driving Chaput under such
circumstances would be doing an act for the purpose of aiding him to commit the
offence.

The appellant's case was that he and Chaput were drinking
together in a tavern in Montreal on the evening of the crime, that he agreed to
drive Chaput to Rougemont for $5 which Chaput paid to him, that he left Chaput
at Rougemont and returned alone to Montreal and that he acted throughout
without any knowledge of Chaput's guilty purpose.

From this brief statement of the theories of the Crown and
of the defence it at once becomes obvious that the Crown's case rested chiefly
on the evidence of Chaput who was, on the Crown's theory, clearly an accomplice
of the appellant. It will be convenient to first set out all the passages in
the charge of the learned trial judge touching on (i) the onus resting upon the
prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused and the duty of the jury to give
the accused the benefit of any reasonable doubt, (ii) the way in which the jury
should approach the evidence of an accomplice, and (iii) the theory of the
defence.

The learned trial judge having said that the youth of
counsel for the accused at the trial would excuse him for a little exaggeration
continued:—

Je fais allusion à la question
du doute, quand il a dit que ""si vous avez le moindre
doute""; alors, je dis: ""Ce n'est pas tout à fait ce que nos tribunaux
exigent des jurés, ce n'est pas le moindre doute, c'est un doute sérieux,
raisonnable, qui doit être interprété en faveur de l'accusé.

The only other portion of the charge making any reference to the three above matters is as
follows:—

Maintenant, je vais me limiter aux questions
de droit. La Couronne a l'obligation de faire la preuve de l'accusation portée contre
l'accusé. C'est à vous de l'apprécier. Et là, la question du doute intervient.
Si vous avez un doute, un doute sérieux, non pas fantaisiste, mais un doute
raisonnable, alors votre devoir est d'en donner le bénéfice à l'accusé qui est
dans la boîte.

Maintenant, il est question de la preuve d'un
complice, dans cette cause-ci. Comme vous l'a fait remarquer le procureur de la
Couronne, il faut accepter le témoignage d'un complice sous réserve. Cependant,
la loi reconnaît un tel témoignage s'il est corroboré par des circonstances,
d'autres

[Page 98]

témoignages et des circonstances. Il vous
appartiendra de dire si les circonstances qui ont été placées devant vous
rendent vraisemblable la véracité du témoignage du complice en cette cause.

Maintenant, comment apprécier la preuve, je
laisse cela à votre entière liberté. Prenez d'abord l'expérience de la vie,
vous avez droit de vous en servir, et vous apprécierez la preuve selon les
dictées de votre conscience. Vous vous demanderez—il y a
certaines questions que vous avez droit de vous demander pour arriver à la
vérité—vous vous demanderez si les explications données
par l'accusé et par ses témoins vous ont satisfaits; vous vous demanderez
pourquoi ce voyage dans la nuit, qu'est-ce qui a motivé ce voyage dans la nuit,
et vous vous demanderez si là il n'y a pas une circonstance qui fortifie le
témoignage du complice.

As to the first point, it was argued
that the learned trial judge erred in using the adjective ""sérieux""
which he coupled with the adjective ""raisonnable""
whenever the latter was used. As to this it may be recalled that in the
reasons of the majority of the Court in Boucher v. The Queen 1,
the use of the word ""sérieux"" in place of the word ""raisonnable""
when describing that doubt the existence of which requires a jury to return a
verdict of not guilty was deprecated. However, the misdirection which, on this
point, appears to me to be fatal is that contained in the following sentence
and particularly in those words which I have italicized:—

… vous vous demanderez si les explications
données par l'accusé et par ses témoins vous ont satisfaits; …

From these words the jury would normally understand
that there lay an onus on the appellant to satisfy them of his innocence.

Turning now to the second ground of appeal, it is obvious
that on the Crown's theory Chaput was an accomplice. There is to be found in
the record some evidence which, if they believed it, the jury might regard as
corroboration of that of Chaput. Under the circumstances of this case it was the
duty of the learned trial judge; (i) to tell the jury that it is always
dangerous to convict an accused on the uncorroborated evidence of an
accomplice, although it is within their legal province to do so; (ii) to tell
them that Chaput was an accomplice; while in doubtful cases the Judge will
instruct the jury as to what in law constitutes an accomplice and leave it to
them to say whether a particular witness is or is not an accomplice, in the
case at bar this point was not in issue; (iii) to explain to the jury what is
meant by

[Page 99]

the term corroboration; the classic statement as to this is
found in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Baskerville
2:

We hold that evidence in corroboration must be independent
testimony which affects the accused by connecting or tending to connect him
with the crime. In other words, it must be evidence which implicates him, that
is, which confirms in some material particular not only the evidence that the
crime has been committed, but also that the prisoner committed it. The test
applicable to determine the nature and extent of the corroboration is thus the
same whether the case falls within the rule of practice at common law or within
that class of offences for which corroboration is required by statute. The
language of the statute, ""implicates the accused"", compendiously
incorporates the test applicable at common law in the rule of practice. The
nature of the corroboration will necessarily vary according to the particular
circumstances of the offence charged. It would be in high degree dangerous to
attempt to formulate the kind of evidence which would be regarded as
corroboration, except to say that corroborative evidence is evidence which
shows or tends to show that the story of the accomplice that the accused
committed the crime is true, not merely that the crime has been committed, but
that it was committed by the accused.

The corroboration need not be direct evidence that the
accused committed the crime; it is sufficient if it is merely circumstantial
evidence of his connection with the crime.

This statement has been repeatedly approved in this
Court. See, for example, Hubin v. The King 3, Thomas
v. The Queen 4 and Manos v. The Queen 5.
The learned trial judge should have directed the jury in the sense of this
passage and particularly should have made it plain to them that facts although
independently proved could not be regarded as corroborative of Chaput's
evidence if they were equally consistent with the truth of the evidence of the
appellant. As to the first of these requirements the direction of the learned
judge:—""il faut accepter le témoignage
d'un complice sous réserve."" was inadequate; as to the remaining
two nothing was said. The concluding sentence from the portions of the charge
quoted above:—""Vous vous demanderez pourquoi ce voyage dans
la nuit, qu'est-ce qui a motivé ce voyage dans la nuit, et vous vous demanderez
si là il n'y a pas une circonstance qui fortifie le témoignage du
complice."" is not helpful. It was common ground that the journey to
Rougemont was made in the night and that admitted fact was equally consistent
with the theory of the Crown and with that of the defence.

[Page 100]

The third and fourth grounds of appeal may be dealt with
together. The theory of the defence was simple enough and no elaborate
direction was called for; it was however incumbent on the learned trial judge
to point out to the jury that this theory was that the appellant drove Chaput
to Rougemont because he was asked and paid to do so and
that he was ignorant of Chaput's guilty purpose, and to tell them that they
should acquit if, on all the evidence, they entertained a reasonable doubt of
the appellant's guilt.

As to the fifth ground of appeal, the record shews that at
the conclusion of the appellant's cross-examination he was being questioned as
to the number of occasions during the night in question on which he had been
stopped and questioned by the police. The police officers had testified that
there were three such occasions and the appellant that there were only two, one
on the way to Rougemont and one on his return journey. The cross-examination
concluded as follows :—

D      Mais, vous les avez vus une deuxième
fois en revenant, arrêté dans une petite rue à Marieville?

R Non, ils m'ont arrêté seulement une fois en
descendant.

D       Et là, on vous aurait demandé
qu'est-ce que vous faisiez dans ce bout-là, qu'est-ce que vous cherchiez?

R      Non, il n'a pas été question de ça.

D      Vous leur auriez répondu : ""Je cherche mon chum qui est débarqué dans une rue, je ne le trouve
pas""?

R      Il n'a pas été question de ça.

D      Vous jurez que c'est faux?

R      Je jure ça.

D      Deux officiers de police sont venus
jurer, cet avant-midi, et vous jurez que c'est faux?

R      Moi, je dis que je les ai vus seulement
une fois en descendant.

D      Je vais vous faire arrêter pour
parjure, demain matin.

R      C'est correct.

D      Peut-être cet après-midi.

It will be observed that the last two
""questions"" by the learned counsel for the Crown are not questions at
all; they are threats or statements of his intention, which it was improper for
him to make, and the making of which before the jury could scarcely fail to
prejudice the fair trial of the accused.

[Page 101]

For the above reasons, I would allow the appeal, quash the
conviction and direct a new trial.

Appeal allowed; new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal Law—Murder—Conspiracy
to Rob—Minimum force to be used—Death by strangulation at hands of one
assailant—Liability of other—Jury, adequacy of charge—Whether furnishing jury
with transcript of part of charge prejudicial to accused—Criminal Code, ss. 69(1),
(2), 260(a), (c), 1014(2).

The appellant with three others conspired to rob a
storekeeper. It was agreed that no weapons would be used and only the amount of
force required to overcome such resistance as might be offered. The appellant
seized the storekeeper from behind, placing a hand over his mouth and an arm
around his throat and then hit him on the head with a can of meat. The victim
was still struggling when the appellant handed him to an accomplice and started
searching for money. The only evidence of what then happened was that of the
appellant who stated his accomplice told him he had put his knee against the
storekeeper's throat. The appellant and the accomplice were both charged with
murder and tried separately. The appellant appealed his conviction.

Held by Kerwin C.J., Rand, Estey and Cartwright JJ.
(Taschereau, Locke and Fauteux JJ. dissenting): 1. That the giving to the jury
of a transcript of only a portion of the trial judge's charge, which emphasized
the Crown's case but did not set out the theory of the defence, was in the
circumstances such an irregularity as to justify a new trial.

2. That a new trial should also be directed because the judge
in summarizing the law as related to the facts omitted to direct the jury that:
(a) the appellant could only be a party to the offence of murder under
s. 69 (1) of the Criminal Code if the jury thought that the accomplice
had committed the murder and that the appellant had

[Page 102]

aided or abetted him; (b) that under s. 69 (2) the
appellant would be guilty only if the commission of the murder was known or
ought to have been known to him to be a probable consequence of the prosecution
of robbery.

Per Taschereau and Locke JJ. (dissenting): The
appellant on his own testimony was ready to overcome any fight put up and s.
260 (a) and (c) of the Code therefore applied and, as a
result of their combined effect and of s. 69 (1), the killing amounted to
murder. The appellant was guilty of abetting and procuring the commission of
the crime if the strangulation was imputed to his accomplice and by virtue of
s. 260 (c) if he himself stopped the breath of the victim. The jury was
properly charged and directed and permitting it to take a portion of the
judge's charge into the jury room could not vitiate the trial. It was open to
it to ask for additional oral instructions which would have had the same result
and which not only would have been proper but imperative for the judge to
furnish.

Per Locke and Fauteux JJ. (dissenting): On the
appellant's own testimony, the nature of the agreement and the manner in which
it was executed are clear. The violence to be exerted was to be measured by the
resistance of the victim. The appellant was the first to resort to violence and
the injuries he inflicted, first alone and then with the assistance of his
accomplice, amounted to grievous bodily injury as defined under the
authorities. At that moment, both parties were then of one mind and there is
nothing to suggest that when, in order to search the premises, the appellant
handed over the victim to his accomplice, this situation was changed. The
appellant left it to his accomplice to overcome their victim, and even if the
blows then inflicted by the latter were ill-measured, the appellant is
nonetheless a party thereto. The case comes squarely under the law as laid down
in ss. 260 and 69 (1) and is a proper one for the application of s. 1014(2). Beard's
case [1920] A.C. 470, followed, The King v. Hughes [1924] S.C.R.
517, distinguished.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1]
affirming the conviction of the appellant on a charge of murder. O'Halloran and
Davey JJ. A., dissented; the former would have substituted a conviction for manslaughter,
the latter, a new trial. The appellant was tried separately on a charge of
joining with three others in committing murder. In separate trials one of the
other three was convicted of murder, one acquitted and the Crown did not
proceed against the third.

and F. C. Munroe for the appellant.

L. H. Jackson and W. G.
Burke-Robertson, Q.C. for the respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—I agree with
Mr. Justice Estey.

[Page 103]

TASCHEREAU J. (dissenting):—The
charge against the appellant is:

THAT at the City of
Vancouver, on the Sixth day of January, in the year of our Lord, one thousand
nine hundred and fifty-five, he, the said Donald Keith Cathro, together with
Eng Git Lee, Chow Bew and Richard Wong, unlawfully did murder Young Gai Wah,
otherwise known as Ah Wing, against the form of the Statute in such case made
and provided and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her Crown and
Dignity.

He was tried by Mr. Justice
Manson and a jury, was found guilty and sentenced to death. His appeal was
dismissed by the Court of Appeal of British
 Columbia[2], O'Halloran J.A. and Davey J.A. dissenting. The
former would have substituted a verdict of manslaughter, and the latter would
have ordered a new trial. No charge was laid against Richard Wong, Eng Git Lee
was acquitted, and the present appellant and Chow Bew were found guilty. Mr.
Justice Manson granted separate trials.

The evidence reveals that on the
6th of January, 1955, the appellant was approached by Bew, whom he did not
know. Bew explained to him there was an old Chinese by the name of Ah Wing,
owner of the MacDonald Market on MacDonald Street, and that ""it would be
easy"", and in his evidence given on his own behalf, the appellant says
that he knew ""pretty well what he meant"". At nine o'clock that
night the appellant met Chow Bew, who was in a parked car with two friends in
it, namely, Eng Git Lee who was driving the car, and Richard Wong sitting in
front next to him. On the way to the restaurant, they discussed how to enter
the premises, and the appellant was told that the Chinese had $5,000 in his
store. They were familiar with the place where the money was, because two of
them had been there previously to change a large bill, and Ah Wing had gone to
the back of the store to make the change for them. The appellant was also told
that the Chinese was an elderly man and ""that there would be no trouble
about it"". He was informed ""that there would be no violence"" and
that none of his companions ""had any weapons or any club or anything of
that kind"". He nevertheless said that if the Chinaman ""put up a
fight"", ""he was going to do just what he did"", and ""that
whatever fight the old man would put up he was ready to overcome it"".

[Page 104]

When they arrived at the
restaurant, they parked their automobile across the street, waiting for the
shop to close. They then moved the car around the corner and the appellant went
in first. Several customers came in and left, and the appellant bought a
""coke"" and some other minor articles. The appellant helped Ah Wing to
find a dentist's address and, as planned, when Bew came in, he asked the
deceased for a can of meat, and when the Chinaman went to the back of the store
to get the meat, the appellant put his arm around him and ""took him into
the backroom"". Chow Bew unlocked the backdoor and put out the lights. A
struggle ensued and the appellant told him that if he did not keep quiet he
would hurt him. The deceased kept making a noise, so the appellant hit him on
the head with a can of meat, and Wing started to yell putting up a good fight.

The appellant told Bew to get a
flashlight and Chow Bew hit Wing with it. Bew tried to ""wad"" a cloth
in the deceased's mouth so to stop him from yelling, but without success. The
appellant then told Bew to hold the Chinese while he would look around for the
money. The Chinaman was lying on the floor. They took a few bills from his
pockets and when they heard somebody coming at the front door, they ran out
through the back door to the waiting car.

The medical evidence reveals that
the deceased had a minor cut over the right eye, scratch on the lips, a cut on
the right side of the tongue from which there had been some bleeding. The skin
of the chin and upper neck had a rubbed appearance, as though a rough cloth had
been rubbed across the skin and there were several abrasions on the right side
of the neck. The examination of the throat showed hemorrhage or bruising into
the muscles of the neck. There was a fracture of the voice box with hemorrhage.
There was obviously strangulation, and the pressure applied to the neck must
have been very severe in order to fracture the voice box.

In his evidence given on his own
behalf, the appellant swears that the deceased was alive when Bew ""took
charge of him"". Very soon after, the four companions were arrested down
town by the police, after the deceased had been found dead in his shop. They
were in possession of

[Page 105]

an old cigar box, that belonged
to the deceased, in which there was a small amount of money. The appellant
admits that he agreed with Bew, Lee and Wong to join in the robbery of the
grocery store operated by Wing.

The appellant now appeals to this
Court alleging that the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia,
in dismissing the appeal is erroneous and ought to be set aside on the
following grounds:—

1. In not holding that the
learned trial judge failed to present the defence to the jury fairly, fully and
adequately, in a way that would have brought out its full force and effect, and
particularly in failing to fully and properly direct the jury as to a possible
verdict of manslaughter.

2. The learned trial judge
permitted the jury during their deliberations to take with them into the jury-room
a transcript of a portion of his charge, said transcript containing a powerful exposition
of the Crown's case, and including misdirection upon the law to which the
defence counsel had objected, and remarks which directed the jury's attention
to weaknesses in the defence, and not containing that part of the charge in
which the learned trial judge explained the case for the defence to the jury.

3. The learned trial judge
told the jury that a verdict of guilty, by the exercise of executive clemency,
may not result in the carrying out of the death sentence.

4. The learned trial judge
misdirected the jury on evaluating credibility and on determining the weight of
evidence, particularly by repeated reference to the interest of the appellant
in the verdict.

5. The learned trial judge
erred in curtailing cross—examination of the Crown witness Det. Sgt.
McCullough.

6. The learned trial judge
instructed the jury that their verdict ""must be unanimous"" and
""must be arrived at"" without also saying ""if you can agree upon
a verdict"".

For the purpose of the
determination of this case, it will be necessary to deal only with grounds 1, 2
and 4, as there has been no dissent in the Court of Appeal on grounds 3, 5 and
6, and no special leave to appeal has been granted on these points.

It is clear as revealed by
appellant's own evidence that he, with the others, joined a conspiracy with a
common intention to commit robbery, and that although the appellant was
told that there would be no violence, he was ready to overcome any fight that
the Chinaman would put, and that he was also prepared to do just what he has
done. It is also in evidence that when the robbery was planned between the
appellant and the others, the fear of trouble from neighbours was discussed,
and in his statement to the Police of January 10, 1955, he said he knew

[Page 106]

that the beauty-parlor next door,
""was run by two women"", and that they would ""give no
trouble"". This, to my mind, is a clear indication of what the intention of
the appellant and the others was.

The law on the matter is clear,
and s-ss. (a) and (c) of s. 260 of the Criminal Code find
here their application. These section and sub-sections are to the effect that
in case of treason, piracy, escape or rescue from prison or lawful custody,
resisting lawful apprehension, murder, rape, forcible abduction, robbery,
burglary or arson, culpable homicide is also murder, whether the offender means
or not death to ensue, or knows or not that death is likely to ensue, if the
offender meant to inflict grievous bodily injury for the purpose of
facilitating the commission of any of the above mentioned offences, or if by
any means he wilfully stops the breath of any person for either of the purposes
above mentioned, and death ensues.

I have no hesitation in reaching
the conclusion that as a result of the combined effect of s. 260 (a), (c)
Cr. C. and of s. 69 (1) Cr. C. the killing of the Chinaman amounts to murder.
As stated above, it is in evidence that death was due to strangulation. It is
also my opinion that the jury could not reasonably find, in view of the
evidence, that the two assailants were not prepared to inflict grievous bodily
injury, for the purpose of facilitating the commission of the offence of
robbery. In such a case, it is immaterial that they meant or not death to
ensue, or knew or not that death would likely ensue.

It necessarily follows that by
virtue of s. 69 (1) Cr. C., the appellant is guilty of the offence for abetting
and procuring the commission of the crime, if the strangulation is imputed to
Bew, and by virtue of s. 260 (c) if he himself stopped the breath of the
victim. In my opinion, there was no room for a verdict of manslaughter, and it
was unnecessary for the trial judge in his charge to the jury to deal with this
feature of the case. It is, therefore, quite irrelevant if his instructions on
this point were inadequate. It was not necessary for the judge, as stated in Manchuk
v. The King [3], to
tell them that if as a result of the evidence as a whole, they were in
reasonable doubt

[Page 107]

whether the crime was murder or
manslaughter, they should convict of manslaughter. Nothing in the evidence
would justify a verdict of manslaughter.

The case of Rex v. Hughes
[4]
has no application. In that case, the learned trial judge told the jurors that
the only possible verdict could be murder or acquittal, and completely eliminated
the possible verdict of manslaughter. There were evidence however to show that
the shot that killed Hughes went off accidentally, and it was found by this
Court that it could not be said as a matter of law that this was an act of
violence done by the accused in furtherance of, or in the course of the crime
of robbery as held by the House of Lords in Director of Public Prosecutions
v. Beard [5] and in Rex
v. Elnick [6].
Moreover, the law as it stood at the time of the Hughes decision given in 1942,
was not the same as it is now, as s. 260 was amended in 1947 (Statutes of
Canada, c. 55, articles 6 and 7) to cover the Hughes case, and paragraph (d)
was added to the section.

I believe that the jury were
properly charged, in view of ss. 260 (a). (c) and 69 (1) Cr. C.
It has been argued that the jury should have been instructed that the act done
was the probable consequence of the common purpose, and that it was known, or
ought to have been known to the appellant that such consequence was probable.
Sections 260 (a) (c) and 69 (1) Cr. C. negative these
propositions, and I do not think they can prevail. They have their foundation
on ss. 69 (d) and 69 (2) of the Criminal Code, but they totally ignore
s. 260 (a) and (c), which clearly hold one or the other liable
although he did not mean death to ensue, and also s. 69 (1). A party to an
offence is a person who not only counsels, but abets or procures
another to commit a crime. Such is the present case, and it is immaterial
therefore that the appellant knew or ought to have known that the death of Ah
Wing by strangulation, was a probable consequence of the prosecution of the
common purpose.

If the opposite view should
prevail, and if a new trial were ordered, I cannot imagine how the trial judge
could logically instruct the jury. He would of course have to

[Page 108]

tell them that under s. 260 (c)
Cr. C., in case of robbery, culpable homicide is murder whether the
offender means or not death to ensue, if he wilfully stops the breath of
the deceased. He would also have to instruct them, by virtue of s. 69 (2), that
if the accused knew or ought to have known that the killing of the
victim was a probable consequence of the common purpose, he was guilty of
murder. That, to my mind, would constitute a flagrant contradiction. Section 69
(2), I think, contemplates an entirely different case. It would apply, for
instance, if two persons formed the common intention of committing the crime of
forgery, and one of the offenders killed a police officer with a hidden weapon,
the possession of which was unknown to the other. In such a case, it could
surely be said as an excuse; that he did not know or ought not to have known
that the killing was a probable consequence of the common purpose of forgery.

I also believe that the fourth
ground of error raised by the appellant is unfounded. It is my view that the
learned trial judge properly directed the jury in evaluating credibility, and
in determining the weight of evidence.

The last ground of appeal raised,
and on which there was a dissent, is that the learned trial judge allowed the
jury during their deliberations, to take with them into the jury—room a
transcript of a portion of his charge. I do not think that this can vitiate in
any way the trial. It is open to the jury to ask for whatever information they
desire, and instead of being furnished with a part of the written address, they
could have asked the trial judge for additional oral instructions which would
have had the same result, and it would have been not only proper, but imperative
upon the judge to furnish all this information. That the additional
instructions were written instead of verbal, does not appear to me to have the
effect of invalidating the verdict.

I would dismiss the appeal.

RAND J.: — The ground of dissent in which O'Halloran and
Davey JJ.A. concurred was this. At the request of the jury, a transcript of a
portion of the charge was furnished them which they retained during their
deliberation;

[Page 109]

it consisted in large measure of
a forceful statement of the Crown's case and, in the opinion of these justices,
it so overshadowed the defence as to obscure it.

The essence of the latter was
that the death had been caused by an offence which was not ""a probable
consequence"" in the prosecution of the robbery as required by s. 69 (2) of
the Criminal Code, a requirement which seems to differentiate our law in
respect of joint wrongdoers from that of England. The accused took the stand
and gave evidence to the effect that the death could only have been caused
while he was searching the premises for the money and the deceased was in the
hands of the accomplice Bew. In the light of the violence of the force applied
as indicated by its effects on the larynx, its mode of application was
suggested by an alleged remark of Bew to the accused that he had put his knee
on the victim's throat. It was also asserted by the accused that it had been
expressly agreed that no force would be used beyond preventing the outcry of a
small man of 65 years who was considered, apparently, to be unable to put up
much resistance. Admittedly there were no weapons, although the accused, who
for the first minute or so had tried to smother the noise by putting his right
arm around the neck of the deceased and his left hand over his mouth, had
struck the latter on the head with a can picked up in the shop, a blow which
could have been found to have played no part in inflicting the ""grievous
bodily harm"" or in the death. The truth of the whole or any part of this
account, which is the only evidence of what actually took place in the shop,
was for the jury. It was likewise for them, in the event of their believing it
and in the light of the evidence as a whole, uninfluenced by overemphasis on
any feature of it, to say whether the infliction of the grievous bodily harm or
the strangulation by Bew was a ""probable consequence"" of the
prosecution of the robbery. I am unable to say that the jury could not have
found that it was not. They might equally have entertained a reasonable doubt
that it was. They could, on the other hand, have come to the conclusion that
the act either of that harm or strangulation was such a probability, but that
determination was for them.

[Page 110]

I cannot agree, however, with
O'Halloran J.A. that in this aspect we can substitute a verdict of
manslaughter. S. 69 (2) means, in my opinion, this: the offence, here the
culpable homicide under either paras. (a) or (c) of s. 260, which
must be a ""probable consequence"" of carrying out the criminal plan of
several persons, in this case robbery, must be such as severs the connection of
the person not otherwise associated with it than by the original scheme. The
accused and his companion, Bew, undoubtedly intended force to be applied to
their victim; but was there such an excess in mode or degree as converted it
into an act and an offence so outrageous or so unforeseeable as to be beyond
the scope of probable consequence? On that question—which, by the charge, had
been placed in doubtful adequacy before the jury—the transcript could easily
have been the decisive factor.

I agree, therefore, with the
dissenting justices and would order a new trial.

ESTEY J.:—The appellant's
conviction for murder was affirmed by a majority of the learned judges in the
Appellate Court of British Columbia. Mr. Justice O'Halloran, dissenting, would
have substituted a verdict of manslaughter, while Mr. Justice Davey, also
dissenting, would have awarded a new trial.

The appellant, in giving evidence
on his own behalf, admitted that he, Chow Bew and two others, in the afternoon
of January 6, 1955, had agreed to rob the deceased Ah Wing that night
at his store in Vancouver. About 9:30 that evening the four proceeded in an
automobile and parked at a place near the store of the deceased. Ah Wing was a
Chinaman about sixty-five years of age whom they referred to as an old man who
would not offer much resistance. Though they were without weapons, they were
prepared to exercise physical strength in order to overcome such resistance as
the deceased might offer. Only two of the four entered the store and, while in
the course of their intent to rob, such force was applied to the person of the
deceased, by the appellant and Chow Bew or one of them, as to cause his death.

The appellant admitted that, as
arranged, he entered the store first and in a matter of minutes Chow Bew

[Page 111]

entered. When there were no
customers present the appellant asked the deceased for a can of meat which he
knew would be toward the back of the store. In order to obtain this can the
deceased turned his back upon the appellant, who thereupon put his hand over
his mouth and an arm around his neck. At the same time Chow Bew put out the
lights, locked the front and opened the back door. They were in the store
approximately ten minutes and at some point appellant handed the deceased over
to Chow Bew. At that time, the appellant deposed, the deceased was struggling
and endeavouring to make a noise and was doing the same when later, while Chow
Bew was still holding him, the appellant searched his person for money. The appellant
further stated that when Chow Bew took over the deceased he searched the
premises for money and, as the store was in darkness, he did not know what Chow
Bew was doing to the deceased and, because of their understanding that they
would not cause serious bodily harm to the deceased, he neither knew nor ought
to have known that the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon, or the wilful
stopping of the breath of Ah Wing was a probable consequence of what Chow Bew
did to the deceased.

Under s. 260 of the Criminal
Code, so far as its provisions are relevant to the facts in this case, one
in the course of committing a robbery will be guilty of murder, whether he knew
or ought to have known that death was likely to ensue, if he means to inflict
grievous bodily injury for the purpose of facilitating the commission of the
robbery and death ensues, or if he, by any means, wilfully stops the breath of
a person in order to facilitate the commission of the offence and death ensues
from such stoppage. Under this section it was open to the jury to find that the
appellant's participation was such that he was guilty of murder.

However, the main contentions
advanced on behalf of the appellant were that Chow Bew had inflicted the fatal
injury (although based on what the appellant alleged had been told him by Bew)
and that he was not a party to the murder as a participant under s. 260, nor
was he made so by virtue of the provisions of s-ss. (1) and (2) of s. 69. Under
s-s. (1) (s. 69), if the appellant did or omitted

[Page 112]

some act for the purpose of
aiding Chow Bew to commit the offence of murder, or abetted Chow Bew in the
commission of that offence, the jury might find the appellant guilty of murder.
It was, however, the contention on behalf of the appellant that, however much
he may have aided and abetted in the commission of the robbery, he never did
aid or abet, or in any way assist Chow Bew in the commission of the murder
within the meaning of s. 69 (1).

Under s-s. (2) (s. 69), if, as
here, the appellant and Chow Bew had formed a common intention to rob Ah Wing
and, while assisting each other in the prosecution of that robbery, Chow Bew
murdered Ah Wing, the appellant would be a party to the offence of murder if
the commission thereof was, or ought to have been known by him to be a probable
consequence of the prosecution of such robbery. I agree with the appellant that
these subsections ought to have been explained in such a manner that the jury
would understand the difference between the two and the respective effects
thereof in relation to the facts as adduced in evidence.

There was evidence in support of
issues under the foregoing sections which counsel for both parties apparently
discussed and certainly were dealt with by the learned trial judge in the
course of his charge. The learned trial judge, at the outset of his charge,
explained the functions of the jury, presumption of innocence, reasonable doubt
and other matters, and then devoted approximately twelve pages to a discussion
of the relevant statute law, including the foregoing ss. 260 and 69. In the
course thereof he selected the relevant portions of the sections and, in
illustrating their general effect, referred to parts of the evidence.
Thereafter in about eighteen pages, he discussed the evidence as given by the
respective witnesses. At the end thereof, and before discussing the evidence
and the issues raised on behalf of the appellant, the learned judge deemed it
advisable to summarize the law that he had explained in the earlier part of his
charge.

I am in agreement with the
learned trial judge that where, as here, he had discussed the law, with some
reference to the facts, followed by a rather lengthly review of the evidence,
the law should be restated and summarized

[Page 113]

in relation to the facts in a
manner to enable the jury to appreciate the issues upon which they had to
decide. That the law should be so related to the facts has often been a matter
of discussion in the decided cases, not only in this, but in other courts, and
more recently in this Court in Azoulay v. The Queen [7].
It may be added that this can seldom be accomplished by first a discussion of
the law followed by a review of the evidence, unless there is some restatement,
or summary, that will relate the law and the facts, as contemplated under the
authorities. It would seem, and with great respect to the learned trial judge,
that in his summary these two sub-sections of s. 69 were not sufficiently
distinguished in relation to the facts. In particular, the summary did not
include a statement to the effect that the appellant could only be a party to
the offence of murder under s-s (1) of s. 69 if the jury thought Chow Bew had
committed the murder and the appellant had aided or abetted Chow Bew in the
commission of the murder, and that under s-s. (2) of s. 69 the appellant would
be guilty only if the commission of the murder was known or ought to have been
known by him to be a probable consequence of the prosecution of the robbery.
These omissions were upon matters so vital in this prosecution as to largely
nullify the purpose of the summary. Indeed the remarks of my Lord the Chief
Justice (then Kerwin J.) are particularly appropriate:

However, while the general
statement of the law of conspiracy made by the trial Judge may be unimpeachable,
it was of the utmost importance in this case that the application of the law to
the facts should be explained fully to the jury, particularly so far as the
evidence relating to Carson's activities was concerned. Forsythe v. The
King [8].

It would, therefore, seem that
because of these omissions the law was not related to the facts in respect of
these vital issues, as required by the authorities. Moreover, from the
appellant's point of view, these omissions prevented his case being fully
presented to the jury. It, therefore, follows that a new trial must be
directed. There were a number of other points raised with respect to the
charge, but, inasmuch as there must be a new trial in which many of these may
never arise, it seems unnecessary that they should be here discussed.

[Page 114]

I am also in agreement with Mr.
Justice Davey that giving to the jury a portion of the learned trial judge's
charge constituted, in the circumstances, such an irregularity as to justify a
new trial. At the conclusion of the learned trial judge's address the jury
retired and were recalled when the learned judge supplemented the instructions
he had already given. At the conclusion thereof the foreman of the jury
requested a copy of the remarks made by his Lordship with respect to the law
prior to the hearing of any of the witnesses. When his Lordship intimated that
such would have to be considered in the light of his further instructions, the
foreman stated: ""Maybe we could have the section you read this
morning."" The word ""section"" had reference to that portion of
the learned judge's charge dealing more particularly with the law. While
counsel for the Crown concurred, counsel for the defence at once pointed out
that this section contained a direction which the learned judge had supplemented
in his further instructions and, notwithstanding that his Lordship stated that
he would repeat the additional remarks in handing this portion to the jury,
counsel for the appellant said he could not consent to this portion of the
charge being handed to the jury. His Lordship felt that he should accede to the
request of the jury and accordingly that portion of his charge dealing with the
law, with such reference to the evidence as he deemed appropriate to explain
and illustrate the respective sections, was extended and placed in the hands of
the jury, together with the comment repeated by the learned trial judge as
above mentioned.

At the conclusion of the portion
so extended his Lordship dealt at length with the evidence and made some
further observations with respect to the law. This latter part constituted a
larger portion of the charge than that handed to the jury. It is well
established that a charge must be considered as a whole. With this in mind, it
seems impossible to conclude otherwise than that the jury, in the course of
their deliberations, would inevitably give more weight to the portion
transcribed than to that part which they had heard but verbally expressed in
the court room. Moreover, in this particular case there was that portion which
counsel for the defence had discussed at the

[Page 115]

end of the learned trial judge's
charge and upon which the learned judge made further comment, which he repeated
to the jury as he handed them the typewritten portion. It would, therefore,
seem, as a matter of principle, that a part of a charge should not be handed to
the jury.

No case was cited in support of
such a portion being handed to the jury. There are jurisdictions in the United States
where the practice of delivering a copy of the judge's charge to the jury is
recognized by statute. In other jurisdictions it seems to be permissible, even
without a statute, and in that country there is authority for the giving of a
copy of a penal section of the law to the jury, but there does not seem to be any
decision which would support the view that a substantial portion of the charge
could be delivered to the jury.

It may be that a section of the Code,
or even a small passage of a learned trial judge's charge, with the consent of
counsel concerned, may be handed to the jury, but even then the question must
remain whether, in the circumstances, there has been prejudice or miscarriage
of justice. Where, however, as here, the transcribed part of the charge
contains important references to the evidence and contentions made on behalf of
the Crown, and but slight reference to the evidence and none to the contentions
on behalf of the defence, there can be no doubt but that the giving of such a
portion to the jury ought not to be permitted.

The learned trial judge, discussing
the duty of the jury to arrive at a fair and just conclusion, warned them that
sympathy ought not to be a factor in their deliberations and went on to call
their attention to the fact that sympathy might have a place in a consideration
of executive clemency. At the conclusion of his charge counsel for the defence
took the position that from his Lordship's remarks with respect to executive
clemency the jury might conclude that he was of the opinion that this was a
case in which a conviction should be found and executive clemency exercised.
The learned trial judge, as a result of this comment, dealt further with it in
his supplementary instructions to the jury and stated that he was not in any
way suggesting what their verdict should be, or any view on his part that an
""occasion might arise for an application for such clemency."" Sir
Lyman Duff, in commenting upon a reference

[Page 116]

to executive clemency in the
course of a charge to the jury, described such as ""unfortunate"" and
concluded his remarks as follows:

Such a reference could not
assist the jury in performing their duty to decide the issue of fact before
them, and there is always some risk that a suggestion that the verdict is to be
reviewed may result in some abatement of the deep sense of responsibility with
which a jury ought to be brought to regard their duty in passing upon any
criminal charge, and, preeminently, when the offence charged is murder, to
which the law attaches the capital penalty. McLean v. The King [9].

In this case the Court concluded
that no substantial harm or miscarriage resulted and, in view of the fact that
here a new trial is directed, it is unnecessary to do more than to repeat the
warning expressed by Sir Lyman Duff.

The appeal should be allowed, the
conviction quashed and a new trial directed.

LOCKE J. (dissenting):—I agree
with my brothers Taschereau and Fauteux and would dismiss this appeal.

CARTWRIGHT J.:—For the reasons
given by my brothers Rand and Estey I would allow the appeal, quash the
conviction and direct a new trial.

FAUTEUX J. (dissenting):—On the
6th of January, 1955, at the city of Vancouver, Ah Wing, a grocer of about
sixty-five years of age, was murdered in his store while resisting the
commission of a robbery perpetrated actually by both the appellant and one Chow
Bew, pending which their accomplices stood ready, outside of the store, for the
flight in an automobile; intending thereafter to share amongst themselves five
thousand dollars of savings anticipated by them to be found in possession of their
victim.

Cathro and Bew each had a
separate trial and were found guilty of murder. These verdicts were upheld by
majority judgments of the Court of Appeal. We are only concerned here with the
case of Cathro.

The substance of the principal
grounds of appeal, upon which there was a dissent, is related to the
instructions of the trial Judge.

[Page 117]

I agree with Robertson and Bird
JJ.A., that a verdict of manslaughter was not open to the jury in this case.
Furthermore and—assuming the presence of certain illegalities—on a careful
consideration of the evidence, and particularly of the testimony falling from
the very lips of the appellant, who was the only one of the group to testify, I
also agree with these two members of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia
that this is a proper case, if any, for the application of section 1014(2).

In Beard's case [10],
it was proved that there was a violent struggle in which the accused
overpowered a child and stifled her cries by putting his hand over her mouth
and pressing his thumb upon her throat, the acts which, in her weakened state
resulting from the struggle, killed her. This, the House of Lords held, was
murder, although the accused had no intention of causing death. In this
country, as stated at page 524, by the then Chief Justice of this Court, Sir
Lyman Duff, who delivered the uananimous judgment for the Court, in The King
v. Hughes et al[11],
""a charge arising out of circumstances such as those considered in the Beard's
case, would be disposed of under the law laid down in s. 260 of the Criminal
Code."" The parts of this section relevant to the present case read:—

260. In case of …robbery …culpable
homicide is also murder, whether the offender means or not death to ensue, or
knows or not that death is likely to ensue.

(a) if he means to
inflict grievous bodily injury for the purpose of facilitating the commission
of any of the offences in this section mentioned, …and death ensues from such
injury; or

 ***

(c) if he by any
means wilfully stops the breath of any person for either of the purposes
aforesaid, and death ensues from such stopping of the breath.

Were there, in this case, but a
single offender implicated in the robbery and the material facts leading to the
death of Ah Wing, a verdict of murder could be the only proper one which a
reasonable jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, could render; for
the proof of the constituent elements of the substantive offence created under
s. 260 is beyond doubt; death did ensue from grievous bodily injury meant and inflicted
for the purpose of facilitating the commission of robbery.

[Page 118]

However, because there is, in the
present case, a plurality of offenders, and though both Cathro and Bew, acting
individually as well as together, had a hand in the infliction of violence to
advance their criminal and common purpose, the following submission is made, in
the present appeal, on behalf of Cathro. The original agreement, it is
contended, was that there would be no violence; strangulation, which was the
cause of death, might, on one view of the medical evidence, have resulted from
the acts of violence which Cathro—through evidence of doubtful admissibility—attempts
to ascribe to Bew, rather than from the acts of violence which he admitted
having committed; the acts of Bew would then be beyond the scope of the
agreement; with the consequence that Cathro, having had, directly or by
complicity, no part in the infliction of the fatal injury, could not be held
guilty under s. 260.

The agreement. Of the agreement
there is no other evidence than (i) what Cathro said it was and (ii) what, from
the subsequent conduct of the parties in the store, as related by Cathro, is to
be deduced.

(i) There was, of course, a clear
agreement to rob the store owner of the five thousand dollars of savings he was
estimated by them to possess. As to the means to be used to achieve this end,
Cathro, in his examination in chief, says:—

On the way to the store,
they more or less discussed the situation, told me what it was all about, the
other surrounding buildings, they said he was an old man and there wouldn't be
no trouble, there was no necessity of any violence.

And later he repeats:—

A Yes, I asked them if they
had any weapon, anything to hit him with, or anything, and they said: No, there
wasn't, there was no need of it.

Q And no such thing was
carried?

A We understood before we
went out there, that there would be no violence.

Whether this is tantamount to a
restrictive agreement as to the means or rather to a simple understanding as to
the anticipated measure of means to be used in the circumstances, it rested on
an alleged expectancy that there would be no trouble, no necessity for
violence. However, at no time, during the preparation of the plan,—or its
actual execution, as will be seen later—was an abandonment of 

[Page 119]

the plan followed by an immediate
withdrawal from the premises, even thought of as being the conduct to adopt in
the event of resistance and necessity for violence arising and developing, as
indeed it did to culminate into death. On the contrary, on Cathro's own
evidence, notwithstanding his declaration that he had no intention to hurt,
what was then to be done, failing the materialization of the expectancy, was
not left in doubt. Pressed, in cross-examination, Cathro admitted the
expectation of a fight and, on his understanding of the plan, the degree of
violence to be then used upon Ah Wing was to be measured by the degree of
resistance opposed by their victim to the fulfilment of their common aim:—

Q Well now, it is perfectly
plain that if you had put up a fight for six hundred dollars (the biggest
amount Cathro said he once had), the old Chinaman was to put up a fight for
five thousand dollars?

A Yes.

Q Well, what were you going
to do if he did?

A Hold him.

Q And you were to apply
whatever force was necessary to silence him?

A Not necessarily.

 *** 

Q And if he had put up a
fight, you would have to put up a fight also?

A Well to a certain extent.

 *** 

Q Well, just answer the
question now. Wasn't that the situation, whatever fight that old man put up,
you were there to overcome it?

A Yes, sir.

Q And that is what you did,
isn't it?

A Yes, sir.

This evidence does not exclude
grievous bodily injury, if needed in the judgment of either of the parties to
the agreement.

(ii) The subsequent conduct of
the parties. At closing hours, the appellant went in the store first to be
followed thereafter by Bew. Each in turn bought soft drinks. The last customer
having departed, Cathro went to the back of the store and asked the owner for a
can of meat. The latter turned his back in order to fetch this object; Cathro
grabbed him from behind, put an arm around his neck and the hand of the other
on his mouth. Meanwhile Bew locked 

[Page 120]

the front door, opened the back
door and put out the lights. Examined in chief, he then, in a rather dimmed
recital of the facts, proceeds to say:—

I then—the Chinaman was
making quite a bit of noise, trying to struggle. I told him to keep quiet or I
would have to hurt him, more or less as a threat. He kept making noise, so I
hit him with the can, not intending to hurt him at all, more or less to scare
him. He made more noise than ever.

Q Where did you hit him? A
High on the head.

Q How many times did you hit
him? A Once.

Q Then what happened? A
Well, I had seen a flashlight before the lights had gone out. Billy, who had
been looking around, I told him to get the flashlight so he could see better.
Instead of putting the flashlight on, he hit the man with it, which I told him
to stop and get something to put in his mouth. I heard some cloth tearing. He
tried to put something in his mouth and it didn't seem to work, it was much too
thick, he was still making noise.

Q Go on.

A I then asked Chow Bew to
hold him while I looked around.

Cathro then went to the bedroom
where he found rolls of coins underneath the bed, then to the till which he
emptied and returned to the back room. At the request of Bew, who was with Ah
Wing then lying down on the floor, he searched the pockets of the victim and
obtained a few bills. Asked by Bew how much money he had, Cathro answered,
""Very little"". At the suggestion of Bew, he then went for further
searches in the back room in which he was when somebody knocked at the door,
whereupon both fled immediately. In cross-examination, Cathro testifies:—

Q Well, how could you stuff
this cloth in his throat, or how could you expect to stuff this cloth in his
throat if you took your hand off his mouth, even for an instant, without him
making such an outcry that the whole neighborhood would hear?

A Just what I was saying, I
was holding him, I had my arm around him and his head back, at the same time he
was putting the cloth in his mouth.

Q At that time you had your
hand off his mouth, didn't you?

A When the cloth was trying
to be forced in.

Q How were you silencing him
then?

A He did yell then, that is
why I say it didn't work.

Q Well nobody next door
heard it through this partition?

A It doesn't appear that
way.

Q Why did you let him yell?

A Trying to put that cloth
in his mouth.

Q I didn't ask that, I asked
why did you let him yell?

A What else was I going to
do when he tried to put something in his mouth.

[Page 121]

Q You could just put the
pressure on his throat with your good right arm, couldn't you?

A I guess so.

Q And that is what you did,
didn't you?

A I might have put some
pressure on his throat.

Q If the man didn't yell you
would have to?

A The man was yelling after
that.

***

Q Well, I'm suggesting that
you would have to render him unconscious before you transferred him over to
Chow Bew? Now, what do you say about that?

A The man was not
unconscious.

Q Or practically so?

A No, he was yelling,
putting up a fairly good fight, yet fairly active.

Cathro is referred to the small
cut over the right eyebrow, scrapes of the lips, cut on the tongue from which
there had been some bleeding in the mouth, the rubbed appearance of the skin of
the chin and of the neck and abrasions on the right side of the neck of the
victim, and asked:—

Q Actually you didn't know
how much pressure you used on that man's neck, do you?

A I never used very much
pressure.

Q Well, you don't know what
you did in the excitement there, do you?

A Not in complete detail,
no.

And as to the moment at which the
victim went on the floor, the evidence of Cathro is:—

Q At what stage did the old
fellow get down on the floor?

A When I was turning him
over to Chow Bew, I guess.

***

Later:—

Q At what stage did you get
the old man down on the floor?

A I don't know exactly.

Q Wasn't it a fact that he
just fell down?

A No, he didn't fall down.

THE COURT: Q He didn't fall
down?

A Not that I know of.

Q Well, he got there
ultimately, didn't he?

A He was on the floor when I
went through his left front pocket, the one I could get at.

Q And unconscious then too,
wasn't he?

A Not to my knowledge.

Q Well, did he struggle when
you were rifling his pockets? 

A He might have, but the
other man was holding him.

Q He was not gagged though?

A Not to my knowledge, no.

[Page 122]

On Cathro's own story:—he was the
first to resort to violence in the manner planned for; he grabbed his victim
from behind, he held him in a manner, known to him to permit strangulation; he
hit him on the head with a meat can; both he and Bew, notwithstanding their
combined strength, unsuccessfully attempted gagging. And it is then that Cathro
turned Ah Wing over to Bew, with the implied request to take responsibility for
the means to be adopted in order to permit him to search the premises, and
later their victim, for the money.

As to the law. If death, whether
intended, anticipated or not, ensues as a consequence of grievous bodily
injury, meant and inflicted for the purpose of facilitating the commission of a
robbery, the offence, under s. 260 standing alone, is murder. Under s. 69 (1)
of the Criminal Code, every one is party to such offence who actually
commits it, or whose conduct, in relation to its commission by another, comes
within the description of either one of sub-paragraphs (b), (c)
or (d) of paragraph 1 of section 69 reading:—

69 (1). Every one is a party
to and guilty of an offence who

(a) actually commits
it;

(b) does or omits an
act for the purpose of aiding any person to commit the offence;

(c) abets any person
in commission of the offence; or

(d) counsels or
procures any person to commit the offence.

The fatal injury, in this case,
was inflicted either by the appellant or by Bew. On the first hypothesis,
Cathro is guilty of murder. On the second, Cathro is a party to murder under
section 69 (1). For, on the two hypotheses, the evidence does not permit
doubting either that the fatal injury was meant and inflicted for the purpose
of facilitating the commission of the robbery in which both were engaged, or
that, on Cathro's own evidence, both were at one mind as to the purpose and the
means of their common plan, as made and as executed. In such circumstances,
this case comes squarely under the law laid down in s. 260 and s. 69 (1) of the
Criminal Code. As defined, ""bodily harm becomes grievous whenever
it seriously interferes with health or even comfort. It is not necessary that
its effects should be dangerous or that they should be permanent.""
(Roscoe's Criminal Evidence 16th ed. p. 631; Russell

[Page 123]

On Crime, 10th ed. Vol. 1, p. 690; Archbold's Criminal
Pleading, Evidence and Practice, 32nd ed. p. 968; Harris and Wilshere's Criminal
Law, 17th ed. p. 282; Rex v. Cox [12];
Rex v. Ashman [13].
Before he transferred him over to Bew, the violence which Cathro himself, first
alone and then with the assistance of Bew, exerted upon Ah Wing, comes within
that definition; hence Cathro and Bew were then at one mind as to inflicting
grievous bodily injury. And there is nothing to suggest that, from the moment
of transfer—when, in Cathro's own words, Ah Wing was still ""yelling,
putting up a fairly good fight, yet, fairly active yet"", there was a modification
in the mind of either party with respect to the flexible rule by which the
degree of violence had to be measured. From then on, Cathro relied on Bew to
overcome the resistance or yelling of Ah Wing. The evidence does not show that
Bew did more than was necessary for that purpose; even if the fatal blow was
ill-measured, Cathro, under s. 69 (1), is none the less party thereto.

Assuming that the grounds of
appeal, upon the consideration of which we have jurisdiction to enter, might be
decided in favour of the appellant, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has actually occurred.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal allowed,
conviction quashed and new trial directed.

Mr. Justice Estey, because of
illness, took no part in the judgment.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal Law—Murder—Death
resulting from robbery by violence at hands of accused or an accomplice—Whether
proof of intent to kill necessary—Criminal Code, ss. 69 (2), 260 (a), (c).

The appellant charged with three others of murder, tried
separately and convicted, appealed on the ground among others that the jury as
charged could reasonably have believed that it was entitled to convict of
murder under s. 260 (a) or (c) of the Criminal Code
without proof of intent to kill and apart from s. 69 (2).

Held: 1. That upon a charge of murder based on s. 260 (a)
or (c) proof of intent to kill is not necessary, nor is it when s. 69
(2) is invoked.

2. (Cartwright J. dissenting): That the charge upon this
aspect of the matter was sufficient.

3. (By Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke and Fauteux JJ.):
That it was not necessary that the jury be charged as to the defence of
manslaughter since there was no evidence upon which such a defence could be
based.

Per Taschereau, Locke and Fauteux JJ.: There was
evidence from which the jury might properly infer that the appellant and his
companion meant to inflict grievous bodily injury to the deceased and had aided
and abetted each other in doing so for the purpose of facilitating the
commission of robbery and that death had ensued. Such an offence is murder as
defined by s. 260 whether they or either of them meant or knew that death was
likely to ensue. In such circumstances it would be a matter of indifference
which inflicted the fatal injury since each was liable for the other's act. The
appellant might also be found guilty of murder if the jury inferred that a
common intention had been formed by the appellant and his associates to rob the
deceased and to assist each other in doing so and that the killing was an
offence which ought to have been known to the appellant to be a probable
consequence of such common purpose.

Per Cartwright J. (dissenting): The jury should have
been instructed, that if they concluded from the evidence that the violence was
inflicted by the appellant's companion alone, they could find the appellant
guilty only if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt: (i) that it was
in fact a probable consequence of the prosecution of the common purpose of the
appellant and his accomplice to rob the deceased that the accomplice, for the
purpose of facilitating the robbery, would intentionally inflict grievous
bodily injury on the deceased or would wilfully stop his breath, and (ii) that
it was known or ought to have

[Page 125]

been known to the appellant that such consequence was
probable. While on the evidence it was open to a properly instructed jury to so
find, the jury was not adequately instructed on this vital matter.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (1955)
112 Can. C. C. 180, affirmed.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1]
affirming, the appellant's conviction for murder. O'Halloran J.A. dissenting,
would have set aside the murder conviction, substituted a verdict of
manslaughter and imposed a sentence of ten years imprisonment.

In separate trials one of the
other three was convicted of murder, one acquitted and the Crown did not
proceed against the third.

F. G. P. Lewis for the
accused, appellant.

L. H. Jackson and W. G.
Burke-Robertson, Q.C. for the respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—This appeal is
based upon five grounds of dissent taken by Mr. Justice O'Halloran in the Court
of Appeal for British Columbia[2]. As to numbers two, three and five, I am of opinion
that the charge of the trial judge is not open to the objections raised. These
are as follows:—

(2) Upon the charge as given
them the jury could reasonably believe they were entitled to convict of murder
under Code s. 260 (a) and (c) without proof of intent to
kill and apart from Code s. 69(2).

(3) The jury were not
instructed that proof of intent to kill was essential under Code s.
69(2) upon the evidence before them, in order to convict of murder.

(5) The instructions upon
reasonable doubt did not bring home to the jury the distinction between the
proof required in a criminal case of murder vis-à-vis manslaughter contrasted
with that required in a civil case.

Numbers one and four may be considered
together:—

(1) The Learned Judge
omitted to put the defence of manslaughter adequately before the Jury and
nowhere in the charge was the defence of manslaughter put in such a way that
the Jury would realize that manslaughter vis-à-vis murder was the transcendent
issue for them to decide.

(4) No mention of
manslaughter was found at pages 189, 193, 195 and 197 in the Charge to the Jury
where in eleven places it ought to have appeared with murder and acquittal as a
verdict open to the jury.

[Page 126]

After a careful reading of the
charge I am of opinion that the trial judge unequivocally directed the jury as
to returning a verdict of manslaughter if they were not satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that murder had been proved; but, in any event, there was no
evidence in this case upon which any verdict of manslaughter could be based.

The appeal must be dismissed.

The judgment of Taschereau, Locke
and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:—

LOCKE J.:—The second and third
grounds of dissent upon which this appeal has been taken imply that, in a
charge of murder based on s. 260 (a) or s. 260 (c) of the Code,
proof of intent to kill is necessary and that this is also so when s. 69(2) is
invoked. I am unable, with respect, to agree with these conclusions in view of
the terms of the sections mentioned.

S. 259 defines some of the
circumstances in which culpable homicide is murder in law, and certain others
are defined in s. 260. As declared by s-s. (a) of the latter section, if
a person means to inflict grievous bodily injury for the purpose of
facilitating the commission of the offences, inter alia, of robbery or
burglary and death ensues from such injury, the offence is murder, whether the
offender means or not death to ensue or knows or not that death is likely to ensue.
S-s. (c) provides that if a person by any means stops the breath of any
person for any such purpose and death ensues from such stopping of the breath,
the offence is murder.

The first sentence of s. 69
provides, inter alia, that every one is a party to and guilty of an
offence who actually commits it, or does or omits an act for the purpose of
aiding any person to commit the offence, or abets any person in committing it.
This section appeared as s. 61 when the Code was first enacted in 1892.

As it affects the present case,
the matter is thus stated in the 10th Edition of Russell on Crime, at p.
1853, as follows:—

Thus where several persons
are together for the purpose of committing a breach of the peace, assaulting
persons who pass, and while acting together in that common object, a fatal blow
is given, it is immaterial

[Page 127]

which struck the blow, for
the blow given under such circumstances is in point of law the blow of all, and
it is unnecessary to prove which struck the blow.

There was evidence in the present
matter from which a jury might properly draw the inference that the appellant
and Cathro had meant to inflict grievous bodily injury to Ah Wing and had aided
and abetted each other in doing so for the purpose of facilitating the
commission of the offence of robbery and that his death had resulted. If the
jury chose to draw this inference, the offence was murder as defined by s. 260,
whether they or either of them meant that death should ensue or knew that death
was likely to ensue. In such circumstances, it would be a matter of
indifference which of the two struck the fatal blow or inflicted the fatal
injury, since each would be liable in law for the act of the other.

The appellant might also have
been found guilty of murder, if the jury were to draw the inference that a
common intention to rob Ah Wing had been formed by the appellant and his
associates and to assist each other in doing so, and that the killing was an
offence which ought to have been known to the appellant to be a probable consequence
of the prosecution of such common purpose. The charge upon this aspect of the
matter appears to me to have been sufficient.

As to the objections to the
charge on the ground that what has been referred to as the defence of
manslaughter was not put to the jury properly, I think nothing in the evidence
raised any such issue and, accordingly, this criticism of the charge is not
justified. In my opinion, upon the evidence only two verdicts were possible,
that is, guilty or not guilty. I cannot think that it affected the appellant's
position to his detriment that the jury were told, as they were, that they
might find manslaughter.

I would dismiss the appeal.

RAND J.:—The evidence in this
case, differing in this respect from that adduced in the trial of the
accomplice, Cathro, whose conviction of murder has likewise been brought in
appeal before us, did not go directly to what had taken place in the store
resulting in the death. The facts before the jury were these: about 10:30 p.m. from his
home a witness saw an automobile, draw up right opposite him 

[Page 128]

on 24th Avenue on which a lane
opened leading to the rear of the store of the deceased; a man was sitting
slouched in the driver's seat, and the engine was running which upon the
witness's coming out of the house was shut off; about this time Cathro was seen
in the store drinking from a bottle by three other witnesses also inside;
before the latter went out the accused entered and he and Cathro were left
alone with the deceased on their departure; the lights of the store were
noticed to be out earlier than usual; within ten or fifteen minutes from the
time the car was observed by him, the first witness who had returned from a
short errand in his car noticed two persons, one of them carrying a small box,
running westerly along the avenue from the direction of the store to the parked
automobile which they hurriedly got into and drove away at high speed; the.
witness, who had previously recognized the make of car, followed them and was
able to obtain the license number; upon returning from this pursuit, he found
the police in the store to whom he gave a description of the car, including its
number; the police had been called in by a neighbour of the deceased upon
hearing moaning within the store; a general alert was sent out at about 10:58
o'clock the police came upon the car with four occupants, the accused and
Cathro being in the back seat with the former holding a small box containing
about $50 and a receipt shown to have been given to the deceased. The cause of
death was the force which not only had broken the walls of the larynx but by
shutting off respiration had brought about asphyxia. On these primary facts the
jury could admittedly have found the death to have been brought about in the
course of robbery by acts of force to which both men were party: as is seen,
there is nothing whatever on which a distinction could be made by the jury
between the parts played by Cathro and the accused. the vital circumstances in
which the evidence differs from the case of Cathro.

In that situation must a trial
judge, in his charge, embark upon a speculation of the many possible modes in
which the fatal occurrence might have taken place? Without more, it would, I
think, be improper for him to invite the jury to indulge in any such
imaginings. What they must do is to draw their conclusions from the evidence
submitted to them or the reasonable inferences arising from it; but on any
feature on which the evidence, including in that the 

[Page 129]

inferences to be drawn from the
total circumstances disclosed, is silent, in general and specifically here no
special direction is warranted.

A number of grounds were urged
against the charge, but I find myself quite unable to say that as a whole it
did not present the law and the case for the defence to the jury both fairly
and adequately.

I would dismiss the appeal.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—The
appellant was tried before Manson J. and a jury at the Vancouver assize and on
March 30, 1955, was convicted on the charge, ""that he, the said Chow Bew
at the City of Vancouver, in the County of Vancouver, in the Province of
British Columbia, on the 6th day of January, 1955, together with Donald Keith
Cathro, Eng Git Lee and Richard Wong, unlawfully did murder Young Gai Wah,
otherwise known as Ah Wing.""

His appeal to the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia was dismissed. O'Halloran J.A., dissenting, would
have allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and substituted a verdict of
manslaughter and a sentence of ten years imprisonment.

The following statement of the
facts is taken from the reasons for judgment of Bird J.A.:—

The case for the Crown rests
upon the evidence of various persons who between approximately 10.30 and 11.00
p.m. on the night in question were either present in the store where the
killing occurred or in its near vicinity; as well as that of police officers
who investigated the circumstances surrounding the crime and of the physician
who conducted the autopsy on the body of the deceased man.

The facts now set out emerge
from the uncontradicted testimony of these persons called as Crown witnesses:

(1) The store is situate at 4017 MacDonald Street from the rear of which a passage leads to the 2800 block on West 24th Avenue, Vancouver, B.C.

(2) At 10.30 p.m. January 6, 1955, Dickinson saw
a car stop in the 2800 block W. 24th
 Avenue, from which two persons alighted
and walked away in the general direction of the store. He said that the car, in
which was one occupant, remained there with lights out.

(3) About 10.40 p.m. the deceased
man served in the store the witness Cowie, who, with his wife, occupied the
premises adjoining the store to the north, as well as Shearer and Wood. Cathro
was then observed in the store by Cowie, Shearer and Wood, and the appellant
was seen entering by Shearer when the latter left the premises.

(4) At 10.50 p.m. a groan
from the store premises was heard by Cowie and his wife who then observed that
the interior lights of the store were out. She called the police immediately by
telephone.

[Page 130]

(5)About 10.45 p.m.
Dickinson returned by car to his home in the 2800 block 24th Avenue West and
soon after, in company with Scholes, saw two men, one of whom carried what
looked like a cigar box, run west on 24th Avenue from the direction of
MacDonald Street, and enter the parked car which then rapidly drove east
without lights.

(6) Dickinson
followed the eastbound car for two miles, observed that it was a Pontiac and
noted its licence number which information soon after was reported by him to
police officers whom he found near the store premises on his return.

(7) Shearer and Wood, who
stood talking outside the store after leaving it, did not observe anyone enter
or leave the premises before police cars arrived at 10.50 p.m. Meantime they
had observed the store lights go out.

(8) Upon examination of the
store premises made by police officers about 10.50 p.m. the front door was
found locked, the rear door leading to the passage to 24th Avenue was open. The
lights had been shut off from the fuse box and the dead body of Ah Wing was
found within the premises.

(9) A Pontiac car
bearing the licence number given to the police officers by Dickinson was
stopped by a constable on a downtown street some miles from the store premises
at 10.58 p.m. In the car were the four men charged in the
indictment. The appellant then had in his possession a cigar box containing
money, as well as a receipt which was shown to have been issued to the deceased
man.

The facts thus elicited from
the various Crown witnesses and particularly the fact that only Cathro, the
appellant, and Ah Wing were present in the store between 10.40 and 10.50 p.m.
do not appear to have been seriously questioned by defence counsel at the
trial.

T. R. Harmon, a qualified
physician and surgeon, retained as pathologist and autopsist by the City of Vancouver,
expressed the opinion, founded upon his examination of the body of the deceased
made January 7, 1955, that the latter had come to an ""unnatural
death from asphyxia due to strangulation with a fracture of the voice
box"". It was his belief that ""death resulted from strangulation by
pressure that shut off the breathing,"" that ""very great pressure was
required to fracture the voice box"". The application of ""a knee on
the neck was the most likely cause of injury, very powerful hands could do
it"" but they would leave marks on the neck of which the witness found
none. He said further that the identical type of injury to the voice box is not
usual and he could not recall having seen another. There were superficial
injuries to the face; left wrist, and scalp, none of which in the witness'
opinion were likely to have caused death, though the injuries to the head may
have caused loss of consciousness.

There was no direct evidence
of what transpired in the store premises subsequent to 10.40 p.m. when Cathro,
the appellant, and Ah Wing, were shown to have been the only occupants.

The appellant did not take
the witness-box nor did the defence adduce evidence.

It may be added, as is pointed
out by O'Halloran J.A., that there was no evidence that any weapon was in the
possession of the appellant or of any of the other three named in the
indictment or played any part in causing the death of Ah Wing.

[Page 131]

It is apparent from this summary
of the evidence that it was open to the jury to find that the appellant and
Cathro had formed a common intention to rob Ah Wing and to assist each other in
so doing, that Ah Wing came to his death as the result of an assault committed
for the purpose of facilitating the carrying out of the robbery, that the force
used was so great as to indicate that the person who applied it meant to
inflict grievous bodily harm on Ah Wing or to stop his breath or to do both. It
is, I think, also apparent that it was open to the jury to find that the
evidence was not inconsistent with the view that the force which caused the
death of Ah Wing was applied by one only of the two who were together
committing the robbery and that it was impossible to say which one actually
committed the assault. It therefore became of crucial importance that the
learned trial judge should make plain to the jury the law by which they should
be guided if they took the view of the evidence that all the injuries from
which the death of Ah Wing ensued were inflicted by Cathro alone.

From the description of the
injuries given by Dr. Harmon there could be little doubt that the individual
who actually applied the force was guilty of murder under the provisions of
either clause (a) or clause (c) of s. 260 of the Criminal
Code, in force at the date of the offence and at the date of the trial. It
would seem that such individual meant, for the purpose of facilitating the
commission of the robbery, to inflict grievous bodily injury or, as an
alternative to the intention just mentioned or in addition thereto, meant to
stop the breath of Ah Wing. The question is how the jury should have been
instructed as to what they must find before they could properly convict of
murder the other individual taking part in the robbery on the assumption that
he did not personally use any force from which the death of Ah Wing ensued.

In my view the law of Canada on
this point is to be found in ss. 259, 260 and 69 of the Criminal Code
and differs from the law of England as laid down in the cases of Rex v. Betts and
Ridley [3] and
Rex v. Grant and Gilbert [4].

Applying the relevant sections of
the Code to the state of facts mentioned, I am of opinion that it should
have been

[Page 132]

made plain to the jury that, if,
in their view, the circumstances proved were not inconsistent with the view
that the violence inflicted on Ah Wing was inflicted by Cathro alone, they
could find the appellant guilty of murder only if they were satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt of two things, (i) that it was in fact a probable consequence
of the prosecution of the common purpose of the appellant and Cathro to rob Ah
Wing, that Cathro, for the purpose of facilitating the' commission of the
robbery, would intentionally inflict grievous bodily injury on Ah Wing or would
wilfully stop his breath, and (ii) that it was known or ought to have been
known to the appellant that such consequence was probable. While in my view, on
the evidence, it would have been open to a properly instructed jury to so find,
I am in agreement with O'Halloran J.A. that the jury were not accurately
instructed on this vital matter.

The learned trial judge having
told the jury that in ss. 259 and 260 the word ""offender"" extended to
all who were involved and that the singular included the plural if the evidence
so required, went on to say in dealing with these two sections:—

If you are of the opinion
beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused did intend to inflict grievous
bodily harm, for the purpose of facilitating—when I say the Accused, I think I
might well join with it the Accused or his companion or the two of them
together—if you are of the opinion beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
did intend to inflict grievous bodily injury for the purpose of facilitating
the commission of the robbery, then the earlier words of Section 260 come into
play and the crime is that of murder, regardless of whether the offender meant
or not death to ensue, or whether he knew or not that death was likely to
ensue.

and a little later continued:—

It seems to me—and the
finding of fact is for you—that the acts of the offenders were for the purpose
of facilitating the commission of the robbery, as it seems to me that the
offenders wilfully stopped the breath of the deceased to facilitate the
commission of the crime of robbery and death ensued. And if I am right in my
view that that word ""offender"" as used in that section extended to
the plural, then you at once arrive at the position that it is quite immaterial
which of these two men that were in the premises, seemingly, stopped the breath
of the Accused (sic—obviously the word ""accused"" should be
""deceased"") and it is immaterial whether they meant to cause death or
not, or knew or not that death was likely to ensue, if they stopped the breath
and death did ensue.

I now leave those sections
and turn to Section 69 of the Code …

It appears to me that the jury
may well have understood from the passages which I have quoted, and in the
first of which I have italicized some words, that it was open to

[Page 133]

them to find a verdict of guilty
against the appellant, even if in their opinion he had not personally used any
force to Ah Wing, by the application of the terms of ss. 259 and 260 and
without the necessity of considering or applying the terms of s. 69 (2); and I
think that this was a fatal error. If I am right in my view as to the existence
of this error, it is obvious that it could not be cured merely by an accurate
direction, as to the effect of s. 69 (2), for, ex hypothesi, the jury
might feel no need to consider that section at all; and I can find nothing in
the remainder of the charge which has the effect of correcting or removing such
error. I conclude therefore that the verdict cannot stand.

The ground of misdirection on
which I have concluded that the appeal should be allowed appears to me to be
sufficiently raised in the second ground of dissent of O'Halloran J.A. set out
in the formal order of the Court of Appeal as follows:—

Upon the charge as given
them the jury could reasonably believe they were entitled to convict of murder
under Code s. 260 (a) and (c) without proof of intent to
kill and apart from Code s. 69 (2).

While I trust that it so appears
from all that I have said above, I wish, so as to avoid the possibility of
misunderstanding, to say explicitly that I do not agree with the view, implied
in the wording of the ground of dissent just quoted, that in order to enable a
properly instructed jury to convict of murder in this case proof of intent to
kill was necessary. My view as to the misdirection which I regard as fatal
would be correctly summarized as follows:—

Upon the charge as given
them the jury could reasonably believe they were entitled to convict of murder
under Code s. 260 (a) and (c) apart from Code s. 69
(2).

As already indicated this ground
is, I think, included in the ground of dissent which I have quoted. The greater
includes the less.

It does not appear to me that
this is a case in which the provisions of 1014 (2) can be applied. I have
already indicated my view that the evidence was sufficient to permit a properly
instructed jury to convict of murder but I do not think it can safely be
affirmed that they must necessarily have done so.

[Page 134]

I would allow the appeal, quash
the conviction and direct a new trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Theft—Mens Rea—Beachcomber
collecting logs from booming ground without consent of owner—Whether theft—Whether
mens rea—Criminal Code, ss. 22, 396.

The respondent was charged
under the Criminal Code with the theft of two saw logs belonging to a
lumber company and stamped with a registered brand, which had been floating
within a recognized booming ground but not contained in any boom. He admitted
taking and selling them to another beachcomber who, according to the existing
practice, had them scaled by the Forest Branch of the provincial government.
But he contended that he did not intend to do anything wrong and thought that
he had the right to do what he did; that they were drifting and that he thought
that the tide or the wind had carried them into the enclosure.

His acquittal by the trial
judge, on the ground that there had been no mens rea, was affirmed by the Court
of Appeal.

Held (Locke J. dissenting),
that the appeal should be allowed and a conviction directed.

Per Taschereau and Rand JJ.: The respondent's belief
that by the general law he had the right to collect the logs as he did, to
dispose of them, and in effect to require the owners to pay him or the person
to whom he transferred them a remuneration for his salvage work, being a
mistake of law, was not admissible as a defence by virtue of s. 22 of the Criminal
Code.

Per Estey and Fauteux JJ.: In the circumstances of this
case, it cannot be said that the respondent could justify his collecting the
logs by stating that they were drifting. The were not drifting in an area that
would permit a beachcomber to take them into his possession. He did not collect
them in such a place or under such circumstances that he could reasonably
presume that they had been abandoned or that he might take them out of
possession of the party in control of the booming ground. Knowing that they
were in a booming ground under the control and direction of the company, he
could not be said to have had an honest and reasonable belief in the existence
of facts which, if true, would have constituted a defence and, therefore, he
possessed mens rea.

By trespassing upon the
booming ground and taking the logs fraudulently and without colour of right,
with intent of disposing of them in a manner that deprived the company
temporarily of its property, he was guilty of theft.

Per Locke J. (dissenting): There was evidence upon which
the trial judge could find that the respondent took possession of the logs
believing that he was entitled to do so with the intention not of stealing them

[Page 607]

but of profiting by obtaining
salvage from the owners if they were found, or which could leave the trial
judge in such doubt as to require him to acquit. To constitute the crime of
theft, the act must be done fraudulently and without colour of right.

Section 22 of the Criminal
Code did not affect the matter since the question to be determined was
whether or not the respondent committed any offence.

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the acquittal by the trial judge of the
respondent on a charge of stealing saw logs from a booming ground.

S. J. Remnant, Q.C. for
the appellant.

Glen McDonald for the
respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau and
Rand JJ. was delivered by:—

RAND J.:—The external facts in
this appeal are few and simple. The accused removed from a booming ground,
within which a lumber company, the prosecutor, had exclusive privileges for the
putting down of mooring dolphins, the anchorage of booms, a line of piles and a
log haul-up, two logs belonging to the company which at the time of removal had
become lodged against the easterly end of a line of booms. He did that by
entering the water area over a boundary line of single logs a distance of approximately
40 feet and towing the two logs out and down the Fraser river where on the
following day he sold them, along with 23 others, for eighty dollars or so.

He was believed in saying that he
did not intend to do anything wrong and that he thought he had the right to do
what he did. This both the County Court judge who tried him and the Court of
Appea[2] have
found to be an answer to the charge laid.

The accused can be said, as he
was in the courts below, to have acted upon a mistake, but in what did the mistake
lie? He acknowledged that the logs were not drifting, that is, not at large in
the river; he claims they were floating, that is, within the leased area, and
for a distance of about 40 feet, they might move as the tide came in or went
out. With admittedly no claim whatever to any property

[Page 608]

interest in them but as a means
of earning what may be called salvage money, he proceeded to gather them up as
if they were adrift and, if not interfered with, might be carried out to sea
some miles distant. He knew or abstained from ascertaining that the logs were
stamped with the mark of the logger and that they were owned by some person who
could establish his title to them. They were not lost and he was not in the
position of a finder, though if that circumstance had been present it would not
yield much benefit to him. He admits that, for all he knew, they might have
belonged to the company, but with that he was not concerned. He does not
suggest that from the company he had any right or privilege in any manner or
degree to appropriate them and in fact he was aware of a memorandum of advice
published by the provincial land department which told him that even when logs
gathered up were drifting, he was, if called upon, bound to surrender them to
the owner, and whether or not he would be entitled to receive compensation for
his trouble depended on some form of understanding between himself and the
owner. No such distinction between a drifting and a floating log is made in
that memorandum.

What, then, he believed was that
by the general law he had a right to collect them as he did, to dispose of
them, and in effect to require the owners to pay him or the person to whom he
transferred them remuneration for his salvage work. Is that admissible as a
defence? I have no doubt that it is not. As Kenny in his outlines of criminal
law, 1952 Ed. at p. 48 says:—

The final condition is, that
the mistake, however reasonable, must not relate to matters of law but to
matters of fact. For a mistake of law, even though inevitable, is not allowed
in England to afford any excuse for crime. Ignorantia juris neminem excusat. The
utmost effect it can ever have is that it may occasionally, like drunkenness,
rebut the existence of the peculiar form of mens rea which some particular kind
of crime may require.

This principle is embodied in
sec. 22 of the Criminal Code:—

The fact that an offender is
ignorant of the law is not an excuse for any offence committed by him.

A claim to ownership of a
chattel, although it may depend on matter of law, is, in most cases, a question
of fact, or its legal basis may, in the ordinary sense of the 

[Page 609]

word, be subsumed in
""fact"". This enhances the difficulty of separating legal from factual
elements in any relation to property and in any case it may resolve itself into
a refined conceptual distinction. But a distinction between justifying an act
as authorized by law and as a bona fide belief in a property interest does seem
to correspond with an instinctive discrimination between the two concepts.

This idea is given its best
expression by Lord Westbury in Cooper v. Phibbs[3]
in the following language:—

It is said ""ignorantia
iuris haud excusat""; but in that maxim the word ""ius"" is used in
the sense of denoting general law, the ordinary law of the country. But when
the word ""ius"" is used in the sense of denoting a private right, that
maxim has no application. Private right of ownership is a matter of fact; it
may be the result also of matter of law; but if parties contract under a mutual
mistake and misapprehension as to their relative and respective rights, the
result is that that agreement is liable to be set aside as having proceeded
upon a common mistake.

This language was used in a civil
proceeding but it furnishes a most helpful distinction for the application of
the maxim in criminal law of which it has always been taken to be a basic
principle.

The taking into possession and
the conversion of the logs obviously was intended to deprive the owner
temporarily at least of its property and this comes within the express language
of the definition of theft given by the Criminal Code.

I would therefore allow the
appeal and direct a judgment of conviction upon the second count, with a fine
of $25 imposed upon the accused.

The judgment of Estey and Fauteux
JJ. was delivered by:—

ESTEY J.:—The respondent was
found not guilty in the County Court Judge's Criminal Court of Westminster,
British Columbia, on a charge containing two counts: (1) that he did, on February 15, 1953,
without the consent of the owner, fraudulently collect two saw logs stamped
with a registered brand and thereby committed an offence contrary to s. 394(a)
(i) of the Criminal Code; (2) that he did steal the said logs and
thereby committed an offence contrary to s. 396 of the Criminal Code. His
acquittal was

[Page 610]

affirmed in the Court of Appeal[4].
Leave to appeal to this Court was granted, but restricted to the acquittal
under the second count.

These logs were each stamped with
a registered brand—8 over 697 within a triangle. They had been sold by the
owner of that brand and at all times material hereto were the property of McKay
and Flanagan Brothers Lumber Mill Limited (hereinafter referred to as the
company). This company operates a sawmill on the Fraser River near New
Westminster and leases an area of that river in front of its mill site, about
1,300 feet in length and in width varying from 240 to 265 feet, as a booming
ground. For some distance from the shore this booming ground is well marked on
the surface thereof and the respondent admits that these logs were within that
marked area and that he knew the logs were in this booming ground, both when he
first saw them and when he collected them.

The respondent describes himself
as a fisherman who does ""a bit of beachcombing"". About ten o'clock Sunday
morning, February 15, 1953, accompanied by a boy fifteen years of age named Hamilton, he
went out in his fishing boat upon the Fraser River to ""look for some logs"". He deposed
that in ""going up river and passing Flanagan's booming ground I noticed
two logs drifting down and I circled the boat and came up against the tide, it
was just about slack tide by that time. By the time I got the boat turned
around the logs landed on top of the boom, at the head end of their boom"".
He directed his boat into the booming ground and collected the two logs which
he estimated had floated approximately forty to fifty feet since the time he
first saw them. The next day he disposed of the logs to another beachcomber,
Patterson, along with some twenty-six other logs he had obtained in
beachcombing, all for a sum which he recollected to be $78.

Patterson, called on behalf of
the Crown, described the respondent as a ""fisherman, and he picks up a few
logs for me"". Patterson states that on the Monday the respondent brought
some twenty-eight or thirty logs for which he paid him $80. That Patterson
intended to communicate with the authorities and have these logs disposed of in
the

[Page 611]

usual way there can be no doubt,
but before the scalers had arrived a representative of the company called and
Patterson delivered to him the two logs in question, as well as three more of
the company's logs which he had in his possession.

The Fraser River at this point flows approximately westward and these
logs were at the upper or east end of the booming ground, well inside of the
marked area thereof. At this end a barrier exists between that of the Farris
Lumber Company Limited and the booming ground of the company, for the purpose
of separating these grounds.

Respondent justifies his
collecting these logs upon the basis that they were drifting and, therefore, he
""was entitled to go and pick them up"". When it was suggested he
incurred some risk, he replied: ""I didn't figure it was a risk picking up
logs at all, because they were loose and floating and drifting"".

Respondent based his belief in
his right to take a floating log upon his reading of the pamphlet issued by the
British Columbia Forestry Service entitled ""General Information on
Beachcombing"" and which was filed as an exhibit at the trial. He did not
specify any particular portion thereof, but contented himself with stating:
""According to this, as long as you don't steal them"" it is all right
to collect floating logs, but that ""if you take a log out of a boom that
is stealing"". In fact the pamphlet makes no reference to a booming ground
or a boom. It refers to the civil rights of one engaged in the business of
beachcombing and indicates his position to be that of ""a finder of lost
things"". Section 394 of the Criminal Code is specifically referred
to, and in part set out. It further reminds the beachcomber that he must comply
with the provisions of the Forest Act. Indeed, when one reads the
pamphlet as a whole it supports the view that the purpose and intent of
beachcombing is to restore to the owner logs which have passed out of his
control. In Watts and Grant
v. The Queen[5],
the logs were collected at points not under the control or direction of the
owner and the issues concerned the collection by the accused parties of logs
belonging to a particular owner and what, if any, were the rights of the
accused

[Page 612]

with respect to these logs, while
in the present case the issue turns on the right of one, while engaged in the
business of beachcombing, to knowingly enter and collect logs floating outside
of a boom but within a private booming ground.

Counsel for the Crown, upon these
facts, submitted that, as respondent took the logs from an area which he well
knew was a booming ground and, therefore, an area under the control and direction
(except with respect to certain matters not material hereto) of the company as
lessee, he could not do so with other than a dishonest or fraudulent intent.
The logs within such an area are subject to the control of the company and,
apart from the rights of an owner (with which we are not here concerned), the
lessee has a right to the possession thereof against a person in the position
of the respondent. South Staffordshire Water Company v. Sharman[6].
The conduct of the respondent, in the submission of the Crown, in going into
and trespassing upon the booming ground with the intent and purpose of
collecting floating logs therein, though not inside a boom, was itself, in the
circumstances, such evidence of dishonest or wrongful intent that the mere assertion
on his part that he thought he had a right to collect floating logs would not
establish an honest intent. The conduct of the respondent, at the time of
collecting the logs, as well as later when the police officer called at his
home, appears to support the contention of the Crown. When the police officer
called, and before he had intimated the reason therefor, the respondent stated:
""I guess it is about the logs"". He had lived for about twenty-five
years in the vicinity and, while the evidence does not disclose how long he had
been beachcombing, Patterson says he had purchased logs from him during the
""last year and a half anyway I believe"". Apart altogether from the
pamphlet, which does not support the respondent, a person in his position would
know that as a beachcomber he would not be entitled to take these logs out of a
private booming ground. In the ordinary circumstance the logs there would be
the property of the lessee, as, in fact, they were in this case. A beachcomber,
therefore, in collecting them would do so for the purpose of having the lessee
pay him for

[Page 613]

finding and collecting the logs
in his own (the lessee's) booming ground. There is really, in such
circumstances, no ""finding"" and no ""collecting"" in the
sense that these words would be understood in the business of beachcombing.

In these circumstances it cannot
be said that one in the position of the respondent, who collected logs in the
booming ground, could justify his doing so by stating that they were drifting.
They were drifting in one sense, but they were not drifting in an area that
would permit of one engaged in the business of beachcombing taking them into
his possession.

In Brend v. Wood[7],
the accused had been absent from the country on service with the Navy. He was
given a forged motor vehicle fuel coupon and later was charged with having that
coupon in his possession with intent to deceive. It was established that he did
not know it was forged and he satisfied the court that he had acted in good
faith. In the present case the accused had lived in the vicinity for a period
of twenty-five years and was himself, at least to some extent, engaged in the
business of beachcombing and, therefore, is not in a position at all analagous
to that of the accused in Brend v. Wood.

The beachcomber collects logs
which are lost to the owner in the sense that they are out of his control and,
in so far as his position is similar to that of one who finds lost articles,
the observations of Baron Parke in Regina v. Wm. Thurburn[8],
are pertinent. There the accused found a note which had been accidentally
dropped on the highway with no name or mark thereon to indicate the owner, nor
were there any circumstances which would enable the finder to discover to whom
the note belonged when he picked it up, nor had he any reason to believe that
the owner knew where to find it again. At p. 393 Baron Parke states:

To prevent, however, the
taking of goods from being larceny, it is essential that they should be
presumably lost, that is that they should be taken in such a place and under
such circumstances, as that the owner would be reasonably presumed by the
taker, to have abandoned them, or at least not to know where to find them.
Therefore if a horse is found feeding on an open common or on the side of a public
road, or a watch found apparently hidden in a hay stack, the taking of these

[Page 614]

would be larceny, because
the taker had no right to presume that the owner did not know where to find
them; and consequently had no right to treat them as lost goods.

The respondent did not collect
these logs ""in such a place or under such circumstances"" that he
could reasonably presume that they had been abandoned, or that he might take
them out of the possession of the party in control of the booming ground.

Bank of New South Wales v. Piper[9]
was an action for malicious prosecution arising out of a charge laid by a bank
manager against a mortgagor who had mortgaged his sheep to the bank as
security. Under s. 7 of the relevant statute (11 Vict. No. 4) the mortgagor
could not sell any of his sheep without the written consent of the mortgagee.
The mortgagor, with the oral consent of the mortgagee, sold the sheep and when
a charge was laid by the bank the Attorney General refused to proceed with it.
In the action for malicious prosecution the jury found that, while the
mortgagor did not have the written consent, he had the oral consent of the
manager of the bank and judgment was directed for the plaintiff. In the Privy
Council this was reversed. It was there held that the legislature intended to
make a sale by the mortgagor without the written consent of the mortgagee a
criminal offence and with respect to mens rea it was stated: ""…the absence
of mens rea really consists in an honest and reasonable belief entertained by
the accused of the existence of facts which, if true, would make the act
charged against him innocent"". A written consent would have made the
accused innocent of the charge. He did not claim such and, therefore, never had
""an honest and reasonable belief …of the existence of"" a written
consent ""which, if true, would make the act charged against him
innocent"". Therefore, in the opinion of the Judicial Committee, he
possessed mens rea.

In the present case the
respondent knew he was taking logs out of a booming ground under the control
and direction of the company. The fact that the logs were floating outside of a
boom does not alter or qualify the fact that while they were within the limits
of the booming ground they were in the possession of the company. Had these
logs been outside the booming ground and floating in a

[Page 615]

position and manner that one
might reasonably conclude they were out of the control of, or, in effect, lost
to the party entitled to their possession, then the beachcomber might collect
them and cause the party entitled to them to pay for his work. The respondent
did not have present to his mind any such facts. His belief was analagous to
that of Piper in the New South Wales case who thought the verbal permission sufficient.
The respondent, in taking these logs out of the possession of the company,
could not be said to have an honest and reasonable belief in the existence of
facts which, if true, would have constituted a defence and, therefore, within
the foregoing authority, he possessed mens rea.

The respondent made no effort to
see if the logs were marked. Even if he had found a mark, it is doubtful if he
would have known they were the property of the company. That, however, is not a
material circumstance. What he did know, and which is material, is that these
logs were in the company's booming ground. In this connection the language of
Lord Goddard C.J. in Hibbert v. McKiernan[10]
is pertinent. There the accused went upon a golf course and picked up certain
golf balls which had been abandoned by their owners. It was held that the golf
club had sufficient property and interest in these balls to support an
indictment for larceny. Lord Goddard C.J., in the course of his judgment,
stated:

Every householder or
occupier of land means or intends to exclude thieves and wrongdoers from the
property occupied by him, and this confers on him a special property in goods
found on his land sufficient to support an indictment if the goods are taken
therefrom, not under a claim of right, but with a felonious intent.

These cases illustrate what is
stated in Halsbury's Laws of England, 2nd Ed., Vol. 11, p. 497:

To prevent the taking from
being felonious the claim of right must be an honest one, though it may be
unfounded in law or in fact.

See also Kenny's Outlines of
Criminal Law, 1952 Ed., p. 241; Stephen's History of the Criminal Law of
England, Vol. 3, p. 124.

A reading of this record in the
light of the authorities, and I say this with the greatest possible respect to
the learned judges who hold a contrary view, leads to the conclusion,

[Page 616]

when regard is had to the area in
which the logs were floating, the knowledge of the respondent in respect to
that area and the rights of the company therein, that the respondent trespassed
upon the booming ground, took the logs fraudulently and without colour of
right, with the intent of disposing of them in a manner that deprived the
company temporarily of its property or interest therein. I am, therefore, of
the opinion that the respondent committed the offence of theft as charged and
would impose a fine of $25.

I am, therefore, of the opinion
that the appeal should be allowed.

LOCKE, J. (dissenting):—This is
an appeal by the Crown taken pursuant to leave granted by Rand J. from a
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[11]
which dismissed the appeal of the Crown from the acquittal of Shymkowich by His
Honour Judge Grimmett after a trial held in the County Court Judge's Criminal
Court of the County of Westminster.

Two charges were laid against the
respondent but the leave granted restricts the matter to be considered to the
acquittal upon the second of these, which was in the following words:—

For that the said Andrew
Shymkowich on or about the 15th day of February A.D. 1953 at South Westminster
in the County of Westminster and Province of British Columbia, unlawfully did
steal two saw logs bearing timber mark 8 over 697 within a triangle and valued
at over $25.00 and being the property of McKay and Flanagan Brothers Lumber
Mill Limited, contrary to the form of the Statute made and provided and against
the Peace of our Lady the Queen, her Crown and Dignity.

The facts disclosed by the
evidence, in so far as it is necessary to consider them, are as follows:—On the
south bank of the Fraser River, a short distance east of the City of New
Westminster, the lumber company referred to operates a lumber mill. For the
purpose of carrying on its operations, the company obtained in the year 1938
the right, granted under the provisions of the Navigable Waters Protection
Act (c. 140, R.S.C. 1927), to place a line of six dolphins at equal
distance between the easterly and westerly boundary of a 7.41 acre portion of
the Fraser River immediately adjacent their mill property to the north, a log
haulup, a line of piles fifty feet in length on the southerly

[Page 617]

boundary of the log haul-up
produced north westwardly and any other dolphins, piling or construction which
might be necessary for the more efficient operation of a saw mill. For these
privileges the lumber company paid an annual sum to the New Westminster Harbour
Commissioners. In pursuance of the rights thus granted to them by Order-in-Council,
the dolphins were installed along the northerly boundary of the booming ground
and piling was driven along the easterly or up river end of the area to which
boom sticks were attached, forming what was referred to as a standing boom
extending from the shore line approximately 135 ft. to the north, designed
apparently to prevent logs being carried out of the booming ground to the east
by the tide, and similarly to prevent logs being carried into the booming
ground by the current from the east. The booming ground was not enclosed in any
way along its northerly boundary other than by the dolphins placed there and,
while the evidence is not clear on the point, it apparently was not enclosed in
any way at its westerly extremity.

On the day in question, a boom of
logs which the lumber company had bought from the Scheller Logging Company was
tied up to the piling which had been driven in a line parallel to the southern
shore of the river and some 50 feet north of the water line between the log
haul-up and the easterly limits of the booming ground.

The respondent is a fisherman and
apparently supplements his income by beachcombing logs on the Fraser River
and, on the day in question which was a Sunday, proceeded in company with a
fifteen year old boy, Albert Hamilton, in his fishing boat up the river,
apparently in search of logs drifting on the river which he might salvage.
According to the respondent, on Saturday,
 February 14, 1953, there had been a
very heavy wind on the Fraser and there were quite a few logs drifting around
but the waves were so high they could not be salvaged. He described his actions
on the following day as follows:—

I decide I would go up river
and have a look for some logs. Going up river and passing Flanagan's booming
ground I noticed two logs drifting down and I circled the boat and came up
against the tide, it was just about slack tide by that time. By the time I got
the boat turned around the logs landed on top of the boom, at the head end of
their boom. 

[Page 618]

Circling around, coming in
against the tide, I reversed into the top of the boom and I got Ab Hamilton to
drive a couple of dogs in the logs and after I got the logs dogged up, I came
out past the boom and went down the river and tied up alongside of my float
there.

Nothing was said by the
respondent in giving his evidence in chief as justification for his actions in
going in the booming ground and taking away logs which presumably were the
property of the lumber company but, when cross-examined, he said that when he
saw the logs they were ""floating down river"". He then said that they
were floating down from the standing boom and that, at that time, the tide was
just starting to change and as he circled the boat around the tide carried them
up against the top of the boom, referring to the purchased boom above
mentioned. After saying that he knew that the logs were in a booming ground,
when asked why he went in and took possession of them, he said:—

Well, it has been the
practice, any log floating, any fisherman picks up any log that has been
floating.

He then said that:—

I couldn't tell that they
were McKay and Flanagan's logs.

In answer to further questions, he
gave the following evidence:—

Q. Did you realize that you
were taking quite a risk in picking up logs indiscriminately?

A. Not to my knowledge, I
didn't figure it was a risk picking up logs at all, because they were loose and
floating and drifting.

Q. Do you know the
difference between a floating log and a drifting log?

A. Yes.

Q. What is it?

A. Well, a floating log is
in a boom and a drift log is drifting down the river, floating loose say out of
the boomsticks.

Q. Referring to your own
statement, you saw two logs floating within a booming ground of McKay &
Flanagan Mill, didn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. You think those are drift
logs, do you?

A. Well, in a boom I regard
it—but actually this wasn't in a boom.

Q. We are talking about logs
within this booming ground.

A. Well, they could have
drifted down there.

Q. They weren't drifting,
were they?

A. Yes, they were drifting.

Q. Where were they drifting?

A. They were drifting down
the river.

[Page 619]

Q. Did you see those logs
being blown in there?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. So you don't know how
they got there?

A. No, I don't.

When asked by the learned trial
Judge as to whether he thought he was entitled to go in to the booming ground
and take the two logs, he said he thought that he was. Asked by counsel for the
Crown where he got this information, he said it was contained in a pamphlet
issued by the Forest Branch of the B.C. Government. Whether he had seen this
before the date in question does not appear. However, the document referred to,
which had been received in evidence though objected to by counsel for the
Crown, was apparently issued for the information of beachcombers and expressed
certain views as to their civil rights and informed them that any log found by
them which did not bear a registered timber-mark was deemed to be the property
of the Crown: if the log bore a registered mark it was prima facie evidence
that it was the property of the registered owner of the mark. Certain parts of
section 394 of the Criminal Code were referred to and information as to
the necessity of paying stumpage or royalty on such logs was given.

At the request of the
respondent's counsel, the following passage was read into the evidence:—

The Forest Service grants no
authority to any person either by licence or permit to engage in the beachcombing
of logs but does not attempt to prohibit or restrict such ventures providing
that logs are not stolen or obtained by other unlawful methods.

Following this, the respondent
was asked if he understood what stealing was and he said that he understood
that if you take a log out of a boom that is stealing and said finally:—

I was acting on the
knowledge that probably the tide or wind blew them logs in there.

Hamilton, who was called as a
witness by the Crown, said that, as the respondent's fishing boat was passing
the booming ground, they saw the two logs starting to drift down from the
standing boom and, by the time they got in to the booming ground, they had been
carried, apparently by the current, to the most easterly end of the purchased
boom which, he said, was tied up some 30 or 40 feet from 

[Page 620]

the shore and indicated the place
at which the logs came to rest against it as a point some 50 feet from the
shore. This, as shown upon a sketch showing the dimensions of the booming
grounds, would be some 90 to 100 feet to the south of the line of dolphins
along the northerly limit of the booming grounds.

Persons logging on Crown lands in
the Province of British Columbia are required by the provisions of the Part IX
of the Forest Act (c. 128, R.S.B.C. 1948) to mark each log with a timber-mark
issued by the Forest Service in such a manner that it is readily discernible
when the log is floated. The logs in the purchased boom and the two logs in
question had been cut on a timber sale in the Chilliwack River Valley by
the Collins Macken Lumber Company of Chilliwack who had registered a timbermark 8/697 within a
triangle for that timber sale. It was shown that the two logs in question were
stamped with this mark but the respondent does not appear to have examined them
to ascertain whether they bore a timber-mark.

The respondent had apparently
previously accumulated a number of logs presumably found adrift in the river
and on February 16, 1953, he purported to sell these or his interest in
them, with the two taken from the lumber company's booming ground, to Richard
Patterson, a fisherman who also dealt in beachcombed logs. Patterson was
familiar with the instructions given in the circular issued by the Forest
Branch above referred to. On the 17th of February he had the logs scaled by an
official scaler of the Forest Branch and paid to the Department timber
royalties upon such of the logs as bore a timber-mark and stumpage upon those
where no such mark was visible. The Scale and Royalty Account for this sum does
not show any logs bearing the mark 8/697, the scaler apparently not observing
the mark upon these logs. According to Patterson, the practice established by
the Forest Branch is that, when logs bearing a registered mark are found adrift
and beach-combed, the person finding or having possession of the logs reports
the fact to the local office of the B.C.
 Forest Service and the registered owner of the mark is notified of the fact.
As between dealers such as Patterson and loggers or lumber mill operators who
are either registered as owners of a timber-mark or have purchased logs so
marked, the usual 

[Page 621]

practice is to pay the dealers
fifty per cent of the market value of the logs as salvage. As to logs upon
which there is no visible timber-mark, the dealer, after paying stumpage to the
Forest Branch, proceeds to sell them on the footing, apparently, that they have
been purchased from the Crown. I think it is sufficiently clear from the
evidence of this witness that a person such as Shymkowich finding a log adrift
in the river bearing a timber-mark might expect, after paying the timber
royalty, that the owner would deal with him in the same manner as with
Patterson.

It was on February 19 that the
two logs in question and three other logs similarly marked were found by the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Patterson's boom. While there was no evidence
that the three logs so marked were taken from the booming grounds of the McKay
and Flanagan Lumber Company or that they had purchased all of the logs so marked
by the Collins and Macken Lumber Company, it was apparently assumed that they
were their property and they were returned to them, Patterson delivering the
logs and making no claim for salvage.

In delivering judgment, the
learned County Court Judge, after referring to certain of the evidence which
had been given before him, said in part:—

The accused says he did not
know he was doing anything wrong in picking up the floating logs which were not
contained in a boom. It is interesting to note that in the Regina vs Watts and
Gaunt case beach-combed logs are described there as 'any logs which are
separated from the booms and floating or resting on the shore.' The only
complication in this particular case is that the accused actually entered a
recognized booming ground to retrieve the floating logs which he thought were
drift logs.

I think that mens rea, that
is an intent to do wrong, is an integral part of this offence and must be
proved, and in this connection, I feel that the story and the actions of the
accused have created more than a reasonable doubt in my mind as to there being
any intent on his part to do anything wrong, and it is of course well
established practice that the accused shall be entitled to any reasonable
doubt. In view of this, I feel I must dismiss the charge.

The reasons for the judgment of
the Court of Appeal were delivered by the Chief Justice of British Columbia.
They refer only to the first of the two charges which had been laid under
section 394(a) (1) of the Code. It is, however, quite clear that the
remarks of the learned Chief Justice were intended equally to apply to the
second charge, with which alone we are concerned. Agreeing with the learned
trial 

[Page 622]

Judge that mens rea was an
essential element of the offence and finding that there was evidence to support
his conclusion that there was no mens rea on the part of the respondent,
the learned Chief Justice found that there was no error in law. He further
expressed the opinion that the evidence disclosed that the respondent was under
the honest impression that he had the right to take possession of the logs in
order to recover some portion of their value from the owners.

The relevant part of the
definition of theft contained in section 347 of the Criminal Code reads:—

Theft or stealing is the act
of fraudulently and without colour of right taking, or fraudulently and without
colour of right converting to the use of any person, anything capable of being
stolen, with intent,

(a) to deprive the
owner, or any person having any special property or interest therein,
temporarily or absolutely of such thing or of such property or interest.

This portion of the definition
appeared in the same terms when the Criminal Code was first enacted in
1892 as section 305. The definition does not appear to have been taken from the
English Statutes enacted up to that time dealing with the offence of larceny
under that name (c. 96, 24-25 Vict. and c. 116, 31-32 Vict.), but rather to
embody the accepted definition of the offence of larceny at common law. To
constitute the offence, the act must be done fraudulently and without colour of
right. In Stephen's History of the Criminal Law, Vol. 3, p. 124, the learned
author says:—

The expression 'fraudulent
misappropriation of property' obviously involves three elements: fraud,
property capable of being misappropriated, and misappropriation in its various
forms. Fraud, as I have observed elsewhere, involves, speaking generally, the
idea of injury wilfully effected or intended to be effected by deceit or secretly,
though it is not inconsistent with open force. It is, however, essential to
fraud that the fraudulent person's conduct should not merely be wrongful, but
should be intentionally and knowingly wrongful. Fraud is inconsistent with a
claim of right made in good faith to do the act complained of. A man who takes
possession of property which he really believes to be his own does not take it
fraudulently, however unfounded his claim may be. This, if not the only, is
nearly the only case in which ignorance of the law affects the legal character
of acts done under its influence.

In East's Pleas of the Crown,
Vol. 2, p. 659, in dealing with the offence of larceny, it is
said:—

And here it may be proper to
remark, that in any case if there be any fair pretence of property or right in
the prisoner, or if it be brought into doubt at all, the court will direct an
acquittal.

[Page 623]

In Reg. v. Reed[12],
where the accused person had found a five-pound note and appropriated it, the
Court directed the jury to consider the state of the finder's mind and ruled
that if the jury thought the person really believed the note to be her own by
right of finding they should not bring in a verdict of guilty on the indictment
for larceny. Coleridge, J. said in part (p. 308):—

Ignorance of the law cannot
excuse any person; but, at the same time, when the question is, with what
intent a person takes, we cannot help looking into their state of mind; as, if
a person take what he believes to be his own, it is impossible to say that he
is guilty of felony.

In Reg. v. Farnborough[13],
Lord Russell of Killowen, delivering the judgment of a Court consisting of
himself, Pollock B., Grantham, Lawrence and Wright, JJ. said that to shown an
animus furandi on the part of the prisoner was an essential ingredient of the
crime of larceny and was a matter to be decided by the jury, a statement
referred to and adopted by the Court of Appeal in Rex v. Bernhard[14].

These statements of the law are
supported by the statement of Blackburn, J. to the jury in Reg. v. Wade[15],
referred to by the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia, and the result of
the authorities is, in my opinion, correctly stated in the passage from Kenny's
Outlines of Criminal Law, at p. 241, quoted by him.

The evidence as to the extent of
the rights of the lumber company to the booming ground in question is not
entirely clear. The Order-in-Council relied upon as evidence as to such rights
simply permitted the installation of the dolphins and other works to which I
have above referred, but did not purport to give to the company the exclusive
right of possession and expressly stipulated that the works should be
constructed so as not to interfere with navigation in any way. It is, however,
unnecessary, in my opinion, to decide whether in entering the booming ground
the respondent was committing a trespass. The accused had sworn that he thought
that probably the tide or wind carried the two logs into the enclosure, a
statement which apparently the learned County Court Judge understood as meaning
that they had theretofore been adrift in the main stream, where the

[Page 624]

respondent thought he would have
been entitled to take them into possession for the purpose of obtaining
salvage, and had simply floated into the booming ground and were not the property
of the lumber company. I do not think the question to be determined is affected
by section 22 of the Criminal Code stating that ignorance of the law is
not an excuse for any offence committed, since the question to be determined is
whether or not the respondent committed any offence. Other than to construe the
language of the Code defining theft, I see no question of law in this
matter other than as to whether there was any evidence upon which the learned
County Court Judge could find that the respondent took possession of the logs
believing that he was entitled to do so with the intention not of stealing them
but of profiting by obtaining salvage from the owners if they were found, or
which left him in such doubt as to require him to acquit him. I respectfully
agree with the Chief Justice of British Columbia that there was evidence upon
which the trial Judge could so find.

I would dismiss this appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Conspiracy to
commit indictable offence—Gist of offence—Whether necessary to have intention
to commit the indictable offence—Criminal Code, s. 573.

It is misdirection for a trial
judge to tell the jury, at the trial of a person charged of having conspired
with another person to commit the indictable offence of kidnapping, that the
offence of conspiracy was complete by the making of the agreement to kidnap
even though the other alleged conspirator never at any time had had any
intention of carrying the agreement into effect. The mere agreement, without
the intention of both parties to carry into effect the common design, is not
sufficient. There must exist an intention not only to agree but also an intention
to put the common design into effect.

Per Locke J. (dissenting): The
gist of the offence of conspiracy is the agreement of two or more persons to
commit any indictable offence, and the mens rea is to be found in the intention
to offend against the penal provisions of an act. Therefore, the agreement
entered here between the two conspirators to commit the offence of kidnapping
was a conspiracy within the meaning of s. 573 of the Criminal Code. There was
an agreement in the eyes of the law and the fact that one of the parties in the
agreement did not intend to carry out his part of the bargain could not affect
the legal nature of the arrangement.

The portion of the judgment of
Willes J. in Mulcahy v. The Queen ((1868) L.R. 3 H.L. 306),
purporting to define criminal conspiracy, was never intended as such, but
rather was it a statement of the offence covered by the statute under which
that case was tried.

R. S. Wright's The Law of
Criminal Conspiracies and Agreements (1873 ed.); Poulterers Case
(1611) 9 Co. Rep. 55b; Reg. v. Best (1705) 1 Salk. 174; O'Connell
v. Reg. (1844) 11 Cl. & F. 155; Reg. v. Aspinall
(1876) L.R. 2 Q.B.D. 48; Brodie v. The King [1936] S.C.R. 188 and
Bank of New South Wales v. Piper [1897] A.C. 383 referred to.

Per Fauteux J. (dissenting): In
the circumstances of this case, the exchange of promises could not be treated
as having never existed because of the alleged mental reservation on the part
of one of the two parties. Mental reservations are not apt to defeat the
natural consequences of words accompanied by deeds. In this case, the common
intention was assented to and encouraged by word and by deeds, and that was
sufficient to constitute the conspiracy even though one of the parties did not
intend to go through with the execution of the agreement.

[Page 667]

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], allowing, Robertson J. dissenting, the appeal of
the respondent from his conviction on a charge of having conspired to kidnap
and ordering a new trial.

T. G. Norris Q.C. for the
appellant.

J. Stanton and G. M.
Bleakney for the respondent.

TASCHEREAU, J.:—The Attorney
General of British Columbia appeals from a judgment of the Court of Appeal[2]
which ordered a new trial. It held that there had been misdirection.

The charge for which the
respondent was convicted was that, in the City of Vancouver, British Columbia,
between the 30th day of November, 1952, and the 14th day of January, 1953, the
respondent unlawfully conspired with one Walter John Tulley and others, to commit
a certain indictable offence, namely, kidnapping.

Tulley, the alleged co-conspirator,
was not charged, but at the trial, being called as a Crown witness, he gave an
account of various meetings he had with the respondent, and explained that both
had agreed, at the request of the latter, to kidnap one Joan Margaret
Pritchard. He said in his evidence that he never had any intention of going
through with this plan, but was just fooling the respondent, or hoaxing him. He
also explained that he denounced the whole scheme to the police authorities,
and the respondent was arrested.

The learned trial Judge in his
charge said:—

Counsel for the accused has
suggested that the offence is not complete, because Tulley, in his own
evidence, said that he had had at no time any intention of carrying out that
agreement. I tell you as a matter of law, gentlemen, that the offence was
complete, if, in point of fact, the accused and Tulley did make the
agreement which is charged against him, even though Tulley never at any time
had any intention of carrying the agreement into effect.

The Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice
Robertson dissenting, held that this constituted misdirection, and therefore,
ordered a new trial.

The contention of the respondent
which was accepted by the majority of the Court of Appeal, is that Tulley, not
having any intention to carry through the common design,

[Page 668]

could not be a party to the
conspiracy, and that therefore, O'Brien the respondent, could not alone be
found guilty of the crime. It is common ground that no others were involved in
the conspiracy. The mere agreement, without any intention to carry into effect
the common design would, according to the submission of the appellant, be
sufficient.

I think there has been some
confusion as to the element of intention which is necessary to constitute the
offence. It is, of course, essential that the conspirators have the intention
to agree, and this agreement must be complete. There must also be a common
design to do something unlawful, or something lawful by illegal means. Although
it is not necessary that there should be an overt act in furtherance of the
conspiracy, to complete the crime, I have no doubt that there must exist an
intention to put the common design into effect. A common design necessarily
involves an intention. Both are synonymous. The intention cannot be anything
else but the will to attain the object of the agreement. I cannot imagine
several conspirators agreeing to defraud, to restrain trade, or to commit any
indictable offence, without having the intention to reach the common goal.

I fully agree with some of the
statements that have been made by the Court of Appeal of Quebec in Rex
v. Kotyszyn[3].
The head note reads:—

There was no common design
between the accused and the policewoman, and there was no agreement between
them since the policewoman had no intention of undergoing the operation.
Consequently there was neither a conspiracy nor an attempt to
conspire.

In the same case, at page 269,
Mr. Justice MacKinnon said:—

There can be no conspiracy
when one wants to do a thing and the other does not want to do it.

Stephen (Commentaries on the laws
of England, 21st Ed., Vol. 4) says at page 166:—

The object of the agreement
may be the accomplishment of an unlawful act, or of a lawful act by unlawful
means. In other words it must be unlawful either in its aims or in its
methods.

The two elements of agreement and
of common design are specifically stated to be essential ingredients of
the crime of conspiracy. Willes, J. in Mulcahy v. The Queen[4]:

[Page 669]

A conspiracy consists not
merely in the intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or more to
do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. So long as such a
design rests in intention only, it is not indictable. When two agree to carry
it into effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and the act of each of the
parties… punishable if for a criminal object…

Vide also Rex v. McCutcheon[5].

This is not the case of the
conspirator, who after having completed the crime, withdraws from the
conspiracy. If a person, with one or several others, agrees to commit an
unlawful act, and later, after having had the intention to carry it through,
refuses to put the plan into effect, that person is nevertheless guilty,
because all the ingredients of conspiracy can be found in the accused's
conduct. But, when the conspiracy has never existed, there can be no
withdrawal.

The definition of conspiracy
itself supposes an aim. People do not conspire unless they have an object in
view. The law punishes conspiracy so that the unlawful object is not attained.
It considers that several persons who agree together to commit an unlawful act,
are a menace to society, and even if they do nothing in furtherance of their
common design, the state intervenes to exercise a repressive action, so that
the intention is not materialized, and does not become harmful to any one. The
intention must necessarily be present because it is the unlawful act
necessarily flowing from the intention, that the state wishes to prevent.

In the case at bar, there is
evidence that although he made an agreement with the respondent, Tulley never
intended to carry the plan through and kidnap Mrs. Pritchard. On the other
hand, there is also evidence that may indicate that he intended to attain the
object of the agreement. Did Tulley have this intention or not? This is a
question for the jury, and I would invade a domain which is not mine, if I
attempted to answer it.

It has been said that if the
submission of the respondent were the law, it would be impossible to obtain a
conviction on a charge of conspiracy, because the mental state of an accused
very often remains in the sphere of uncertainty. All crimes where intention is
an essential element would then become impossible to prove. Various factors
have to

[Page 670]

come into play, and with their
help it is then possible to determine what the intention was. There is a
presumption for instance, that a person who does an act intends to do it. As
well, numerous circumstances will indicate if an alleged thief intended to rob,
or if a killer intended to murder. Conspiracy is not in a different class. It
is within the exclusive province of the jury, to weigh all the evidence and to
determine all these questions of fact, and to say whether the intentional
element is revealed by the evidence.

But I do think that the jury were
not properly instructed when they were told that, even without the intention to
commit the kipnapping, which was necessarily the common design, the conspiracy
was complete by the agreement. The jury were not free to weigh the evidence
because, being improperly instructed, they had to disregard what is in my view
one of the most important elements of the crime for which the accused was
charged.

I agree with the Court of Appeal that
there was misdirection, and that consequently there must be a new trial. It has
been suggested that the Court of Appeal should have dismissed the appeal, on
the ground that although there was misdirection, a properly instructed jury
would have necessarily come to the same conclusion. (Cr. Code 1014). With this
proposition, I entirely disagree. There is evidence that would justify a
properly instructed jury to acquit or to convict, and I do not think in either
alternative, that the verdict would be set aside as unreasonable.

I would dismiss the appeal.

RAND J.:—I agree that a conspiracy requires an actual
intention in both parties at the moment of exchanging the words of agreement to
participate in the act proposed; mere words purporting agreement without an
assenting mind to the act proposed are not sufficient. The point of difference
between the judgments below is the meaning to be given the word
""agreement"". In the opinion of Robertson J.A.[6]
there was an agreement when Tulley in effect said ""I will"" even
though at that moment his mind was ""I won't"". The mens rea here
appears to lie in the intent to utter the words ""I will""; but this
severance of the intention to speak the words from that of carrying out the
action they signify

[Page 671]

is a refinement that seems to me
to be out of place in a common law crime. Modern statutes have introduced
offences in which the objective or physical acts themselves are struck at but
they are irrelevant to the unwritten offences. Bishop's Criminal Law, 9th Ed.
Vol. II, p. 131 puts it thus:—

Obviously there must be,
between the conspirators, a concert of will and endeavor, not a mere knowledge,
acquiescence or approval or a mere several attempt to accomplish the particular
wrong…. Where there are only two, and one simply joins in appearance to draw
the other on, neither is a conspirator.

and at p. 132:—

As soon as this union of
will is perfected, the offence of conspiracy is complete,—no act beyond is
required…. It is sufficient if the minds of the parties meet understandingly so
as to bring about an intelligent and deliberate agreement to do the acts and
commit the offence charged, although such agreement be not manifested by any
formal words.

The question raised is, in my
opinion, concluded by the judgment of the House of Lords in Mulcahy v. The
Queen[7].
In that case a prosecution had been brought under The Crown and Government
Security Act, 11 Vict., c. 12. The indictment following the language of the
statute alleged that the accused with five other persons ""did feloniously
and wickedly compass, imagine, invent, devise, and intend to deprive and depose
Our Lady the Queen from the style, honour, and royal name of the Imperial Crown
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland"" and proceeded to
declare that the accused did ""express, utter, and declare by divers overt
acts and deeds hereinafter mentioned, that is to say"". The overt acts were
then alleged:—

In order to fulfill, perfect
and bring to effect this felonious compassing, imagination, invention, devise
and intention aforesaid, they… feloniously and wickedly did combine, conspire,
confederate, and agree with (19 other persons all named) and with divers other
evilly disposed persons, to the jurors aforesaid unknown to raise, make, and
levy insurrection and rebellion against Our said Lady the Queen within this
realm.

The statute required the
expression of compassing and intending by overt acts and it was necessary,
therefore, to allege them. The question raised was whether a conspiracy was
such an act.

[Page 672]

The House held that it was. This
means that the act of conspiracy was sufficient to establish both the
compassing and the intention to do the forbidden act, or to put it in another
form, that in conspiracy there is not only agreement to do the act proposed signified
by words or other means of communication, but also the coexistent intent in
each to do it. If that were not so, conspiracy would not have evidenced the intention
of those charged ""to deprive and depose, etc."" The language of Willes
J. at p. 317 of the report bears out that view. In the course of considering
the argument that conspiracy rests in intention only and that an overt act must
consist in some external manifestation or deed, he says:—

A conspiracy consists not
merely in the intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or more to
do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. So long as such a
design rests in intention only, it is not indictable. When two agree to carry
it into effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and the act of each of the
parties, promise against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being
enforced, if lawful, punishable if for a criminal object or for the use of
criminal means.

In that language he distinguishes
between the intention of each person severally and the communicated assent
between them to carry out the intention. In stressing the necessity for
agreement he assumes the existence of intent.

The same view is expressed in Rex
v. Dowling[8].
It appears that one of the witnesses had in appearance been involved in the
conspiracy and it had been urged that being an accomplice his evidence required
corroboration. Erle J., in directing the jury on this, said:—

He was not an accomplice,
for he did not enter the conspiracy with the mind of a co-conspirator,
but with the intention of betraying it to the police, with whom he was in
communication.

In The Queen v. Aspinall[9],
Brett J.A., dealing with one of the counts in the indictment for conspiracy to
defraud, expressed himself thus:—

If the second count in this
indictment contains averments sufficiently stated which are enough to shew
sufficiently that the defendants unlawfully, i.e. with minds intending to do
wrong, agreed by false pretences to cheat and defraud… it sufficiently
alleges a criminal conspiracy within the last rule above enunciated.

[Page 673]

That rule was,

An agreement made with a
fraudulent or wicked mind to do that which, if done, would give to the
prosecutor a right of suit founded on fraud, or on violence exercised on or
towards him, is a criminal conspiracy.

On the contrary view, even if
both parties had been without the intent to carry out the scheme, each seeking
to incriminate the other, they would have drawn guilt upon themselves.

Assuming, then, the truth of the
evidence of Tulley that at no time did he ever intend to go along with the
proposal made to him, there was no conspiracy.

I would, therefore, dismiss the
appeal.

ESTEY, J.:—The respondent was
found guilty before a jury upon an indictment that charged that he conspired with
Tulley and others to kidnap Mrs. P. The learned judges in the Court of Appeal[10],
Mr. Justice Robertson dissenting, were of the opinion that there had been
misdirection and directed a new trial. The passage held to constitute
misdirection reads as follows:

Counsel for the accused has
suggested that the offence is not complete, because Tully, in his own evidence,
said that he had had at no time any intention of carrying out that agreement. I
tell you as a matter of law, gentlemen, that the offence was complete, if, in
point of fact, the accused and Tully did make the agreement which is charged
against him, even though Tully never at any time had any intention of carrying
the agreement into effect.

The contention is that the
learned trial judge was in error in stating that even though Tulley never, at
any time, had any intention of carrying the agreement into effect, the offence
was completed. Tulley was not charged, but was called as a witness on behalf of
the Crown. O'Brien gave evidence on his own behalf. These parties, upon all
essential points, are in complete disagreement. It is clear, however, that no
others were involved and, therefore, if there was a conspiracy, it existed only
between O'Brien and Tulley.

In view of the objection to the
charge, it will be necessary to summarize only Tulley's evidence. Early in
December O'Brien approached him and suggested, and it was agreed, that he would
assist O'Brien to kidnap Mrs. P. for the sum

[Page 674]

of $500. During one of the first
conversations he received $10. O'Brien also showed him where Mrs. P. lived and,
as Mrs. P. was standing in the window, he pointed her out as the lady he
desired to kidnap. He accompanied O'Brien to White Rock to find a house where
they might take Mrs. P., but none was found. Before Christmas he received $190.
In January he received $40 to pay for the rent of a house that he led O'Brien
to believe was available for rent. He did not, however, spend this $40, but
retained it, making a total of $240 that he had received from O'Brien and which
he kept. In January, though a day was not fixed for the kidnapping, O'Brien was
pressing that it ought to be done as quickly as possible. On January 12 Tulley
told Mrs. P. of O'Brien's intentions, which led to the arrest and prosecution
of O'Brien. Tulley deposed to the foregoing and stated that though he had
entered into an agreement with O'Brien to kidnap Mrs. P. that never, at any
time, had he intended to carry out the agreement. O'Brien denies that at any
time he entered into an agreement to kidnap Mrs. P. He admits the payment of
the three sums of money—$10, $190 and $40—but explains these in a manner that
has no relation to the kidnapping, and likewise the trips looking for the
houses.

Though dealt with in several
sections of the Criminal Code, the result is that conspiracy to commit
any indictable offence is itself an indictable offence. Nowhere, however, does
the Code define a conspiracy. The definition, therefore, must be found
in the common law. Since 1868 the accepted definition has been that of Mr.
Justice Willes in delivering the opinion of the judges in Mulcahy v. The
Queen[11]:

A conspiracy consists not
merely in the intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or more to
do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. So long as such a
design rests in intention only, it is not indictable. When two agree to carry
it into effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and the act of each of the
parties, promise against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being
enforced, if lawful, punishable if for a criminal object or for the use of
criminal means.

Mulcahy was indicted under An
Act for the better Security of the Crown and Government of the United Kingdom (11 & 12 Vict., c. 12). This statute, in part, provides that

[Page 675]

If any Person… shall, …
compass, … or intend to deprive or depose our most Gracious Lady the Queen, …
and such Compassings, … Intentions, or any of them, shall express, utter, or
declare, … by any overt Act or Deed, every Person so offending shall be guilty
of Felony, …

It was the contention of the
prosecution in the Mulcahy case that his conspiracy with nineteen others to
stir up and incite insurrection and rebellion constituted an overt act within
the meaning of the statute.

Mulcahy was convicted and his
conviction affirmed in the Court of Queen's Bench in Ireland. Upon
a further proceeding by way of writ of error his conviction came before the
House of Lords. Their Lordships solicited the opinion of the judges and this
was delivered by the Honourable Mr. Justice Willes, in the course of which he
gave expression to the definition of a conspiracy above quoted and which, as I
have said, has been accepted since 1868.

The point material to this
discussion was stated by Mr. Justice Willes at p. 316:

The main point of this
question is, whether a conspiracy to do an unlawful act in promotion of a
felonious design can be a sufficient ""overt act"" to express that
design within the 11 Vict. c. 12. The first count and the first overt act
sufficiently raise that question.

This point, particularly as it
was contended on behalf of Mulcahy that, as conspiracy rested in intention
only, it could not be an overt act within the meaning of the statute, required
a consideration of what constituted a conspiracy and, where it existed, would
it be accepted as an overt act and, if so, was it an overt act within the
meaning of the statute. The statute under which Mulcahy was indicted did not
contain a definition of conspiracy and it would appear that Mr. Justice Willes
and the learned judges on whose behalf he was writing were setting forth their
conception of conspiracy under the common law. Under this definition a
conspiracy does not exist in the mere intention to commit an unlawful act, but
when two or more entertain that intention and embody their common design in an
agreement the conspiracy is complete. It is the concluding of the agreement
which constitutes the overt act. Then, specificially referring to whether the
conspiracy constituted an overt act within the meaning of the statute, Mr.
Justice Willes stated at p. 317:

[Page 676]

The history of the statute
also points clearly to the conclusion that a conspiracy is a sufficient overt
act, and, indeed, seems to shew that the language of the Act, following that of
36 Geo. 3, c. 7, was framed to confirm, and even extend, the decisions upon the
construction of Statute of Treasons, and to preclude all such questions for the
future.

The opinion of the learned judges
expressed by Mr. Justice Willes was approved by all of their Lordships sitting
in the House of Lords. Lord Chelmsford, while approving of Mr. Justice Willes's
opinion, stated the grounds upon which he arrived at the same conclusion. At p.
328 he stated:

It is a mistake to say that
conspiracy rests in intention only. It cannot exist without the consent of two
or more persons, and their agreement is an act in advancement of the intention
which each of them has conceived in his mind. The argument confounds the secret
arrangement of the conspirators amongst themselves with the secret intention
which each must have previously had in his own mind, and which did not issue in
act until it displayed itself by mutual consultation and agreement.

Though the precise point with
which we are here concerned was not before the court in the Mulcahy case, the
language of both Mr. Justice Willes and Lord Chelmsford, it seems to me,
indicates the answer. In that case, as in all cases of felony, or, under the Code,
indictable offences, unless otherwise provided, the requisite mens rea must be
found. This can only be found, when conspiracy is charged, if the mental
attitude of the parties is such that each possesses a common design or
intention to do an unlawful act or a lawful act by unlawful means. Lord
Chelmsford gives expression to the same view in the passage already quoted. In
this passage he emphasizes that it is the agreement to carry out the intention
which each has conceived in his mind. If, therefore, where only two parties are
involved, one has not ""conceived in his mind"" that intention, there
can be no agreement evidencing a common design and, therefore, the offence of
conspiracy is not completed. In this case, as it is so often throughout the
criminal law, the nature and character of the act is determined by the
intention of the party committing it.

Again in Russell on Crime, 10th
Ed., at p. 1798, it is stated:

The external or overt act of
the crime is concert by which mutual consent to a common purpose is exchanged.

[Page 677]

This further emphasizes that
there must be ""mutual consent to a common purpose"". Tulley's conduct
was undoubtedly reprehensible, whether he intended to conspire, or to obtain
money wrongfully from respondent, or to accomplish some other wrongful purpose.
We are here only concerned with whether he possessed an intention to conspire
with the respondent to kidnap Mrs. P. If he had such an intention at the time
of the agreement and subsequently withdrew, he is none the less guilty. If,
however, he never possessed a common design or intention with respondent to
kidnap Mrs. P., then there was no conspiracy.

I am, therefore, in respectful
agreement with the learned judges who have held that there was misdirection.
While there was evidence to support the verdict, it cannot be said that a jury,
properly directed, would have necessarily reached the same conclusion. I would,
therefore, affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal directing a new trial.

The appeal should be dismissed.

LOCKE J. (dissenting):—This is an
appeal by the Crown from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[12] by which the appeal of Daniel O'Brien from his
conviction of conspiracy to kidnap Joan Margaret Pritchard was allowed and a
new trial directed. Mr. Justice Bird, with whom the Chief Justice of British
Columbia agreed, delivered the judgment of the majority of the Court. Mr.
Justice Robertson dissented and would have dismissed the appeal.

O'Brien was charged in that he,
at the City of Vancouver, between November 30, 1952 and January 14, 1953:—

Did unlawfully conspire,
combine, confederate and agree together with Walter John Tulley, and together
with divers other persons unknown, to commit a certain indictable offence,
namely kidnapping, by then and there conspiring, combining, confederating and
agreeing together to unlawfully kidnap Joan Margaret Pritchard with intent to
cause her to be secretly confined within Canada against her will, against the
form of the Statute in such case made and provided.

On this charge he was tried
before Davey J. and a jury at Vancouver, found guilty and thereafter sentenced to five
years' penal servitude.

[Page 678]

O'Brien appealed to the Court of
Appeal on the ground of misdirection in the charge to the jury and it was upon
this ground that the majority of the Court considered there should be a new
trial.

It is necessary for the
determination of the matter to examine closely the evidence given on behalf of
the Crown at the trial. Tulley, referred to in the indictment, had apparently
known O'Brien for several years. On December 11, 1952, Tulley was unemployed
and apparently penniless. His evidence was that that day he met the accused in Vancouver,
when the latter asked him to go with him to a club where they had some drinks
together. At this time O'Brien told him, without mentioning her name, that he
had been going with a young woman for two years, that she had left him and that
he was trying to get her back. During the time that they were together, Tulley
said that O'Brien told him that the only way he could figure out to do this was
to kidnap her. At the same time, he said that O'Brien, learning that he was
""broke"", gave him $10. Two or three days later, the two men met by
arrangement and discussed plans for kidnapping the woman and Tulley said that
O'Brien then said that if he would ""stick with him and see him through
this thing he would do right by me in regard to money"" and mentioned the
sum of $500. According to Tulley, what O'Brien proposed was that they would
kidnap the woman and conceal her in a house and Tulley said that he thought it
would be possible to get a satisfactory place for this purpose at White Rock, a
village near the American border on the coast south of Vancouver. On
December 18, 1952, Tulley hired a U-Drive car and drove with O'Brien
to White Rock. The search there for a suitable house in which to conceal the
woman was unsuccessful and the two returned to Vancouver. Tulley told O'Brien
that he knew a fisherman in Vancouver from whom he thought they could get a
house. This statement, he admitted, was untrue and the fisherman an imaginary
person. On the day following, the two men met and Tulley asked O'Brien if he
would loan him a couple of hundred dollars. O'Brien agreed and the amount was
paid but not as a loan but rather as a payment on account of the promised sum
of $500 to assist in the 

[Page 679]

kidnapping. In spite of this
fact, Tulley said that he offered O'Brien an I.O.U. for the money but this the
latter refused, saying that he:—

Would trust me and if I
would stick with him he would stick by me, he would keep his promise.

Tulley, according to his story,
continuing the deception of O'Brien told him that he did not think he would be
able to get the fisherman's house before some time in January. Thereafter they
met several times and discussed the manner in which they were to carry out the
proposed kidnapping. O'Brien's plans according to Tulley, were that they would
go together to Mrs. Pritchard's house when Tulley was to knock on the door and
when she came seize her, put tape over her mouth, put her in the back seat of a
car and take her to the house selected.

Around New Year's Tulley says
that he borrowed a car and drove out to East
 52nd Street in Vancouver
with O'Brien and pointed out a house which, he said, he had in mind as the
place to conceal the woman and that O'Brien approved of it. Tulley said that
his statements as to this house were also false, that he had merely picked it
at random and had made no arrangements to rent it. At the same time, the two of
them discussed how they were going to get food into the house while the woman
was concealed there and, according to Tulley, O'Brien then stated that he was
going to either make her come with him or she would go back a very sorry woman.
Later that day, Tulley said that he told O'Brien that the rent of the house
would be $40 and the latter gave him the money. No arrangements had been made
to rent the place and Tulley apparently appropriated the money to his own use.
About January 12, O'Brien who had, according to Tulley, been trying to speak to
the woman on the telephone, said that they must carry out their plan at once,
whereupon Tulley decided to inform Mrs. Pritchard and her husband of what
O'Brien proposed and he was then taken in charge by the Police.

During the cross-examination of
Tulley at the trial, the statements were made which gave rise to the claim of
misdirection. The relevant portion of the evidence reads:—

Q. Now isn't it a fact that
you at no time did any more than pretend to O'Brien that you would assist him
in this kidnapping? 

A. I didn't get the
question.

[Page 680]

Q. Perhaps I can assist you.
I am going to read to you something that you said at the Preliminary Hearing. I
would direct your attention to page 39, my lord, about the fifth line from the
top of the page:

Q. You had no intention of
going through with this scheme you are telling us about, did you?

A. This kidnapping? 

Q. Yes. 

A. No.

Q. Were you asked that
question on the Preliminary Hearing and did you make the answer which I have
read to you on oath?

A. I did. 

Q. Is it true? 

A. It is. 

Q. I will proceed:

Q. No, no of course not. And
you didn't agree in any way with O'Brien that you would do such a thing, did
you?

A. Yes.

Q. You mean ""yes""
you did make such an agreement?

A. With him, yes.

Q. But you had no intention
of carrying it out?

A. No.

Q. You were just fooling
him, eh?

A. Yes.

Q. Were you asked those
questions at the preliminary hearing and did you make those answers on oath?

A. I did.

Q. Are they true?

A. They are.

Q. In other words, witness,
you were just hoaxing him, weren't you?

A. I was.

In charging the jury, the learned
trial Judge instructed them that, as a matter of law, the offence of conspiracy
was complete if in point of fact the accused and Tulley did make the agreement,
even though Tulley never at any time had any intention of carrying his part of
it into effect.

Bird J.A. considered that the
charge was in this respect inaccurate, since the burden was upon the Crown to
prove that each of the participants had the intent that the agreement should be
carried into effect by one or both of them and that since, if the quoted
portion of Tulley's evidence should be believed by the Jury, the intent was
that of O'Brien alone, he could not be found guilty of conspiracy. As the
question as to whether Tulley did in fact intend to carry out his agreement at
the time he made it had not been left to the jury, he considered there should
be a new trial.

[Page 681]

Robertson J.A. was of a contrary
opinion, considering that the gist of the offence was the agreement itself and
that as Tulley, on his own statement, had intended to make the agreement,
whether or not he intended to carry it into effect, the conspiracy was proved
if the evidence were to be believed. Agreeing with the opinion of the majority
that mens rea must be shown, he said in part:—

I think in this case mens
rea was proved by the mere entering into the agreement. If one person does the
act of agreeing with another person to commit an indictable offence, intending
to do that act (that is to say the act of agreeing) his mind is rea whether he
intends to commit that indictable offence or not. It is not of the essence
whether he has, or has not, a mental reservation as to its completion. Mens rea
is in such a case merely a condition of mind which is evidenced by the act of
agreeing itself. The guilty intent which is important is the intent to enter
into the agreement.

The charge was aid under section
573 of the Criminal Code which reads:—

Every one is guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to seven years' imprisonment who, in any case not
hereinbefore provided for, conspires with any person to commit any indictable
offence.

In the same terms, this was
enacted as section 527 of the Criminal Code when first enacted in 1892
(c. 29). Kidnapping is made an indictable offence by section 297 of the Code.

The Code does not define
either the word conspire or the offence of conspiracy. In some of the text
books and in some of the reported cases, a passage from the judgment of Willes
J. in the opinion expressed by him on behalf of the judges in Mulcahy v.
The Queen[13],
is accepted as a definition of a criminal conspiracy. In the 10th edition of
Russell on Crimes, at p. 1797, the following appears:—

The generally accepted
definition of the offence is that given by Wilkes (sic.) J. on behalf of all
the judges in Mulcahy v. R., and accepted by the House of Lords
in that and subsequent cases:—

A conspiracy consists not
merely in the intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or more to
do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. So long as such a
design rests in intention only it is not indictable. When two agree to carry it
into effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and the act of each of the
parties, promise against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being
enforced if lawful, punishable if for a criminal object or for the use of
criminal means.

[Page 682]

It has been said that in Quinn
v. Leatham[14],
this was accepted as a definition of the offence (R. v. Brailsford[15],
Alverstone C.J. at 746). With respect, I think this to be inaccurate since Lord
Brampton alone, of the Law Lords who considered Quinn v. Leatham,
mentioned Mulcahy's case or the extract from the judgment of Willes J.
quoted by Russell.

In my opinion, the portion of the
judgment of Willes J. above quoted was never intended as a definition of a
criminal conspiracy, rather was it a statement of the offence which was
punishable under the statute under which Mulcahy was charged. That Act
was chapter 12 of 11 Vict. being An Act for the better security of the Crown
and Government of the United
 Kingdom and amended earlier
statutes passed in the reign of Geo. III directed to the punishment of treason.
The language of the indictment followed that of the statute and charged that
the accused

Did feloniously and wickedly
compass, imagine, invent, devise and intend to deprive and depose Our
Lady the Queen.

and thereafter alleged various
overt acts. It was of the offences so charged that Willes J. employed the
language quoted by Lord Brampton in Quinn v. Leatham (and
repeated in Russell as aforesaid), but part of his remarks were omitted which
preceded and appear to me to explain the part quoted. The omitted passage reads
(p. 317):—

The argument was that a
conspiracy rests in intention only, that the law distinguishes between acts
intended and acts done; and that an overt act, to satisfy the statute, must
consist in either publishing or printing some writing, or in some bodily act or
deed, such as procuring arms.

So far as this question
depends upon the bare construction of the statute, it appears to admit of no
doubt.

It has been said that the opinion
of the judges in Mulcahy's case was approved by the House but it seems
quite clear that all that the Law Lords approved was that this part of the
opinion of Willes J. was a correct statement of the offence created by the
statute, cap. 12 of 11 Vict.

It is to be noted that in Regina v.
Dowling[16],
a prosecution under the statute under which Mulcahy and others had been
charged, Erle J. in charging the jury said (p. 514):—

[Page 683]

The indictment is divisible
into two distinct parts: first, the criminal intent: secondly, the overt acts,
by means of which such intent was carried out. The law requires proof, to the satisfaction
of the jury, that such intent existed, and that such overt acts were committed.

In the Law of Criminal
Conspiracies by R. S. Wright published in 1873, five years after the judgment
of Willes J. and that of the House of Lords in Mulcahy's case had been
delivered, the learned author said (p. 14) that no intelligible definition of
conspiracy had yet been established and an examination of the earlier
authorities supports this statement, in my opinion. After referring to the
expression used by Willes J. in Mulcahy's case above referred to, Wright
said (p. 66):—

An expression cannot be the
definition of conspiracy, the defining part of which is itself so devoid of
definiteness for the purposes for which a definition is required.

I have referred to the language
employed in the judgment in Mulcahy's case since, in the judgment of the
majority of the Court of Appeal, the part of the passage from the judgment of
Willes J. quoted by Lord Brampton in Quinn v. Leatham is given as
authority for the proposition that the intention to commit the offence of
kidnapping is of the essence of the offence charged in this case under Code
section 573. I am unable, with respect, to agree with that opinion.

It is unnecessary in disposing of
the present matter to attempt to formulate a general definition of the offence
of criminal conspiracy as it was prior to the enactment of the Criminal Code
in 1892. In Quinn v. Leatham, before quoting the passage from the
judgment of Willes J. in Mulcahy's case, Lord Brampton said (p. 528)
that a conspiracy consists of an unlawful combination of two or more persons to
do that which is contrary to law, or to do that which is wrongful and harmful
towards another person. It is sufficient for me to say that, in my opinion, the
agreement between Tulley and O'Brien to commit the offence of kidnapping was a
conspiracy, within the meaning of this section of the Code. In agreement
with the opinion of Mr. Justice Robertson, it is my view that the gist of the
offence referred to is the agreement of two or more persons to commit any
indictable offence.

[Page 684]

This construction of the section
appears to me consistent not only with the earlier cases in England but
with the decisions of this Court in which the matter has been considered. Thus,
in the Poulterers Case[17],
it is said that a false conspiracy between divers persons shall be punished although
nothing be put in execution and that ""a man shall have a writ of
conspiracy though they do nothing but conspire together and he shall recover
damages and they may also be indicted thereof."" In Reg. v. Best[18],
it was said that the conspiracy is the gist of the indictment:—

And that though nothing be
done in prosecution of it, it is a complete and consummate offence of itself.

In O'Connell v. Reg.[19],
Tindal C.J. said in part (p. 233) :—

The crime of conspiracy is
complete if two, or more than two, should agree to do an illegal thing; that
is, to effect something in itself unlawful, or to effect, by unlawful means,
something which in itself may be indifferent or even lawful. That it was an
offence known to the common law, and not first created by the statute 33 Edw.
1, is manifest. That statute speaks of conspiracy as a term at that time well
known to the law, and professes only to be ""a definition of
conspirators"". It has accordingly been always held to be the law that the
gist of the offence of conspiracy is the bare engagement and association to
break the law, whether any act be done in pursuance thereof by the conspirators
or not.

In Reg. v. Aspinall[20],
Brett J.A. said (p. 58):—

Now, first, the crime of
conspiracy is completely committed, if it is committed at all, the moment two
or more have agreed that they will do, at once or at some future time, certain
things. It is not necessary in order to complete the offence that any one thing
should be done beyond the agreement. The conspirators may repent and stop, or
may have no opportunity, or may be prevented, or may fail. Nevertheless the
crime is complete; it was completed when they agreed.

In Brodie v. The King[21],
Rinfret J. (as he then was), in delivering the judgment of the Court said in
part (p 198):—

On a charge of conspiracy,
the agreement is itself the gist of the offence (Paradis v. The King,
1934 S.C.R. 165 at 168). The mere agreement to commit the crime is regarded by
the law sufficient to render the parties to it guilty at once of a crime
(Kenny, Outlines of Criminal Law, 13th ed., p. 81).

And we need only recall the
often cited passage of Lord Chelmsford in Mulcahy v. The Queen:—

It cannot exist without the
consent of two or more persons; and their agreement is an act in advancement of
the intention which each of them has conceived in his mind.

[Page 685]

In other words, to borrow
the expression of Mr. Justice Willes (Mulcahy v. The Queen at p.
317):—""The very plot is an act in itself"". It follows that a person
may be convicted of conspiracy as soon as it has been formed and before any
overt act has been committed. The offence is complete as soon as the parties
have agreed as to their unlawful purpose (Kenny, Outlines of Criminal Law, 13th
ed., p. 289; Belyea v. The King, 1932 S.C.R. 279).

The contention of the Crown is
that the offence of conspiracy in this matter was complete when O'Brien and
Tulley agreed to commit the offence. Conceding that mens rea must be
shown, the Crown contends, rightly in my opinion, that an intention to offend
against the penal provisions of an Act (in this case to agree to commit an
indictable offence) constitutes mens rea (Bank of New South Wales v. Piper[22]).

It is however, said for the
respondent that if it be the case that to agree to commit an indictable offence
is punishable under section 573 of the Code, here there was no agreement since,
on Tulley's own showing, he did not intend to carry out his undertaking. Thus,
while the parties exchanged promises, to adopt the above quoted language of
Willes J., ""capable of being enforced if lawful, punishable if for a
criminal object or for the use of criminal means"", it is said there was no
agreement within the legal meaning of that expression, since Tulley never
intended to go through with the plan.

Some support for this contention
is to be found in a case of Woodworth v. State[23].
That case is relied upon to support a statement in Bishop on Criminal Law, 9th
ed. vol. 2, p. 131, that where there are only two parties and one simply joins
in appearance to draw the other on, neither is a conspirator. That statement is
followed by some further expressions of opinion as to what is necessary to
constitute an agreement to support a charge of conspiracy founded on other
American cases. In Woodworth's case, the Texas Court of Appeal considered
an appeal from a conviction under certain articles of the Penal Code of the
State of Texas. According to Willson, J. that Code defines the
offence of conspiracy to be a positive agreement entered into between two or
more persons to commit one of certain named offences. That learned judge then
proceeded to express his view as to what was the meaning to be assigned

[Page 686]

to the word ""agreement""
in the Penal Code and apparently accepted as a definition of the word one given
in Webster's Dictionary and one of several definitions given in Bouvier's Law
Dictionary. The latter publication said, inter alia, that agreement
""consists of two persons being of the same mind, intention, or meaning,
concerning the matter agreed upon"". Since the evidence supported the view
that the principal witness for the State, one Hunt, who was the only party to
the conspiracy alleged, at no time intended to commit the offence but proposed
rather to prevent its commission and was merely trying to entrap the accused,
Willson, J. considered that there was no such agreement as was contemplated by
the statute. It would appear that this decision has been followed in a case in Tennessee and
other cases in the State of Texas.

Whatever is to be said as to what
constitutes a ""positive agreement"" under the Penal Code of the State
of Texas, it is (in the absence of a statutory definition) to the common law of
this country that we must look to determine what amounts to an agreement to
commit an indictable offence. Where two or more persons declare their consent
as to any act or thing to be done or foreborne by some or one of them, it is an
agreement in the eyes of the law and the fact that one of the parties agreeing
does not intend to carry out his part of the bargain cannot affect the legal nature
of the arrangement. On the question as to whether or not an agreement has been
made, the intention of either party to carry it out is an irrelevant
consideration. If the contention of the respondent on this aspect of the matter
be analysed, it amounts simply to this that when two parties exchange promises
to do any act it is an agreement if the act to be done be lawful, but it is not
an agreement if it is unlawful and one of the parties does not intend to carry
out his part of it. This argument appears to be wholly untenable.

The cases which decide that the
evidence of police spies or agents provocateurs who, in pursuance of their duty
to suppress crime, become parties to criminal conspiracies do not, in my
opinion, assist the respondent in the present matter.

It is to be remembered that these
cases deal with the law of evidence and do not assume to deal with the legal
position of such persons endeavouring to discharge the duties 

[Page 687]

imposed upon them by their
calling who enter into agreements with others for the commission of criminal
offences. They are collected in the standard works on the law of evidence
(Phipson, 9th ed. 510: Roscoe, 16th ed. 145: Wigmore, 3rd ed. art. 2060).

The principal cases in England
dealing with the question are: R. v. Despard[24]:
Reg. v. Dowling[25]:
Reg. v. Mullins[26]:
R. v. Bickley[27].
Such persons are variously described as police spies, informers or accomplices,
though in Despard's case Lord Ellenborough said they could not be
considered as accomplices. The rule as to the corroboration of the evidence of
accomplices generally is stated in Reg. v. Stubbs[28].

That the rule does not apply to
persons who have joined in, or even provoked, the crime as police spies was
decided by this Court in Vigeant v. The King[29].
The reason that it does not apply is explained in the judgment of Lord Reading,
L.C.J. in R. v. Baskerville[30].

The question as to whether an
agent provocateur entering into an agreement such as that made between Tulley
and O'Brien would be guilty of the offence referred to in section 573 has not
been decided by any court whose decisions are binding upon us and does not
arise in this case. Robertson, J. A. expressed the view that a person so acting
on the instruction of the authorities would be excused on grounds of public policy.
In Stroud on Mens Rea, p. 14, the learned author suggests that, since whenever
the law imposes a duty it necessarily confers a right to carry out that duty,
this might afford justification.

In none of these cases is the
question considered as to whether such an arrangement made between an agent of
the police and a third person, with the design on the part of such agent merely
to entrap the other person, would in the eyes of the law be an agreement of the
nature necessary to support a charge of criminal conspiracy. The cases,
therefore, afford no support for the contention made here that

[Page 688]

what transpired between Tulley
and O'Brien was any the less such an agreement if Tulley did not intend to
carry out his part of the bargain.

In my opinion, the learned trial
judge did not misdirect the jury and I would allow this appeal and set aside
the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

FAUTEUX J. (dissenting):—The
material facts of this case appear in the reasons for judgment of my brother
Locke. In substance, the appellant O'Brien, having formed the project of
kidnapping one Mrs. X, confided it to one Tulley, with whom he was acquainted.
The two had then several meetings during which they discussed and plotted with
finality the means by which the criminal design of the appellant could be
achieved. In brief, by words, Tulley declared his consent and, thereafter, by
deeds, continued to manifest his agreement and encouragement to O'Brien as to
both means and aim. Indeed he actually pocketed money which, he admitted,
O'Brien gave him as part of the consideration agreed to between them for his
guilty participation in the execution of this criminal purpose. At trial,
Tulley admitted all these facts and more specially his corrupt participation in
the plotting of the crime, his agreement to commit it and his acceptance of the
money and he also testified that he hired a cab which he said he used with
O'Brien for the purpose of locating a house convenient for the sequestration of
the woman. He testified, however, that he never had the intention ""of
going through with this scheme"" or ""of carrying it out"". On the
basis that some credence could be given by a reasonable jury to the existence
of this alleged mental reservation as to the execution of the agreement—negatived
by his overt acts—it is contended that the trial Judge misdirected the jury in
instructing them that, in law, the offence of conspiracy was complete if, in
point of fact, the accused and Tulley did make the agreement even though the
latter ""never at any time had any intention of carrying the agreement into
effect.""

The question of law which then
falls to be determined is whether there was an indictable conspiracy if Tulley,
one of the two parties to the agreement who—motivated by a desire to extort
money from O'Brien—admittedly had the 

[Page 689]

intention and the will to and did
actually plot the commission of the crime and openly agreed to and encouraged
its commission, but had no intention to satisfy his own part of the exchanged
promises and engagements.

It is recognized in jurisprudence
and in text books that no complete and exhaustive definition of conspiracy has
yet been formulated. Generally, it is said that conspiracy is an agreement of
two or more persons to effect an unlawful purpose whether as their ultimate aim
or only as a means to it. But that the legal concept of criminal conspiracy and
the legal concept of criminal agreement are not to be confused is, I think,
sufficiently suggested by s. 266 of the Criminal Code enacting that:—

Every one is guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to 14 years imprisonment who conspires or
agrees with any person to murder or to cause to be murdered, any other person…

The modern law of conspiracy
stems from what is referred to as the 17th century rule. The principle is thus
formulated by Coke:—

Quando aliquid prohibetur,
prohibetur et id quod pervenitur ad illud: et affectus punitur licet non
sequatur effectus; and in these cases the common law is a law of mercy, for it
prevents the malignant from doing mischief, and the innocent from suffering it.
Coke's Reports, Vol. V, New Edition, page 101.

A similar principle underlies
these provisions of s. 69 of the Criminal Code prescribing that he who
counsels the commission of a crime is guilty of a substantive offence even if
the offence he counselled is not committed, such substantive crime being
completed once counselling has taken place. Brousseau v. The King[31].
Furthermore, if the offence counselled is committed, the person who counselled
it is also guilty of the latter unless he has, before its commission, given a
timely, express and actual countermand or revocation of the counselling. Croft
v. The King[32].
An unmanifested change of heart on behalf of a person who has counselled is not
sufficient. In the Croft case, it may be added, there was a mutual
agreement to commit suicide, consequential to which one of the parties died.
Croft, the other party to the agreement—who could undoubtedly have been
successfully charged with criminal conspiracy, for

[Page 690]

suicide is a common law crime,
(Kenny, Outlines of criminal law, 13th edition, page 289)—was actually charged
and found guilty of the major offence of murder and this on the basis that the
agreement itself amounted to such counselling, procuring, inducing, advising or
abetting of murder as constituted the survivor an accessory before the fact if
he was not present when the other party to the agreement committed suicide.
There was no suggestion that Croft's agreement was affected by any mental
reservation with respect to the execution of the criminal purpose. But whether
or not it was leaves untouched the proposition that his participation in the
plotting of the crime and his signified agreement, his promise or engagement to
execute it were tantamount to counselling, inducing, advising the other party
to commit it. Hence, in the face of these promises and engagements amounting to
counselling, inducing, etc., mental reservation could have been no defence to
the charge of murder. And to say that, assuming the existence of such mental
reservation there would have been no conspiracy, would be tantamount to a
denial of the existence of the very ultimate foundation upon which the same
party was found guilty of the partially executed agreement.

That two or hundreds of persons
may confederate and plot in advance the commission of a crime or crimes against
another person or group of persons, or even the State, though agreeing, at the
same time, to defer to a later date the question whether such criminal plans
should at all be executed, is not an extravagant hypothesis. That such a secret
combination against the peace, though for the time being denuded of the actual
intention to commit the plotted crime or crimes, would not come within the
meaning of those which, under the principle enunciated by Coke, are indictable,
I am not ready and do not have to say for the determination of this appeal.

To the narrower proposition,
i.e., that, in the circumstances of this case, the external manifestation of
intention, this exchange of promises, of engagements and encouragements between
the parties must be treated as having never existed because of the alleged
mental reservation on the part of Tulley as to the ""going through with the
scheme"", I am unable to subscribe. An agreement is an act in the law
whereby two or more persons declare their consent as to 

[Page 691]

any act or thing to be done. Such
a declaration takes place by the concurrence of the parties in a spoken or
written form of words as expressing their common intention. Mental acts or acts
of the will, it has been said, are not the material out of which promises are
made. Hence the law, in civil matters at least, does not allow one party to
show that his intention was not in truth such as he made it or suffered it to
appear to the other party. That a different view should be adopted because of
the criminal nature of the object of the agreement in this case where Tulley,
willingly and with full appreciation of the matter, signified his agreement,
promised and took the engagement, and thus encouraged the criminal design, is
not only inconsistent with the economy of our criminal law but, in my
respectful view, unwarranted under the authorities.

Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol.
9, 2nd edition, page 44:—

The gist of the offence lies
in the bare engagement and association to do an unlawful thing (i.e., a
thing contrary to or forbidden by law), whether such thing be criminal or not,
and whether any act other than the engagement or association be done by
the conspirators or not.

Russell on Crime, Tenth edition,
Vol. 2, p. 1798:—

The gist of the offence of
conspiracy then lies, not in doing the act, or effecting the purpose for which
the conspiracy is formed, nor in attempting to do them, nor in inciting others
to do them, but in the forming of the scheme or agreement between the
parties. The external or overt act of the crime is concert by which
mutual consent to a common purpose is exchanged. In an indictment, it
suffices if the combination exists and is unlawful, because it is the
combination itself which is mischievous, and which is considered to give
the public an interest to interfere by indictment.

Harris and Wilshere's Criminal
Law, 17th edition, page 45:—

The offence consists in
the combining.

In Quinn v. Leatham[33],
Lord Brampton, at page 528, said:—

The essential elements,
whether of a criminal or of an actionable conspiracy, are, in my opinion, the
same, though to sustain an action special damage must be proved.

and the learned Lord then
proceeds to quote ""as a very instructive definition of a conspiracy"",
the words of Willes J., in Mulcahy v. R.[34],
who, in delivering the unanimous

[Page 692]

opinion of himself, Blackburn J.,
Bramwell B., Keating J., and Pigott B., subsequently adopted by the House of
Lords, said:—

A conspiracy consists not
merely in the intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or more to
do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. So long as such a
design rests in intention only it is not indictable. When two agree to carry it
into effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and the act of each of the
parties, promise against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being
enforced, if lawful, punishable if for a criminal object or for the use of
criminal means… The number and the compact give weight and cause danger.

It is true these words were
uttered touching a criminal case, but they are none the less applicable to
conspiracies made the subject of civil actions like the present.

Dealing with and giving the
reasoning out of which emerged the 17th century rule and its subsequent
extension, Harrison in Law of Conspiracy, page 14, says:—

For it was a general rule of
criminal law that the gist of a crime was in the criminal intent, although it
could not be punished until the intent was manifested by some act done in
furtherance of it. Thus it was argued that in conspiracy the criminal intent
was the intent to combine to indict falsely, and this intent was
sufficiently manifested by the act of combination, that is, by the
agreement, without any carrying out of the objects of the agreement.

The case of Rex v. Kotyszyn[35],
quoted in support of respondent's contention, does not, in my respectful view,
support the proposition that the alleged mental reservation of Tulley as to the
commission of the crime of kidnapping renders the agreement, his promises and
his engagements, non-existent and without jural consequences in criminal law.
Indeed Bissonnette J., at page 202, quotes with approval the following passage
of Marchand J. in Deur v. The King:—

The principal element of the
offence of conspiracy is the plotting or agreement of two or more persons to
commit an act that is criminal in its design, or to accomplish a legitimate
purpose by criminal means, and the complete offence is committed by the
participants in the conspiracy as soon as there is an agreement between them to
commit a crime. It is not necessary that the crime, the object of the plotting,
be committed by one or the other of the conspirators. Each of them is guilty of
conspiracy as soon as he has signified his adherence to, or promised his
collaboration in, the common criminal design.

[Page 693]

In the same case, Mackinnon J.,
having also, at page 268, quoted with approval the above statement of Marchand
J., adds at page 269:—

The dealings between Mary Elm
and the respondent had advanced far past an attempt to commit a conspiracy, the
conspiracy itself having actually been accomplished.

And then he quotes what was said
by Willes J. in Mulcahy v. R.

Finally, Gagné J., at page 264,
says:—

I do not know that it is
necessary to scrutinize the intimate intention of each one of the persons. The
expression of the desire to conspire communicated to another person who
consents thereto, ought to be sufficient to incriminate the latter, even
when it might later appear that the former did not really have the intention of
doing an unlawful act. The object that she pursued in her own conscience
cannot be said to be an excuse for another. It seems to me that that is simply
good sense.

The case of Rex v. Kotyszyn
stands, besides, in quite a different category than the present. Furthermore,
the fact that, on grounds of public policy, a peace officer, for instance,
might be excused, or immuned of prosecution, for agreeing to buy drugs from a
drug pedlar agreeing to sell them, in order that the latter be successfully
brought to justice on the statutory charge of selling drugs, has not yet
authoritatively permitted the statement that, because of the honest motives of
the officer or his lack of criminal intent, there was, in criminal law, no
agreement to sell and no sale.

For the dismissal of the present
appeal, it is also said that if Tulley was charged with conspiracy and the jury
would attach credence to his story, he should in law be acquitted and that, in
such event, even if O'Brien had been previously convicted, O'Brien should be
discharged according to the practice based on the rule that one cannot conspire
alone. In this argument, I cannot find any assistance, for whether or not
Tulley should in law be acquitted on the basis of his mental reservation is a
question involved in the determination of this appeal. The question is one
which according to Kenny, Outlines of criminal law, 15th edition, page 336, in
a foot-note—has been raised, but whether as a pure academic question or in the
consideration of an actual case, the learned author does not say. Indeed, no
case in point, either in England or in Canada, has been quoted at bar nor was it possible to find
any. Hence, furthermore, whether, assuming a defence resting on mental 

[Page 694]

reservation should, contrary to
the views I hold, obtain in favour of Tulley, O'Brien—who, as implied by the
verdict of the jury, had undoubtedly not only the intention to conspire but
also the will to kidnap,—should legally benefit of the mental reservation of
Tulley with whom he had agreed, is a question which has not then been
considered in the cases where one convicted party was discharged because of the
acquittal of the other party to the conspiracy, and is moreover a question
which does not arise here in view of the conclusion I have reached as to
Tulley's legal position in the premises.

In brief, Tulley, by lending a
receptive ear to O'Brien's criminal proposition, by plotting along with him the
unlawful means by which the crime was to be committed, by promising to O'Brien
to actually join with him in its commission, by accepting money given to him by
the latter as part of the price agreed for his participation in the matter, by
hiring a cab and using it with O'Brien for the purpose of locating a house
convenient for the sequestration of the woman, has, by deeds and by words,
assented to and encouraged the design, and this whether he intended or not to
go through with it. Mental reservations are not apt to defeat the natural
consequences of words accompanied by deeds. Undoubtedly, O'Brien believed in
and was encouraged by the manifested sincerity of Tulley. In Tulley's own
words, O'Brien ""believed something he had planned himself along with
me."" Indeed and when the moment came to actually kidnap the woman, Tulley
thought it advisable, for motives of his own, to inform her husband of the plot
against her. In the Law of Criminal Conspiracies and Agreements by R. S. Wright
(London, 1873) at page 70, it is stated:—

For the rest, there seems to
be no reason to suppose that, unless perhaps in some forms of treason, the kind
of conduct necessary for making a man a party to a conspiracy differs in any
respect from that which would be necessary for making a man a party to any
other sort of criminal design. If he procures, counsels, commands or abets a
design of felony, he is involved in the guilt of the principal felon, though in
a lower degree, if the felony is not actually committed. If he procures,
counsels, commands or abets a misdemeanor, he is guilty of a misdemeanor at
common law. So there can be no doubt but that a person may involve himself in
the guilt of a conspiracy by his mere assent to and encouragement of the
design, although nothing may have been assigned or intended to be executed
by him personally.

[Page 695]

In the circumstances of this
case, I agree with Robertson J.A. of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, and with my brother Locke, that the verdict of the jury should not be
disturbed and that the present appeal should be maintained.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Murder—Alleged misdirection on
doctrine of reasonable doubt and circumstantial evidence—Alleged inflammatory
language by Crown counsel to jury—Criminal
Code, ss. 1014(2), 1025.

The appellant was found
guilty of murder. His appeal to the Court of appeal was unanimously dismissed.
He now appeals to this Court, by special leave, on grounds of misdirection with
reference to reasonable doubt, circumstantial evidence and inflammatory
language used by Crown counsel in his address to the jury.

Held (Taschereau and Abbott
JJ. dissenting), that the appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and
a new trial ordered.

1. There was no misdirection
in the trial judge's charge with respect to the doctrine of reasonable doubt.

Per Kerwin ,C.J., Kellock,
Estey, Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: Difficulties would be avoided if
trial judges would use the well known and approved adjective
""reasonable"" or ""raisonnable"" when describing that doubt
which is sufficient to require the jury to return a verdict of not guilty.

[Page 17]

2. There was misdirection by
the trial judge with reference to the rule as to circumstantial evidence.
Neither the language of Rex v. Hodge ((1838) 2 Lewin C.C. 227) nor
anything remotely approaching it was used.

Per Kerwin C.J. and Estey J.:
Even though expressions other than the ones used in the Hodge case are
permissible, a trial judge should use the well settled formula and so obviate
questions arising as to what is its equivalent.

3. Crown counsel exceeded
his duty when he expressed in his address by inflammatory and vindictive
language his personal opinion that the accused was guilty and left with the
jury the impression that the investigation made before the trial by the Crown
officers was such that it had brought them to the conclusion that the accused
was guilty.

It is improper for counsel
for the Crown or the defence to express his own opinion as to the guilt or
innocence of the accused. The right of the accused to have his guilt or
innocence decided upon the sworn evidence alone uninfluenced by statements of
fact by the Crown prosecutor, is one of the most deeply rooted and jealously
guarded principles of our law.

4. Per Kerwin C.J., Rand,
Kellock, Estey, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: It could not be safely affirmed
that had such errors not occurred the verdict would necessarily have been the
same.

Per Locke J.: There was a
substantial wrong and consequently s. 1014(2) of the Code had no
application.








Per Taschereau and Abbott JJ.
(dissenting) : As the verdict would have necessarily been the same there had
been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the appellant's conviction
on a 'charge .of murder.

A. E. M. Maloney, Q.C. and F. de B.
Gravel for the accused.

P. Miquelon and P. Flynn for the
respondent.



The judgment of
Kerwin C.J. and Estey J. was delivered by:—



THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—The first question of law upon which
leave to appeal to this Court was granted is:—



(1) Were the
jury misdirected by the learned trial judge with reference to the doctrine of
reasonable doubt?



The trial judge,
in my view, did not misdirect the jury, but the difficulties occasioned by what
he did say would not arise if trial judges would use the well-known and

[Page 18]



approved word
""reasonable"" or ""raisonnable"" when describing that doubt
which is sufficient to enable a jury to return a verdict of not guilty.



There was clear
misdirection by the trial judge with respect to the second question of law
which the appellant was permitted to raise:—



(2) Were the
jury misdirected by the learned trial judge with reference to the rule as to
circumstantial evidence?










The evidence
against the appellant was entirely circumstantial. ""In such cases"",
as this Court pointed out in The King v. Comba[2],
""by the long settled rule of the common law, which is the rule of law
in Canada, the jury, before finding a prisoner guilty upon such evidence, must
be satisfied not only that the circumstances are consistent with a conclusion
that the criminal act was committed by the accused, but also that the facts are
such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the
accused is the guilty person"". This, of course, is based upon the decision
in Rex v. Hodge[3]; and,
while we stated in McLean v. The King[4], ""There
is no single exclusive formula which it is the duty of the trial judge to
employ. As a rule he would be well advised to adopt the language of Baron
Alderson or its equivalent."", in this case neither that language, nor
anything remotely approaching it was used. Even though, according to the
judgment in McLean, other expressions might be permitted, the experience
of the Courts in Canada in the last few years justifies a further warning that a
trial judge should use the well settled formula and so obviate questions
arising as to what is its equivalent. Because of the misdirection in this case,
the conviction cannot stand, unless the Court, exercising the power conferred
upon it by s.s. 2 of s. 1014 of the Criminal Code, considers that there
has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.



Before dealing
with that problem, it is well to set out the third question of law which the
appellant was allowed to argue:—



(3) Was
the appellant deprived of a trial according to law by reason of the fact that
the crown counsel used inflammatory language in his address to the jury?

[Page 19]



It is the duty of
crown counsel to bring before the Court the material witnesses, as explained in
Lemay v. The King[5]. In
his address he is entitled to examine all the evidence and ask the jury to come
to the conclusion that the accused is guilty as charged. In all this he has a
duty to assist the jury, but he exceeds that duty when he expresses by
inflammatory or vindictive language his own personal opinion that the accused
is guilty, or when his remarks tend to leave with the jury an impression that
the investigation made by the Crown is such that they should find the accused
guilty. In the present case counsel's address infringed both of these rules.










I now turn to s.s.
2 of s. 1014 of the Code. The test to be applied was laid down in Schmidt
v. The King[6]:
""that the .onus rests on the crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict
would necessarily have been the same"". While I am inclined to the view
that that test has been met, I understand that several members of the Court
think other-wise and, therefore, under the circumstances of this case, I will
not record a dissent.



The judgment of
Taschereau and Abbott JJ. (dissenting)
was delivered by:‑



TASCHEREAU,
J.:‑L'appelant a été accusé d'avoir assassiné un nommé Georges Jabour
Jarjour, à St-Henri, comté de Lévis, le 3 juin 1951, et a été trouvé coupable
de meurtre à la suite d'un procès devant le jury, présidé par l'honorable Juge
Albert Sévigny. La Cour du Banc de la Reine[7] a unanimement confirmé ce
verdict. Après avoir obtenu la permission de l'honorable Juge Kellock de la
Cour Suprême du Canada, l'appelant a inscrit la présente cause devant cette
Cour. Ses griefs d'appel sont les suivants:‑



1.
Le juge dans son adresse aux jurés, ne les a pas légalement instruits sur la
doctrine du doute raisonnable.



2.
La règle qui doit être suivie dans le cas de preuve circonstantielle [sic] n'a
pas été suffisamment expliquée.



3.
L'accusé n'a pas obtenu un procès équitable eu égard aux faits de la cause,
étant donné que l'avocat de la Couronne, dans son adresse aux jurés, a fait
usage d'un langage enflammé.

[Page 20]



Je suis
d'opinion que le premier motif d'appel n'est pas fondé. Un résumé de ce que le
président du tribunal a exprimé à maintes reprises sur le doute que peuvent
entretenir les jurés, se trouve dans l'extrait suivant de son adresse : ‑



Si
la Couronne ne prouve pas le fait, le crime, de façon à établir une certitude
morale, une certitude qui donne la conviction à l'intelligence, une certitude
qui satisfait la raison et dirige le jugement à rendre, et que les jurés ont un
doute sérieux sur la culpabilité de l'accusé, c'est leur devoir et ils sont
obligés de donner le bénéfice de ce doute à l'accusé et de le déclarer
non coupable.



Évidemment,
le jury a nécessairement compris par ces mots, qu'il devait être satisfait de
la culpabilité de l'accusé, au delà d'un doute raisonnable. Sinon, ce dernier
devait en avoir le bénéfice et être déclaré non coupable.










Le
second grief est plus sérieux. Depuis au delà de cent ans, la règle concernant
la, direction qui doit être donnée aux jurés lorsqu'il s'agit de preuve
circonstantielle, a été posée clans la cause de Hodge[8]. S'adressant aux jurés, le
Baron Alderson s'est exprimé ainsi:



That before
they could find the prisoner guilty they must be satisfied, not only that those
circumstances were consistent with his having committed the act, but they must
also be satisfied that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person.



Cette
jurisprudence a depuis été suivie, et il suffit de référer aux causes suivantes
pour se convaincre qu'elle a été constante:-(Wills on Circumstantial
Evidence (7th ed. pp. 320 and 321) Rex. v. Natanson[9], Rex. v. Francis and
Barber[10], Rex. v. Petrisor[11], MacLean v. The King[12].



Malgré
que les tribunaux se sont montrés très sévères sur la nécessité qu'il y a
d'instruire le jury clans le sens indiqué dans la cause de Hodge, il ne
s'ensuit pas que la formule soit sacramentelle, et que l'accusé aura droit à un
nouveau procès si les termes exacts ne sont pas employés. (MacLean v. The
King supra) 'Ce serait exiger un trap grand formalisme, et le droit
criminel ne va pas jusque là. Il faut cependant retrouver dans les paroles du
juge au procès, au moins l'équivalent, qui fera comprendre aux jurés que dans

[Page 21]



une cause
comme celle qui nous occupe, où la preuve est circonstantielle, pour trouver un
accusé coupable, ils doivent être satisfaits non seulement que les
circonstances sont compatibles avec sa culpabilité, mais qu'elles sont
aussi, incompatibles avec toute autre conclusion rationnelle.



Malheureusement,
l'équivalent de cette directive qui doit être nécessairement donnée, ne l'a pas
été. Le savant président du tribunal a bien attiré l'attention du jury sur la
preuve circonstantielle; il leur a bien dit qu'elle devait être forte et
convaincante, mais il n'a pas, à mon sens, expliqué la véritable doctrine que
j'ai citée plus haut et qu'exige la loi.










L'appelant
prétend enfin que la procureur de la 'Couronne, au cours de son adresse au
jury, a fait usage d'un langage enflammé en faisant appel à leurs passions,
avec le résultat qu'ils auraient été entraînés à ne pas juger cette cause comme
des hommes raisonnables.



La
situation qu'occupe l'avocat de la Couronne n'est pas celle de l'avocat en
matière civile. Ses fonctions sont quasi-judiciaires. Il ne doit pas tant
chercher à obtenir un verdict de culpabilité qu'à assister le juge 'et le jury
pour que la justice. la plus complète soit rendue. La modération et
l'impartialité doivent toujours être les caractéristiques de sa conduite devant
le tribunal. Il aura en effet honnêtement rempli son devoir et sera à l'épreuve
de tout reproche si, mettant de côté tout appel aux passions, d'une façon digne
qui convient à son rôle, il expose la preuve au jury sans aller au delà de ce
qu'elle a révélé.



Je suis
donc 'd'opinion qu'en ce qui concerne les directives du président du tribunal,
relatives à la preuve circonstantielle, il y a eu erreur 'de droit. Je crois
également, après avoir analysé l'adresse au jury du procureur de la Couronne,
qu'il y a eu exagérration de langage. Mais je ne crois pas que ces deux motifs
soient suffisants pour ordonner un nouveau procès. L'article 1014 du Code
Criminel est ainsi rédigé, et je pense que dans les circonstances de cette
cause, il doit trouver toute son application :



1014.
A l'audition d'un pareil appel d'un' jugement de culpabilité, la cour d'appel
doit autoriser le pourvoi, si elle est d'avis



a)
Qu'il y a lieu d'infirmer le verdict du jury pour le motif qu'il est injuste ou
non justifié par la preuve; ou



b)
Qu'il y a lieu d'annuler le jugement du tribunal à cause d'une décision erronée
sur un point de droit; ou

[Page 22]



c)
Que, pour un motif quelconque, il y a eu déni de justice; et (d) Dans
tout autre cas, la cour doit renvoyer l'appel.



2.
La cour peut aussi renvoyer l'appel si, malgré son avis que l'appel pourrait
être décidé en faveur de l'appelant, pour l'un des motifs susmentionnés, elle
est aussi d'avis qu'il ne s'est produit aucun tort réel ou déni de justice.










Il ne
me paraît pas utile d'analyser les faits que la preuve a révélés au cours du
procès. Il sera suffisant de dire qu'à sa lecture, je me suis convaincu que
même si la directive du juge eut été conforme à la loi, et si le procureur de
la Couronne eut fait usage d'un langage plus modéré, le verdict aurait été nécessairement
le même. Je suis satisfait qu'il n'y a eu aucun déni de justice et que
l'accusé n'a subi aucun tort réel. Gouin
v. The King[13];
Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecutions[14];
Schmidt v. The King[15].



Je
rejetterais l'appel.



RAND
J.:‑Three grounds of appeal were taken : an error in the charge as it
dealt with the burden of proof on the Crown; a failure to give an instruction
on the test required for circumstantial evidence; and certain statements of
Crown counsel in his address to the jury.



The
first ground can be disposed of shortly. The words objected to were ""hors
de tout doute sérieux"". Whatever difference there is between this and the
usual formula was swept away by subsequent language with which the jurors were
at least more familiar: they must have ""une absolue certitude de la vérité
de l'accusation qu'ils ont à juger""; other expressions were to the same
effect. The instruction, as a whole, was more favourable to the accused than is
customary.



The
rule as to the sufficiency of proof by circumstances is that the facts relied
on must be 'compatible only with guilt and admittedly no instruction of that
nature expressly or in substance was given. The purpose of the rule is that the
jury should be made alive to the possibility that the material facts might be
given a rational explanation other than that of items plotting the course of
guilty action. I think it should have been given, and I cannot say that the
charge as a whole supplied its omission.

[Page 23]



There
are finally the statements of counsel, which I confine to those dealing with
the investigation by the Crown of the circumstances of a crime:



C'est
le devoir de la Couronne, quand une affaire comme celle-là arrive, n'importe
quelle affaire, et encore plus dans une affaire grave, de faire toutes les
recherches possibles, et si au cours de ces recherches avec nos experts on en
vient à la conclusion que l'accusé n'est pas coupable ou qu'il y a un doute
raisonnable, c'est le devoir de la Couronne, messieurs, de le dire ou si on en
vient à la conclusion qu'il n'est pas coupable, de ne pas faire d'arrestation. Ici, c'est ce qu'on a fait.



Quand
la Couronne a fait faire cette preuve-là, ce n'est pas avec l'intention
d'accabler l'accusé, c'était avec l'intention de lui rendre justice.










Many,
if not the majority of, jurors acting, it may be, for the first time,
unacquainted with the language and proceedings of courts, and with no precise
appreciation of the role of the prosecution other than as being associated with
government, would be extremely susceptible to the implications of such remarks.
So to emphasize a neutral attitude on the part of Crown representatives in the
investigation of the facts of a crime is to put the matter to unsophisticated
minds as if there had already been an impartial determination of guilt by
persons in authority. Little more likely to colour the consideration of the
evidence by jurors could be suggested. It is the antithesis of the impression
that should be given to them: they only are to pass on the issue and to do so
only on what has been properly exhibited to them in the course of the
proceedings.



It is
difficult to reconstruct in mind and feeling the court room scene when a human
life is at stake; the tensions, the invisible forces, subtle and unpredictable,
the significance that a word may take on, are sensed at best imperfectly. It is
not, then, possible to say that this reference to the Crown's action did not
have a persuasive influence on the jury in reaching their verdict. The
irregularity touches on( of the oldest principles of our law, the rule that
protects the subject from the pressures of the executive and has it safeguard
in the independence of our courts. It goes to the foundation of the security of
the individual under the rule of law.



It
cannot be over-emphasized that the purpose of a criminal prosecution is not to
obtain a conviction, it is to lay before a jury what the Crown considers to be
credible evidence relevant to what is alleged to be a crime. Counsel

[Page 24]



have a
duty to see that all available legal proof of the facts is presented: it should
be done firmly and pressed to its legitimate strength but it must also be done
fairly. The role of prosecutor excludes any notion 'of winning or losing; his
function is a matter of public duty than which in civil life there can be none
charged with greater personal responsibility. It is to be efficiently performed
with an ingrained sense of the dignity, the seriousness and the justness of
judicial proceedings.



The
answer of the Crown is that notwithstanding these objectionable features, there
has been no substantial miscarriage of justice; that the proof of guilt is
overwhelming and that the jury, acting judicially, must necessarily have come
to the same verdict.










Sec.
1014(2) of the Criminal Code provides that the Court



may
also dismiss the appeal if, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that on any
of the grounds above mentioned the appeal might be decided in favour of the
appellant, it is also of opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has actually occurred.



By sec.
1024 this Court, on an appeal, shall



make
such rule or order thereon in affirmance of the conviction or for granting a
new trial, or otherwise, or for granting or refusing such application, as the
justice of the case requires .. .



It will
be seen that under the former section the Court is to exercise its discretion
in the light of all the circumstances. Appreciating to the full the
undesirability, for many reasons, of another trial, I find myself driven to
conclude that nothing short of that will vindicate the fundamental safe-guards
to which the accused in this case was entitled.



The
conviction, therefore, must be set aside and a new trial directed.



LOCKE
J.:‑I have had the advantage of reading the reasons to be delivered in
this matter by my brother Cartwright. I agree with what he has said in regard
to the first and second questions of law. The failure to direct the jury upon
what may be called the rule in Hodge's case appears to me to be directly
contrary to the unanimous decision of this Court in Lizotte v. The King[16].

[Page 25]



Upon the third
question, I have this to say. It has always been accepted in this country that
the duty of per-sons entrusted by the Crown with prosecutions in criminal
matters does not differ from that which has long been recognized in England.



In Regina v.
Thursfield[17], counsel
for the Crown stated what he considered to be his ,duty in the following terms:



that he
should state to the jury the whole of what appeared on the depositions to be
the facts of the case, as well those which made in favour of the prisoner as
those which made against her, as he apprehended his duty, as counsel for the
prosecution, to be, to examine the witnesses who would detail the facts o the
jury, after having narrated the circumstances in. such way as to make the
evidence, when given, intelligible to the jury, not considering himself as
counsel for any particular side or party.










Baron Gurney, who
presided, then said:



The learned
counsel for the prosecution has most accurately conceived his duty, which is to
be assistant o the Court in the furtherance of justice, and not to act as
counsel for any particular person or party.



In Regina v.
Ruddick[18], decided
just after the passage of Denman's Act, Crompton J. said (p. 499):



I hope that
in the exercise of the privilege granted by the new Act to counsel for the
prosecution of summing up the evidence, they will not cease to remember that
counsel for the prosecution in such cases are to regard themselves as ministers
of justice, and not to struggle for a conviction, as in a case at Nisi Prius‑nor
be betrayed by feelings of professional rivalry‑to regard the question at
issue as one of professional superiority, and a contest for skill and
preeminence.



An article entitled
""The Ethics of Advocacy"", written by Mr. Showell Rogers, appears in
Vol. XV of the Law Quarterly Review at p. 259, in which the cases upon this
subject are reviewed and discussed. Speaking of the principles above referred
to, the author says:



Any one who
has watched the administration of the criminal law in this country knows how
loyally-one might almost say how religiously-this principle is observed in
practice. Counsel for the Crown appears o be anything rather than the advocate
of the particular private prosecutor who happens to be proceeding in the name
of the Crown. When there is no private prosecutor, and the proceedings are in
the most literal sense instituted by the Crown itself, the duty of prosecuting
counsel in this respect is even more strictly to be performed.



These are the
principles which have been accepted as defining the duty of counsel for the
Crown in this country.

[Page 26]



In Rex v.
Chamandy[19], Mr.
Justice Riddell, speaking for the Ontario Court of Appeal, put it this way (p.
227):



It cannot be
made too clear, that in our law, a criminal prosecution is not a contest
between individuals, nor is it a contest between the Crown endeavouring to
convict and the accused endeavouring to be acquitted; but it is an
investigation that should be conducted without feeling or animus on the part of
the prosecution, with the single view of determining the truth.










In the last
Edition of Archbold's Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice, p. 194, the
learned author says that prosecuting counsel should regard themselves rather as
ministers of justice assisting in its administration than as advocates.



It is improper, in
my opinion, for counsel for the Crown to express his opinion as to the guilt or
innocence of the accused. In the article to which I have referred it is said
that it is because the character or eminence of a counsel is to be wholly
disregarded in determining the justice or other-wise of his client's cause that
it is an inflexible rule of forensic pleading that an advocate shall not, as
such, express his personal opinion of or his belief in his client's case.



In an address by
the late Mr. Justice Rose, which is reported in Vol. XX of the Canadian Law
Times at p. 59, that learned Judge, referring to Mr. Rogers' article, pointed
out a further objection to any such practice in the following terms:‑



Your duty to
your client does not call for any expression of your belief in the justice of
his cause ... The counsel's opinion may be right or wrong, but it is not
evidence. If one counsel may assert his belief, the opposing counsel is put at
a disadvantage if he does not state that in his belief his client's cause or
defence is just. If one counsel is well known and of high standing, his client
would have a decided advantage over his opponent if represented by a younger,
weaker, or less well known man.



In my opinion,
these statements accurately define the duty ,of Crown counsel in these matters.



An extract from
one of the passages taken from the address of counsel for the Crown by my
brother Cartwright reads:‑



C'est
le devoir de la Couronne, quand une affaire comme celle-là arrive, n'importe
quelle affaire, et encore plus dans une affaire grave, de faire toutes les
recherches possibles, et si au cours de ces recherches avec nos experts on en
vient à la conclusion que l'accusé n'est pas coupable ou

[Page 27]



qu'il
y a un doute raisonnable, c'est le devoir de la
Couronne, messieurs, de le dire ou si on en vient à la conclusion qu'il n'est
pas coupable, de ne pas faire d'arrestation. Ici, c'est ce qu'on a fait.



These
are statements of fact and not argument and, in making them, counsel for the
Crown was giving evidence. The matters stated were wholly irrelevant and, had
the counsel in question elected to go into the witness box to make these
statements on oath, the proposed evidence would not have been heard. In this
manner, however, these facts were submitted to the jury for their
consideration.










The
statements were calculated to impress upon the jury the asserted fact that,
before the accused had been arrested, the Crown, with its experts, had made a
thorough investigation and was satisfied that he was guilty beyond a
reason-able doubt. Introduced into the record in this manner, there could be no
cross-examination to test their accuracy.



The
address of Crown counsel to the jury ended in this manner:‑



On
voit tous les jours des crimes encore plus nombreux que jamais, des vols et
bien d'autre chose, au moins celui qui vole à main armée ne fait pas souffrir
sa victime comme Boucher a fait souffrir Jabour. C'est un crime révoltant d'un
homme dans toute la force de l'âge, d'un athlète contre un vieillard de 77 ans
qui n'est pas capable de se défendre. J'ai un peu respect pour ceux qui volent
quand au moins ils ont donné une chance à leur victime de se défendre, mais
j'ai aucune sympathie, aucune et je vous demande de n'en pas avoir, aucune
sympathie pour ces lèches qui frappent des hommes, des amis. Jabour n'était
peut-être pas un ami, mais c'était un voisin, du moins ils se connaissaient.



Lâchement,
à coups d'hache.‑Et, si vous rapportez un verdict de coupable, pour une
fois ça me ferait presque plaisir de demander la peine de mort contre lui.



The
Crown prosecutor, having improperly informed the jury that there had been an
investigation by the Crown which satisfied the authorities that the accused was
guilty, thus assured them on his own belief in his guilt and employed language
calculated to inflame their feelings against him.



In
Nathan House[20], where a conviction was quashed on the three grounds of
misreception of evidence, misdirection and the conduct of counsel, Trevethin,
L.C.J., referring to the fact that counsel for the Crown had made an appeal to
religious prejudice in his address to the jury, said that

[Page 28]



the language
complained of was highly improper and that it was impossible to. say that it
could not have influenced the jury.



In 'delivering the
judgment of the House of Lords in Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecutions[21],
Lord Sankey, L.C. said in part (p. 176) :‑










... it must
be remembered that the whole policy of English criminal law has been to see
that as against the prisoner every rule in his favour is observed and that no
rule is broken so as to prejudice the chance of the jury fairly trying the true
issues.



The right of the
accused in this matter to have his guilt or innocence decided upon the sworn
evidence alone, uninfluenced by statements of fact by the Crown prosecutor
bearing directly upon the question of his guilt, and to have the case against
him stated in accordance with the fore-going principles, were rights which may
be properly described, to adopt the language of the Lord Chancellor in Maxwell's
case, as being two ""of the most deeply rooted and jealously guarded
principles of our criminal law.""



The infringement
of these rights was, in my opinion, a substantial wrong, within the meaning of
section 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code, and accordingly that provision
has no application to this case: Makin v. Attorney General for New South
Wales[22];
Allen v. The King[23];
Northey v. The King[24].



I would allow this
appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and the verdict at the
trial and direct that there be a new trial.



The judgment of
Kellock, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by



CARTWRIGHT
J.:-This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench,
Appeal Side[25],
pronounced on the 15th day of June, 1954, dismissing the appeal of the
appellant from his conviction on a charge of murder at his trial before Sevigny
C.J. and a jury on the 15th of January, 1954.

[Page 29]



The appeal is
brought pursuant to leave granted by my brother Kellock. The questions of law
upon which leave to appeal was granted are as follows:



(i) Were the
jury misdirected by the learned trial judge with reference to the doctrine of
reasonable doubt? -



(ii) Were the
jury misdirected by the learned trial judge with reference to the rule as to
circumstantial evidence?










(iii) Was the
appellant deprived of a trial according to law by reason of the fact that the
crown counsel used inflammatory language in his address to the jury?



As to the first
question, I am of opinion that when all that was said by the learned Chief
Justice in his charge to the jury as to the onus resting upon the Crown and as
to the accused being entitled to the benefit of the doubt is considered as a
whole it cannot be said that there was misdirection on this point. I do,
however, venture to make the respectiful suggestion that it would be well if
trial judges when describing to the jury the doubt the existence of which
prevents them from returning a verdict of guilt would refrain from substituting
other adjectives for the adjective ""reasonable"" which has been so
long established as the proper term to employ in this connection.



As to the second
question of law on which leave to appeal was granted, it is common ground that
the evidence against the appellant was wholly circumstantial. It is clear that
throughout his charge the learned Chief Justice failed to direct the jury that
before they could find the appellant guilty on such evidence they must be
satisfied not only that the circumstances proved were consistent with his having
committed the crime but also that they were inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion than that the appellant was the guilty person. The rule
requiring the giving of such a direction to the jury, usually referred to as
the rule in Hodge's Case[26], has
been long established and it is necessary to refer only to the following
authorities. In McLean v. The King[27], the
following passage in the unanimous judgment of the Court appears at page 690:



It is of last
importance, we do not doubt, where the evidence adduced by the Crown is solely
or mainly of what is commonly described as circumstantial, that the jury should
be brought to realize that they ought not to find a verdict against the accused
unless convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the guilt of the accused is the
only reasonable explanation of the facts established by the evidence. But there is no

[Page 30]



single
exclusive formula which it is the duty of the trial judge to employ. As a rule
he would be well advised to adopt the language of Baron Alder-son or its
equivalent.



In The
King v. Comba[28], Duff C.J. giving the unanimous judgment of the Court said
at page 397:










It is
admitted by the Crown, as the fact is, that the verdict rests solely upon a
basis of circumstantial evidence. In such cases, by the long settled rule of
the common law, which is the rule of law in Canada, the jury, before finding a
prisoner guilty upon such evidence, must be satisfied not only that the
circumstances are consistent with a conclusion that the criminal act was
committed by the accused, but also that the facts are such as to be
inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused is the
guilty person.



It is however
desirable to point out, as was done by Middleton J.A. in Rex v. Comba[29],
that the rule in Hodge's case is quite distinct from the rule
requiring a direction on the question of reasonable doubt.



On this point I do
not find it necessary to quote from the charge of the learned Chief Justice in
the case at bar as I understand that all members of the 'Court agree that there
was a failure to give the necessary direction.



As to the third
question of law on which leave to appeal was granted, it appears that in the
course of his address to the jury counsel for the Crown said:



Le
docteur nous dit au sujet du sang,-on nous a fait un reproche messieurs parce
que nous avons fait faire une analyse du sang. Mais la Couronne n'est pas ici
pour le plaisir de faire condamner des innocents.



C'est
le devoir de la Couronne, quand une affaire comme celle-là arrive, n'importe
quelle affaire, et encore plus dans une affaire grave, de faire toutes les
recherches possibles, et si au cours de ces recherches avec nos experts on en
vient à la conclusion que l'accusé n'est pas coupable ou qu'il y a un doute
raisonable, c'est le devoir de la Couronne, messieurs, de le dire ou si on en
vient à la conclusion qu'il n'est pas coupable, de ne pas faire d'arrestation.
Ici, c'est ce qu'on a fait.



Counsel for the
Crown concluded his address to the jury as follows:



On
voit tous les jours des crimes encore plus nombreux que jamais, des vols et
bien d'autre chose, au moins celui qui vole à main armée ne fait pas souffrir
sa victime comme Boucher a fait souffrir Jabour. C'est un crime révoltant d'un
homme dans toute la force de l'âge, d'un athlète contre un vieillard de 77 ans
qui n'est pas capable de se défendre. J'ai un peu respect pour ceux qui volent
quand au moins ils ont donné une chance à leur victime de se défendre, mais
j'ai aucune sympathie, aucune et je vous demande de n'en pas avoir, aucune
sympathie pour ces lâches qui frappent des hommes, des amis. Jabour n'était
peut-être pas un ami, mais c'était un voisin, du moins ils se connaissaient.

[Page 31]



Lâchement,
à coups d'hache.-Et, si vous rapportez un verdict de coupable, pour une fois ça
me ferait presque plaisir de demander la peine de mort contre lui.










There
are a number of other passages in the address of this counsel to the jury which
I do not find it necessary to quote as I think they can be fairly summarized by
saying that counsel made it clear to the jury not only that he was submitting
to them that the conclusion which they should reach on the evidence was that
the accused was guilty, a submission which it was of course proper for him to
make, but also that he personally entertained the opinion that the accused was
guilty.



There
is no doubt that it is improper for counsel, whether for the Crown or the
defence to express his own opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused.



The
grave objection to what was said by counsel is that the jury would naturally
and reasonably understand from his words first quoted above that he, with the
assistance of other qualified persons, had made a careful examination into the
facts of the case prior to the trial and that if as a result of such
investigation he entertained any reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt a
duty rested upon him as Crown counsel to so inform the Court. As, far from
expressing or suggesting the existence of any such doubt in his mind, he made
it clear to the jury that he personally believed the accused to be guilty, the
jury would reasonably take from what he had said that as the result of his
investigation outside the court room Crown counsel had satisfied himself of the
guilt of the accused. The making of such a statement to the jury was clearly
unlawful and its damaging effect would, in my view, be even greater than the
admission of illegal evidence or a statement by Crown counsel to the jury
either in his opening address or in his closing address of facts as to which
there was no evidence.



I conclude
that in regard to both the second and third questions on which leave to appeal
was granted there was error in law at the trial and that accordingly the appeal
should be allowed unless this is a case in which the Court should apply the
provisions of section 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code.

[Page 32]



The
subsection mentioned has often been considered in this Court and, in the view
that I take of the evidence, it is sufficient to refer to the judgment of
Kerwin J., as he then was, in Schmidt v. The King[30]:










The meaning
of these words has been considered in this Court in several cases, one of which
is Gouin v. The King, from all of which it is clear that the onus rests
on the Crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict would necessarily have been
the same if the charge had been correct or if no evidence had been improperly
admitted. The principles therein set forth do not differ from the rules set
forth in a recent decision of the House of Lords in Stirland v. Director of
Public Prosecutions, i.e., that the proviso that the Court of Appeal may
dismiss the appeal if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice
has actually occurred in convicting the accused assumes a situation where a
reasonable jury, after being properly directed, would, on the evidence properly
admissible, with-out doubt convict.



As there is to be
a new trial, I will, in accordance with the established practice of the Court,
refrain from discussing the evidence and will simply state my opinion that it
cannot be safely affirmed that the jury, had they been properly directed as to
the rule in Hodge's case and had the improper remarks of Crown counsel
not been made, would necessarily have convicted the appellant. This makes it
unnecessary for me to consider the submission of counsel for the appellant,
that even if the Court should be of opinion that had the trial been free from
the errors in law dealt with above the jury would necessarily have convicted
the appellant the 'conviction should nonetheless be quashed because these
errors were of so fundamental a character that the appellant was deprived of
his right to the verdict of a jury following a trial according to law and such
deprivation is of necessity 'a substantial wrong, an argument which would have
required a 'careful examination of the judgments in such cases as Allen v.
The King[31] and
Northey v. The King[32].



Having concluded
that there was error in law at the trial in regard to both the second and third
questions on which leave to appeal was granted and that this is not a case in
which it can be said that had such errors not occurred the verdict would necessarily
have been the same it follows that the conviction must be quashed.



I would allow the
appeal, quash the conviction and direct a new trial.

Appeal
allowed; conviction quashed; new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT
OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal
law—Murder—Charge to jury—Plea of insanity—Possible verdicts—Alleged illegal
cross-examination of accused—Whether miscarriage of justice—Criminal Code, ss.
1014(2), 1025.

The appellant was
convicted of murder. His appeal was unanimously dismissed by the Court of
Appeal. He now appeals to this Court, by leave granted under s. 1025 of the Criminal
Code-, on grounds that the trial judge erred (a) in his instructions
as to the possible verdicts and in omitting to mention the possibility of a
disagreement, and (b) in his instructions as to the plea of insanity and
in his statement of the evidence in support thereof. Subsequently, of its own
motion, the Court ordered a new hearing on a point dealing with an alleged
improper cross-examination of the accused as to statements made to the police
but not proved to have been voluntarily made.

Held (Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. dissenting),
that the appeal should be dismissed.

Per Kerwin C.J., Taschereau, Rand, Estey and Abbott
JJ.: There is no obligation upon a trial judge to explain to the jury that they
may disagree.

The trial judge had adequately
presented the issue of insanity and the evidence in support thereof.

Per Kerwin C.J., Taschereau and Abbott JJ. : Assuming
that the cross-examination was improper, there was no duty on the trial judge
in the circumstances to point out to the jury that this was not evidence. There
had been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, even if the trial
judge should have gone into the matter.

Per Rand J.: Assuming that the statements were
inadmissible, there had been no miscarriage of justice since the remaining
evidence was so overwhelming and conclusive.

Per Kellock J.: Such a statement could not be used
even in cross-examination until its voluntary nature had been established.
However, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred since the
cross-examination simply brought out in more detail what was involved in the
evidence not objected to.

Per Estey J.: Assuming that the cross-examination was
improper, there had been no miscarriage of justice since any of the suggestions
made in the course of the cross-examination were either contained in or
directly implied in statements already in evidence.

Per Locke and Fauteux JJ. (dissenting): The right to
disagree was not excluded in the trial judge's charge.

[Page 121]

The trial judge had adequately
presented the issue of insanity, but not the medical theory of the defence.

Per Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. (dissenting) :
The trial judge should not have permitted the statements to be used in
cross-examination without first having decided as to their free and voluntary
character. The avowed purpose of the cross-examination was to destroy the
factual basis, i.e. the lack of memory of the accused, upon which the medical
expert for the defence mainly rested his opinion as to the insanity of the
accused. It is impossible to affirm that had this illegal cross-examination not
taken place, the jury would necessarily have convicted the appellant.

APPEAL from the
judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming the conviction of the appellant on a
charge of murder.

L. Corriveau for the appellant.

N. Dorion
Q.C., P. Miquelon Q.C. and P.
Flynn for the respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J., Taschereau and Abbott JJ. was
delivered by :

The Chief Justice:—The appellant was
convicted of having murdered one of his children and his appeal to the Court of
Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) for the Province of Quebec 2 was dismissed unanimously. By leave granted by
Mr. Justice Estey under s. 1025 of the Criminal Code he was given
permission to appeal to this Court on the following points of law:—

(a) Did the learned
trial judge err in his instructions relative to the possible verdicts the jury
might render and, in particular, in omitting to mention the possibility of
their disagreeing?

(b) Did the learned trial judge err in his
instructions relative to the plea of insanity and his statement of the evidence
in support thereof?

There appears to be no doubt that he killed not only the one
child referred to, but his other three children. The defence was insanity and
the accused gave evidence on his own behalf and also called Dr. Moffatt.

[Page 122]

As to the first
point,—The learned trial judge in a careful charge explained that any verdict
had to be unanimous and also that there were four possible verdicts:—

(1) Coupable;

(2) Coupable
d'homicide involontaire;

(3) Non coupable;

(4) Non coupable
pour cause de folie.

Reliance was placed upon what was said in this Court in Latour
v. The King 3.
In that case a new trial was directed for certain reasons and then the judgment
continued with the following obiter dictum at p. 30:

The other matter in
which comments may be added, although the point was not raised by the
appellant, is related to the following direction given to the jury:

This is an important
case and you must agree upon a verdict. This means that you must be unanimous.

This is all that was
said on the subject. If one of the jurors could have reasonably understood from
this direction—and it may be open to such construction—that there was an
obligation to agree upon a verdict, the direction would be bad in law. For it
is not only the right but the duty of a juror ""to disagree if, after full
and sincere consideration of the facts of the case, in the light of the
directions received on the law, he is unable conscientiously to accept, after
honest discussion with his colleagues, the views of the latter. To render a
verdict, the jurors must be unanimous but this does not mean that they are
obliged to agree, but that only a unanimity of views shall constitute a verdict
bringing the case to an end. The obligation is not to agree but to co-operate
honestly in the study of the facts of a case for its proper determination
according to law.

The terse manner in
which the trial judge in that case had referred to the matter is to be noted.
In the present instance the trial judge made it quite clear to the jury what
were their duties. He stated, more than once, that they must be unanimous and
again, more than once, explained the various conclusions at which they could
unanimously arrive. These conclusions are the verdicts enumerated above. To
give effect to the appellant's argument would mean that a trial judge should
invite a jury to disagree. This is a far different matter from an intimation,
veiled or otherwise, that, notwithstanding the views of one or more jurors, it
was necessary that one of certain defined conclusions be arrived at, or
verdicts returned. After going over the trial judge's charge in its entirety, I
am satisfied that there is no basis for the argument on the first point.

[Page 123]

The second ground of
appeal is divisible into two parts, the first of which is: Did the trial judge
err in his instructions relative to the plea of insanity? Our attention was
called to what was said in the charge at p. 617 of the record,—

Et, ici encore, la defense doit apporter une preuve qui vous
satisfasse raisonnablement par sa prépondérance, que l'accusé était en somme
dans cet état d'esprit exigé par l'article 19.

and objection is raised to the words ""par sa
prépondérance"". As to this, reliance was placed upon the following
statement of Anglin J. in Clark v. The King 4:

No doubt, however,
""proved"" in subsecticon 3 of section 19 of our Code must mean
""proved to the satisfaction of the jury"", which, in turn, means to
its reasonable satisfaction.

and to this extract
from the reasons of Mignault J. at p. 632:

I would therefore think
that a proper direction would be to call the attention of the jury to the legal
presumption of sanity and to inform them, the onus being on the accused, that
insanity must be proved by him to their satisfaction. Further than that I would
not go.

However, at p. 626,
Anglin J. stated that he found nothing ""to warrant requiring evidence of
greater weight than would ordinarily satisfy a jury in a civil case that a
burden of proof had been discharged—that, balancing the probabilities upon the
whole case, there was such a preponderance of evidence as would warrant them as
reasonable men in concluding that it had been established that the accused when
he committed the act was mentally incapable of knowing its nature and quality,
or if he did know it, did not know that he was doing what was wrong."" And
earlier on the same page of his reasons (632), Mignault J. had stated that proof
in ordinary matters did not suppose that the evidence removed all doubt;
""it is the result"", he continued, ""of a preponderance of
evidence, or of the acceptance on reasonable grounds of one probability in
preference to another, and, in the case of insanity, the evidence generally is
largely a matter or expert opinion"". Duff J., with the concurrence of Brodeur J., referred to the burden of proof resting upon a party to establish a
given allegation of fact in civil proceedings as being merely to produce such a
preponderance of evidence as to shew that the conclusion he

[Page 124]

seeks to establish is substantially the most probable of the
possible views of the facts, (referring to Cooper v. Slade 5). We were also
referred to the commencement of the reasons for judgment in Smythe v. The
King 6,
delivered by Sir Lyman Duff on behalf of the Court :

It was settled by the decision of this Court in Clark v.
The King (1921) 61 S.C.R. 608, that where a plea of insanity is advanced
on a trial for murder the law does not require the accused, in order to succeed
upon that issue, to satisfy the jury that insanity has been proved beyond all
reasonable doubt; it is sufficient in point of law if insanity is proved to the
reasonable satisfaction of the jury.

However, it is to be noted that Sir Lyman later referred to
Best on Evidence as to a mere preponderance of probability in civil proceedings
being sufficient and then continued:

It is the rule that prevails generally in civil cases, as
this Court decided in the case above mentioned (the Clark case).

I am satisfied that the objection 'taken to the judge's
charge in this case on the first part of the second ground is without
foundation.

The next part of the second ground was whether the trial
judge erred in his charge to the jury in his statement of the evidence in
support of the plea of insanity. Upon this branch of his argument counsel for
the accused quite properly pointed out that what was sought to be shown was
that the appellant was insane at the time of the killing of the children. Two
doctors gave evidence on behalf of the Crown and counsel for the accused
admitted that one of these, Dr. Larue, did distinctly state that, in his
opinion, the accused at that time was not insane. It is contended, however,
that the other doctor called by the Crown, Dr. Martin, related his opinion not
to that event but to the time, or times, when he examined the accused some days
later. This might appear to be so if one looks only at that part of the
latter's evidence referred to by counsel, but a reading of what immediately
precedes, and other parts of Dr. Martin's evidence, makes it quite clear that
he had not so confined his opinion and, therefore, the trial judge was not in
error when, in his resume of the evidence of the two Crown doctors, he stated
that they (meaning both Crown

[Page 125]

doctors) had testified that Hébert knew
what he was doing at the moment of the crime and was able to distinguish right
from wrong.

The final part of the second ground of appeal is that the
trial judge incorrectly stated the evidence of Dr. Moffatt, called on behalf of
the accused. For the trial judge to have charged the jury in the manner
suggested by counsel for the appellant would have entailed his repeating a
great part not only of the examination in chief, but also of the
cross-examination of the doctor, since it was apparently difficult to determine
exactly what Dr. Moffatt's conclusions were. Undoubtedly they were based upon
the presumption that the story of the accused as told in the witness box (and
which Dr. Moffatt said was the same as the accused had previously told him) was
a true version of what had actually occurred. The questions put by jurors to
the doctor showed that they were alive to the nature of the problem they were
to decide and, of course, as the trial judge told them, they were not bound to
accept the evidence of any witness, either in whole or in part. The evidence
included that of the accused and there was put in a letter, or note, by him,
although it was uncertain when it had been written. It was made clear to the
jury that they were the judges of the facts and that they were not bound in any
way by the judge's recollection of the testimony. After reading Dr. Moffatt's
evidence and the judge's charge, I conclude that the appellant has failed to
substantiate this final branch of the second ground of appeal.

What has been said was
sufficient to dispose of the only questions raised before us on the original
argument when judgment was reserved. During consideration of the matter a point
arose and later we heard whatever Counsel had to say with respect to it, which
is whether Crown Counsel improperly cross-examined the appellant as to the
statements allegedly made by him to Captain Matte, or other police officers,
and whether the trial judge's charge was proper in relation thereto. In order
to avoid any difficulty Mr. Justice Estey granted leave to appeal on this
point.

The particular statement
emphasized is one allegedly made by the accused to Captain Matte and put down
in writing. This was not referred to in the evidence given on the voir dire,
although oral statements made by the accused

[Page 126]

to Captain Matte and
Officers Pettigrew and Fontaine were put in evidence. In the presence of the
jury the accused was cross-examined as to what is supposed to be in the writing
made by or at the instance of Captain Matte. For the purposes of this appeal I
assume that this cross-examination was not proper.

It is said that in three
respects the alleged written statement goes beyond what was said orally by the
accused to the other two officers: (1) There was no mention of the drinking of
beer by the accused; (2) there was no statement that the accused started his
operations in the first room of his house; (3) there was no statement that he
killed René first. It is then said that the trial judge
should have explicitly pointed out to the jury that nothing suggested by Crown
Counsel in that part of his cross-examination was evidence, and that they
should bear in mind that the three matters mentioned were not included in the
oral statements made by the accused. In my opinion, having told the jury that
they were to be bound by the evidence given at the trial, and having placed the
issues in relation to that evidence before them, there was no obligation on the
trial judge under all the circumstances to refer to the matter in the manner
suggested.

As to the cross-examination itself, I am of opinion that
there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice and that even if the
trial judge, contrary to my opinion, should have gone into the other matter as
suggested, that defect, if any, also would come under the saving provisions of
s-s. (2) of s. 1014 of the Criminal Code.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Rand J.:—The
harrowing facts of this case cannot be permitted to becloud the issue. What is
urged is that the defence was not adequately placed before the jury. That
defence was this. The circumstances of the life of the accused, aggravated
latterly by those of his marriage, had gradually generated emotional pressures
of such despair and frustration that they finally overwhelmed the will in an
orgy of killing and contemplated suicide. In the throes of the paroxysm a
temporary blackout of the mind made it impossible for the accused to appreciate
the nature of what he was doing or that it was morally or legally wrong. No

[Page 127]

attempt was made to analyse or portray his mental state
during this physical convulsion, that is, the nature of the intellectual,
volitional or sense activity which directed the actions, or whether there was
no such direction and the actions were, in some manner, involuntary.

The fact that men sometimes yield to such tensions is as old
as humanity and nothing is added by dignifying its manifestation as a theory or
describing it as a ""réaction dépressive accompagnée par un
état de confusion, ou de panique"". But treating it as it was
advanced and describing it as specifically as its nebulous and elusive nature
could be gathered from the evidence of the expert called by the defence, it was
fairly and fully transmitted to the jury by the trial judge From the record of
the proceedings, it is obvious that they were keenly alive to what was being
suggested. With this on the one side and the mass of factual evidence against
it, largely given by the accused himself, on the other, carefully placed in
juxtaposition in the course of the charge, they had before them every
significant factor to the determination they were called upon to make.

On the renewed argument the further ground was stressed that
in cross-examination of the accused he was questioned on statements he had made
to a police officer on the day following his arrest which were apparently
reduced to writing. If they were inadmissible because of a presumed influence
of favour or fear arising from the circumstances in which they were made, then
I agree that neither s. 10 nor 11 of The Canada Evidence Act permits
cross-examination on them. For the purposes of evidence they are tainted with
untrustworthiness and the reasons that exclude them from direct introduction
prevent their being slipped in the back way by cross-examination: Rex v.
Treacy 7:
Rex v. Scory 8.
I am by no means satisfied that they were not admissible, but it is unnecessary
to decide that and I will assume that they were, and that the trial judge
should have directed the jury to dismiss from their minds any implication from
the questions asked or the answers given.

A confession had been
made before there was any suspicion even that a crime had been committed. The
accused was obviously tortured in mind and conscience and

[Page 128]

he sought relief by not
only volunteering all of the essential facts of the tragedy but by going to his
home and there giving a graphic confirmation of them while the officers
seemingly were still somewhat incredulous. The statements could have done
little, if anythting, more than to supply a few minor details of the circumstances
or the order or course of the events. Up to this time there had been no
suggestion by the accused that he could not remember any detail and no question
on cross-examination of any of the officers went to such a point. Only when the
defence was being adduced was the so-called blackout brought up. But there was
before the jury a writing found on the table in the house and admittedly made
by the accused which, whether written immediately before or after the crime,
was conclusive against the existence of this phenomenon.

The only other ground
urged calling for an observation is based on the reference in the judgment of
this Court in Rex v. Latour 9 to the unanimity of a verdict. But the language
used there must be read in relation to the facts of that case. There was
obviously no intention of suggesting that a verdict was obligatory or that a
trial judge must bring to the minds of the jury the fact that they could
disagree.

Notwithstanding what I
assume to have been improper cross-examination, the remaining evidence before
the jury was so overwhelming and conclusive that, acting judicially, they must
have brought in the verdict they did.

I would, therefore,
dismiss the appeal.

Kellock
J. :—I do not find it necessary to
refer to any of the points originally raised on behalf of the appellant. After
reserving judgment however, the court, of its own motion, raised a question not
argued by counsel for the appellant, and leave being given to argue the point,
the argument has now been heard.

According to evidence
not in any way objected to, it appears that the killing occurred some time
during the night of Tuesday, April 21, 1953. The appellant says that following
the killing, he remained at home until Thursday, the 23rd, when, having
invented a story that his children had met death in a railway accident, he went
to the morgue to

[Page 129]

make burial
arrangements. After the appellant had left, the police were notified of the
visit and the witnesses Pettigrew and Fontaine were despatched
from police head-quarters to investigate.

From the description
they had received of the appellant they were able to identify him on the street
and he agreed to go with them to the police station. During the course of this
trip, he told them voluntarily that he had had trouble with his wife, that he
was tired of life, that he had killed his four children, that if they did not
believe him they could come to his home and see for themselves and that he knew
he would be hung but that he had done it just the same. He added that he had
intended to take the lives of three other people. The appellant repeated the
substance of these statements to Police Captain Matte at the station and then
accompanied the three police officers to his home.

On arrival, he opened
the door for them and showed them throughout, conducting Captain Matte to the
bathroom where he produced an axe saying to Captain Matte ""c'est avec ca"".

In the kitchen Matte found on the table a note which the
appellant admitted he had written. This speaks of the difficulty he had with
his wife, that she had desired separation and custody of the children, but that
he had promised she would never get them. It includes the statement : ""moi sest féni je vas êtres pandu mais je vas
maurire avec mais anfant"". Whether the appellant wrote the note
before or after the deaths of the children is not established.

The three police officers were duly called by the Crown and
deposed as above. The appellant gave evidence on his own behalf, testifying
that he did not remember the killing having fallen asleep and wakened up after
the event, when he attempted suicide. There was some evidence of bleeding at
the neck when the police first met him. During cross-examination, Crown counsel
proceeded to examine the appellant with relation to a statement made to Captain
Matte on the morning of April 24 after he had been arrested. Although objected
to, the cross-examination was allowed by the learned trial judge in the view
that it was proper with relation to credibility. In my view, this ruling

[Page 130]

was erroneous, the law being well settled that a statement
of this character cannot be used even in cross-examination until its voluntary
nature has been established.

The question is, therefore, as to whether or not a new trial
ought to be directed or whether, in the circumstances, it can properly be said
that notwithstanding this error and the failure of the learned judge to refer
to the matter at all in his charge, ""no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice has actually occurred""; s. 1014(2) of the Criminal Code. In
my opinion, in the circumstances of this case, the subsection ought to be
applied.

It is to be observed that at no time during April 23 did the
appellant suggest that he had suffered from any failure of memory. How long
afterwards this suggestion was put forward does not appear. On the contrary,
the appellant had no difficulty whatsoever in telling what had occurred as
above. He himself produced the axe and, unlike his evidence at the trial when
he said that he had concluded from the presence of the axe beside him he must
have committed the deed, he told the police that it was with it he had done the
killing.

Again, whether the note of the appellant was written by him
before or after the killing is immaterial. If before, it would evidence a clear
intention to commit the deed; if after, it indicates clearly that the deed had
been knowingly done. In these circumstances, the jury, in my opinion, must
necessarily have come to the conclusion that the defence of loss of memory was
an afterthought. I am fortified in this view by the circumstance that this must
also have been the view of the professional advisers of the appellant as they
did not raise the point but argued it only after it had been raised proprio
motu by the court. The cross-examination simply brought out in more detail
what was involved in the evidence not objected to. While, as I have said, the
course followed by Crown counsel was wrong, I feel obliged in the circumstances
to say that the subsection should be applied and that the appeal should be
dismissed.

Estey J.:—The
appellant submits that the learned trial judge erred, when instructing the jury
as to the possible verdicts they might render, in that he failed to mention the
possibility of their disagreeing. This submission is founded

[Page 131]

upon a dictum in Latour v. The King 10, to the effect that a judge
ought not to tell the jury they must agree upon a verdict in a manner that
precludes disagreement. The observations in that case were prompted by the
imperative and unqualified language used in directing the jury. It does not suggest
that a trial judge must point out to the jury that they may disagree. A juror
is bound by his oath to decide according to the evidence and if, after a
careful and complete consideration of all the facts and circumstances, his
conclusion is different from that of the other jurors it is his duty to
disagree. The learned trial judge in the present case discussed the issues, the
relevant law and facts and pointed out that there were four possible
verdicts—murder, manslaughter, not guilty, or not guilty because of insanity.
He then discussed the difference between 'murder and manslaughter and, if they
concluded the appellant had committed murder or manslaughter, they might find
him not guilty because of insanity. Then, after referring to certain matters relative
to the verdict not material to this discussion, the learned trial judge stated:

Vous devrez maintenant, messieurs, vous
rappeler que le verdict que vous rapporterez, quel qu'il soit, doit être un
verdict unanime, c'est-à-dire que tous les douze, vous devez être de la même
opinion et rapporter le même verdict.

The learned trial judge, throughout this portion
of his charge, was discussing the possible verdicts that the jury might
render and impressed upon them that in order to arrive at a verdict they must
be unanimous. A verdict, as stated in the Oxford Dictionary, is ""the
decision of a jury in a civil or criminal cause upon an issue which has been
submitted to their judgment."" A disagreement is not a verdict. It exists
only because of the inability of the jury to arrive at a decision and,
therefore, a verdict. In this context the jury would understand that he was
discussing a verdict as a decision and not in any way referring to the
possibility of a disagreement or denying their right to disagree. There is no
obligation upon a judge to explain to a jury they may disagree. In fact, a
trial judge does not accept a disagreement until he is satisfied that there is
no reasonable possibility of the jury arriving at a unanimous decision.

[Page 132]

The second submission is
in relation to the learned trial judge's instructions relative to the plea of
insanity and his statements of the evidence in support thereof. In the course
of his charge the learned trial judge explained the law relative to insanity as
a defence in a manner that no exception has been taken thereto. The burden of
proving this plea rests upon the defence, but is not, as he explained, a burden
such as the Crown must discharge before a jury would be justified in finding an
accused guilty of the offence as charged, but that it was sufficient if, upon
the evidence, they were reasonably satisfied that the appellant was insane,
they would find him not guilty because of insanity. Counsel for the appellant
objected to the word ""prépondérance""
as used by the learned trial judge
on several occasions and more particularly because, as the Crown had called two
experts and the defence but one, the jury might, because of the use of this
word, be led to give greater weight to the evidence of two rather than one. In
addressing juries learned judges have often stated that a jury may be
reasonably satisfied if the weight or preponderance of, or if upon a balance of
probabilities, the evidence directs them to a certain conclusion or decision.
It would appear that the learned trial judge was using the word ""prépondérance in this sense and that it would be so understood
by the members of the jury, who would not be led to give effect to the number
of witnesses rather than the evidence. This conclusion is supported by the learned
trial judge's pointing out:

Vous n'êtes pas tenus de croire ou d'accepter
ces témoignages ou leurs opinions, pas plus qu'il s'agissait des autres
témoins. Vous pouvez les rejeter en bloc, vous pouvez vous en servir pour
juger. Le rôle de l'expert consiste à éclairer, à vous guider, mais leurs dires
et leurs opinions ne vous lient pas, et vous devez considérer non seulement
leurs témoignages, vous en tenez compte si vous voulez, non seulement leurs
témoignages, mais l'ensemble de la preuve, pour vous former une opinion quant à
l'état d'esprit de l'accusé. Vous avez votre bon sens, vous avez votre
jugement, alors les faits qui ont été rapportés par d'autres témoins dans la
preuve, la conduite de l'accusé, son comportement, ses écrits, ses déclarations,
son attitude dans la boîte aux témoins, tout cela, messieurs, ça constitue de
la preuve et ça doit servir à vous guider pour vous demander si c'est l'accusé
qui a fait ce qu'on lui reproche et si c'est lui qui l'a fait, savait-il,
pouvait-il savoir à ce moment-là ce qu'il faisait.

Moreover, counsel for
the accused contended the learned trial judge had dealt more fully with the
evidence of the experts for the Crown than he had with that of the expert

[Page 133]

called on behalf of the
defence. It is the duty of a trial judge to define the issues and discuss the
evidence in relation thereto. He need not, however, review the evidence in
detail. In the course of his charge he stated:

L'expert de la
défense a eu des entrevues avec Hébert. Il a étudié les renseignements qu'il a
obtenus, relatifs à son passé, sa vie conjugale et, en supposant que ce que
Hébert a dit était vrai, il a diagnostiqué chez l'accusé, ce qu'il a appelé
""une réaction dépressive accompagnée par un état de confusion ou de
panique."" Il en conclut qu'au moment où Hébert aurait fait ce qu'on lui
reproche, que c'est lui qui l'a fait, il ne pouvait connaître à ce moment-là la
différence entre le bien et le mal.

Later the learned trial judge returned to the early life of the accused, his marital difficulties
and their possible effect upon his mentality and again impressed upon the jury
that it was their duty to give such effect thereto as they, in their judgment,
might see fit. The learned trial judge did not, as the jury would no doubt
understand, attempt to review in detail the evidence for either the Crown or
the defence. In my view it cannot be said that the learned judge has not fully
presented the issue of insanity or that he has emphasized the evidence for the
Crown more than that for the defence.

The third submission on behalf of the accused is that Crown
counsel, in cross-examination of the appellant, referred to a statement, that
appellant had made to the police and which had not been proved to have been
voluntarily made, in a manner that constituted error in law. The appellant made
statements to Lieutenant Pettigrew and Constable Fontaine on his way to the
police station and immediately upon his arrival made a further statement to
Captain Matte. These were all proved to have been voluntarily made and placed
in evidence by the Crown. It appears that later Captain Matte, upon a number of
occasions, had him brought to his office where at least one statement made by
the appellant was recorded by a stenographer. No effort was made in the course
of the Crown's case to place this statement in evidence, nor was it proved to
have been voluntarily made. Counsel for the Crown, however, in the course of
his cross-examination of the appellant, while not showing to him the statement,
did ask questions as to a portion of its contents and in the course thereof
suggested that the appellant had consumed liquor on the night of, and prior to,
the murder of his children;

[Page 134]

that he had started at the first room and that René was the first to have died; further, that he had reflected
upon his position of having four children without money to buy the necessities
of life and his wife's mode of living and decided to murder his children. The
appellant replied throughout this portion of his examination that Captain Matte
had, upon these occasions, asked him questions, but that he did not remember
his replies, as he had not cared what he then said because he had made up his
mind to die with his children.

A cross-examination upon such a statement, by the great
weight of authority in our provincial courts, as well as in the court of
criminal appeal in England, has been condemned. However, it is unnecessary to
determine this point here, as, upon the assumption that this was an improper
examination, it would appear that, having regard to the facts and the
circumstances of this case, there has been no miscarriage of justice within the
meaning of s. 1014(2) of the Criminal Code.

Tuesday night, when the appellant and his four infant
children were the only persons in his house, the latter were all put to death.
Thereafter appellant remained in the house with the doors locked and the
curtains drawn until Thursday afternoon, when he went to Marceau's undertaking
parlour, where the manager, Pouliot, was the first person to whom he had spoken
since the death of the children.

Some time before leaving
for Marceau's the appellant wrote, in his own handwriting, a statement which
reads:

Ma femme est
partie et je lui ai ôté mes enfants et j'ai promis qu'elle aurait jamais les
enfants à elle, ça dépend de ma belle-mère et ma belle-sœur qui garde ma femme,
moi j'aime mieux mourir tout de suite avec mes enfants que rester sur la terre
et toujours pâtir. J'ai eu un téléphone qu'elle voulait une séparation et
garder les enfants, mais c'est fini, j'aime mieux être pendu, moi je vais
mourir avec mes enfants; ma femme est partie dépenser l'argent des enfants,
elle est venue chercher le chèque, nous autres nous avons pas d'argent, elle va
se rappeler leur avoir ôté le manger dans la bouche des enfants; tout ça dépend
de ma belle-mère et me belle-sœur de garder ma femme.

The first portion of this statement, as filed in court, would seem to read as follows:

Ma femme est partie et veut m'ôter mes enfants
et j'ai promis qu'elle n'aurait jamais les enfants.

[Page 135]

It was so read to Dr. Moffatt in the course of his
cross-examination.

At Mareeau's undertaking parlour appellant explained to
Pouliot that the four children had been killed in a railway accident and that
he desired to make arrangements for their funeral. Pouliot immediately
communicated with the police and it was shortly thereafter that the appellant
was asked by Lieutenant Pettigrew and Constable Fontaine to accompany them to
Captain Matte's office. As they proceeded in the police automobile 'the accused
made a number of voluntary statements which were placed in evidence. As to
these statements Lieutenant Pettigrew stated, in part:

C'est tout ce qu'il a dit, qu'il était tanné
de la vie que sa femme faisait et que c'était pour cette raison qu'il avait tué
ses quatre enfants.

........

Il a dit qu'il avait tué ses enfants, qu'il
savait qu'il était pour être pendu et qu'il le faisait pareil. A part ça.
. . . .

........

Alors, il aurait
dit: ""Vous m'arrêtez en temps parce que j'en avais trois autres à
tuer.""

Constable Fontaine stated :

Il a dit que c'était parce que ça allait pas
bien avec sa femme et qu'il aimait ses enfants.

They proceeded to Captain Matte's office and there the
appellant repeated much of what he had said in the automobile and that if they
did not believe him he could show to them the four bodies. Captain Matte, with
others and the appellant, proceeded to the latter's home. There appellant
unlocked the door, showed the four infant bodies to the police, then went into
the bathroom, where he picked up an axe, handed it to the police and said : ""C'est avec ca."" It was during this visit that the
above statement, written by the accused, was found upon the kitchen table, as
to which Captain Matte deposed:

Alors que j'accompagnais l'accusé, nous sommes
arrivés à la table, il a fait un geste pour s'emparer de ce papier là et d'un
crayon qui était avec, le crayon ici.

The appellant, at the trial, stated his wife had been away since Saturday night and, as a consequence,
he had been forced to remain at home and, therefore, not to go to his work on
Monday and Tuesday; that on the Tuesday night, after preparing the children for
bed and while they were playing, he had informed them that he would have to place

[Page 136]

them in homes. The two older protested. When they had gone
to bed he had reflected upon the conduct of his wife, his financial position
and his responsibility to his children; that he wept and went to deep. Later he
woke up and found an axe beside him, his children all dead and a scratch about
three inches long on his own throat.

The real issue at the trial was whether the appellant had no
knowledge of what he was doing as he put his children to death. The two experts
called on behalf of the Crown, who had submitted the appellant to a physical
examination and had conversed with and questioned him upon four occasions
between April 25 and November 6 inclusive, were of the opinion that the
appellant did, at the time his children died, know what he was doing and
understood the nature and quality of the act which he had committed. These experts
were of the opinion that there are only two types of individuals who may be
unconscious for a short time and recover, as the appellant did after the death
of his children. First, a person who receives a blow upon the head or suffers a
shock in an accident may be unconscious for a time and recover. The second is a
person who suffers from epilepsy.

The expert called on behalf of the appellant deposed that he
had conversed with and questioned the appellant upon three occasions between
November 3 and 6, and, having regard to his history and his conduct on the
night in question, he stated:

… j'ai porté le diagnostic de réaction dépressive, qui était accompagnée par un état de confusion,
un état de panique.

Dr. Moffatt did not describe nor did he explain the symptoms
of ""réaction dépressive."" He was questioned at
length with regard to the effect of being depressed. After explaining that ""dépression"" was not of itself a mental illness, he
stated it was a symptom and might lead to a mental illness. He was asked:

Q. Vous donnez le symptôme le plus
caractéristique?

R. Chez d'aucun oui, chez d'autres, non.
Peut-être l'anxiété aurait causé un état dépressif quelconque. Quand le
dépression est assez avancée, elle cause une psychose, une maladie mentale, le
refus de manger, l'incapacité de dormir le soir.

[Page 137]

There was no evidence
suggesting that he had ever refused to eat, or suffered difficulty with respect
to his appetite or his ability to sleep.

That the jury fully
appreciated this issue is evidenced by the questions which their members asked
the experts. It is significant that, when a juryman asked if it was possible
that one who puts others to death and remains living himself may be able to
forget completely all that he did in putting the others to death, Dr. Moffatt
replied:

Certainement,
tout dépend de l'état où il était au moment où il a commis son meurtre. S'il
est dans une confusion, dans un état de confusion mentale, de choc émotionnel,
une confusion de panique, c'est possible. J'ai moi-même vu, au cours
d'accident, sortir quelqu'un d'une machine, quelqu'un qui n'avait aucune
blessure, absolument rien, mais dont l'état d'émotion était tellement aggravé,
tellement évident, qu'on leur demandait leurs noms, leurs adresses et qu'ils ne
s'en rappelaient pas.

Dr. Moffatt here
illustrates his point of view by referring to a person who suffers a
shock much like that described by the psychiatrists called for the Crown.

The burden of. establishing, to the reasonable satisfaction
of the jury, that the accused was insane, as that term is applied and
understood in McNaghten's Case 11,
at the time he put the children to death rested upon the defence. The
appellant's written statement, his false version at the undertaking parlour,
his verbal and voluntary statements to the police, as well as his conduct when
he and the police were present at his house, were all, in effect, contrary to
the contention that he did not know the nature and quality of his act or what
he was doing upon the night in question. Moreover, when analyzed, the evidence
of the experts for the Crown, who examined the appellant as to both his
physical and mental condition, supports their conclusions with reasons that
could not but impress the jury.

While Dr. Moffatt, called on behalf of the defence, refers
to the life of and his interviews with the appellant, he does not indicate, in
a direct and specific manner, what it was in the conduct or conversation that
led him to conclude that the appellant, in committing the acts we are here
concerned with, did not appreciate the nature and quality of his acts

[Page 138]

and was unable to distinguish between right and wrong. In
this regard the language of Lord Chief Justice Reading is appropriate :

The tests in McNaghten's case must be observed, and it is
not enough for a medical expert to come to the Court and say generally that in
his opinion the criminal is insane. There must be some evidence of insanity
within the meaning of the rule in McNaghten's case. Holt v. The King 12.

Then as to the possible effect upon the jury of any of the
suggestions made by counsel for the Crown in the course of the
cross-examination here objected to, it should be observed that they were either
contained in or directly implied in statements already in evidence. It is not,
therefore, a case in which entirely new facts were so introduced, but, rather,
circumstances which, in relation to the whole of the evidence, would be but a
repetition of that which would already be present to the minds of the jury.

When all of the evidence is considered, this becomes a case
in which it may well be said, in the language of my Lord the Chief Justice
(then Kerwin J.) in Schmidt v. The King 13, ""that the verdict would
necessarily have been the same"" even had the cross-examination here
objected to not taken place. This case is quite distinguishable from Allen v.
The King 14, where counsel for the Crown
sought, through cross-examination, to place in evidence that given by a witness
at the preliminary who was not called at the trial. In the course of his
reasons for judgment Fitzpatrick C.J., as well as Mr. Justice Anglin (later
C.J.), referred to the fact that there was other sufficient evidence to support
the 'conviction. In the case at bar the evidence is such, apart from the
cross-examination objected to, as would leave no doubt in the minds of a
reasonable jury that the appellant was, at the time he committed the crime, not
insane as that word is applied and understood in law.

It is also distinguishable from Markadonis v. The
King 15, where a young man of eighteen
was charged with the murder of his sister. No motive was established and the
revolver used to commit the crime was not produced and apparently was never
found. Evidence was given at the trial to the effect that in the middle of the
second night after the murder the accused was taken from his cell and,

[Page 139]

along with three police officers, taken out to a road to
search for the revolver. The accused was cross-examined upon the incidents of
that trip and his answers were made the basis for rebuttal evidence. Mr.
Justice Davis, at p. 664, stated:

The whole course of conduct and conversation of the accused
on that trip was clearly inadmissible in the absence of any proof that the
statements made were voluntary and upon proper warning.

In the circumstances of that case, as reported, such
evidence added to the facts already in evidence and could not but be
prejudicial to the defence.

The facts and circumstances of this case are so very
conclusive that the language in Stirland v. The Director of Public
Prosecutions 16 is appropriate. When referring
to a proviso in the English statute similar to that of s. 1014(2) of our Criminal
Code, it is stated:

… if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of
justice has actually occurred in convicting the accused assumes a situation
where a reasonable jury, after being properly directed, would, on the evidence
properly admissible, without doubt convict.

This passage is quoted with approvel in Schmidt v.
The King, supra.

In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

Locke J.
(dissenting) :—I agree with my brothers Cartwright and Fauteux and would quash
the conviction in this matter and direct that there be a new trial.

Cartwright J.
(dissenting) :—In this case I find it necessary to deal with only one of the
questions which were argued before us, i.e., whether Crown counsel improperly
cross-examined the appellant as to certain statements allegedly made by him to
Captain Matte.

It is not necessary to go into the facts at any length. The
appellant was convicted of the murder of one of his children. At the trial it
was not seriously questioned that he had killed this child and his three other
young children. The. main issue was as to whether or not he was insane at the
time of such acts.

Doctor Moffatt, called as a witness for the defence,
testified that in his opinion the appellant at the time of the killing was by
reason of mental illness unable to appreciate

[Page 140]

the nature and quality of his acts or to know that they were
wrong. Doctor Martin and Doctor Larue called as witnesses by the Crown
testified that they were of the contrary opinion.

It is clear that Doctor Moffatt founded his opinion in part
on the assumption that the accused had in fact no memory as to what occurred at
the time of the killing, and, as Mr. Miquelon very properly stated, the
question whether or not the accused did have such memory was of vital
importance on the issue of insanity.

In giving his evidence in chief the appellant deposed that
he had no memory as to what happened during the critical period. In
cross-examination he was asked a number of questions by Crown counsel who then
held in his hands what purported to be a transcript of a number of questions
put to the accused by Captain Matte and of the answers given by the accused to
such questions. This interrogation was said to have taken place at about eleven
p.m. on the Thursday following the killing, some hours after the appellant had
told the police officers that he had killed his children and had been taken
into custody on a charge of murder. The answers which the accused was said to
have given during this interrogation indicated that he was able at that time to
recall the details of the killing of his children and so tended to discredit
his evidence given at the trial as to his having no memory of that occurrence.

Counsel for the appellant objected to the use of the
transcript and to any cross-examination in regard to it but the learned trial
judge overruled the objection. I think it clear that the learned trial judge
should not have permitted any use to be made of the transcript in question
without first hearing evidence in the absence of the jury with a view to
determining whether or not the appellant's answers had been given voluntarily.
The learned judge appears to have been of opinion that although not admissible
as part of the Crown's case the questions said to have been put to the accused
and the answers said to have been made by him could be put to him in
cross-examination. In this, in my respectful opinion, he was in error.

[Page 141]

In Rex v. Wilmot 17, Ford J.A. with whom
MacGillivray J.A. agreed said :—

It is conceded that the statements, if made at all, were
made to a . person in authority and that the Crown could not prove their
voluntary character so as to make them admissible. This being so, in my opinion
C not only should the Crown be not permitted to prove them in rebuttal any more
than in chief, but that it is improper to permit cross-examination as to them.
Indeed they should, in my opinion, be treated for all purposes as non-existent
or as having no probative value of any kind, either as going to the credit of
the accused as a witness or otherwise.

This view of the law was adopted by the Court of Appeal for
British Columbia in Rex v. Byers 18 and by the Court of Appeal for
Saskatchewan in Rex v. Scory 19.
A similar view was expressed by Langlais J. in Rex v. Heroux 20.

In Rex v. Scory (supra) Mackenzie J.A., who
gave the unanimous judgment of the Court, after referring to Rex v. Wilmot,
Rex v. Byers and Rex v. Heroux continued, at page
323:—

In a still more recent case involving the same question, R.
v. Treacy (1944) 60 T.L.R. 544, the Court of Criminal Appeal in
England rendered the same view. Thus in delivering the judgment of the Court,
Humphreys J., said (p. 545) : ""In our view, a statement made by a prisoner
under arrest is either admissible or not. If it is admissible, the proper
course for the prosecution is to prove it, and give it in evidence, and to let
the statement, if it is in writing, be made an exhibit, so that everybody knows
what it is and everybody can inquire into it and do what they think right about
it. If it is not admissible, nothing more ought to be heard of it, and it is
wrong to think that a document can be made admissible in evidence which is
otherwise inadmissible simply because it is put to a person on
cross-examination.""

Having regard to the protection which our criminal law in
accordance with its well-known policy in javorem vitae casts about every
accused person to protect him on his trial against the introduction of his own
involuntary statements, the above decisions on counsel's last contention
should, in my opinion, be followed not only because of their obvious authority
but also because they are logically sound.

I have carefully considered the reasons of Campbell C.J. who
expressed a contrary opinion in Rex v. Jones 21 and in Rex v. Essery
22 and the reasons of Harvey C.J.
who dissented in Rex v. Wilmot (supra) but, with
the greatest respect for these views, I am of opinion that the passage quoted
above from the judgment of Mackenzie J.A. correctly states the law.

[Page 142]

It is argued for the respondent that even if this
cross-examination was illegal no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
has occurred and the appeal should be dismissed. With the greatest respect for
all those who hold the contrary view, I find it impossible to affirm that had
this illegal cross-examination not taken place the jury would necessarily have
convicted the appellant.

It was open to the jury to believe the appellant's evidence
as to his having no memory of the period in which the killings occurred and, if
they did believe it, it was for them to say whether they accepted Doctor
Moffatt's opinion in preference to that of the two medical witnesses called by
the Crown. All three of these doctors were men of high standing in their
profession and it is scarcely necessary to observe that a jury may act upon the
evidence of one witness although it is in conflict with the evidence of two or
more other witnesses. But the opinion of Doctor Moffatt depended in large
measure upon the assumption that the appellant had in fact no memory of the
period in which the children were killed. The reason that the jury did not act
upon Doctor Moffatt's opinion may well have been that they did not find that
the appellant was without memory of the critical period and their failure to so
find may well have been the result of the illegal cross-examination.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a
new trial.

Fauteux J.
(dissenting) :—Suivant des admissions extrajudiciaires,
jugées libres et volontaires, l'appelant a reconnu, sans toutefois en donner
aucune circonstance, avoir, dans le cours du mois d'avril 1953, tué ses quatre jeunes enfants pour lesquels, cependant, il
n'entretenait, suivant la preuve, que des sentiments d'affection. Accusé du
meurtre de l'un d'eux, il plaida qu'au moment de ces actes, il était incapable
d'en juger la nature et la gravité et de se rendre compte qu'ils étaient mal.
Le bien-fondé de ce plaidoyer fut affirmé par un expert de la défense et nié
par deux experts de la poursuite. Trouvé coupable, il logea un appel devant la
Cour du Banc de la Reine 23, lequel fut
rejeté par jugement unanime. Hébert obtint alors, en vertu de l'article

[Page 143]

1025 du Code Criminel, l'autorisation
d'en appeler devant cette Cour sur des questions de droit formulées comme suit:—

(a) Did the learned trial Judge err in his instructions relative to the possible
verdict the jury might render and in particular in omitting to mention the
possibility of their disagreeing?

(b) Did the learned trial Judge err in his
instructions relative to the plea of insanity and in his statement of the
evidence in support thereof?

Au soutien du premier moyen
(a), on a invoqué, de la décision de cette Cour dans Latour v.
The King 24, un passage
apparaissant à la page 30 où l'on exprime l'opinion que,
des instructions du Juge au procès, les jurés pouvaient raisonnablement déduire
que le droit à un désaccord était
exclu dans la cause. Dans Frank Frederick Creasey 25, Lord Goddard,
Juge en chef de la Cour d'Appel d'Angleterre, signale bien que de similaires
directives ont déjà, dans le passé, reçu la désapprobation des tribunaux
d'appel, telle, par exemple, la suivante: ""It is essential that you
should give a verdict"". C'est, cependant, en regard de toute l'adresse du Juge que la question doit être appréciée. Ainsi
considérée, je ne crois pas qu'on puisse, en l'espèce, dire que le droit à un
désaccord ait été exclu.

Au second moyen (b), il y a deux
griefs. J'écarterais le premier, ayant trait aux directives sur le plaidoyer de
folie, et ce, pour les raisons données par l'honorable Juge en chef. Je
retiens, cependant, le second, savoir:—

Did the learned trial Judge err … in
his statement of the evidence in support thereof? (i.e., au
soutien du plaidoyer de folie).

grief dans la considération duquel il
convient d'inclure un point soulevé lors du délibéré et subséquemment discuté
au cours d'une réaudition, après que, au cas où nécessaire, permission
d'appeler ait été donnée, savoir:—

Whether Crown counsel improperly cross-examined the appellant as to the statements
allegedly made by him to Captain Matte or other police officers and whether or
not the trial Judge's charge was proper in relation thereto.

La véritable—pour ne pas
dire l'unique—question qui se posait devant le jury était
de savoir si, au moment où l'accusé tuait ses quatre jeunes enfants, il était
dans un état mental le rendant incapable de juger la nature et la gravité de
ses actes et de se rendre compte qu'ils étaient mal. Il était donc de capital
importance que l'exposé de la preuve

[Page 144]

sur ce point
soit fait adéquatement; c'était toute la cause. Cette preuve soumise aux jurés
et qu'il nous faut maintenant considérer pour juger du mérite de ce grief,
portait sur deux points:—(i) la théorie médicale soumise par le
docteur Moffatt, l'expert de la défense, et (ii) les faits, gestes et declarations de l'accusé, surtout celles dont la véracité—assumée par le docteur Moffatt pour fins de son opinion—fut mise en
question par la Couronne et ses experts.

La théorie médicale de la défense. Le docteur
Moffatt a conclu qu'au moment de l'acte, rappelant était incapable de
distinguer le bien du mal parce qu'il était alors affecté d'un trouble mental
qu'il désigne techniquement comme ""une réaction dépressive accompagnée par
un état de confusion ou de panique"". Cette conclusion, il la motive comme
suit:—A raison d'événements particuliers qui se sont
produits au cours de l'enfance, aussi bien qu'au cours de l'adolescence et,
ensuite, de la vie conjugale de l'appelant, ce dernier souffrait de mélancolie,
mais non dans le sens précis qu'on donne en psychiatrie à la maladie mentale
classifiée sous ce nom; il avait ainsi développé une instabilité émotionnelle
affectant sa résistance et l'empêchant d'avoir, sur ses facultés
intellectuelles, un contrôle normal, offrant en conséquence, et à l'occasion
d'une crise émotionnelle, un terrain propice à la naissance et l'action d'un
trouble mental. De plus, l'accusé ayant affirmé, au cours d'examens par le
docteur Moffatt, et juré, dans son témoignage à l'audition, qu'il n'avait
aucune mémoire des circonstances dans lesquelles les actes reprochés avaient
été commis, l'expert de la défense déduisit du fait de cette carence de mémoire
qu'au moment où l'accusé tuait ses quatre jeunes enfants, il était dans un état
de confusion mentale et de panique. Le docteur Moffatt a bien précisé qu'il ne
prétendait pas que l'accusé souffrait de cette maladie mentale classifiée en
psychiatrie comme mélancolie et que l'état de confusion dont il parlait était
un trouble mental reconnu par les auteurs anglais, américains et allemands et,
comme tel, différent de la confusion mentale, résultant d'une cause organique,
dont parlent les auteurs français. En somme, mise en contraste avec l'opinion
des experts de la Couronne, celle du docteur Moffatt s'inspire d'une théorie
médicale différente dans sa conception et son

[Page 145]

expression de
celle exposée par les experts de la Couronne et se fonde, en l'espèce,
principalement sur l'hypothèse de la véracité des affirmations de l'accusé
quant à cette carence de mémoire. Nous n'avons pas à départager les médecins et
à décider d'une préférence pour l'une ou l'autre des théories par eux exposées;
ceci était du ressort exclusif des jurés et la difficulté qu'ils pouvaient
avoir à ce faire rendait encore plus imperative
l'obligation d'une adéquate
exposition de ces théories et, particulièrement, de celle de la défense. A la
vérité, et au cours de l'audition de la preuve médicale, l'un des jurés
manifesta ouvertement son inquiétude à rencontrer l'obligation que lui et ses
collègues avaient de départager les experts. Pour dissiper cet état d'esprit,
on les rassura en les informant que des directives appropriées leur seraient
données au cours de l'adresse du Juge. En tout respect, cependant, je dois dire
qu'en ce qui concerne la théorie médicale de la défense, on s'est contenté,
dans l'adresse, d'indiquer uniquement la conclusion précitée du docteur Moffatt
sans signaler ce qui divisait les experts dans la conception et l'expression de
leurs théories médicales respectives et sans aucunement rappeler les motifs sur
lesquels s'appuyait la théorie exposée en défense. L'opinion d'un expert n'a
que la valeur des motifs sur lesquels elle se fonde. Je suis d'avis que la
théorie médicale de la défense au soutien du plaidoyer de folie n'a pas été
exposée comme elle aurait dû l'être et que, pour cette première raison, ce
grief de l'appelant est bien fondé.

Outre la théorie médicale de l'expert de la
défense, la preuve apportée au soutien du plaidoyer de folie et qui devait être
exposée aux jurés comportait, entre autres faits, les déclarations de l'accusé
et, particulièrement, son affirmation sous serment relative à son absence de
mémoire, affirmation dont la véracité, comme déjà indiqué, fut assumée par le docteur
Moffatt pour les fins de son expertise, mais mise en question par la Couronne
et ses experts. D'où l'on voit que dans l'exposé de cet aspect particulier de
la preuve, il était de singulière importance, pour permettre aux jurés de se
prononcer justement sur le point, de ne pas les inviter virtuellement, comme il
a été fait, à décider de la véracité de cette affirmation, en la considérant
avec les déclarations ci-après qui la contredisent, lesquelles furent—ainsi qu'il appert ci-après—illégalement admises
au

[Page 146]

dossier, à l'initiative de la Couronne, et ce,
tel que déclaré par les deux procureurs la représentant à la réaudition, dans
le but d'attaquer la crédibilité de l'accusé et, plus précisément, de détruire,
en démontrant le contraire de l'affirmation ci-dessus, le véritable fondement
de l'opinion émise par le docteur Moffatt.

Le dossier révèle que le capitaine Matte,
officier de la Sûreté en charge de la cause, a plusieurs fois au
cours de la détention de l'appelant, questionné ce dernier afin d'en obtenir
une relation des circonstances dans lesquelles il avait tué ses enfants,
circonstances que ne comportaient aucunement ses aveux extrajudiciaires jugés
libres et volontaires et admis au dossier. Il appert, de plus, que les
questions et réponses, faites au cours de ces examens conduits par cet officier
de police, avaient été sténographiées et qu'au procès, un document les
rapportant était entre les mains du procureur de la Couronne et utilisé par lui
pour le contre-interrogatoire de l'accusé. Dès la première tentative de la
Couronne d'introduire une telle preuve au dossier, le procureur de la défense
s'objecta comme suit:—

Objecté:—

D'abord, je
voudrais savoir si réellement cet aveu-là a eu lieu et dans quelles conditions
cet aveu-là a eu lieu et quel était également l'état mental de cet homme-là à
ce moment-là.

Ce à quoi
la Couronne répondit:—

On est aussi bien de vider le problème, j'ai
bien l'intention d'entrer dans les déclarations qu'il a faites pour le
contredire.

L'objection de la défense fut renvoyée et
c'est alors qu'entre autres questions et, en substance, on a demandé à l'accusé
s'il n'était pas vrai:—qu'il avait déclaré au capitaine Matte
avoir consommé quatre ou cinq bouteilles de bière avant de tuer
ses enfants (p. 259) ; qu'il lui avait raconté en détails
ce qui s'était passé chez lui (p. 284) ; qu'il lui avait
raconté qu'il s'était assis sur une chaise, s'était bercé un peu, avait pensé à
tout et que c'est alors qu'il s'était décidé à faire les actes reprochés (p. 290)
; qu'il avait commencé par la chambre d'en avant, qu'il avait
commencé par tuer René, (p. 291). A la vérité, non
seulement on lui a posé ces questions, mais, en les formulant, on a indiqué les
réponses incriminantes que l'accusé était supposé avoir données au détective Matte.
Enfin, par ce procédé, on a réussi à faire entrer au dossier des
déclarations dont la substance allait à

[Page 147]

contredire le témoignage de l'appelant
et, particulièrement, sa déclaration dont la véracité avait été assumée par le
docteur Moffatt pour les fins de son expertise.

Dans quelles conditions furent conduits ces
interrogatoires et furent données ces réponses que le capitaine Matte, d'une part, trouva nécessaire de faire consigner par un sténographe et
que la Couronne, d'autre part, jugea essentiel au succès de sa cause de porter
à la connaissance des jurés, le dossier est silencieux. Aucun voir dire, aucun
examen de tous les témoins qui, suivant les exigences de la jurisprudence de
cette Cour (Sankey v. The King 26; Tiffault v.
The King 27), devaient être
entendus pour permettre au Juge de décider si, oui ou non, ces déclarations
pouvaient, à la lumière des principes reconnus en la matière, être admises
devant les jurés. Dans Gach v. The King 28, cette Cour, à la page 255, approuvait la
proposition suivante formulée par le Juge Sankey, tel qu'il était alors, dans Rex
v. Crowe and Myerscough 29:

If a police officer has
determined to effect an arrest or if the person is in custody, then he should
ask no questions which will in any way tend to prove the guilt of such person
from his own mouth.

Aussi bien, la
Couronne, au procès comme devant cette Cour, n'a-t-elle cherché à justifier
l'introduction de cette preuve au dossier que par les dispositions des articles
10 et 11 de la Loi de la preuve, lesquelles
autorisent d'attaquer la crédibilité d'un témoin en le contre-interrogeant sur
ses déclarations antérieures incompatibles avec son témoignage. Le point de
savoir si dans le contre-interrogatoire d'un accusé entendu comme témoin, il
est loisible à la Couronne de référer à des déclarations faites par lui à la
police alors que le caractère libre et volontaire de ces déclarations n'a pas
été décidé, a été considéré dans plusieurs causes. Dans ses notes, mon collègue
le Juge Cartwright réfère à ces décisions et, comme lui, je suis d'opinion que
la Couronne ne peut davantage, sur cette base, justifier, en l'espèce, la
position prise par elle au procès et devant cette Cour. L'introduction de cette
preuve était donc totalement illégale et d'une illégalité qui, je crois, aurait
justifié, sinon commandé, la mise à fin du procès comme mistrial. Aussi bien, et le procès s'étant continué, était-il
impératif que

[Page 148]

dans l'exposé de cet aspect de la preuve faite
au soutien du plaidoyer de folie, les jurés, au lieu d'être invités, comme ils
l'ont été, à considérer toutes les déclarations de l'accusé, sans distinguer
celles qui avaient été prouvées légalement de celles illégalement introduites
au dossier, reçoivent la direction la plus claire et la plus solennelle
d'écarter totalement de leur considération les dernières pour juger de la
véracité de l'affirmation relative à la perte de mémoire. Ce n'était pas
satisfaire à l'obligation qu'il y avait de faire un exposé légal de la preuve,
faite en défense au soutien du plaidoyer de folie, que d'inviter les jurés,
pour en juger, à faire entrer dans leur considération des preuves illégalement
admises. Pour cette seconde raison, je crois donc que le grief de l'appelant
est fondé.

Sur la loi relative à l'obligation d'exposer
adéquatement la théorie de la défense, il suffit, je crois, de référer à
quelques passages des deux dernières décisions de cette Cour sur le point. Dans
Kelsey v. The Queen 30, on a rappelé comme suit, à la page 227,
le principe d'où découle cette obligation:—

The rule is simple and implements the
fundamental principle that an accused is entitled to a fair trial, to make a
full answer and defence to the charge, and to these ends, the jury must be
adequately instructed as to what his defence is by the trial Judge.

De la décision d'Azoulay v.
The Queen 31, la considération des passages suivants est
pertinente:—

The pivotal questions upon which the defence stands must be
clearly presented to the jury's mind. (p. 498).

Three experts, two of
which were called by the appellant, gave very elaborate explanations on medical
matters, and their respective opinions on the result
of the autopsy that was performed on the body of the deceased woman. It was, I
think, the duty of the trial judge, in summing up this highly technical and
conflicting evidence, to strip it of the nonessentials, and as O'Halloran, J.A.
said in Rex v. Hughes 78 Can. C.C. 1, to present to the jury the
evidence in its proper relation to the matters requiring factual decision, and
direct it also to the case put forward by the prosecution and the answer of the
defence, or such answer as the evidence permitted. Unfortunately, this has not
been done, and the explanations and grounds of defence have not adequately been
put before the jury. (p. 499).

The authorities contemplate that in the course of his charge
a trial judge should as a general rule, explain the relevant law and so relate
it to the evidence that the jury may appreciate the issues or questions they
must pass upon in order to render a verdict of guilty or not guilty. Where, as
here, the evidence is technical and somewhat involved, it is particularly

[Page 149]

important that he should do so in a manner that will assist
the jury in determining its relevancy and what weight or value they will
attribute to the respective portions, (p. 503).

Reste à considérer la suggestion de la
Couronne d'appliquer, en l'espèce, les dispositions de l'article 1014
(2) édictant que même si les griefs soulevés par l'accusé sont
bien fondés, la Cour peut renvoyer l'appel s'il n'y a pas eu de tort réel ni de
déni de justice. A raison de la gravité des violations ci-dessus relatées, il me
paraît impossible d'accéder à cette demande. Rendant le jugement pour le Comité
Judiciaire du Conseil Privé dans Makin 32, Lord Herschell,
à la page 70, dit:—

The evidence improperly admitted might have chiefly
influenced the jury to return a verdict of guilty, and the rest of the evidence
which might appear to the court sufficient to support the conviction might have
been reasonably disbelieved by the jury. Their Lordships do not think it can
properly be said that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice, where on a point material to the guilt or innocence of the accused the
jury have, notwithstanding objection, been invited by the judge to consider in
arriving at their verdict matters which ought not to have been submitted to
them. In Their Lordships' opinion substantial wrong would be done to the
accused if he were deprived of the verdict of a jury on the facts proved by
legal evidence, and there were substituted for it the verdict of the court
founded merely upon a perusal of the evidence.

Dans Maxwell v. Director
of Public Prosecutions 33, Lord Sankey, L.C., parlant pour lui-même, Lord Blanesburgh, Lord Atkin, Lord Thankerton et Lord Wright, dit à la
page 176:—

But it must be remembered that the whole policy of English
criminal law has been to see that as against the prisoner every rule in his
favour is observed and that no rule is broken so as to prejudice the chance of
the jury fairly trying the true issues. The sanction for the observance of the
rules of evidence in criminal cases is that, if they are broken in any case,
the conviction may be quashed. Hence the great care which has always been shown
by the Court in applying the proviso to section 4 of the Criminal Appeal Act,
1907, and refusing to quash a conviction. It is often better that one guilty
man should escape than that the general rules evolved by the dictates of
justice for the conduct of criminal prosecutions should be disregarded and
discredited.

Ces
principes exprimés par la Chambre des Lords se passent de commentaires et leur
application, au Canada, est d'autant plus justifiée que la loi canadienne,
contrairement à la loi anglaise, autorise la tenue d'un nouveau procès au lieu
d'un acquittement.

[Page 150]

Ajoutons que,
pour bénéficier des dispositions de l'article 1014 (2), la Couronne
doit établir que, sans cette preuve illégale au dossier, le verdict eut été le
même. Et c'est là la position qu'elle prend. Devant les jurés, cependant, elle
considéra l'affaire bien autrement, puisqu'alors, elle jugea essentiel à
l'avancement de sa cause de porter à leur connaissance cette preuve illégale.
Et même devant nous, en cherchant à se justifier de l'avoir introduite, ses
deux procureurs ont plaidé avec vigueur les propositions suivantes que l'un
d'eux avait couchées par écrit, avant d'en donner communication verbale à cette
Oour, à la fin de l'argument de la Couronne:—

1. The issue was whether the accused
was telling the truth when he testified that he did not remember the
circumstances.

2. The object of this evidence was to show that he could not
be believed.

3. This evidence was most relevant to the issue, in view of
what Doctor Moffatt had said.

La Couronne a bien raison d'affirmer que la
crédibilité de l'accusé constituait le principal problème soumis aux jurés.
Mais, précisément pour cette raison, la Couronne ne peut maintenant demander de
considérer comme négligeable cette preuve illégale qu'elle a jugé essentiel
d'introduire sur cette question cruciale que les jurés avaient à déterminer.
Les deux positions sont manifestement irréconciliables. Aussi bien m'est-il
impossible de conclure que l'intimée a établi, comme elle en avait le fardeau,
que, sans la présence de cette preuve, le verdict eut été le même.

Je maintiendrais l'appel, annulerais le
verdict et ordonnerais un nouveau procès.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA,
APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Evidence—Reasonable
doubt—Criminal negligence causing death—Motor vehicle—Acquittal at trial
because of doubt as to identity of driver—Question of fact or question of
law—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 221(1), 584(1).

After consuming a large quantity of beer and
liquor, the appellant got in his car with three friends. He says that he was
then drunk, and that from that time he remembers nothing until he awoke in
hospital the next morning. The evidence establishes that the car proceeded on a
wild ride at a speed of 70 to 80 miles an hour and finally struck a metal power
pole. The right side of the car was almost demolished. The car swung around, clockwise,
through an arc of about 180 degrees. All the occupants were killed other than
the appellant who was found behind the steering wheel, which was badly bent.
His left leg was to the left of the steering column and pinned between the
dashboard and the floor so completely that he could only be released by the use
of an hydraulic jack. One of the occupants was found lying in the back seat and
the other two, in the right front portion of the car, one on top of the other.
The appellant was charged with criminal negligence causing death, under
s. 221(1) of the Criminal Code. After a trial without a jury, the
trial judge acquitted the appellant on the ground that he was not satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was driving the car. The Court of
Appeal set aside the acquittal. On appeal to this Court, the appellant
contended that the decision of the trial judge was on a question of fact, and
did not involve a question of law, so that the Court of Appeal was not acting
within its jurisdiction as defined in s. 584(1) of the Criminal Code.

[Page 102]

Held (Cartwright
C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.: The trial judge failed properly to apply the
rule in Hodge’s case, to the facts before him in that he acquitted the
appellant not because he found that there was a rational conclusion on the
facts inconsistent with his guilt, but because there was, in his opinion, a
conjectural conclusion which he considered might be inconsistent with his
guilt. This involved an error on a question of law alone. The trial judge, in
considering the facts to which he referred, failed to appreciate their proper
effect in law, in that he did not distinguish between a conjectural possibility,
arising from those facts, and a rational conclusion arising from the whole of
the evidence. No other conclusion could be reached on the evidence than that
the appellant was driving at the material time.

Per Ritchie
J.: The trial judge misapplied the rule in Hodge’s case as restated in
this Court in The Queen v. Mitchell,  [1964] S.C.R. 471, in that instead
of seeking to determine whether the circumstantial evidence disclosed “any
other rational conclusion” inconsistent with the appellant’s guilt, he based
his decision on “a matter of conjecture”. In so doing he erred in law and his
decision was accordingly properly reviewable under s. 584 of the Criminal
Code.

Per Pigeon J.:
This case was correctly decided in the Court of Appeal. This is in accordance
with the ratio of the judgment in Belyea et al. v. R., [1932]
S.C.R. 279.

Per Cartwright
C.J., dissenting: The only ground stated in the notice of appeal was
that the trial judge misdirected himself in law in ordering an acquittal as
there was no evidence on the basis of which a reasonable doubt could arise as
to the appellant’s guilt. An appeal based on a ground so stated is foredoomed
to failure unless the decision in Lampard v. R., [1969] S.C.R. 373, is
disregarded. It appears too clear for argument that the decision of the trial
judge proceeded on a ground of fact and certainly not a ground of law alone in
the strict sense. The question whether from certain proved primary facts the
inference should be drawn that the appellant was driving the automobile which
caused the fatality was a pure question of fact.

Per Hall J., dissenting:
This appeal by the Crown did not involve a question of law alone as
required

[Page 103]

by s. 584(1) (a) of the Code. The
inference to be drawn from the proven facts was a pure question of fact.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: If there is evidence upon which a trial judge may find that
there could be another rational conclusion then whether or not that evidence
would have been sufficient to cause a Court of Appeal to reach a like conclusion
is irrelevant. The task of determining the rationality of another conclusion if
evidence exists is for the trial Court judge, and any weighing of that evidence
in a Court of Appeal is engaging in consideration of something other than a
question of “law alone”. In the present case, there was a considerable body of
evidence which the trial judge could have and should have considered in
determining whether there might have been any other rational conclusion than
that the accused drove the vehicle. That evidence shows that it was possible,
time after time, for there to have been a change in the identity of the
operator of the vehicle. Once there is evidence it is the trial judge’s duty
and his duty alone to determine whether another conclusion is a rational one.
The judgment of the Appellate Division could only have been reached by a
weighing of the evidence in order to determine whether other conclusions were
rational, and such a course is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate
Division as provided in s. 584(1) (a) of the Code.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of Alberta, Appellate Division[1],
setting aside the appellant’s acquittal on a charge of criminal negligence
causing death. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ.
dissenting.

Donald H. Bowen, Q.C., and John M. Hope,
for the appellant.

J.W.K. Shortreed, Q.C., for the
respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—This
appeal is brought, pursuant to s. 597(2)(a) of the Criminal
Code, from a unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court of Alberta1 which allowed an appeal from the judgment of
acquittal of the present appellant on a charge of criminal negligence causing
death pronounced by Dechene J. after trial without a jury.

[Page 104]

The relevant facts are set out in the reasons of
my brothers Martland and Spence, which I have had the advantage of reading, and
do not require repetition.

At the conclusion of his oral judgment, the
learned trial Judge summarized the ground on which he acquitted the appellant
as follows:

What can happen to the occupants of a vehicle
which comes to such a sudden stop, is, I think, a matter for conjecture.
Mr. Stainton invites me to apply whatever little knowledge I have of the
laws of physics and the principle of inertia, to find that the accused could
not have been in the back seat immediately before. I must consider the fact
that there were two people in that back seat immediately before, the position
of the back of the seat on the driver’s side, particularly to the smashed condition
of the steering wheel and the fact that there is no evidence of injury to the
accused’s head, face or chest. The first doctor, Dr. McCurry after looking
at the three other men, only glanced at the accused for thirty seconds or so
and decided that he did not require medical treatment. Those facts do not
enable me to say that I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
was driving the car because there are certain things, while it is probable he
was driving, there are these factors which make it, although not likely, but
possible that someone else was at the wheel. The accused is, therefore,
entitled to the benefit of that doubt which I entertain.

Counsel instructed by the Attorney General
appealed to the Appellate Division pursuant to s. 584(1) of the Criminal
Code which reads as follows:

584. (1) The Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal

(a) against a judgment or verdict of
acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by indictment on any ground of appeal
that involves a question of law alone,

The only ground stated in the notice of appeal
was as follows:

The learned trial Judge misdirected himself
in law in ordering an acquittal as there was no evidence

[Page 105]

on the basis of which a reasonable doubt
could arise as to the respondent’s guilt.

It appears to me that unless we are to disregard
what has recently been said by this Court in Lampard v. The Queen[2], an appeal based on a ground so stated was
foredoomed to failure. I refer particularly to the following passage in the
reasons concurred in by a majority of the Court at pages 380 and 381:

It has often been pointed out that where a
trial judge makes findings of primary facts and draws an inference therefrom an
appellate tribunal is in as good a position as was the trial judge to decide
what inference should be drawn, but in drawing the inference the Court is
making a finding of fact. In the case of an appeal at large the Court of Appeal
has, of course, power to substitute its view, as to what inference should be
drawn, for that of the trial judge, but where, as in the case at bar, the
jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is limited to questions of law in the
strict sense it has no such power.

When the onus of establishing a certain
fact lies upon a party it may be a question of law whether there is any
evidence (as distinguished from sufficient evidence) to prove that fact. In the
case at bar the onus was, of course, upon the Crown to prove that the appellant
did the acts complained of with the guilty intention specified in the section.
If the learned trial Judge erred in finding that that onus had not been
satisfied, his error was one of fact, certainly not one of law in the strict
sense. The applicable principles are clearly set out in the reasons of my
brother Ritchie giving the judgment of the majority of this Court in the Sunbeam
case, supra, and it is not necessary to repeat them.

In a criminal case (except in the rare
cases in which a statutory provision places an onus upon the accused) it can
sometimes be said as a matter of law that there is no evidence on which the
Court can convict but never that there is no evidence on which it can acquit;
there is always the rebuttable presumption of innocence.

[Page 106]

I find nothing in the reasons of my brother
Judson in the Lampard case, which were concurred in by my brother
Spence, to throw any doubt on the accuracy of the passage just quoted. Lampard
was a case where all the evidence of guilty intent was circumstantial; it
pointed very clearly to the existence of the intent alleged by the Crown and
there was no evidence in the record to suggest any other intent. My brother
Judson dealt with the matter as follows at page 382:

The appellant here submits that if there
was error in the judgment at trial, which he does not admit, it is error in
fact.

The basis of the judgment of the learned
trial judge, who was sitting without a jury, was that the trading activities of
the appellant did not indicate to him beyond a reasonable doubt that they were
carried out ‘with intent to create a false or misleading appearance of active
public trading in a security’. On the other hand, a unanimous Court of Appeal
thought that the inference that there was such intent was irresistible.

I agree with this conclusion of the Court
of Appeal but we are still left with the question whether the error was one of
fact or law. I am compelled by the majority judgment of this Court delivered in
Sunbeam Corporation of Canada Ltd. v. The Queen to hold that the
error—and I am sure that it was error—was one of fact. The appeal therefore
succeeds.

In the case at bar the learned trial judge
instructed himself accurately as to the rule in Hodge’s case[3], which is after all only an example of the
application of the rule that an accused can be convicted of a criminal offence
only if the tribunal is satisfied of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and
then found that he was not so satisfied. I agree with my brother Spence that
there was in the case before us evidence to raise a doubt as to whether the
appellant was driving the car at the time of the fatality, notably the
condition of the steering wheel and the absence of injuries to the appellant’s
chest, but I regard that as irrelevant. With the greatest respect to those who
entertain a contrary view it appears to me to be too clear for argument that
the

[Page 107]

decision of the learned trial judge proceeded on
a ground of fact and certainly not a ground of law alone in the strict sense.

When an appeal from a conviction of an
indictable offence is taken to a provincial Court of Appeal that Court has
power, under s. 592 (1) (a) (i), to allow the appeal if it is of
opinion that “the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is
unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence”; but that Court has no
corresponding power in an appeal from an acquittal. In such an appeal it is
limited to questions of law in the strict sense.

The question whether from certain proved primary
facts the inference should be drawn that the appellant was driving the
automobile which caused the fatality was, in my view, a pure question of fact.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Appellate Division and restore that of the learned trial judge
acquitting the appellant.

The judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and
Judson JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—This is an appeal from the unanimous
judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[4] which allowed an appeal by the Crown from
the decision of the learned trial judge to acquit the appellant on a charge of
criminal negligence, causing death.

The facts are not in dispute. On May 28, 1968,
the appellant, with three friends, proceeded in his car to the Corona Hotel, in
Edmonton, at about 7:45 p.m., and each consumed 16 glasses of beer. They
proceeded from there to a bar, known as the Beachcomber, where the appellant
consumed more beer, and the others drank liquor. They left the bar at about
11:30 p.m. The appellant says that he was then drunk.

They proceeded to the appellant’s car and got
in. The appellant says that from that time

[Page 108]

he remembers nothing until he awoke in hospital
at about 5 a.m. on May 29.

The evidence establishes that the car proceeded
on a wild ride around some portions of the City. During the course of this, the
driver of the appellant’s car became annoyed at the driver of another car,
threatened him, and later swerved into that car. Subsequent to this encounter,
the appellant’s car proceeded east on 112 Avenue, at a speed, estimated by one
witness, of 70 to 80 miles an hour. The car then, at least partially, mounted
the curb, proceeded a distance of 42 feet 4 inches with its right wheels over
the curb and its left-hand wheels on the highway, when the right front end
violently struck a solid metal power pole, bending it substantially. It left a
“side skid mark” on the highway, not a braking skid mark, of 44 feet. The right
side of the car was almost demolished. In the collision, the car swung around,
clockwise, through an arc of about 180 degrees.

All of the occupants of the car were killed, as
a result of the collision, other than the appellant. He was found behind the
steering wheel, which was badly bent. His face was covered with blood. His left
leg, which was to the left of the steering column, was pinned between the
dashboard and the floor to such a degree that he could not be freed until a
fireman had used an hydraulic jack unit to raise up the dashboard.

One of the other occupants of the car was found
lying in the back seat. The other two were found in the right front portion of
the car, hanging from the vehicle on to the pavement, one on top of the other.

The learned trial judge said that he had no
difficulty in finding that the driver of the appellant’s vehicle was guilty of
criminal negligence. He acquitted the appellant because he said he was not
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was driving the car at
the time of the collision because, while it was probable that he was the
driver, certain factors made it “although not likely, but possible that someone
else was at the wheel.”

[Page 109]

It is desirable to cite that part of his
judgment which deals with this issue:

The difficulty I have is regarding the
identity of the driver, his identification. It is well established and we know
that it was his car that was involved; we know that he was driving it earlier
that evening, and we know that he was found behind the steering wheel on the
driver’s side with his left leg pinned under the dashboard. Usually that would
be sufficient. However, we have here a situation where a number of people have
seen this car immediately or in a few minutes before the accident and not one
of them can identify the driver. The driver himself does not remember what
happened from the time he got into the car after leaving the Beachcomber
Restaurant on the last fatal trip of that motor vehicle. It is probable that
the accused was the driver.

The circumstances and the findings which I
have just made, are circumstantial and I can only find that he was the driver if
those circumstances are not only consistent with his guilt but inconsistent
with any other reasonable explanation. Is there another reasonable explanation?
The evidence is not very complete.

With relation to the altercation between
Greenough and the accused on 107th Avenue when the driver of the motor vehicle
got out while the vehicle was stopped for a red light, spoke to Greenough and
then returned to his car, it is my view that at that point there was an
opportunity to change drivers. There had been one, of course, earlier on when
they left the Beachcomber Restaurant.

The impact which followed the crash, the
collision with the power pole, was such that as we look at the photographs, the
car was demolished. We also know that the car turned on itself in a clockwise
fashion so that it was facing southwest, practically in the same direction from
which it had come.

What can happen to the occupants of a
vehicle which comes to such a sudden stop, is, I think, a matter for
conjecture.

Mr. Stainton invites me to apply
whatever little knowledge I have of the laws of physics and the principle of
inertia, to find that the accused could not have been in the back seat
immediately before. I must consider the fact that there were two people in that
back seat immediately before, the position of the back of the seat on the
driver’s side, particularly to the smashed condition of the steering wheel and
the fact that there is no evidence of injury to

[Page 110]

the accused’s head, face or chest. The
first doctor, Dr. McCurry after looking at the three other men, only
glanced at the accused for thirty seconds or so and decided that he did not
require medical treatment. Those facts do not enable me to say that I am
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was driving the car
because there are certain things, while it is probable he was driving, there
are these factors which make it, although not likely, but possible that someone
else was at the wheel.

Dealing with this conclusion, and after
reviewing the evidence on which the learned trial judge had relied in forming
an opinion that it was possible that the appellant had not been driving, at the
time of the accident, the judgment of the Appellate Division reads as follows:

…In my view the evidence referred to
amounts to no more than conjecture or surmise that this was the course of
events. It seems clear to me that the trial judge’s doubt as to whether the
Respondent was the driver has “no evidence to support it” and “lacks factual
support” just as much as the contention in Regina v. Torrie, 50 C.R.
300, that the tire of Torrie’s car may have been cut by a sharp object thrown
against it by some other traffic was found to be without any evidence to
support it. See also The Queen v. Lemire (1965) S.C.R. 174, Martland J.,
concurred in by Fauteux, Abbott, and Ritchie JJ. at pp. 191, 192.

I agree with and consider that the
following statement of Evans J.A. for the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Regina
v. Torrie (supra) at page 303 is applicable to the case at bar. That
statement is as follows:

“With the greatest respect, I am of the
opinion that the learned trial judge misapplied the rule in Hodge’s Case
(1838), 2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136, as to circumstantial evidence in that he
based his finding of reasonable doubt on nonexistent evidence. In Regina v.
Mclver, (1965) 1 O.R. 306 at 309, (1965) 1 C.C.C. 210, McRuer C.J.H.C.
said:

‘The rule (in Hodge’s Case) makes it clear
that the case is to be decided on the facts, that is,

[Page 111]

the facts proved in evidence and the
conclusions alternative to the guilt of the accused must be rational
conclusions based on inferences drawn from proven facts. No conclusion can be a
rational conclusion that is not founded on evidence. Such a conclusion would be
a speculative, imaginative conclusion, not a rational one.’

This statement was approved on appeal to
this Court, (1965) 2 O.R. 475, 45 C.R. 401 (1965) 4 C.C.C. 182 and an
appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed (1966) S.C.R.
254, 48 C.R. 4, (1966) 2 C.C.C. 289.

I recognize that the onus of proof must
rest with the Crown to establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable
doubt, but I do not understand this proposition to mean that the Crown must
negative every possible conjecture, no matter how irrational or fanciful, which
might be consistent with the innocence of the accused.”

In my view the contention that the
Respondent may not have been driving at the time of the accident is, to borrow
the words of Evans J.A. in Regina v. Torrie (supra) “conjecture” and is
“fanciful”. In my opinion no other conclusion could be reached on the evidence
than that the Respondent was driving at the material time.

The issue before this Court is as to whether the
Appellate Division, in reaching this conclusion, was acting within its jurisdiction
as defined in s. 584(1) of the Criminal Code, which permits an
appeal by the Attorney General against a judgment of acquittal “on any ground
of appeal that involves a question of law alone.” The contention of the
appellant is that the decision of the learned trial judge was on a question of
fact, and does not involve a question of law.

In the Lemire case[5], to which reference was made in the reasons
of the Appellate Division, quoted above, it was stated, in this Court, that on
an appeal from a conviction, if an appellate court allows the appeal on the
ground that certain specified evidence creates a reasonable doubt as to the
guilt of the accused, when, on a proper view of the law, that evidence is not
capable of creating any doubt as to his guilt, there is an error

[Page 112]

of law. In my opinion, that proposition applies
equally in a case in which a trial judge, in his reasons, finds that certain
specified evidence creates a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused,
when, on a proper view of the law, that evidence is not capable of creating any
doubt as to his guilt.

In my opinion the ground of appeal to the
Appellate Division did involve a question of law alone. That question is as
follows:

Did the learned trial judge err in law in his application
of the rule in Hodge’s Case, (1838) 2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136, to the
facts of this case?

The learned trial judge summarized the effect of
the rule. Stated in full the rule in Hodge’s case[6] is as follows:

Alderson B., told the jury, that the case
was made up of circumstances entirely; and that, before they could find the
prisoner guilty, they must be satisfied, “not only that those circumstances
were consistent with his having committed the act, but they must also be
satisfied that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person.”

Unlike a jury trial, we have the advantage here
of knowing, from the judge’s own words, whether he properly applied the rule in
the circumstances of the present case. He clearly found that the circumstances
were such as to be consistent with the appellant’s having been the driver of
the car. He said that it was probable that the appellant was the driver. The
other issue which he was required to determine was whether the facts were
consistent with any rational conclusion other than that the appellant was the
driver.

The vital circumstance in this case, which is
barely mentioned by the learned trial judge, is that the person who was found
behind the wheel of the car after the accident was pinned in that position so
completely that he could only be released by the use of an hydraulic jack. The
pinning in that position must have occurred immediately

[Page 113]

upon the violent impact which occurred when the
car struck the power pole. The theory propounded on behalf of the appellant
involved the proposition that, following that violent impact, with the car
turning in a clockwise direction (which would result in the passengers’ being
subject to a force carrying them toward their right, as illustrated by the
position of two of the bodies after the accident), the appellant was hurled out
of the back seat into the driver’s position on the left-hand side of the front
seat, that he landed there in a sitting position, with his left leg to the left
of the steering column, and that then, and only then, he was pinned into
position.

In his reasons, the learned trial judge says
that:

What can happen to the occupants of a
vehicle which comes to such a sudden stop, is, I think, a matter for
conjecture.

On the facts of this case, however, the issue to
be determined was whether, in the light of the appellant’s having been pinned
behind the wheel, there was any rational conclusion, on the evidence, other
than that the appellant was the driver of the car at the time of the accident.
He did not find that there was such a rational conclusion. What he did was to
conjecture that the appellant might have been riding as a passenger in the back
seat and, if so, might have been thrown into the front seat on impact.

The learned trial judge referred to the fact
that, after the accident, it appeared that the back of the front seat was bent
backwards, that the steering wheel was substantially bent, and that there was
no evidence of injury to the appellant’s chest or face. These facts are
reviewed in the judgment of the Appellate Division, as follows:

It should be pointed out, however, that the
Respondent’s face had blood upon it to the extent that any visible injury would
not be seen, that the Respondent was unconscious behind the wheel with his head
bent forward on to his chest and hanging either on or near the steering wheel.
Shortly after the accident the Respondent was held up by a fireman and a
policeman in a position where it appeared he was suffering the least pain
because if there was any movement he would let out a very loud scream. There
was no other evidence as to the nature and extent of the Respondent’s injuries.

[Page 114]

It might further be pointed out that the finding
of lack of injury to the appellant’s face, head and chest was made only as a
result of visual observation of the appellant by the trial judge at the trial,
which did not take place until December 17, 1968.

In the result, it is my opinion that the learned
trial judge failed properly to apply the rule in Hodge’s case to the
facts before him in that he acquitted the appellant, not because he found that
there was a rational conclusion on the facts inconsistent with his guilt, but
because there was, in his opinion, a conjectural conclusion which he considered
might be inconsistent with his guilt.

In reaching the conclusion that, in this case,
the learned trial judge erred on a question of law, it is necessary to consider
whether this is inconsistent with the judgment of this Court in the case of Sunbeam
Corporation (Canada) Ltd. v. The Queen[7].
The issue in that case, on an appeal by the Crown from an acquittal, was as to
whether there had been an error on a question of law alone so as to entitle the
Court of Appeal to interfere with the decision at trial.

That case involved two charges against a
manufacturer of electrical appliances of breaches of s. 34(2) (b) of
the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 314, in attempting to
induce retail dealers to resell its products at prices not less than minimum
prices specified by it. The evidence was mainly documentary, and the Crown was
able to take the benefit of s. 41(2) of that Act, which provided that
documents, such as certain letters in question, should be admitted in evidence
and should constitute prima facie evidence that the accused had
knowledge of the documents and their contents and that anything recorded in
them as having been done, said, or agreed upon by the accused or its agent was
done, said or agreed upon.

[Page 115]

Notwithstanding the documentary evidence
adduced, and the impact of s. 41(2), the learned trial judge held, as to
one charge, that:

…The evidence as to inducement on this
count does not bear that quality of certainty that ought to exist in the case
of a criminal charge and it will therefore be dismissed.

As to the other charge, he said:

There is here neither sufficient evidence
of inducement on the part of the accused nor that the alleged offence took
place within the time charged. This charge must therefore be dismissed.

In the Court of Appeal, in dealing with the
letters, applying s. 41(2), the Court said that the statements made by the
company’s salesman “constitute direct proof by way of admissions of the
attempts charged” and went on to say:

That evidence is not only sufficient to get
the case past the judge to the jury, but there being no issue as to the weight
or credit to be given to it, it is sufficient to counterbalance the general
presumption of innocence and require affirmative action by the court in
convicting the accused where, as here, it is not countered or controlled by
evidence tending to contradict it or render it improbable, or to prove facts
inconsistent with it.

Dealing with this proposition, Ritchie J.,
delivering the judgment of the majority of this Court, said, at p. 229:

With the greatest respect I cannot agree
with Mr. Justice Schroeder that the provisions of s. 41(2) in any way
preclude a judge or jury from considering the weight to be attached to
the evidence contained in the letters in question in determining the issue of
whether the Crown has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

Section 41(2)(c) simply provides
that documents, such as these letters, which were in the possession of the
accused “shall be admitted in evidence without further proof thereof and shall
be prima facie evidence” that the accused had knowledge of the documents
and their contents and that anything recorded in them as having been done, said
or agreed upon by the accused or its agent, was done, said or agreed upon. This
does not mean that the trial judge, having accepted the letters as prima
facie evidence of their contents, is precluded from assess-

[Page 116]

ing the weight to be attached to that
evidence in considering the issue of the accused’s guilt or innocence.

The conclusion of the majority is expressed by
Ritchie J., at p. 231, as follows:

In the quotations which I have taken from
the judgment of the trial judge and of Mr. Justice Schroeder, I have
italicized the words “sufficient” and “sufficiently” wherever they occur, as it
appears to me that the fundamental difference between the trial judge and the
majority of the Court of Appeal was that the Court of Appeal was of opinion
that the evidence on the 3rd and 4th counts was sufficient to require a
verdict of guilty, whereas the trial judge did not consider it to be sufficient
to support such a verdict. It is well-settled that the sufficiency of
evidence is a question of fact and not a question of law…

In essence, therefore, the Sunbeam case was
one in which, applying s. 41(2), the Crown had made a prima facie case,
which had not been answered by the accused by way of defence. The trial judge
held that, notwithstanding this, it was still open to him to consider the
sufficiency of that evidence to warrant a conviction in a criminal case. The
Court of Appeal held that the evidence was sufficient to require a verdict of
guilty. This Court held that the matter of sufficiency of proof was a question
of fact for the trial judge and not a question of law.

In Lampard v. The Queen[8], in which the Sunbeam case was
followed, the finding of the trial judge was as to guilty intent, and it was
held that an inquiry as to whether certain acts were committed with a certain
intent involved a question of fact.

In the present case there is no issue as to the
sufficiency of the evidence to establish that an offence, as charged, had been
committed and there is no issue as to any question of intent. The only issue
was as to identity, and involved the proper application of the rule in Hodge’s
case. For the reasons given, it is my opinion

[Page 117]

that the learned trial judge failed properly to
apply the rule to the facts of this case. This involves error on a question of
law.

In Belyea and Weinraub v. The King[9], Chief Justice Anglin said, at p. 296:

The right of appeal by the
Attorney-General, conferred by s. 1013(4), Cr. C., as enacted by c. 11,
s. 28, of the Statutes of Canada, 1930, is, no doubt, confined to
“questions of law.” That implies, if it means anything at all, that there can
be no attack by him in the Appellate Divisional Court on the correctness of any
of the findings of fact. But we cannot regard that provision as excluding the
right of the Appellate Divisional Court, where a conclusion of mixed law and fact,
such as is the guilt or innocence of the accused, depends, as it does here,
upon the legal effect of certain findings of fact made by the judge or the
jury, as the case may be, to enquire into the soundness of that conclusion,
since we cannot regard it as anything else but a question of law,—especially
where, as here, it is a clear result of misdirection of himself in law by the
learned trial judge.

In the present case the learned trial judge, in
considering the facts to which he referred, failed to appreciate their proper
effect, in law, in that he did not distinguish between a conjectural
possibility, arising from those facts, and a rational conclusion arising from
the whole of the evidence.

In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

RITCHIE J.—I have had the benefit of reading the
reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Hall,
Mr. Justice Spence and Mr. Justice Martland and although I am in full
agreement with the reasons and conclusion of the latter, I find it necessary to
add a brief comment of my own.

This appeal raises the issue as to whether,
under the circumstances of the present case, the appeal to the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta was limited to a “ground of appeal
that involves a question of law alone” so as to give that Court jurisdiction
under s. 584 of the Criminal Code.

[Page 118]

The vital question which the learned trial judge
was required to determine was the identity of the driver at the moment when the
motor vehicle struck the power pole. The evidence in this regard is in my
opinion entirely circumstantial and is afforded by the positions of the
occupants of the vehicle immediately after the accident. The rule which the
learned trial judge was required to apply in assessing this evidence has been
recently restated in this Court by Spence J. in The Queen v. Mitchell[10], where he said of the statement made to
the jury by Baron Alderson in Hodge’s case[11]:

Baron Alderson told the jury that the case
was made up of circumstances entirely; and that, before they could find the
prisoner guilty, they must be satisfied, ‘not only that those circumstances
were consistent with his having committed the act, but they must also be
satisfied that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person.’

It is quite clear that this direction was
concerned only with the identification of the accused as being the person who
had committed the crime.

In the Mitchell case, Cartwright J. (as
he then was) speaking for himself alone, observed: “The key word in the rule in
Hodge’s case is ‘rational’.”

In the tragic circumstances of this case, the
circumstance of the accused’s body being pinned behind the steering wheel so
that it required the use of a hydraulic jack to release it, is not only
consistent with the accused having been the driver, but is so compelling as to
make that conclusion almost self-evident. The question however remains as to
whether any of the other evidence concerning the positions of the various occupants
of the car after the accident affords a “rational conclusion” which is
inconsistent with the appellant’s guilt. In considering this question the
learned trial judge himself said:

What can happen to the occupants of a
vehicle which comes to such a sudden stop is, I think, a matter of conjecture.

[Page 119]

In my opinion the learned trial judge misapplied
the rule as stated by my brother Spence in the Mitchell case, supra, in
that instead of seeking to determine whether the circumstantial evidence disclosed
“any other rational conclusion” inconsistent with the appellant’s guilt, he
based his decision on “a matter of conjecture”. In so doing, in my opinion, he
erred in law and his decision was accordingly properly reviewable under
s. 584 of the Criminal Code.

As I have indicated, I would dispose of this
matter as proposed by my brother Martland.

HALL J. (dissenting)—I agree with the
Chief Justice and with my brother Spence that this appeal by the Crown does not
involve a question of law alone as required by s. 584(1) (a) of the
Criminal Code. I question, if I had been the trial judge, that I would
have found that there was a basis for a reasonable doubt in the instant case,
but I was not the trial judge and I have no right to usurp his function as
such, and by reviewing the evidence come to the conclusion that he could not in
law have had a reasonable doubt. The inference to be drawn from the proven
facts was a pure question of fact.

I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by the
Chief Justice.

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[12] pronounced on May 14, 1969. By that
judgment, the Appellate Division allowed an appeal by the Crown from the
judgment of Déchène J. pronounced on December 18, 1968, after trial without a
jury. In the latter judgment, the learned trial judge acquitted the accused of
three charges of criminal negligence causing death and one charge of failing to
remain at the scene of an accident.

I have had the advantage of reading the reasons
of my brother Martland and I shall not repeat his statement of the facts except
where I find it neces-

[Page 120]

sary to extend the reference thereto. I must,
however, differ from my learned brother’s conclusion.

As pointed out in the reasons rendered for the
Appellate Division by the Chief Justice of Alberta, there is no issue as to
negligence and the sole issue upon this appeal is whether the appellant should
have been convicted as the driver of the automobile involved in the accident.
All of the evidence in reference to the question of identification was
circumstantial. Therefore, the consideration of that evidence must be governed
by the rule in Hodge’s case[13].

Cartwright J., as he then was, referring to the
application of that rule, said in Lizotte v. The King[14]:

However that may be, it is my opinion that
where the proof of any essential ingredient of the offence charged depends upon
circumstantial evidence it is necessary that the direction be given.

My brother Martland, in his reasons, has quoted
the direction given by Baron Alderson in Hodge’s case, supra, and
I repeat it here:

Alderson B. told the jury, that the case
was made up of circumstances entirely; and that, before they could find the
prisoner guilty, they must be satisfied, “not only that those circumstances
were consistent with his having committed the act, but they must also be
satisfied that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person”.

Although there is a certain degree of
intermixture of the doctrine of “reasonable doubt” and of the rule in Hodge’s
case, I am of the opinion that both the learned trial judge and the
Appellate Division did consider the latter rule. The learned trial judge, upon
consideration of the circumstances, came to the conclusion that he had no doubt
that under the circumstances of the case whoever had been the driver of the red
Rambler automobile involved in the accident had been guilty of criminal
negligence which caused death.

[Page 121]

As I have said, no further issue arises upon
that topic. The learned trial judge, however, came to the conclusion that
although the circumstantial evidence was consistent with the conclusion that
the accused had been that person who so drove that vehicle there was reasonable
doubt that there might have existed other rational conclusions. Therefore,
applying exactly the rule in Hodge’s case, the learned trial judge
refused to convict.

With respect, the Chief Justice of Alberta in
his reasons in the Appellate Division and my brother Martland in his reasons in
this Court have both proceeded to weigh the evidence in order to determine
whether such other rational conclusion was possible. I am of the opinion that
that is not within the function of either the Appellate Division or of this
Court upon appeal by the Crown from an acquittal of an accused person.

The jurisdiction of an Appellate Court under
such circumstances is set out in s. 584 of the Criminal Code which
in subs. (1) (a) provides:

584. (1) The Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal

(a) against a judgment or verdict of
acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by indictment on any ground of appeal
that involves a question of law alone,

(The underlining is my own.)

I need not repeat the decisions of this Court in
reference to the application of that section. It is sufficient to say that it
has been determined that it does not include a ground of appeal which is one of
mixed law and fact.

In his reasons, the Chief Justice of Alberta
cites The Queen v. Lemire[15] upon
the proposition that the Appellate Division could proceed to examine the
evidence and determine that it “amounts to no more than conjecture or surmise
that this was the course of events”. The majority judgment of this Court in The
Queen

[Page 122]

v. Lemire was
given by my brother Martland and at p. 192 of the report he stated:

With the exception of those counts on which
Lemire was acquitted, in my opinion, there was no evidence on the basis of
which, as to each and every expense account submitted by him, any doubt,
let alone a reasonable doubt, could arise as to Lemire’s having incorporated,
to effectuate the agreed scheme, items of expense which were fictitious and
false.

(The underlining is my own.)

Therefore, that was a case where both this Court
and the Court of Queen’s Bench (Appeal Side) in the Province of Quebec were of
the opinion that there was no evidence upon which to base the acquittal of the
accused.

Again, in Sunbeam v. The Queen[16], Ritchie J. in this Court gave judgment
for the majority allowing an appeal from a conviction by the Court of Appeal
for Ontario on the ground, as Martland J. points out in his reasons upon this
appeal, that the Court of Appeal was considering the sufficiency of the
evidence and that in so doing they were engaging in the consideration of a
question of fact and not a question of law as they alone were entitled to
consider under the provisions of s. 584(1) (a)of the Code.

Chief Justice Smith also quotes the decision of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Regina v. Torrie[17]. There, a County Court Judge had acquitted
the driver of a vehicle who had been accused of criminal negligence contra s.
192 of the Criminal Code, as was the present appellant. In so
acquitting, the trial judge expressed himself as having a reasonable doubt that
the accident might have been caused by a sharp object being tossed from the
road against the left front tire of the accused’s vehicle causing the tire to
deflate and throwing the vehicle over to the left side of the road thereby
resulting in the fatal impact. The evidence had shown that there was a cut or
puncture in the sidewall of the tire close to the rim flange and that the
flange imme-

[Page 123]

diately in line with this puncture had been
damaged. There was no evidence of the presence of any sharp object on the
roadway in the vicinity. The Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed an appeal by
the Crown. At p. 303, Evans J.A. said:

With the greatest respect, I am of the
opinion that the learned trial judge misapplied the rule in Hodge’s case (1838),
2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136, as to circumstantial evidence in that he based his
finding of reasonable doubt on non-existent evidence.

There was no appeal to this Court and therefore
whether or not there was any evidence upon which the learned trial judge could
have based his finding can only be determined upon the acceptance of Evans
J.A.’s statement. I stress, however, that the appeal was allowed and the
accused was convicted on the basis that there was no evidence upon which
the learned trial judge could find that there was another rational conclusion
than the guilt of the accused, not by the weighing of the evidence to determine
whether the learned trial judge should have found such evidence could support
another rational conclusion. I am of the opinion that if there is evidence upon
which a learned trial judge may find that there could be another rational
conclusion then whether or not that evidence would have been sufficient to
cause a Court of Appeal to reach a like conclusion is irrelevant. The task of
determining the rationality of another conclusion if evidence exists is for the
trial court judge and any weighing of that evidence in a Court of Appeal is
engaging is considerations of something other than a question of “law alone”,
to repeat again the words of s. 584(1) (a) of the Criminal Code.

Therefore, in the present case, the question
must be determined whether there was evidence which the learned trial judge
could have and should have considered in determining whether there might have
been any other rational conclusion than that the accused drove the vehicle. I
am of the opinion that there was a considerable body of evidence which the
learned trial judge could have and should have so considered. It is plain that
the appellant was the owner of the

[Page 124]

automobile in question. The appellant gave
evidence on his own behalf and he admitted that he was driving that automobile
at 7:45 p.m. on the evening in question when he met his three companions who
were killed in the accident and that he drove from that meeting place to a beer
parlour known as the Corona where the four sat consuming beer until 10:50 p.m.,
that the four then left the Corona and drove a few blocks to another place,
known as the Beachcomber, where liquor was served, and they there consumed a
small amount of hard liquor each and that they left there at or about 11:30
p.m. The appellant in answer swore that his last recollection was that he and
his companions were walking toward his automobile which was parked on Jasper
Avenue on the same side of the street as the Beachcomber Restaurant. As I have
said, that was at about 11:30 p.m.

A Mr. Greenough was driving his automobile
at 101st Street and 102nd Avenue when he made a manoeuvre in traffic which
seemed to annoy whoever was the driver of a following vehicle which was, no
doubt, the vehicle owned by the appellant, and thereafter that vehicle followed
him, driving in a most erratic fashion for some distance. At the corner of
107th Avenue and 96th Street, when stopped because of a traffic light,
Greenough noticed that the light in the interior of that automobile which stood
behind his had come on indicating that the door had been opened and that there
was no one sitting behind the steering wheel, although he did observe there
were three other persons sitting in the automobile. In a moment, a person
appeared immediately outside the door to Greenough’s left and that person
rapped on the glass with his hand and said, “You’re going to get it”, then
immediately returned to his vehicle. Thereafter, the two vehicules proceeded
and eventually got on 112th Avenue, the street on which the fatal accident
later occurred, and there at about 71st Street whoever was driving the red
Rambler appeared to intentionally cause it to swerve into Greenough’s
automobile, then accelerated away continuing easterly on 112th Avenue to 69th
Street where the red Rambler turned to the right. Mr. Greenough continued
on 112th Avenue to 65th Street where two

[Page 125]

other persons who had witnessed this occurrence
and who gave evidence both informed him of the licence number of the red
Rambler and he telephoned to the police. The constable on the desk informed
Mr. Greenough that the time was then 11:59 p.m., i.e., it was almost
exactly half an hour after the red Rambler had left Jasper Avenue in the
vicinity of the Beachcomber. In my opinion, it is significant that this event
occurred on 112th Avenue, which was the scene of the accident, and that the red
Rambler then turned off 112th Avenue to the south at 69th Street, which would
appear to be between six and seven blocks east of, i.e., beyond, the scene of
the fatal accident. I think it is also significant that in his examination‑in‑chief
at the trial Mr. Greenough was not even asked whether he could identify
the person who stood only a foot or so away from him and threatened him with
the words “You’re going to get it”. Mr. Greenough was not cross-examined.

We are left quite uninformed as to whether this
motorist who had an excellent opportunity to observe closely the driver of this
red Rambler on the same street on which the accident occurred only twenty
minutes before it occurred could identify the accused or even describe the
driver of the vehicle. There was, in addition, that approximately twenty-minute
interval during it would appear that the red Rambler car was some place south
of 112th Avenue when a change of drivers might have occurred. Had either the
appellant or his companions been in a condition to be able to think
intelligently, the quality of driving and temper of the driver, which were
indicated by the events prior to 11:59 p.m. and which I have just outlined,
might well have persuaded them that such a change of driver was required.

One of the witnesses to the slight impact
between the red Rambler and Mr. Greenough’s automobile was
Mr. Alexander Stewart who was unable to say how many persons were riding
in the Rambler automobile and therefore he could add nothing as to the identity
of the driver.

[Page 126]

Mr. Walter Yachimec was another person who
witnessed the impact with the Greenough car and who also confirmed that
thereafter the red Rambler had turned right from 112th Avenue and headed south.
Mr. Yachimec’s evidence was:

No, the only thing I know there was two
people in the back and one of them had glasses on, that’s all I know, they were
both passengers in the car.

He testified that he could not tell whether
there were two or three or how many people there were in the front seat.

The next event in time seemed to be the arrival
of the red Rambler with its passengers at a drive-in restaurant known as the
Burger-King on 112th Avenue. A Mr. Romaine, another patron in another
automobile, testified that at the time there were four people in the red
Rambler and he saw only two get out of the car, that the persons who got out of
the car seemed to be staggering and that the driver did not get out of the car.
It would appear that there had been some loud shouting between Romaine and
these two persons but that Mr. Romaine made no observation of the driver
whatever, stating:

Oh, I didn’t see him or anything, didn’t
have any, talk to him or anything at all, because I think he was getting the
order at the time.

Another patron of the Burger-King Drive-in
Restaurant who testified was one Gordon Botsford. The red Rambler had evidently
pulled in ahead of Mr. Romaine and alongside the automobile driven by
Mr. Botsford. The latter saw only one person getting out of the back of
the car and then re-entering the car on the passenger side of the rear seat,
i.e., the right hand side of the rear seat. He testified that there were four
persons in the car but he did not pay any attention to the driver, and that the
vehicle left the drive-in restaurant in what he described as “a rather jerky
fashion” at about 12:00 o’clock. In cross-examination, Mr. Botsford
testified that there were two persons in the front and two in the rear, and

[Page 127]

that very evidently the man who sat on the
passenger side in the front was drunk and was falling forward and then sitting
back in the vehicle. Mr. Botsford continued his testimony that the vehicle
left the restaurant, headed east on 112th Avenue and he next saw it “maybe four
or five minutes away” afterwards and that it had then been involved in the
accident.

To summarize, it would appear that there was not
the slightest evidence given by Mr. Romaine or by Mr. Botsford to
assist in the identification of the driver of the red Rambler as late as
midnight or perhaps a few minutes after.

Mr. Albert Yagos was driving east on 112th
Avenue at about the bend where the fatal accident occurred when the red Rambler
automobile passed him on his right side, i.e., between his car and the curb, at
a very high rate of speed, a speed which Mr. Yagos estimated, he admitted
very roughly, at 70 to 80 miles an hour, and that the red Rambler hit the curb,
fishtailed and then kept on going until it hit a power pole. At that moment,
Mr. Yagos must have been some little distance to the rear of the red Rambler
as he was not the first to arrive at the scene of the accident. A Detective
Boyd was also driving eastward on 112th Avenue and was evidently between the
red Rambler automobile and that driven by Mr. Yagos when the accident
occurred. Mr. Yagos could only describe the passengers of the automobile
when they passed him as being three in number—two in the front and one in the
rear, and gave no description whatsoever of those three occupants whom he had
seen.

Detective Boyd, who timed the accident very accurately
at 12:20 a.m., said he was at approximately 78th Street when he noticed a flash
of light ahead of him. That flash had indicated the point and time of the
impact. The place of the impact was definitely determined to be midway between
76th Street and 75th Street, so that it occurred about two and a half blocks
ahead of Detective Boyd. When he arrived at the scene of the accident which, of
course, was only a moment after it occurred, Detective Boyd observed one person
behind the wheel in an unconscious condition with

[Page 128]

his head forward on his chest “hanging on or
near the steering wheel”. A young man was unconscious in the back seat of the
car “his chest would be lying on the back seat with his legs on the floor in a
face down mariner”, and on the right hand side of the vehicle there were two
persons lying just outside the right front door. One of the persons was lying
under the other. The twisted debris of the automobile had pinned one of the
ankles of the person on top of the two. The photograph exhibits revealed that
the automobile was well-nigh totally demolished. Subsequent expert evidence
given showed that the impact had occurred on the right front corner, about a
foot and a half from that corner, and the whole right front of the automobile had
been pushed back toward the driver’s side. The right centre doorpost was
twisted so that the door was well inside the vehicle. The right front wheel had
been torn off and was found a very considerable distance away. Police evidence
showed that there had been a skid mark which was described as not like a brake
and which had run for forty-four feet until it met the south curb of 112th
Avenue, that is, the right-hand curb, for a person eastbound, and then a mark
continued on top of the curb from that point for a further forty-two feet four
inches to a heavy steel power pole which power pole had been bent three feet
further in an easterly direction. The impact, therefore, had been terrific, and
the marks showed that the vehicle, upon the impact, had slewed in a clockwise
fashion so that it faced, after it came to rest, southwest with its left front
wheel only a foot and a half north of the curb and its left rear wheel about
three feet north of the curb. The vehicle, therefore, would appear to have
slewed through almost 180 degrees. As I have said, the automobile was well-nigh
demolished. The windshield had been thrown some distance away from the impact
and the steering wheel was bent and broken so that it is almost unrecognizable
in the photographs, particularly in Exhibit 11. The left front seat was broken
so that the back thereof instead of standing at 90 degrees to the east was
driven back to almost a 45 degree angle. The appellant lay on this broken seat
in the fashion which Detective Boyd described. Firemen who were called as an
emergency crew and who arrived almost immediately

[Page 129]

found that his left leg, which was between the
steering column and the left front door frame, was pinned between the dashboard
and the floor boards of the car. Firemen had to use a power jack to separate
these two components of the automobile in order to free the appellant.

All four occupants of the car were removed to a
hospital by ambulance. Dr. McCurry testified that two of them, Morris
Stevenson and Allan Neil Finlayson, were dead on arrival, and the third, Arthur
Daniel Boulay, died forty minutes after admission. Dr. McCurry testified
that he saw the appellant for approximately thirty seconds, only long enough to
form the opinion that he did not need immediate treatment and that he could
wait for another doctor to arrive. According to other police evidence, the
appellant was in such a condition as prevented him from being interviewed that
early morning in the hospital.

The learned trial judge, in his reasons for
judgment, remarked: “There is no evidence of injury to the accused’s head, face
or chest”.

Those who first saw the accused sitting in the
seat ordinarily occupied by the driver, after the impact, testified that there
was blood over his face but that is all the evidence as to injuries which he
received. The appellant was, as I have said, taken to the hospital and there he
was examined by some of the personnel after Dr. McCurry had seen him. It
was within the Crown’s ability to call evidence to establish exactly the injuries
which the appellant suffered at this impact. I am of the opinion that the
learned trial judge was correct in referring to this lack of evidence as being
an important consideration in arriving at the opinion that there might have
been other rational conclusions than that the appellant was the driver. It is
very difficult to imagine how anyone could have been in the driver’s seat of a
vehicle at the moment of its terrific impact with the power pole and not have
received more serious

[Page 130]

injuries. The bent and broken steering wheel
alone could not have failed to crush his chest.

I have recited this evidence with this degree of
detail to show that it was possible, time after time, for there to have been a
change in the identity of the operator of the vehicle. One of the other three
persons might have taken over the driving of the red Rambler at the
Beachcomber; one of the other three persons might have taken over the driving
of the vehicle after the irrational driving thereof culminating in the impact
with Greenough’s automobile; one of the other three persons might have taken
over the driving of the automobile at the Burger‑King Drive-in
Restaurant. None of these suggestions are probabilities, all are possibilities.
All are possibilities which would have given a basis in evidence for the
learned trial judge to determine that other rational conclusions existed. I do
not say that had I been the trial judge I would have determined that there were
other rational conclusions but I do say that his finding that such other
rational conclusions existed was based on a consideration of the evidence and
once there is evidence it is his duty and his duty alone to determine whether
such other conclusion is a rational one. I am, therefore, of the opinion that
the judgment of the Appellate Division could only have been reached by a
weighing of the evidence in order to determine whether other conclusions were
rational and that such a course is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate
Court as provided in s. 584(1) (a) of the Code.

I would, therefore, allow the appeal.

PIGEON J.—I agree with Martland J. that this
case was correctly decided in the Court of Appeal for the reasons stated in the
part of the judgment that he quotes.

I also agree that this is in accordance with the
ratio of the judgment in Belyea[18],
the first case in this Court in which the scope of the right of appeal by the
Crown from an acquittal was considered, after its introduction, and was found

[Page 131]

available against a conclusion of mixed law and
fact, when such conclusion is the result of misdirection in law.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA

Criminal law—Conspiracy to limit facilities
for transporting articles—Conspiracy to prevent or lessen competition in the
transportation of articles—Amendment to indictment—Combines Investigation Act,
R.S.C. 1952, c. 314, as amended by 1960 (Can.), c. 45, s. 13.

The appellants, who are freight forwarders,
were found guilty, after a trial before a judge of the Exchequer Court of
Canada, on each of the two following counts of an indictment laid under the Combines
Investigation Act: (1) Conspiracy to limit unduly the facilities for
transporting or dealing in articles or commodities that may be the subject of trade
or commerce, contrary to s. 32(1) (a) of the Act, and (2)
conspiracy to prevent or lessen, unduly, competition in the transportation of
articles or commodities that may be the subject of trade or commerce, contrary
to s. 32(1) (c) of the Act. The activities of the appellants as
import pool car operators consisted in effecting the consolidation of different
kinds of imported goods at west coast ports and in arranging for their
transportation by rail carriers in mixed pool cars to their destination in eastern
Canada, thus obtaining for their importer clients the advantage of the
consolidation rate for pool cars of mixed goods.

The appellants argue that they provide simply
a service unrelated to articles which are the subject of transportation or of
facilities therefor. They also contend that only physical means of transport
came within the term “facilities” in s. 32(1) (a) and that their
service operations had nothing to do with the

[Page 64]

availability of rail service for those who
required it. In this Court neither the fact of conspiracy nor the element of
undueness is contested.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed and the conviction on both counts affirmed.

As to the second count, the accused were
clearly within s. 32(1)(c) of the Act in preventing or lessening
unduly “competition in the transportation” of the imported articles by rail.
This provision is not limited in its application to persons who are themselves
in the transportation business or who control means of transportation. It
extends to those who are in a position to use or command transportation
services for the carriage of goods in transit.

As to the first count, the operations of the
accused, to which the rail carriage was integral, are comprehended by the term
“facilities for transporting” goods. The physical means of transport were
intimately involved and were enough to bring the accused within the bite of the
statute. It cannot be said therefore that there were no physical means of
transportation involved in the operations of the accused.

APPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the
Exchequer Court of Canada[1],
convicting the appellants on an indictment laid under the Combines
Investigation Act. Appeal dismissed.

Raymond Lette, Q.C., and J. Rousseau, for
the first two appellants.

J.G. Alley, for the other appellant.

S.F. Sommerfeld, Q.C., and D.Q.
Patterson, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LASKIN J.—The three appellants before this Court
are freight forwarders who were found guilty, after a trial before Gibson J. of
the Exchequer Court of Canada1, on each of two counts of an indictment laid
under paras, (a) and (c) respectively of s. 32(1) of the Combines
Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 314, as amended by 1960, c. 45,
s. 13.

[Page 65]

The indictment (which also included two other
firms from whose acquittal there is no appeal) charged two illegal conspiracies
in the following words:

(1) … to limit unduly the facilities for
transporting or dealing in articles or commodities that may be the subject of
trade or commerce, to wit, articles or commodities, imported from designated
areas in the orient into the Province of British Columbia and transported by
railway in railway cars, the railway cars each ordinarily containing a pool
shipment of two or more different kinds of the said articles or commodities, at
east bound import freight rates, to points in Canada, east of the
Manitoba-Ontario boundary, to the City of Toronto and elsewhere in the Province
of Ontario and to the City of Montreal and elsewhere in the Province of Quebec
and did thereby commit an indictable offence contrary to section 32(1) (a)
of the Combines Investigation Act.

(2) … to prevent, or lessen, unduly,
competition in the transportation of articles or commodities that may be the
subject of trade or commerce, to wit, articles or commodities imported from
designated areas in the orient into the Province of British Columbia and
transported by railway in railway cars, the railway cars each ordinarily
containing a pool shipment of two or more different kinds of the said articles
or commodities at east bound import freight rates, to points in Canada, east of
the Manitoba-Ontario boundary, to the City of Toronto, and elsewhere in the
Province of Ontario, and to the City of Montreal and elsewhere in the Province
of Quebec and did thereby commit an indictable offence contrary to
section 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act.

Admissions were made by the Crown as well as by
the accused, pursuant to s. 562 of the Criminal Code. Among those
made by the accused were the following:

1. That during the period described in the
Indictment eighty (80%) per cent—ninety-five (95%) percent of all import pool
car traffic coming within the terms of Canadian Freight Association tariffs
70A, 70B and 70C was carried by the Canadian National Railway and the Canadian
Pacific Railway.

2. That during the period described in the
Indictment approximately eighty-five (85%) percent of all import pool car
traffic referred to in Paragraph 1

[Page 66]

was handled by the accused corporations, but the
portion of the traffic handled by the defendant, Johnston Terminals Limited,
was less than three (3%) to five (5%) percent of the total traffic handled by
the accused corporations.

Counsel for the accused characterized these as
“a straight market admission”, and as designed to support a defence to the
charges that the market specified in the indictment was too narrow. After all
the evidence was in, and, indeed, after counsel for the accused had addressed
the Court, Crown counsel successfully moved to amend the indictment to
introduce the words “which could be” after the words “the Province of British
Columbia and” and before the words “transported by railway” in each count of
the indictment. Objection was taken to the proposed amendment as going to
destroy a defence at a time when other evidence to meet the amendment could no
longer be introduced. Alternatively, it was contended that as a term of
allowing the amendment the accused should be allowed to withdraw the admissions
previously quoted. These contentions were rejected on the ground that there was
no prejudice to the accused.

The propriety of allowing the amendment was one
of the grounds of appeal. Although conceding that the matter was within the
trial judge’s discretion, counsel for the accused submitted that it was
unfairly, that is, not judicially, exercised. This Court did not deem it
necessary to hear Crown counsel on the point, being of the view unanimously
that not only was the trial judge entitled in the circumstances to allow the amendment,
but also that on the merits of the market factor the evidence that was
addressed to the charges as originally laid would not have raised a successful
defence on that issue.

The nub of this appeal is whether the impugned
activities of the accused relate merely to services or to work and labour,
unconnected with “facilities for transporting any article” or with “competition
in the transportation of an article”. Neither the fact of conspiracy nor the
element of undueness is contested; and, apart from the rejected argument on the
amendment of the indictment, there is no issue here on the relevant

[Page 67]

market, either as to the range of imported goods
or as to their source or destination.

The activities of the accused as import pool car
operators, around which their conspiracy developed, became possible with the
amendment of Eastbound Import Tariff 70A, effective July 1, 1955. (Subsequent
amendments through Tariffs 70B and 70C need no elaboration because they did not
alter the situation brought about by the amendment to Tariff 70A.) The tariffs
mentioned covered a wide range of goods imported from countries in the Orient
and brought by ship to west coast ports, and thence carried by rail to points
in Canada east of the Manitoba-Ontario border. Substantially, the importers
were Toronto and Montreal business firms who had their imported goods shipped
to the port of Vancouver.

Prior to the amendment of Tariff 70A in 1955,
these importers could not mix different goods for rail carriage in a single car
in order to get a carload rate; they had to endure the higher less than carload
rate, unless they had a sufficient quantity of the same goods to make up a full
carload of at least 30,000 pounds. As a result of the amendment (and I need not
expatiate on its competitive feature, as against water and truck
transportation, to attract eastern Canada consignees), consolidation of
different kinds of imported goods into carload lots at carload rates became
permissible. The rail carriers themselves, the Canadian National Railways and
the Canadian Pacific Railway, were precluded by a promulgated rule from
themselves effecting a consolidation of goods into a mixed pool car, but would
do so on proper authorization of importers or their agents. In this respect
their services included (1) sorting the goods to be consolidated after they
were unloaded from the ship; (2) loading the goods into the pool car or cars;
and (3) carrying them to their destination, Toronto or Montreal, where they
would be collected by the consignees.

[Page 68]

Since the rail carriers (apparently to avoid the
possibility of discrimination or of charges thereof) could not do the mixing to
make up a carload of goods, eastern Canada importers had the choice of either
banding together to get the advantage of the pool car consolidation rate (which
would mean, in any event, having some representatives at least at Vancouver if
not also in Toronto or Montreal) or of using freight forwarders such as the
accused. The latter, indeed, actively pursued this business and it was admitted
that over 80 per cent of the import pool car traffic during the period January
1, 1956 to August 1, 1966, specified in the indictment, was handled by the
accused, and that not more than 20 per cent of the goods imported from the
Orient and covered by Tariffs 70A, 70B and 70C was carried by truck transport
during this period.

The freight forwarders operated by obtaining
general authorizations from the importers, addressed to shipping line agents,
to secure release of goods consigned to the importers at Vancouver. By an
examination of the ship manifest, the cargo of the authorizing importers was
identified, and thereafter so-called rider sheets, describing the goods, were
made up for presentation to the rail carrier with instructions thereon as to
car loading. The rail carrier, as already noted, did the sorting and loading,
but only according to these directions. The freight forwarder paid the rail
carrier the applicable carriage rate, and, of course, its bill to its importer
clients included these payments in the composite charge for its services. This
overall charge was not a regulated one.

It is, of course, the case that the accused
freight forwarders neither own the imported goods nor have any beneficial
interest in them, nor do they ever come into possession of them. They are not
consignees of the goods but they do control their movement from shipside, at
least so long as their authorizations from importer clients remain in effect.
Again, they own no physical means of transportation and have no control over
the rail carriers, save as rail carrier services are by law available to and
must be provided for those who wish to use them.

On the foregoing facts, the accused mount the
argument that they provide simply a service un-

[Page 69]

related to articles which are the subject of
transportation or of facilities therefor, and that they can no more be found
guilty than could the importers themselves in making use of rail carriers to
get the consolidation rate for pool cars of mixed goods. In so far as this
contention invites this Court to apply agency law as an exonerating feature in
the application and administration of s. 32(1) (a) and (c)
of the Combines Investigation Act, I would reject it. The accused are no
less entrepreneurs in their own right in acting for others. The analogy of the
travel agent purchasing group or charter rate air tickets is misconceived if
there is no article of commerce involved but only passenger travel. Moreover,
no issue of criminality is raised under s. 32(1) (a) and (c)
in the absence of a forbidden conspiracy merely because a freight forwarder
acts as an import pool car operator for a group of importers.

In my opinion, the accused are clearly within
s. 32(1)(c) in preventing or lessening unduly “competition in the
transportation” of the imported articles by rail. This provision is not limited
in its application to persons who are themselves in the transportation business
or who control means of transportation. It extends to those who are in a
position to use or command transportation services for the carriage of goods in
transit, and who combine in the forbidden manner to restrict others from making
use of such services for the carriage of such goods, not because the rail
carrier cannot provide the service but because of the control of goods in
transit for which rail carriage is required. Utilization of rail transportation
is at the very heart of the business of the accused, and it is immaterial that
they neither own nor possess the goods that they send on by rail, or that they
neither own nor control the rail service. I would, therefore, affirm the
conviction on the second count.

[Page 70]

In addressing himself to the two counts of the
indictment, the learned trial judge saw the main issues in the case as turning
on the question of the market and on the question of undueness, neither of
which is of concern here. In addition, he referred to the concept of
competition as being central both to paras, (a) and (c) of
s. 32(1). His reasons do not disclose any consideration of the key phrase
“facilities for transporting any article” in s. 32(1) (a) other
than in his references to the conspiracy as involving “control of the channels
of distribution”.

In a broad sense, it may be said that
s. 32(1) (a), which does not refer to any limitation of
competition, is concerned with maintaining competitive access to “facilities
for transporting” goods. But it was the contention of the accused that only
physical means of transport came within the term “facilities”, and that their
service operations (even if it brought them within the ban of s. 32(1) (c))
had nothing to do with the availability of rail service for those who required
it.

I do not find at all helpful judicial
interpretations of the word “facilities” in cases arising under different
statutes, and especially when the word does not have the contextual connection
in which it appears in the Combines Investigation Act.

I agree with the trial judge that (whatever be
the meaning of “facilities”) conspiring persons may be guilty under s. 32(1)
(a) without owning or controlling “facilities” for transporting goods as
they may be under s. 32(1)(c) without owning or possessing or being
associated with any transportation operation as agents thereof. If, as is
uncontested, the accused dominated the channels of distribution to eastern
Canada of the imported goods laid down at Vancouver, the Court cannot ignore
the centrality of rail carriage in that distribution. It is no answer to a
charge under s. 32(1) (a) to say that this hold on rail
carriage was simply a consequence of the elimination of competition (in
obtaining the authorizations of importers to see to the effective movement of
their goods at the favourable mixed carload rate), and that therefore it was
not itself culpable. In my opinion, the operations of the

[Page 71]

accused, to which the rail carriage was
integral, are comprehended by the term “facilities for transporting” goods. The
physical means of transport were intimately involved, and even if they did not
represent the entirety of the activities of the accused in their particular
business, they are enough to bring the accused within the bite of the statute.
It is evident that these accused limited to themselves (and unduly) facilities
for transporting to eastern Canada the categories of imported goods covered by
the relevant tariffs. I do not agree, therefore, with counsel for the accused
that there were no physical means of transport involved in the operations of
the accused.

It is unnecessary to go beyond this conclusion
in the present case in respect of the meaning of the phrase “facilities for
transporting… any article”. I would add that the fact that the same conduct may
bring the accused within both paras. (a) and (c) of
s. 32(1) is a matter for those laying the charges. The trial juge
reflected his appreciation of the matter by imposing one fine in respect of
both convictions.

I would, therefore, affirm the conviction on the
first count as well, and in the result I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal
law—Evidence—Confession—Admissibility—No statement, inculpatory or exculpatory,
admissible without voir dire.

The appellant was tried and acquitted on a
charge of non capital murder. The trial judge rejected a statement made by the
appellant to the police when

[Page 24]

she was questioned shortly after the
discovery of the victim’s body. After a lengthy voir dire, he held that
the statement was inculpatory and had not been made voluntarily. In her
testimony at the trial, the appellant told a totally different story than the
one contained in the statement which was not received in evidence. The Court of
Appeal directed a new trial, being of the opinion that the statement was
exculpatory and that it was not subject to the rules relating to confessions.
The accused appealed to this Court.

Held (Fauteux
and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Abbott, Martland, Ritchie, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.: There is no
distinction to be drawn between inculpatory and exculpatory statements as such
in so far as their admissibility in evidence when tendered by the Crown is
concerned. The admission in evidence of all statements made by an accused to
persons in authority, whether inculpatory or exculpatory, is governed by the
same rule. If the statement was given voluntarily, it will be admitted; if not
given voluntarily and the trial judge so rules, it will not be admitted.

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Spence J.: The supposed rule that an involuntary statement relative to
the offence with which an accused is charged is admissible against him if on
its face it is exculpatory is an anomaly which should be rejected from our law.
The right of an accused to remain silent is equally violated whether, when he
is coerced into making a statement against his will, what he says is on its
face inculpatory or exculpatory. It is difficult to see how the prosecution can
consistently urge that a statement forced from an accused is in reality
exculpatory while at the same time asserting that its exclusion has resulted in
the acquittal of the accused and that its admission might well have resulted in
conviction.

Per Fauteux
and Judson JJ., dissenting: The statement in question was exculpatory.
It denied guilt. It was an assertion by the accused that she had not shot the
man. A statement denying guilt cannot be a confession and is not therefore
subject to the rules relating to confessions. If a person chooses to give the
police an innocent explanation of his conduct and then at the trial goes into
the witness box and gives another innocent explanation incon-

[Page 25]

sistent with the first, it is entirely
appropriate for Crown counsel to cross-examine on this discrepancy and the
reasons for it. There should be no recognition of any right on the part of an
accused to tell the police one innocent story and then tell another innocent
story in the witness box without the jury knowing anything about the conflict
between the two.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Manitoba[1],
quashing a verdict of acquittal and directing a new trial. Appeal allowed,
Fauteux and Judson JJ. dissenting.

S.M. Froomkin, for the appellant.

H.E. Wolch, for the respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright C.J. and Spence J.
was delivered by

CARTWRIGHT C.J.—The relevant facts and the
course of the proceedings in the courts below are set out in the reasons of my
brothers Judson and Hall which I have had the advantage of reading.

I agree with the conclusion of my brother Hall
that we are free to say and should say that no statement made by an accused to
persons in authority should be admitted in evidence against him unless it is
shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement in the sense stated
by Lord Sumner in the passage from his reasons in Ibrahim v. Rex[2], quoted by my brother Hall, and that
this rule applies whether the statement sought to be admitted is inculpatory or
exculpatory.

I agree with the reasons of my brother Hall but
wish to add a few words as to why, in principle, an involuntary exculpatory
statement should be inadmissible.

The main reason assigned for the rule that an
involuntary confession is to be excluded is the danger that it may be untrue
but, as has been

[Page 26]

recently reasserted by this Court in DeClerq
v. The Queen[3], the
answer to the question whether such a confession should be admitted depends on
whether or not it was voluntary not on whether or not it was true.

It appears to me to involve a strange method of
reasoning to say that an involuntary statement harmful to the accused’s defence
shall be excluded because of the danger of its being untrue but that a harmful
involuntary statement, of which there is not merely a danger of its being false
but which the prosecution asserts to be false, should be admitted merely
because, considered in isolation, it is on its face exculpatory.

If, on the other hand, one regards the rule
against the admission of an involuntary statement as being based in part on the
maxim, nemo tenetur seipsum accusare, the right of an accused to remain
silent is equally violated whether, when he is coerced into making a statement
against his will, what he says is on its face inculpatory or exculpatory. I
find it difficult to see how the prosecution can consistently urge that a
statement forced from an accused is in reality exculpatory while at the same
time asserting that its exclusion has resulted in the acquittal of the accused
and that its admission might well have resulted in conviction.

In Best v. Samuel
Fox & Co. Ltd.[4], Lord
Porter said, at page 727:

The common law is a historical development
rather than a logical whole, and the fact that a particular doctrine does not
logically accord with another or others is no ground for its rejection.

In the same case, at page 733, Lord Goddard, who
agreed in the result, said:

…but English law is free neither of some
anomalies nor of everything illogical, but there is no reason for extending
them.

In my view, the supposed rule that an
involuntary statement relative to the offence with which an

[Page 27]

accused is charged is admissible against him if
on its face it is exculpatory is an anomaly which should be rejected from our
law.

While somewhat different considerations enter
into some of the decisions of the courts of the United States, in my opinion,
the law of Canada is correctly stated in the following passage from the reasons
of Traynor J., as he then was, in People of the State of California v.
Atchley[5],
quoted by Freedman J.A. in the case at bar:

Accordingly any statement by an accused
relative to the offence charged is inadmissible against him if made
involuntarily.

I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my
brother Hall.

The judgment of Fauteux and Judson JJ. was
delivered by

JUDSON J. (dissenting)—The appellant,
Ruth Thelma Piche, was charged with the non-capital murder of Leslie Pascoe in
the early morning of November 1, 1968. She had been living with Pascoe since
1964. The two had had an evening of drinking on October 31, 1968, along with
others. They returned home about midnight. There was evidence of quarrelling
during the evening and also on their return home, and of more and heavier
drinking, particularly on the part of Pascoe. At 2.30 a.m. on November 1, 1968,
the appellant called a taxi, which took her and her infant child to her
mother’s apartment. At 10.30 a.m. on November 1, Pascoe’s body was found in his
apartment. He had been shot by a gun which was found on a gunrack in the
bathroom. The police interviewed the appellant on the morning of November 2.
She was tried and acquitted on the charge of non-capital murder in February of
1969. In April 1969, the full Court of Appeal[6],
with one dissent, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial on the ground
that there was error in law in the ruling of the trial judge that a certain
statement was inculpatory and had not been proved to be free and voluntary
within the rules prescribed

[Page 28]

in Boudreau v. The King[7]. The majority in the Court of Appeal
was clearly of the opinion that the statement was exculpatory and that it was
not subject to these rules. On appeal to this Court, the same point is in
issue.

The statement in question was given to the
police by the appellant on November 2, 1968. It describes the events of the
evening—the drinking, the quarrelling, the return home and more drinking and
quarrelling after the return home. Then she says that she decided to go to her
mother’s apartment with the child. She puts the time of the call for the taxi
at 1.50 a.m. She says that when she left the apartment at 1.50 a.m., Pascoe was
asleep on the chesterfield.

I agree with the majority opinion of the Court
of Appeal that this statement is exculpatory and that no admission of guilt or
of any essential element in the charge of non-capital murder can be found in
it, and that the ruling of the trial judge was erroneous when he made it
subject to the rules relating to confessions. His reason for finding that the
statement was inculpatory was that it contained statements which went to the
questions of both opportunity and motive.

At the trial, the accused gave evidence that she
took the rifle from the rack with the intention of committing suicide, that it
accidentally discharged, with the bullet striking the deceased, and that she
then left the apartment.

I cannot accept the trial judge’s reasoning in
this case that the statement was inculpatory because it went to the question of
both opportunity and motive. This particular statement denied guilt. It was an
assertion by the accused that she had not shot the man. A statement denying
guilt cannot be a confession. As Wigmore said: “This ought to be plain enough
if legal terms are to have any meaning and if the spirit of the general
principle is to be obeyed.”

[Page 29]

The problem we have here has been repeatedly
before the courts since 1913, beginning with Rex v. Hurd[8], in the Alberta Court of Appeal. The
cases are all reviewed by Monnin J.A., in the present case and by MacKay J.A.
in Regina v. Black and Mackie[9].

The Courts of Appeal in Alberta, British Columbia,
Manitoba and Ontario have all held that a statement denying guilt is not
subject to the confession rule. The only possible exception to this line of
authority is to be found in the judgment of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in
Rex v. Scory[10]. The
British Columbia Court of Appeal refused to follow this decision. In so doing I
think they were right. Rex v. Scory is out of line with all other
authority in this country. In that case the charge was “rape” and the defence
at trial was “consent”. The accused was asked on cross-examination whether when
questioned by the police he had not given another innocent explanation, namely,
that he was not there at all. This line of cross-examination to me is clearly
permissible but it was stopped. It may well be that the foundation for the
decision in Scory was an adherence to what was thought to be the
principle in Gach v. The King[11] to
the effect that incriminating statements made by a person under detention as a
result of questions put to him by a person in authority were not admissible in
evidence unless a proper warning had been given him. It was stated in Boudreau
v. The King, supra, that this dictum in Gach was obiter.
Boudreau expresses the true rule in this country, that the test for the
admissibility of a confession is voluntariness.

Two statements were involved in Boudreau. The
first was the result of questioning before a

[Page 30]

warning had been given. The first statement was
essentially an alibi. The second statement after the warning had been given admitted
the murder. With one exception all the members of the court held that the
statements were voluntary. As to the first statement, the majority held that it
was incriminating and not exculpatory. Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau J. dissented
on this point. They would have held that in any event the confession rule did
not apply.

The dissenting reasons in the Manitoba Court of
Appeal in the present case refer to recent developments in the United States
which indicate that there is no difference between a confession and an
exculpatory statement. The matter seems to be summed up on this point in an
article entitled “Development in the Law of Confessions”, 79 Harvard Law Review
(1965‑66) pp. 1032-33, as follows:

Since Bram v. United States, 168
U.S. 532 (1897), the federal courts have generally applied the rules for
confessions to admissions and exculpatory statements, although there have been
occasional dicta to the contrary. In Bram, the defendant had been told
that another suspect had seen him commit the crime, to which he replied “he
could not see me from there.” Although the statement was intended as a denial
of the accusation, the prosecution offered it on the theory that the accused
had tacitly admitted that the suspect might have seen the crime from some other
place. The Supreme Court, in requiring the application of voluntariness rules,
seemed unconcerned by the exculpatory nature of the statement.

There is a certain trend in recent years to
adopt this liberal viewpoint. In People v. Atchley, the Supreme
Court of California ruled that “any statement by an accused relative to the
offense charged is inadmissible against him if made involuntarily.” In doing
so, the court that had once been so quick to distinguish between confessions
and admissions in the application of the voluntariness rules pointed out that
the rationale for exclusion was equally persuasive for both kinds of statement.
In Oregon, a 1957 amendment to the Criminal Code extended the rules for
confessions to cover admissions. And Rule 63(6) of the Uniform Rules of
Evidence, which is in effect in Kansas, requires a showing of voluntariness for
any statement “relative to the

[Page 31]

offence charged.” But in spite of this
trend, probably most states still accept Wigmore’s view that admissions are not
subject to the rules of voluntariness.

The test which has led to this development seems
to be that a confession must be the result of a free and reasoned choice, and
that no distinctions among the categories of out-of-court statements can
constitutionally be made, and that the test for admissibility must be the same
for confessions, admissions and exculpatory statements.

Turning now to the position in England, the
starting point must be Ibrahim v. The King[12]. Ibrahim was concerned with a
confession. The statement was brief. It was this: In answer to the question why
he had done such a senseless act, the accused said: “Some three or four days he
had been abusing me; without a doubt I killed him.” The case was not concerned
with an admission falling short of a confession. Nothing, in my opinion, turns
upon the use of the word “statement” rather than “confession”. Nor did it in Boudreau
v. The King, which adopted Ibrahim as the standard to be
followed in this country.

Commissioners of Customs and Excise v. Harz and Power[13] involves
what are called admissions which were the result of prolonged questioning. The
accused were charged with defrauding the revenue. Customs officers seized
whatever books were available and then began to ask questions. One of the
accused, Harz, said “We are not talking”, but the officers told him that he
would be prosecuted if he did not answer and he did give certain answers on
that occasion. On subsequent occasions there was further questioning and he
made certain incriminating admissions. The conclusion of the House of Lords was
that these admissions would not have been made unless there had been a threat
of prosecution for refusal to answer, that there was no right to require Harz
to submit to this prolonged interrogation and that he could not have been pro-

[Page 32]

secuted for refusal to answer. These are the
facts of the case and I do not think that the case is authority for anything
more than this, that there is no distinction in principle between a man being
induced by a threat to make a full confession and a man similarly induced
making merely one or more incriminating admissions. This is the extent of the
case and it is so stated in Phipson on Evidence, 11th ed., (1970),
para. 791. It can have no application to a case where there is a complete
denial of commission of the crime as there is here.

The practical importance of the case under
review is obvious. It is an essential part of work of the police to ask
questions of suspects. It is only when the stage of confession is reached that
the confession rules apply. If a person chooses to give the police an innocent
explanation of his conduct and then at the trial goes into the witness box and
gives another innocent explanation inconsistent with the first, it is entirely
appropriate for Crown counsel to cross‑examine on this discrepancy and
the reasons for it. This is particularly needed when an alibi is set up as a
defence. There is no legislation in this country corresponding to the English
legislation, s. 11 of the Criminal Justice Act of 1967, which
requires the early and complete disclosure of the evidence in support of an
alibi. There should be no recognition of any right on the part of an accused
person to tell the police one innocent story and then tell another innocent
story in the witness box without the jury knowing anything about the conflict
between the two.

I would adopt the review of the problem
contained in the reasons of Monnin J.A. in this case and of MacKay J.A. in Regina
v. Black and Mackie, supra. I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Abbott, Martland, Ritchie, Hall,
Spence and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

HALL J.—The appellant was tried before Hunt J.
and a jury on an indictment charging:

That she the said Ruth Thelma Piche on or
about the 1st day of November, A.D. 1968 at the City of

[Page 33]

St. Vital in the Eastern Judicial District
in the Province of Manitoba did unlawfully murder Leslie Harrison Pascoe and
thereby committed non-capital murder.

She was acquitted. The Crown appealed to the
Court of Appeal for Manitoba[14] which
Court (Freedman J.A. dissenting) quashed the verdict of acquittal and directed
a new trial.

The issue in the Court of Appeal involved the
rejection by the learned trial judge of a statement made by the appellant to
the police when she was questioned shortly after the discovery of Pascoe’s body
whose death was said to have occurred between 1:22 A.M. and 4:22 A.M. on the
1st day of November, 1968. The appellant had been cohabiting with the deceased
for some considerable time prior to his death. After a lengthy voir dire, Hunt
J. held that the statement had not been made voluntarily and did not receive it
in evidence.

The Court of Appeal was asked to decide whether
or not the statement was ‘inculpatory’ or ‘exculpatory’. The Crown’s position
was and is that if the statement was inculpatory, the ruling by Hunt J. was
not, in the circumstances of this case, subject to review; if exculpatory, the voir
dire was unnecessary and the statement should have been admitted when
tendered by the Crown.

In the statement given to the police the
appellant said that she had not heard of Pascoe’s death until after she arrived
at her mother’s home, having left the deceased fast asleep in the apartment
they both occupied at or about 1:50 A.M. the same morning. The important
portion of the statement read:

I lay there about five or ten minutes and
couldn’t go to sleep so I got up and telephoned my mother, she was home so I
told her I was coming over to her place. I then ’phoned for a taxi, Duffy’s,
then went and dressed Lisa. I put a coat, a sweater, shoes and socks on her and
I too got dressed. Les was still asleep. I left the house at 1.50 in the
morning I think. After I arrived at my mother’s I slept on

[Page 34]

the chesterfield with Lisa. When I got
there my mother was up and so was her boarder Maurice Laliberty. I told them
we’d had a fight and that I wanted to stay with my mom.

In her testimony at the trial the appellant told
a totally different story, claiming that the killing of Pascoe was accidental,
that following a series of fights and unpleasant incidents between the deceased
and herself she had made up her mind to commit suicide; that in furtherance of
this state of mind she took a rifle from a weapon rack in the bathroom and upon
seeing the deceased asleep on the living room couch decided to go and kiss him
once more: that upon proceeding to do this the weapon accidentally discharged.
In her statement to the police she had admitted that she knew where the rifles
and the pistol were kept in the bathroom and that she knew how to open them and
had taken them from the rack a week before.

In dealing with the opposite contentions, Monnin
J.A., for the majority, said:

The only point in issue, as far as I am
able to see, is whether this statement was exculpatory or inculpatory. The
matter is not free from doubt; it has caused great difficulty to the profession
and the bench over the years. With respect, the conflicting decisions have
added to the confusion rather than helped to solve the problem. Clear and
easily understandable guide lines are necessary.

(Emphasis added)

He proceeded to a full review of the relevant
authorities as he saw them, and concluded:

Without difficulty I hold that in this case
the statement was exculpatory and that consequently the rule as to confessions
does not apply. It ought to have been ruled admissible without a voir dire. With
respect for those who hold a contrary view, I have no hesitation in concluding
that the learned trial Judge was in error in proceeding with a trial within a
trial and in ruling that the statement was inculpatory.

[Page 35]

Freedman J.A. in his dissent said:

We should be clear on what the Crown’s
submission involves. The Crown asks for the introduction in evidence of a
statement which the learned trial Judge has, with justification, found to have
been induced by persons in authority and which therefore could not qualify as
voluntary. The finding of the Court against voluntariness makes no difference,
says the Crown. Voluntary or involuntary, the statement was admissible, because
it was exculpatory. So we are being invited to set aside the jury’s verdict of
acquittal in order that on a new trial this involuntary, induced statement
should be placed before the jury. Unless clearly obliged by law to do so a
court in my view should be slow to accede to such a course.

and concluded on this aspect of the case that
the Court was without jurisdiction to hear the Crown’s appeal, being of the
view that the appeal did not raise a question of law in the strict sense.
However, having so expressed himself, he continued:

This lends weight to the conclusion I have
reached that the present appeal goes beyond a mere question of law. In the
light of that conclusion I could end here by dismissing this appeal for lack of
jurisdiction. But if I should be wrong in this—and the fact that the other
members of the Court take an opposing view makes this a distinct possibility—it
might be desirable for me to add some observations on issues that become
applicable if jurisdiction to hear this appeal exists.

and came to the conclusion that in his opinion
Hunt J. was right in holding the statement to be inculpatory. He then
continued:

I move to another issue. Assuming, contrary
to the learned Judge’s ruling, that the statement was wholly exculpatory, is it
then outside the rule? Does it become admissible without any proof that it was
voluntary? Yes, say most Canadian judges. No, say a few dissenters. The
jurisprudence on the subject is referred to in the judgment of my brother
Monnin. But, somewhat surprisingly, till now there has been no express majority
opinion on the point by the Supreme Court of Canada. Hence the question may
still be regarded as open. That certainly appeared to be the view of the Court
of Appeal of Ontario when,

[Page 36]

in the relatively recent case of Reg.
vs. Black and Mackie (1966) 1 O.R. 683, the majority could write thus:

It is quite clear that the rules which
govern the admission of the confession relate generally to what may be called
inculpatory statements; if the statement is totally exculpatory in its nature
other considerations may or may not apply. The cases are in conflict on this
point.

Having researched all the relevant decisions of
this Court on the subject of inculpatory vis‑a‑vis exculpatory
statements, I have concluded that Freedman J.A. was right when he said:

But, somewhat surprisingly, till now
there has been no express majority opinion on the point by the Supreme Court of
Canada. Hence the question may still be regarded as open.

(Emphasis added)

The leading authority in this Court is Boudreau
v. The King[15]. This
case was heard by Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand, Kellock, Estey and
Locke JJ. Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau J. (as he then was) expressly drew a
distinction between inculpatory and exculpatory statements while Kerwin J. (as
he then was) and Kellock J. implicitly accepted such a distinction. The other
three members of the Court did not discuss the issue of inculpatory versus
exculpatory statements.

In my view the time is opportune for this Court
to say that the admission in evidence of all statements made by an accused to
persons in authority, whether inculpatory or exculpatory, is governed by the
same rule and thus put to an end the continuing controversy and necessary
evaluation by trial judges of every such statement which the Crown proposes to
use in chief or on cross-examination as either being inculpatory or
exculpatory. The rule respecting the admission of statements is a judge-made
rule and does not depend

[Page 37]

upon any legislative foundation and I see no
impediment to making the rule clear and beyond dispute.

The classic case upon which virtually all recent
decisions on the subject are based is Ibrahim v. Rex[16], in which Lord Sumner said at pp.
609-610:

It has long been established as a positive
rule of English criminal law, that no statement by an accused is
admissible in evidence against him unless it is shewn by the
prosecution to have been a voluntary statement, in the sense that it has
not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage
exercised or held out by a person in authority. The principle is as old as Lord
Hale. The burden of proof in the matter has been decided by high authority in
recent times in Reg. v. Thompson, (1893) 2 Q.B. 12… (Emphasis
added)

It is of importance to note that in this passage
Lord Sumner does not qualify the word ‘statement’ in any way, but says that no
statement by an accused is admissible. In Boudreau, Rand J. said at
pp. 269-270:

The cases of Ibrahim v. Rex, (1914)
A.C. 599, Rex v. Voisin, (1918) 1 K.B. 531 and Rex v. Prosko, 63
S.C.R. 226, lay it down that the fundamental question is whether the statement
is voluntary. No doubt arrest and the presence of officers tend to arouse
apprehension which a warning may or may not suffice to remove, and the rule is
directed against the danger of improperly instigated or induced or coerced
admissions. It is the doubt cast on the truth of the statement arising from the
circumstances in which it is made that gives rise to the rule. What the statement
should be is that of a man free in volition from the compulsions or inducements
of authority and what is sought is assurance that that is the case. The
underlying and controlling question then remains: is the statement freely and
voluntarily made?

(Emphasis added)

A rule that exculpatory statements made to a
person in authority by an accused shall be subject on a voir dire to the
same requirements as inculpatory statements will not handicap the

[Page 38]

Crown. If the statement was given voluntarily,
it will be admitted: if not given voluntarily and the trial judge so rules, it
will not be admitted. The confusion which appears to have plagued trial judges
and appeal courts on the issue of inculpatory or exculpatory statements being
admissible with or without a voir dire appears to stem from a passage in
Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd ed. Wigmore concludes his discussion of the
matter by saying at p. 243:

Confessions are thus only one species of
admissions; and all other admissions than those which directly touch the fact
of guilt are without the scope of the peculiar rules affecting the use of
confessions.

Although Wigmore is an American author, the
courts of the United States have not followed his view on this important aspect
of the law of evidence. In Opper v. United States[17], Mr. Justice Reed, delivering
the judgment of the Supreme Court, after referring to the passage from Wigmore,
said:

It is urged by the Government, however,
that such requirement should not apply to exculpatory statements, that is,
those that explain actions rather than admit guilt. It is thought that
exculpatory statements do not have behind them the pressure of coercion or the
inducement of escaping the consequences of crime. This accords with Professor
Wigmore’s view. See note 7, supra. The statements here are exculpatory. See
summary, supra. There is no opinion of this Court declaring or declining such
an exception. We conclude that exculpatory statements, however, may not differ
from other admissions of incriminating facts. Given when the accused is under
suspicion, they become questionable just as testimony by witnesses to other
extrajudicial statements of the accused.

The same position was taken by Mr. Justice
Brennan in the Supreme Court in Wong Sun v. United States[18], when he said:

The Government also contends that Toy’s
declarations should be admissible because they were

[Page 39]

ostensibly exculpatory rather than
incriminating. There are two answers to this argument. First, the statements
soon turned out to be incriminating, for they led directly to the evidence
which implicated Toy. Second, when circumstances are shown such as those which
induced these declarations, it is immaterial whether the declarations be termed
‘exculpatory’. Thus we find no substantial reason to omit Toy’s declarations
from the protection of the exclusionary rule.

Of greater significance is the very recent
decision in the House of Lords in Commissioners of Customs and Excise v.
Harz et al.[19] In
that case, Harz was the central figure of an alleged conspiracy involving an
agreement to defraud the Department of Revenue by covering up the real amount
of trading in goods which were subject to purchase tax. The Crown wished to put
in as evidence statements made to customs officers as well as data extracted
from their books. The House of Lords held that under the statute involved the
officers had no right to submit the trader to interrogation. However, there
were very strong dicta concerning the common law position. Lord Reid at pp.
817-818 said:

Then it was argued that there is a
difference between confessions and admissions which fall short of a full
confession… But there appears to be no English case for more than a century in
which an admission induced by a threat or promise has been admitted in evidence
where a full confession would have been excluded… I can see no justification in
principle for the distinction. In similar circumstances one man induced by a
threat makes a full confession and another induced by the same threat makes one
or more incriminating admissions. Unless the law is to be reduced to a mere
collection of unrelated rules, I see no distinction between these cases. And it
is noteworthy that the new Judges’ Rules published in 1964 (Home Office
Circular No. 31/1964, p. 5) make no such distinction. They are clear and
emphatic:

…(e) That it is a fundamental condition of
the admissibility in evidence against any person, equally of any oral answer
given by that person

[Page 40]

to a question put by a police officer, or
of any statement (my italics) made by that person that it shall have
been voluntary in the sense that it has not been obtained from him by fear of
prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority
or by oppression. The principle set out in paragraph (e) above is overriding
and applicable in all cases.

The above paragraph “(e)” taken from the Judges’
Rules is quoted verbatim in Phipson on Evidence, 11th ed., 1970,
para. 791, p. 349, and the learned author continues by saying:

The classic formulation of the principle
applicable to the admissibility of confessions appears in Lord Sumner’s speech
in Ibrahim v. R. (1914) A.C. 599 at pp. 609-10. “It has long been
established as a positive rule of English criminal law that no statement by an
accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it is shown by the
prosecution to have been a voluntary statement in the sense that it had not
been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage
exercised or held out by a person in authority. The principle is as old as
Hale.”

Lord Reid also discussed the landmark case of Ibrahim
v. The King and noted that it made no distinction between
confessions and admissions. That case held that no statement is
admissible unless made voluntarily. Phipson emphasizes this fact in footnote 5
on p. 349 where he says: “Note, too, the principle formulated by Lord
Sumner commences with the words ‘no statement’…”

On the basis that there is no distinction to be
drawn between inculpatory and exculpatory statements as such in so far as their
admissibility in evidence when tendered by the Crown is concerned, I would
allow the appeal and restore the verdict of acquittal rendered by the jury.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA,
APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Non-capital
murder—Defences—Provocation—Drunkenness—Finding that legal tests of defences
not met—Finding that there was a loss of self-control—Conviction of manslaughter
not justified—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 201, 203, 417.

The appellant was charged with the
non-capital murder of his common law wife, by strangulation. Provocation and
drunkenness were the basic defences raised. The trial judge, who dealt with the
charge without a jury, rejected the defence of provocation, as he found that
the words attributed to the victim and relied on by the accused were not of
such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary

[Page 197]

person of the power of self-control. He also
rejected the defence of drunkenness, as he found that it did not render the
appellant incapable of forming the specific intent to kill. However, he
convicted him of the lesser offence of manslaughter because he found that the
combination of the two factors was sufficient to make the appellant lose his
self-control. On an appeal by the Crown, the Court of Appeal substituted a
verdict of non-capital murder. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held (Hall,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.: The Court of Appeal
has rightly held that the trial judge made an error in law in holding that the
combination of the defence of provocation and the defence of drunkenness,
neither of which he found to be a defence in itself on the facts of the case,
constituted a defence to the charge of non-capital murder. When the trial judge
found that the words attributed to the victim and relied on by the appellant
were not of such a nature as to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control, that was the end of the matter so far as the defence of
provocation was concerned. Any further inquiry with respect to provocation
became of no moment. When the trial judge also found that the appellant was not
incapacitated by drunkenness to form the intent to kill, the fact that the mind
of the appellant was found to be affected by drink so that he lost control and
more readily gave way to some violent passion, did not rebut the presumption
that, by applying pressure on the throat of the victim to the point of leaving
marks on her neck, he had intended to kill her. The error of the trial judge,
as was pointed out in the Court of Appeal, permeated and governed what he said
as to intent. In this error of law lies the ratio decidendi of his
verdict. In the circumstances of this case, there is no justification to
disturb the verdict entered by the Court of Appeal pursuant to s. 592(4)
of the Code.

Per Hall,
Spence and Laskin JJ., dissenting: The trial judge clearly rejected
provocation and drunkenness as defences. But he came to the conclusion that the
appellant was not guilty of non-capital murder because of his finding of lack
of intent. Having said that there was a loss of self-control, he went on to
consider whether there was the requisite intent to underpin a conviction of
non-capital murder. How-

[Page 198]

ever, he misdirected himself on the law on
this issue, when he ignored the prescription of intent, sufficient to support a
charge of murder, as including an intent to cause bodily harm that the accused
knows is likely to cause death and he is reckless whether death ensues or not.
There should be a new trial for non-capital murder.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of Alberta, Appellate Division, setting aside a conviction of manslaughter and
substituting thereto a verdict of non-capital murder. Appeal dismissed, Hall,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting.

Oskar H. Kruger, for the appellant.

B.A. Crane, for the respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux C.J. and of Abbott,
Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The appellant was charged with
having, on or about the 30th day of July 1968, at the City of Edmonton, in the
province of Alberta, unlawfully killed and slain Eileen Perrault, his
common-law wife, thereby committing the offence of non-capital murder. On the
9th of March 1969, he was convicted of the lesser offence of manslaughter by
Déchêne J., sitting without a jury as permitted by s. 417 of the Criminal
Code.

On the appeal of the Attorney-General of the
province, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, by a
unanimous judgment, set aside this conviction and substituted thereto a verdict
of non-capital murder.

Perrault now appeals from this decision,
pursuant to s. 597(2)(a) Cr. Code. Under this section, the appeal, from
the judgment a quo, is strictly limited to pure questions of law.

The issue is a simple one. The facts relevant
thereto may be briefly stated.

The appellant and Eileen Perrault lived
together, as man and wife, at the apartment of the latter, for nearly two
years. The appellant wanted to marry her and build a home. Some few weeks

[Page 199]

prior to Tuesday the 30th of July 1968, the day
of the fatal occurrence, they separated but, nonetheless, continued to consort
with one another. On Monday, the 29th, after having visited the mother of the
victim from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., they went to the Dover Hotel until 8 p.m. and
then to the Bonaventure Hotel, until closing time. At both places, they played
a few games of shuffleboard and each one consumed several glasses of beer. At
midnight, they arrived at the apartment. They then had a conversation during
which slightly less than two bottles of beer were consumed. The relevant parts
of this conversation which was brought to an end by the death of the woman,
appear in the following quotations from two statements made the same day by
Perrault to the police and from the evidence he gave at the trial.

In the first statement:

I recall Eileen asking me to go and get
some cigarettes and I said ‘what am I some kind of slave or something’ and then
she was on the floor and my hands were around her neck. After that I used the
belt.

In the second statement:

We had a couple of bottles of beer at home…
I am not too sure how many… but I recall sitting on the foot-stool arguing with
Eileen and the next thing I remember I had the belt around her neck. In the
three weeks that we’ve been separated I have felt that if I can’t have her
nobody else will.

In his evidence at trial:

A. Well at one point during our
conversation I recall telling Eileen that the previous weekend I had taken the
car and said I was going to kill myself and use the car to do it. I said if I
couldn’t live with her I didn’t want to live.

Q. Yes, any further conversation that you
recall?

A. She said something about if you want to
kill somebody why don’t you go to Vietnam where they have got a war on, she
said you haven’t got the guts to kill anybody.

Q. What happened then Mr. Perrault?

A. I don’t remember.

[Page 200]

Q. What is your next recollection of the
events of that evening.

A. I remember taking a belt from around
Eileen’s neck.

He testified that he then endeavoured to
resuscitate the woman by mouth-to-mouth respiration, that he awoke Délia
Cousineau, a room-mate of the deceased, telephoned the police, told them what
he had done and asked them for an ambulance.

The learned trial judge found that appellant
killed Eileen Perrault by strangulation. It is not disputed that appellant
first applied his hands to the throat of his victim, then took off the belt he
was wearing, wound it around her neck and applied a pressure which left marks
of ligature and resulted in death.

Provocation and drunkenness were the basic defences
raised by the accused.

With respect to provocation, the trial judge
held:

The test is not whether this (the words
attributed to the victim and relied on by the accused, at trial) deprived this
accused of his self-control, but whether it is sufficient to deprive an
ordinary person of the power of self-control. We must go further and must show
that the accused acted upon it on the sudden and before there was time for his
passion to cool. That by itself, in my view, does not in this case constitute a
defence because I don’t think the provocation was of that type.

With respect to drunkenness, the trial judge
found that:

…his state of intoxication, which, while
not slight, was far from an extreme case…

As to both defences, he concluded:

In the view that I take, it is my opinion
that neither of these defences by itself is available to the accused on the
facts of this case.

Thus, on the facts of the case, the trial judge
found that the legal test of validity of a defence of provocation, stated in
s. 203 Cr. C., had not been met, in that, particularly, the words
attributed to the victim and relied on by the accused were not of such a nature
as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control.
Thus, also, on the facts of the case, the

[Page 201]

trial judge found that the legal test of a valid
defence of drunkenness had not been met. The test is embodied in the two
well-known propositions of Lord Birkenhead, in Director of Public
Prosecutions v. Beard[1]:

That evidence of drunkenness which renders
the accused incapable of forming the specific intent essential to constitute
the crime should be taken into consideration with the other facts proved in
order to determine whether or not he had this intent.

That evidence of drunkenness falling short
of a proved incapacity in the accused to form the intent necessary to
constitute the crime, and merely establishing that his mind was affected by
drink so that he more readily gave way to some violent passion, does not rebut
the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his acts.

However, having so found on the facts, the
learned trial judge went on to say:

In my view, the combination of that
provocation however slight, and his consumption of alcohol, his state of
intoxication, while not slight, was far from an extreme case, those two factors
were sufficient that he lost his self-control. That he did not intend to cause
the death I think is shown by his actions immediately after. He woke Delia and
said: ‘Come and see what I have done to Eileen’. He phoned the police and told
them that there was a strangled woman there and that he had done it, he wanted
an ambulance and the police. His statement to Constable Hollinshead when that
constable arrived and he says: ‘I am the bastard that did it’. His action in
endeavouring to resuscitate her with mouth-to-mouth respiration, in my view all
indicate that he suddenly realized the enormity of his act and lead me to
believe that he did not intend the result which ensued.

* *
*

and the trial judge concluded his reasons by
saying:

Looking at the case therefor in its entirety I
have come to the conclusion that the Crown have failed

[Page 202]

to satisfy me beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused intended the death of the deceased and I therefore do not find him
guilty of non-capital murder as charged. However, it appears clear that the
culpable homicide which he has committed is within the definition of
manslaughter and I find him guilty of that offence.

(The italics are mine.)

In the view of the Court of Appeal, the trial
judge made an error in law in thus holding that the combination of the defence
of provocation and the defence of drunkenness, neither of which he found to be
a defence in itself on the facts of the case, constituted a defence to the charge
of non-capital murder. With this view of the Court of Appeal, I am in
respectful agreement.

The trial judge having found, particularly, that
the words attributed to the victim and relied on by the accused were not of
such a nature as to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control,
that was the end of the matter so far as the defence of provocation was
concerned; for, under s. 203 Cr. C., the words of provocation are to be
assessed according to the effect they would have on a reasonable man and when
this objective test is found not to have been met on the facts of the case, any
further enquiry with respect to provocation becomes of no moment.

The trial judge having also found that the
accused was not incapacitated by drunkenness to form the intent to kill the
woman, the fact that the mind of the accused was found to be affected by drink
so that he lost control and more readily gave way to some violent passion, did
not rebut the presumption that, by applying pressure, first with his hands and
then with his belt, on the throat of the victim, to the point of leaving on her
neck marks of ligature, he intended to kill her or, to say the least,—a point
which the trial judge failed to consider though, had he done so, the result
must be expected to have been the same,—he intended to cause her bodily harm
known to him to be likely to cause death and being reckless whether death
ensued or not.

[Page 203]

In Attorney General for Northern Ireland v.
Gallagher[2], the
law on drunkenness as a defence to a crime is restated in these terms by Lord
Denning, at pp. 380 and 381:

(a) It may impair a man’s
powers of perception so that he may not be able to foresee or measure the
consequences of his actions as he would if he were sober. Nevertheless he is
not allowed to set up his self-induced want of perception as a defence. Even if
he did not himself appreciate that what he was doing was dangerous,
nevertheless if a reasonable man in his place, who was not befuddled with
drink, would have appreciated it, he is guilty: see Rex v. Meade (1909) 1 K.B.
895, as explained in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard (supra).

(b) It may impair a man’s power to
judge between right or wrong, so that he may do a thing when drunk which he
would not dream of doing while sober. He does not realize he is doing wrong.
Nevertheless he is not allowed to set up his self-induced want of moral sense
as a defence. In Beard’s case (supra) Lord Birkenhead L.C. distinctly ruled
that it was not a defence for a drunken man to say he did not know he was doing
wrong.

(c) It may impair a man’s power of
self-control so that he may more readily give way to provocation than if he
were sober. Nevertheless he is not allowed to set up his self‑induced
want of control as a defence. The acts of provocation are to be assessed, not
according to their effect on him personally, but according to the effect they
would have on a reasonable man in his place. The law on this point was
previously in doubt (see the cases considered in Beard’s case), but it has
since been resolved by Reg. v. McCarthy (1954) 38 C.A.R. 74, Bedder v. Director
of Public Prosecutions (1954) 38 C.A.R. 133, and section 3 of the Homicide
Act, 1957.

Lord Denning then indicated that the general
principle of English law as to drunkenners, illustrated as above in (a),
(b) and (c), is subject to two exceptions which, in my
opinion, in view of the finding of facts in this case, have no application in
this instance.

[Page 204]

I cannot convince myself that the error of the
trial judge, which was pointed out in the Court of Appeal, does not permeate
and govern what, as above indicated, he said, as to intent, either in the
reasons he gave to render a verdict of manslaughter or in what he said
thereafter in proceeding to sentence the accused. In this error of law lies the
ratio decidendi of the verdict of the trial judge.

Section 592(4) of the Criminal Code provides
that

(4) Where an appeal is from an acquittal
the court of appeal may

(a) dismiss the appeal; or

(b) allow the appeal, set aside the
verdict and

(i) enter a verdict of guilty with respect
to the offence of which, in its opinion, the accused should have been found
guilty but for the error in law, and pass a sentence that is warranted in law,
or

(ii) order a new trial.

Pursuant to that section, the Court of Appeal
allowed the appeal, set aside the verdict and entered a verdict of guilty with
respect to the offence of non-capital murder of which, in its opinion, the
accused should have been found guilty but for the above error in law.

Under all the circumstances of this case, I am
unable to find any justification to disturb the unanimous conclusion arrived at
in the Court of Appeal. I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Hall, Spence and Laskin JJ. was
delivered by

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—In allowing the
Crown’s appeal against the acquittal of the accused of non-capital murder, and
in itself entering a conviction on that charge (in place of the conviction at
trial of manslaughter), the Alberta Appellate Division founded itself on an
alleged error of law by the trial judge which, even if it occurred, was not, in
my view, at the heart of his ruling of acquittal. There was a proper ground
upon which the acquittal should have been set aside, but it was a ground not
taken by the

[Page 205]

Appellate Division and, moreover, it was one
which called for a new trial and not for a conviction on the original charge.

I am confirmed in this appraisal by the Crown’s
notice of appeal to the Alberta Appellate Division as well as by the reasons of
the trial judge. Only two grounds of appeal were taken by the Crown in
challenging the acquittal of non-capital murder, and they were as follows:

The learned trial Judge erred in law in
misdirecting himself, to the effect that the Respondent’s loss of self control
was a factor, when it did not amount to provocation.

The learned trial Judge erred in law in
failing to direct himself to consider the question whether the Respondent meant
to cause bodily harm to the deceased that he knew was likely to cause her
death, and was reckless whether death ensued or not.

The reasons of the Appellate Division were, I am
bound to say, unusually brief. They consisted of six sentences of which three
were what might properly be called formal. The substance of the reasons was in
the remaining three sentences which were these:

The learned trial judge found that neither
the defence of provocation nor of drunkenness taken by itself was available to
the accused on the facts of the case.

Notwithstanding these findings, he held
there was a combination of provocation and drunkenness and accordingly found
the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.

In our view, he made an error in law in
holding that a combination of these two defences, neither of which was a
defence in itself, constituted a defence to the charge of non-capital murder.

The trial judge who dealt with the charge of
non-capital murder without a jury (pursuant to the election or consent of the
accused as permitted in Alberta under s. 417 of the Criminal Code)
did clearly reject provocation and drunkenness as defences. To this extent, the
Appellate

[Page 206]

Division was correct. But just as clearly the
trial judge came to the conclusion that he did because of his finding of lack
of intent. I think the Appellate Division took too great a liberty of
construction of the single sentence in the trial judge’s reasons where he said
that the facts upon which the defences of provocation and drunkenness were
posited were sufficient to show a loss of self-control. Earlier in his reasons
he had adverted to the question of intent as the distinguishing element between
murder and manslaughter. Having said that there was a loss of self-control, he
went on to consider whether there was the requisite intent to underpin a
conviction of non-capital murder.

I think that he misdirected himself on the law
on this issue, as the Crown in its notice of appeal to the Appellate Division
pointed out. But on his assessment of the facts he concluded that there was no
intent to cause death. He summed up his review of the evidence in these words:

Looking at the case therefore in its
entirety I have come to the conclusion that the Crown have failed to
satisfy me beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended the death of the
deceased… (The underlining is mine.)

In the result, he acquitted of non-capital
murder and convicted of manslaughter.

Were it not for the error of law on the question
of intent, the finding of the trial judge on this issue would not alone have
given the Crown a right of appeal: see Criminal Code, s. 584 (1) (a).
The reasons at the trial also disclose a serious error against the accused in
the statement that “in law everyone is presumed to intend the natural and
reasonable consequences of his act”, but in view of the trial judge’s verdict,
this misdirection had no adverse effect.

Nothing said by the trial judge appears to me to
justify the Appellate Division’s assertion that “notwithstanding these findings
[against the defences of provocation or drunkenness], he held there was a
combination of provocation and

[Page 207]

drunkenness and accordingly found the
accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter”. (The underlining is
mine.) This is a far too selective piece of interpretation which ignores the
considerable portion of the reasons that concentrated on the issue of intent.
The evidence may very well have supported a finding of the requisite intent,
but I do not think that it was open to the Appellate Division on the record in
this case to make that finding on the appeal that was before it. Indeed, I am
of the opinion that the Appellate Division ought to have treated the verdict
rendered by the trial judge alone with at least as much respect as it would
accord to the verdict of a jury in a like case. Had it done so, it could not
have substituted another verdict of its own for that of the trial judge on what
is essentially a matter of fact.

It is necessary, of course, in cases where
drunkenness is raised as a defence, or where on the evidence it may be a
defence, to a charge of murder, to avoid confusing the effect of drunkenness on
the capacity to form the requisite intent with the question whether there was
such intent in fact. The rejection of the one (that is, as a defence) does not
automatically result in the establishment of the other. The distinction is
evident in the opposing views taken in the judgments of this Court in The
Queen v. Lupien[3], where
the issue revolved around the admissibility of certain psychiatric evidence,
and turned on whether, on one view of the evidence, it went to show that the
accused was mentally incapable of forming the intent to commit a homosexual
offence or whether, on another view, it was offered to show that he did form
the intent in that case.

In the present case, the trial judge left
drunkenness (as referable to capacity to form the requisite intent) behind when
he rejected it as a defence; and, in going on to deal with intent in fact, he
was concerned with a different issue. It may be that his literary expression
was deficient, but there can be no mistaking the burden of his remarks. Crown
counsel certainly did not mistake

[Page 208]

them if regard is had to the formulation of his
notice of appeal to the Appellate Division. He was, I may note, counsel for the
Crown at the trial.

I referred earlier to the trial judge’s error of
law on the question of intent, an error which removed a possible prop of the
Crown’s case. What he said on the matter was this (and I may say here that the
same appreciation of intent was repeated in other portions of the reasons):

If the acts of the accused which caused the
death were done with the intention of causing that death or were done
recklessly without any regard as to whether death followed or not, then it is
murder.

It is evident from this that the trial judge
ignored the prescription of intent, sufficient to support a charge of murder,
as including an intent to cause bodily harm that the accused knows is likely to
cause death and he is reckless whether death ensues or not: see
s. 201(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code. If it be said that despite the
inapt formulation he must undoubtedly have had the correct principles in mind,
we are left with a finding of fact which, on the view of the matter I have
taken, would deprive the Appellate Division of the power to interfere. I think I
should in this case take the trial judge at his word.

For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the
appeal and direct a new trial for non-capital murder.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Joint
trial—Evidence—Admissibility—Accused not calling evidence—Co‑accused
testifying and implicating accused—Admissibility against accused of that
evidence.

The two appellants were tried jointly with E
on counts of breaking and entering and of being in possession of stolen
property. At the close of the case for the prosecution, counsel for the
appellants moved for a dismissal on the ground that there was no evidence. The
magistrate denied the motion. Thereupon counsel for the appellants moved for
acquittal on the ground that there was insufficient evidence and announced that
no evidence would be called on behalf of these two appellants. The magistrate
reserved decision on this motion, stating that he would deal with it when he
had heard all the evidence. The case proceeded. Counsel for the appellants took
no further part in the trial except in the argument at the close of the case. E
gave evidence tending to exonerate himself, but which im-

[Page 261]

plicated the appellants. He was acquitted on
the ground that his explanation had raised a reasonable doubt. The magistrate
ruled that E’s evidence implicating the appellants was not receivable as
against them as they had elected to call no evidence, and he acquitted them. On
an appeal by the Crown, the Court of Appeal ordered a new trial. The accused
appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.: The
situation at the close of the case for the prosecution was that there was ample
evidence upon which the magistrate could have convicted all. three accused. In
such a situation, where two or more accused are jointly indicted, the case is
not concluded until all the evidence is in. All the testimony heard throughout
the trial is evidence for or against each accused. R. v. MacDonald (1962),
38 C.R. 104, was wrongly decided.

Per Laskin J.:
A joint trial, once properly in course, is not terminable by any one of the
accused at the close of the Crown’s case in chief when he thinks it to be to
his advantage not to run the risk of having damaging testimony given by his
co-accused. If any co-accused gives evidence, it takes effect under the tests
ordinarily applicable to the evidence of a witness. There is no rule of its
legal inadmissibility against an accused who has himself decided not to put in
a defence. The fact that he closes his case after the Crown’s evidence in chief
does not mean that he can thereby convert a joint trial into a trial of himself
alone. A co-accused may not limit the effect of relevant and admissible
evidence which his co-accused volunteers as a witness in making his defence.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[1],
ordering a new trial on charges of breaking and entering and unlawful
possession of stolen goods. Appeal dismissed.

[Page 262]

The judgment of Fauteux C.J. and of Abbott,
Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

HALL J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia1 whereby the acquittal of the
appellants who were tried jointly with one Ellsworth by Magistrate Bewley in
Vancouver on counts of breaking and entering and of being in possession of
stolen property, knowing that the same had been stolen, was set aside and a new
trial ordered.

The evidence adduced by the Crown showed that
sometime after 10:00 p.m. on October 10, 1968, and prior to 1:00 a.m., October
11, 1968, the premises of Ornamental Bronze Company Limited in Vancouver had
been broken into and entered and a quantity of bronze ingots, tools and an
adding machine had been stolen from the premises. At approximately 1:30 a.m. on
October 11th police officers on patrol noticed a motor vehicle proceeding along
a street in Vancouver with its lights out. The rear end of the vehicle appeared
to be heavily weighted down. The officers stopped the vehicle which was being
driven by Ellsworth. The appellants were passengers in the vehicle, both
sitting in the front seat and to the right of Ellsworth. An adding machine was
found on the back seat of the vehicle and a tool chest, some tools and a
quantity of bronze ingots were found in the trunk. These were identified as the
property which had been stolen from the Ornamental Bronze Company Limited
premises after 10:00 p.m. the preceding evening. The appellants offered no
explanation when found with Ellsworth in possession of the stolen property.

The trial proceeded against the three accused
jointly. At the close of the case for the prosecution counsel for the
appellants moved for a dismissal of the charges and for acquittal of the
appellants on the ground that there was no evidence before the Court upon which
the two appellants could be convicted. The learned magistrate denied the
motion. Thereupon counsel for the appellants moved for acquittal on the ground

[Page 263]

that there was insufficient evidence on which
the appellants could be convicted and announced to the Court that no evidence
would be called on behalf of these two appellants. The learned magistrate
reserved decision on this motion, stating he would deal with it when he had
heard all the evidence. The case proceeded. Counsel for the appellants took no
further part in the trial except in the argument at the close of the case.
Ellsworth gave evidence tending to exonerate himself, but which implicated the
appellants. The learned magistrate acquitted Ellsworth on the ground that his
explanation had raised a reasonable doubt. He ruled that Ellsworth’s evidence
implicating the appellants was not receivable as against the appellants who had
earlier elected to call no evidence, and he acquitted the appellants on the
grounds that the Crown had not led sufficient evidence, excluding that of
Ellsworth, on which guilt could be established beyond a reasonable doubt. He
considered himself bound by the judgment of Schultz Co. Ct.J. in Regina v.
MacDonald et al.[2].

The appeal from the order for a new trial cannot
succeed. Regina v. MacDonald was wrongly decided. Here the situation at
the close of the case for the prosecution was that there was ample evidence upon
which the learned magistrate could have convicted all three accused. The
circumstances given in evidence of the three accused being in possession of the
stolen property were such that some explanation by the appellants was called
for. Ellsworth offered an explanation. The appellants said nothing. The vehicle
they were in was loaded with stolen property, the adding machine being in plain
view on the rear seat. Any ruling by the magistrate that there was no evidence
before him upon which he might convict would have been erroneous in law.
Counsel for the appellants accepts this in his submission. This being so there
could be no basis for a directed verdict of acquittal at that stage of the
trial.

The appellants relied on the case of Rex v.
Power[3],
but the case is of no assistance to them. Darling J. who spoke for the
Court in Power,

[Page 264]

referring to that case in R. v. Hogan[4], said at p. 183:
“I did not say that whenever a defendant submitted that there was no case and
took no further part in the trial the judge must withdraw the case from the
jury.” The appellants also relied on Regina v. Abbott[5], but that case has no
application to the present appeal. In Abbott there was at the close of
the case for the prosecution no evidence upon which Abbott, one of two
co-accused charged with forgery, could be convicted, and, in fact, the evidence
for the prosecution negatived his participation in the crime. The trial judge
on an application to withdraw the case from the jury for want of any evidence
implicating Abbott refused to do so. The trial proceeded and the co-accused
gave evidence implicating Abbott. The jury convicted. The Court of Criminal
Appeal set aside Abbott’s conviction. That is a different situation from the
present one. Here there was at the close of the case for the prosecution
evidence upon which the learned magistrate could have convicted. In such a
situation, where two or more accused are jointly indicted, the case is not
concluded until all the evidence is in. All the testimony heard throughout the
trial is evidence for or against each accused.

The appeal should accordingly be dismissed.

LASKIN J.—I agree with my brother Hall that the
appeal fails. The principle invoked by the appellants is that whether an
accused be tried alone or jointly with others, he has the same right in the
latter case as in the former, once he elects not to put in a defence, to have
his guilt or innocence determined on the sufficiency of the Crown’s case
against him in chief, and he may therefore insist that the trier of fact
dispose of the charge against him without regard to any implicating evidence
subsequently given by a co-accused.

[Page 265]

The principle is misconceived in respect of a
joint trial, especially where, as here, no question is in issue as to the
propriety of the joinder. Section 4(1) of the Canada Evidence Act declares
that an accused person is a competent witness whether charged solely or jointly
with any other witness. A joint trial, once properly in course, is not
terminable by any one of the accused at the close of the Crown’s case in chief
when he thinks it to be to his advantage not to run the risk of having damaging
testimony given by his co-accused. On the contrary, if any co-accused gives
evidence, it takes effect under the tests ordinarily applicable to the evidence
of a witness. There is no rule of its legal inadmissibility against an accused
who has himself decided not to put in a defence.

The fact that he closes his case after the
Crown’s evidence in chief does not mean that he can thereby convert a joint
trial into a trial of himself alone. This view, adverse to the appellants, goes
to the very considerations that make a joint trial proper. If proper, it must
run its course as to all who are involved in it, so far as concerns the issues
and the evidence touching any of the co-accused, each of whom is, by his
choice, a competent witness in the joint trial.

Although the Crown cannot compel an accused to
testify at his trial, this does not mean that a co-accused may limit the effect
of relevant and admissible evidence which that accused volunteers as a witness
in making his defence.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Trials—Abuse of
process—Oppression—Charge of possession of cheques adapted and intended to be
used to commit forgery—Acquittal—Subsequent charge of conspiring to utter same
cheques—Plea of “autrefois acquit” disallowed—Discretion to stay second
indictment.

The respondent was indicted on a charge of
having had in his possession seven cheques and other papers that were adapted
and intended to be used to commit forgery. In September 1966, he was acquitted
on a directed verdict. The basis for the directed verdict was that the
forgeries were complete so that the cheques could not be held to be adapted or
intended to be used to commit forgery. An appeal by the Crown was dismissed. In
May 1967, the respondent was indicted on a charge of conspiring with a person
or persons unknown to commit the indictable offence of uttering the same seven
forged cheques. At the opening of this second trial, a plea of “autrefois
acquit” was entered. Counsel for the respondent also urged upon the trial judge
that he had a discretion to stay the indictment on the ground that the
proceedings were oppressive and an abuse of the process of the Court. The trial
judge disallowed the special plea and convicted the respondent. The Court of
Appeal directed a verdict of acquittal to be entered on the ground that the
trial judge should have exercised his discretion by staying the second
indictment because it was so oppressive as to constitute an abuse of the process
of the Court. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.

Per Fauteux
J.: The appeal should be allowed.

Per Martland,
Judson and Pigeon JJ.: There does not exist in our criminal law a rule that in
the case of a multiplicity of charges successively made on

[Page 185]

the same facts, a trial judge has discretion
to stay an indictment when, on all the facts of the case, laying it is
considered as an injustice amounting to oppression. The duty of the Courts is
to apply the law as it exists. There is no legal basis for holding that
criminal remedies are subject to the rule that they are to be refused whenever
in its discretion, a Court considers the prosecution oppressive. In our legal
system, it is not considered unfair or oppressive to have an accused undergo
several trials on the same charge when his conviction is quashed even if this
happens repeatedly. A different view should not be taken if the error consists
in not laying the correct charge so that instead of being irregularly convicted
and then ordered to stand a new trial, the accused is acquitted of the
incorrect charge and then brought to second trial on a fresh indictment for the
correct charge.

Per Ritchie,
Hall and Spence JJ.: The question of whether or not the Court has jurisdiction
to intervene to prevent an abuse of its process does not fall to be decided
because there was here no evidence to support the conclusion of the Court of
Appeal that there was oppression. The Court of Appeal placed undue weight on
the long delay and the Crown’s intervening appeal. The exercise of its right to
appeal cannot be considered as oppression on the part of the Crown. It is a
right given by statute. In respect of the delay, the record clearly shows that
such delays as did occur were principally attributable to the accused and not
to the Crown. The Court of Appeal was therefore wrong in concluding that the
trial judge should have stayed the proceedings and was also wrong in
interfering with the discretion he exercised in that regard.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], acquitting the
respondent of a charge of conspiring to utter forged cheques. Appeal allowed.

C.M. Powell and Archie Campbell, for the
appellant.

C.G. Stewart McKeown and David R.G.
Griner, for the respondent.

[Page 186]

FAUTEUX J.—I agree that the appeal should be
allowed.

The judgment of Martland, Judson and Pigeon JJ.
was delivered by

PIGEON J.—The facts of this case are stated as
follows in the reasons of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1.

On November 23rd, 1965, the appellant, Frederick
John Osborn, while being followed by an officer, was seen to throw an envelope
from the window of an automobile. In the envelope were found seven forged
cheques fully made out to various payees and endorsed. The cheques were
complete save as to the dates on them. Also in the envelope were two pieces of
paper giving the names of payees, together with the addresses of certain banks
and some account numbers. At his trial, the appellant testified that he was
directed to the envelope in a cache by one “Frank” who instructed him to cash
the cheques in return for one third of the proceeds but that, after only
glancing at the contents of the envelope, he had resolved not to cash any of
the cheques. There was no other evidence connecting the appellant with the
forgery of the cheques.

In November, 1965, the appellant was indicted on
a charge that, knowingly and without lawful authority or excuse, he had in his
possession certain writings, to wit: seven cheques and two pieces of paper that
were adapted and intended to be used to commit forgery, contrary to the
Criminal Code, Section 312(b).

After a two day trial with a jury in September,
1966, the appellant was acquitted on a directed verdict. It would appear the
basis for the directed verdict was that the forgeries were complete so that the
cheques could not be held to be adapted or intended to be used to commit
forgery.

An appeal by the Crown was dismissed.

In May, 1967, the appellant was indicted on a
charge of conspiring with a person or persons unknown to commit the indictable
offence of uttering seven forged cheques.

At the opening of the second trial in January,
1968, the special defence of autrefois acquit was disallowed by the trial
judge. Counsel for the appellant also urged upon the trial judge that he had a
discretion to stay the indictment on the ground that the proceedings were
oppressive and an abuse of

[Page 187]

the process of the Court. No express ruling was
made by the trial judge as to whether he considered he had such a discretionary
power and, after disallowing the plea of autrefois, he simply directed the
trial to proceed. The appellant was convicted.

Appeal is taken to this Court on the sole ground
that the trial judge had a discretion to stay or dismiss the indictment on the
ground that it was so oppressive and vexatious as to amount to an abuse of the
process of the Court and that such discretion should have been exercised in
favour of the appellant.

After referring especially to speeches in Connelly
v. Director of Public Prosecutions[2], Jessup
J.A., speaking for the Court, said:

In civil law the doctrine of res
judicata occupies the same place as the plea of autrefois does in
the criminal law. But apart from res judicata and Rule 126 the Courts of
this Province have from earliest times invoked an inherent jurisdiction to
prevent the abuse of their process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings.
The principle on which they have acted is stated by Lord Watson in Haggard
v. Pelicier Frères, (1892) A.C. 61…

* * *

I am unable to recognize any basis or
principle on which such inherent jurisdiction is confined to the civil side of
the Courts or why it cannot be invoked to abate oppression caused by a
multiplicity of charges successively made on the same facts by a private or
Crown prosecutor…

I am not prepared to hold that in the
absence of special circumstances the laying of a second indictment upon the
same facts is simpliciter and in all cases productive of such injustice as to
invoke the Court’s inherent jurisdiction. Everything depends on all the facts
of the case. The discretion is to be exercised in favour of an accused only
where a real injustice will otherwise result and such a case should be rare. It
should always be invoked before arraignment on the indictment alleged to be
oppressive and cannot be raised after trial on such indictment. Here, however,
I think that the long delay coupled with the Crown’s intervening appeal results
in unjust oppressiveness from the second indictment.

With deference, this reasoning is erroneous. The
starting point appears to be that in civil mat-

[Page 188]

ters there is admittedly an inherent
jurisdiction to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court through
oppressive or vexatious proceedings. The case cited to support that assertion, Haggard
v. Pelicier Frères[3], is
indeed concerned with a question of jurisdiction, the matter under
consideration being the contention that the defendant had incurred liability
towards the plaintiff in summarily dismissing a case as vexatious because in so
doing he had allegedly acted without jurisdiction.

In the instant case, it does not appear to me
that I need consider whether the trial judge had jurisdiction to make the order
that the Court of Appeal held he should have made. The real problem, in my
view, is whether there exists in our criminal law a rule that in the case of a
multiplicity of charges successively made on the same facts, a trial judge has
discretion to stay an indictment when, on all the facts of the case, laying it
is considered as an injustice amounting to oppression. In this Court as in the
Court of Appeal, counsel have been unable to cite any case in Canada where such a discretionary rule has
been recognized or acted upon other than the obiter dictum of Mackay
J.A. in Regina v. LeClair[4].

Concerning the opinions expressed in Connelly
v. Director of Public Prosecutions, it is essential to observe that the
basis of the difficulty in that case was a most important difference between
our criminal law and the criminal law of England in force at that time. Lord Reid said (at p. 1295):

Ever since the passing of the Criminal
Appeal Act, 1908, Parliament has persistently refused to permit a retrial in
respect of the same offence after a verdict of guilty has been quashed on any
ground by the Court of Criminal Appeal. Refusal to allow a new trial has always
been put on the ground of fairness to the accused and I cannot see why, if it
is unfair to allow a retrial for the same offence, it is fair to allow a fresh
trial on the same facts merely because the offence now charged is different.

[Page 189]

In this country, Parliament’s conception of
fairness has always been, on the contrary, that when a conviction is quashed
(Cr. Code, sec. 592(2)) a new trial can be ordered instead of an acquittal
and such is always the order made except in special circumstances.

It is clear that the new “rule of practice”
requiring the inclusion in a single indictment of all charges arising out of
the same facts, that was proposed in Connelly by Lord Devlin and agreed
to by Lord Pearce and Lord Reid, was motivated exclusively by the desire of
avoiding in the future the anomalous result noted by the latter in the passage
above quoted. Everyone, including Lord Devlin, agreed that this new rule, being
a “rule of practice”, should not be applied to the case at hand. Consequently,
it was unanimously decided that there had been no unfairness to the appellant
in trying and convicting him of robbery after his conviction for a murder
committed in the robbery had been quashed for misdirection, the charges of
murder and of robbery having been preferred in separate indictments in
accordance with the practice followed at the time. In thus upholding a strict
application of autrefois acquit in spite of the fact that in reality it
deprived the accused of the benefit of the statutory rule against retrials, the
majority who expressed themselves in favor of a new rule for future cases, did
not in effect differ from the view of the others as to the proper conclusion in
the absence of such a rule. The statutory principle motivating that rule in England having no counterpart in our
criminal law, the views expressed as to the state of the law apart from the
existence of such a rule appear properly applicable to our circumstances. Lord
Morris said (at pp. 1301-1302 and 1304):

The power (which is inherent in a court’s
jurisdiction) to prevent abuses of its process and to control its own procedure
must in a criminal court include a power to safeguard an accused person from
oppression or prejudice. That power, as is demonstrated by a stream of
authority to which I will refer, has, however, never been regarded as endowing
a court with a power to say that evidence given in reference to one charge may
not be repeated in reference to another and different charge. Nor does it
enable a court to order that a prosecution be dropped merely because of some
rather imprecise regret that an accused should have to face another charge…

[Page 190]

It would, in my judgment, be an unfortunate
innovation if it were held that the power of a court to prevent any abuse of
its process or to ensure compliance with correct procedure enabled a judge to
suppress a prosecution merely because he regretted that it was taking place.
There is no abuse of process if to a charge which is properly brought before
the court and which is framed in an indictment to which no objection can in any
way be taken there is no plea such as that of autrefois acquit or convict which
can successfully be made.

Lord Hodson said (at pp. 1336 and 1337):

The inherent power of the court to control
its own process, civil or criminal, should not prevent access to the courts
when a lawful claim is presented. So to hold would involve grave interference
with the liberty of the subject to have access to the courts, which I should be
surprised to find to be warranted by authority…

I accept that the history of the
development of our law justifies the contention that all rules of common law
which emanate from the breast of the judges may in a sense be said to be
discretionary in origin, but I cannot concede that there ought to be given to
the judge a discretion, which, in my opinion, he has not hitherto been allowed,
to interfere with anything that he personally thinks is unfair. If one
disclaims such a proposal but seeks to substitute a discretion to determine, in
accordance with principle, whether or not a prosecution should be stopped, I do
not know what principle can be applied.

It is basic in our jurisprudence that the duty
of the courts is to apply the law as it exists, not to enforce it or not in
their discretion. As a general rule, legal remedies are available in an
absolute way ex debito justitiae. Some are discretionary but this does
not destroy the general rule. I can see no legal basis for holding that
criminal remedies are subject to the rule that they are to be refused whenever
in its discretion, a court considers the prosecution oppressive.

In our legal system, it is not considered unfair
or oppressive to have an accused undergo several trials on the same charge when
his conviction is quashed even if this happens repeatedly. In other words, it
is not considered desirable that a criminal should escape punishment for a
misdeed

[Page 191]

because an error was committed in his trial that
requires his conviction to be quashed. I fail to see why a totally different
view should be taken if the error consists in not laying the correct charge so
that instead of being irregularly convicted and then ordered to stand a new
trial, he is acquitted of the incorrect charge and then brought to second trial
on a fresh indictment for the correct charge.

For those reasons I would allow the appeal,
reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and restore the conviction and sentence.

The judgment of Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was
delivered by

HALL J.—On November 23, 1965, the respondent was seen
by Detective Douglas Baker of the Metropolitan Police Force seated behind the
wheel of a 1964 Pontiac
automobile, the car being parked on Bloor Street in the City of Toronto. While the car was under observation one Joseph Sullivan approached
the respondent, at which time Detective Baker went to the car and identified
himself as a police officer. He asked for the respondent’s driver’s license
which was not forthcoming. He then questioned the respondent about the car, and
being concerned that the car may have been stolen, said that they would have to
go to No. 11 Police Station. Detective Baker had Sullivan get in the back seat
and he sat in the front seat to the right of the respondent. While proceeding
to No. 11 Police Station, the respondent had to drive through a subway on Dupont Street. While in the subway he was
observed by Detective Baker to reach down to the car floor, pick up what
appeared to be a piece of white paper and throw it out the window on the
driver’s side. The paper was seen by Detective Baker to land close to the north
curb approximately in the centre of the subway. Detective Baker asked what the
paper was and the respondent replied, “Just junk, the car is full of old
paper”. On emerging from the tunnel Detective Baker had the respondent make a
U-turn and go back in the east-bound lane then make another U-turn and into the
subway again. The car was stopped and

[Page 192]

Detective Baker retrieved the paper which he
found to be an envelope containing seven cheques and two pieces of paper. On
showing them to the respondent, saying “What about these?” the respondent
replied: “I don’t know anything about them.” The respondent was directed to
continue to No. 11 Police Station. At the police station, after being
cautioned, he gave a statement which was ruled admissible after a voir dire to
the effect that he had a telephone call from one “Frank” and had been directed to
the envelope which was cached in a toilet paper receptacle in the washroom of
the Brown Derby tavern. He was to get the envelope, cash what cheques he could,
retain one-third of the proceeds and place the balance of the proceeds with any
uncashed cheques back in the place where he had found the envelope. He later
testified to the same effect at his trial.

The respondent was charged:

that he did, on or about the 23rd day of
November, in the year 1965, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, in the
County of York, knowingly and without lawful authority or excuse, had in his
possession certain writings, to wit, seven cheques and two pieces of paper,
that were adapted and intended to be used to commit forgery, contrary to the
Criminal Code.

The case was heard by His Honour Judge Deyman
and a jury in September 1966. At the conclusion of the case for the Crown,
Judge Deyman, holding that there was no case to go to the jury, directed the
jury to bring in a verdict of acquittal on the ground that the cheques were
complete and there was no evidence connecting the respondent with the actual
forgery of the cheques.

The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario which dismissed the appeal in
January 1967. In May 1967 the respondent was indicted on a charge of conspiring
with a person or persons unknown to commit an indictable offence, to wit,
uttering of seven forged cheques contrary to the Criminal Code. He was
remanded for trial and eventually came on for trial on January 22, 1968, before
His Honour E.L. Weaver and a jury.

[Page 193]

At the opening of the trial, counsel for the
respondent, before plea was taken, entered the special plea of autrefois
acquit pursuant to the provisions of ss. 516 to 518 of the Criminal
Code. In his submission in support of the plea of autrefois acquit, counsel
for the respondent discussed what would be in effect a defence of res
judicata. The learned trial judge disallowed the special plea of autrefois
acquit. He was right in so doing. His ruling was as follows:

THE COURT: I have come to the conclusion,
from a consideration of the law, that the offence as charged here, of
conspiring, is a completely different offence to the substantive offence either
of possession of forged documents or even of using documents known to be forged.
It is a completely different offence and therefore the plea of autrefois
acquit, or even of res judicata, does not apply, and I will dismiss your
application.

He mentioned res judicata but did not
make any reference to the suggestion that the Court should stay the proceedings
on the ground that they were oppressive. It is clear from the record that the
discussion as to the proceedings being res judicata or being oppressive
were incidental to the submission being made on behalf of the respondent in
respect of his plea of autrefois acquit. Res judicata is not a special
plea within s. 516 of the Criminal Code but is a substantive defence
which may, in proper circumstances, be raised during the trial.

Following the learned trial judge’s ruling, the
respondent entered a plea of “Not Guilty”, and after a trial on the merits to
which no objection has been taken, he was found “Guilty” and sentenced to 18
months in the reformatory.

Following his conviction, the respondent
appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario by Notice of Appeal dated February 28, 1968, on the grounds:

1. The conviction was contrary to law.

2. The conviction was contrary to the
evidence and to the weight of evidence.

3. Upon such further and other grounds as
are revealed upon a reading of the transcript of evidence.

[Page 194]

On October 18, 1968, the Notice of Appeal was
amended to read:

The learned trial judge erred in the
exercise of his judicial discretion in failing to stop a prosecution which on
the facts created abuse of process and injustice.

In the Court of Appeal, Jessup J.A. for the
Court[5] said:

Here, however, I think that the long delay
coupled with the Crown’s intervening appeal results in unjust oppressiveness
from the second indictment. In my view, the learned trial judge would have
properly exercised his jurisdiction by staying the proceedings before him.

He prefaced his conclusion by saying:

In my opinion, therefore, the learned trial
judge should have exercised his discretion as to whether or not he should stay
the second indictment on the ground that it was so oppressive as to constitute
an abuse of the process of the court. Since he failed to address himself to
that decision this Court must do so. I am not prepared to hold that in the
absence of special circumstances the laying of a second indictment upon the
same facts is simpliciter and in all cases productive of such injustice as to
invoke the Court’s inherent jurisdiction. Everything depends on all the facts
of the case. The discretion is to be exercised in favour of an accused only
where a real injustice will otherwise result and such a case should be rare. It
should always be invoked before arraignment on the indictment alleged to be
oppressive and cannot be raised after trial on such indictment. (Emphasis
added)

I do not think that the question of whether or
not the Court has jurisdiction to intervene to prevent an abuse of its process
falls to be decided in the instant case because in my view there was here no
evidence to support the conclusion of the learned Justice of Appeal that there
was oppression. The circumstances which I have outlined in greater detail than
might otherwise have been necessary negative any oppressive conduct on the part
of the Crown. Jessup J.A. appears to have placed undue weight on what he calls
“the long delay”. He accepts the proposition that

[Page 195]

in the absence of special circumstances the
laying of a second indictment upon the same facts is not in all cases
productive of injustice or oppression. He mentions only two factors: the long
delay and the Crown’s intervening appeal. The exercise of its right to appeal
cannot be considered as oppression on the part of the Crown. It is a right
given by statute and the exercise of that right by the Crown cannot of itself
be oppression. Accordingly it would appear that having eliminated the mere
preferring of the second indictment as being decisive, Jessup J.A. appears to
have been unduly impressed by the delay. Now, in respect of the delay, the
record shows that the appeal from the acquittal on the first indictment was
disposed of in January 1967. The indictment for conspiracy was preferred to the
General Sessions of the Peace for the County of York on May 1, 1967, and the respondent
appeared for arraignment on May 12. He was remanded in custody until trial but
soon released on bail to appear for trial on September 18, 1967. He did not appear on
that date and a bench warrant was issued by His Honour Judge MacRae. An
explanation was given that he was in hospital on the morning of September 18
and he was again released on bail to appear for trial on December 1. He did not
appear and a bench warrant was issued and the case remanded to December 18 and
he was ordered to remain in custody. He was granted bail on an appeal to a
judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario and the case remanded peremptorily for
trial on January 22, 1968, on which date the trial began.

Then, in regard to the delay between the time of
his conviction and his appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, I pointed out previously that the
original Notice of Appeal was dated February 28, 1968, and amended some eight
months later on October 18, 1968, and judgment given on November 25, 1968. It is, therefore, clear that
such delays as did occur were principally attributable to the respondent and
not to the Crown.

I am of the view that the learned trial judge
was right in ruling that the charge of conspiracy should be proceeded with and
the Court of Appeal was wrong in concluding that he should

[Page 196]

have stayed the proceedings and also wrong in
interfering with the discretion he exercised in that regard.

I would, accordingly, allow the appeal and
restore the conviction. Leave to appeal was granted on the terms that the
appellant would pay to the respondent his costs in this Court, including the
costs of the motion for leave to appeal, the whole on a solicitor and client
basis in any event of the cause. The order allowing the appeal should,
therefore, provide for payment of the respondent’s costs in accordance with the
order giving leave.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Habeas
corpus—Certiorari—Sentence of preventive detention—No appeal taken—Whether
certiorari available—Whether warrant of committal defective—Accused claiming
notice not given seven clear days prior to hearing—Exhibit lost—Onus on accused
to prove when notice served—Criminal Code 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 661,
662(1)(b), 682, 691.

On April 22, 1958, the appellant was found to
be a criminal sexual psychopath and was sentenced to preventive detention. He
signed a waiver of his right of appeal. From 1964 to 1967, he made several
applications to have the preventive detention order set aside. Finally in 1967,
he made the present application for a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari
in aid to quash the warrant of committal. The writ was refused by Wilson
C.J. The main ground upon which the appellant relied was that he had not been
given seven clear days’ notice of the application under s. 661(1) of the Criminal
Code and that consequently, the magistrate had been without jurisdiction to
enter upon the hearing.

At the hearing before the magistrate, the
appellant admitted service of a written notice, which was filed as an exhibit,
but no reference was made to the date of the service. That exhibit was lost.
The appellant filed a lengthy affidavit, largely argumentative, in which he
draws the conclusion that the notice could not have been served seven clear
days before the hearing. His affidavit did not state where or when the notice
was served upon him. In their affidavits, the magistrate and the Crown
prosecutor stated that at the hearing it was proved to the magistrate’s
satisfaction that the appellant received a notice of seven clear days. The
affidavit of the constable who served the notice also stated that he believed
he complied with the legal requirements. The Court of Appeal, by a majority
judgment, affirmed the refusal of the application for the writ. The appellant
appealed to this Court and subse-

[Page 110]

quently obtained leave to appeal from the
refusal of the relief sought in the proceedings by way of certiorari.

Held (Cartwright
C.J. and Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
dismissed.

Per Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The circumstances of this case bring
it within the application of s. 682(b) of the Criminal
Code which prevents the removal of the magistrate’s order by certiorari.
If it can be said that the words “the merits were tried” in s. 682(b)
can only be applicable where the Court had jurisdiction, the
section ceases to have any real meaning. The writ of certiorari is
primarily concerned with the matter of jurisdiction of an inferior Court. The
section was intended to apply, and by its terms does apply in a situation
where, in the absence of the section, the jurisdiction of the Court might have
been questioned on certiorari. The intention of the section is to
preclude the coexistence of two remedies. By its terms it applies, in any case
falling within its provisions, to any attempt to remove a conviction or order
by certiorari. This view of the effect of s. 682 does not run
counter to the judgment of this Court in Smith v. R., [1959] S.C.R. 638.

It is unnecessary to express any view as to
whether, in the light of the provisions of s. 691 of the Criminal Code,
this Court has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a refusal by the
Courts to grant certiorari.

There is no requirement that the warrant of
committal recite that the accused had been given seven clear days’ notice of
the application.

Even if s. 682(b) were not
to be considered as constituting a bar to proceedings by way of certiorari, the
appeal fails on the merits. In the light of the circumstances in this case, it
was incumbent upon the appellant, when he applied for certiorari on the
ground that he had not received adequate notice, to establish that fact by
clear and positive evidence. He has not discharged that onus.

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ., dissenting: Seven clear days’ notice not
having been given to the appellant as required by s. 662(1)(b)
of the Code, the magistrate was without jurisdiction ab initio and
the warrant of committal must fall. In these proceedings the Court can inquire
whether the requisite notice was given. Section 682(b) of the Code does
not deprive the Courts of jurisdiction to grant certiorari in this case.
The great weight of authority supports the view that s. 682 is not a bar
to the issue of certiorari where the proceedings

[Page 111]

sought to be questioned are invalid ab
initio. Therefore, the Courts below were entitled to examine the record to
determine whether the magistrate was without jurisdiction ab initio and
this Court has the same right and duty.

If the matter were res integra the
same view would prevail. The case did not fall within the literal wording of
s. 682 as s. 661 does not contemplate the making of any plea.
Furthermore, it cannot be said that “merits were tried” when in fact and in law
the magistrate never acquired jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing. If the
requisite notice was not given then the proceedings before the magistrate were
not a trial but a nullity.

The warrant of committal was defective on its
face in that it shows that the order was made by an inferior Court and does not
show that the notice imperatively required by s. 662(1)(b) as
a condition precedent to the magistrate having power to hear the application
was given and that a copy thereof was filed as required. When, as in the case
at bar it is alleged that a condition precedent to the inferior Court acquiring
jurisdiction to enter on the hearing was not fulfilled and the warrant is
silent, s. 61 of the Supreme Court Act provides an expeditious
method of ascertaining whether or not the allegation is well founded.

The finding of the majority in the Court of
Appeal that the requisite notice was in fact given to the appellant seven clear
days before the hearing cannot be sustained. It cannot be said that an onus
rests upon the appellant to establish that which ought to be a matter of
record.

Per Hall J., dissenting:
The view that s. 682 of the Code denies the right to remove the order
requires holding that a person convicted in a proceeding which is in law a
nullity is without recourse by certiorari when that person might have appealed.
The section does not achieve that result. When Parliament said “where the
defendant appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried”, it meant a lawful
trial or hearing and not a proceeding which was in law a nullity. The language
used in s. 682 is quite explicit, but it is no broader or more explicit
than that found in many statutes which contain privative clauses of which the Labour
Relations Act of Ontario is an example. There is no consistency in holding
that s. 682 is an absolute bar to certiorari in a case involving
the liberty of the person when equally explicit enactments deny certiorari in
Labour

[Page 112]

Relations legislation are not so regarded.
Where there is no jurisdiction there cannot be a trial on the merits within the
meaning of s. 682.

Per Pigeon J.,
dissenting: Proceedings leading to a sentence of preventive detention
constitute a separate issue distinct from the charge following which they are
instituted. Section 682(b) of the Code cannot be applied to a
sentence of preventive detention because the procedure on an application for
such a sentence does not provide for a plea by the accused. The appellant is in
the same situation as in Smith v. The Queen, [1959] S.C.R. 638, he has
not pleaded. The appellant is therefore entitled to certiorari.

The record shows that it was not proved
before the magistrate that seven clear days’ notice was given as required
imperatively by s. 662 of the Criminal Code. Even if the appellant
could validly admit having received the notice, such an admission is not
sufficient in a criminal case. It could not be presumed that the lost exhibit
showed that the required interval of seven clear days had been observed. The
affidavits did not prove that this did appear on the document.

The magistrate proceeded without adequate
proof of a notice served in accordance with the requirements of the law and
this defect deprived him of his jurisdiction. Section 683(1) of the Code
forbids proceeding without notice. This is a condition precedent to
jurisdiction.

APPEAL from a majority judgment of the Court
of Appeal for British Columbia[1],
affirming the refusal by Wilson C.J. of an application for a writ of habeas
corpus with certiorari in aid to quash a sentence of preventive detention.
Appeal dismissed, Cartwright C.J. and Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.

C.R. Kennedy, for the appellant.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Spence J.
was delivered by

[Page 113]

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—This is an
appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] pronounced on June 3, 1968, dismissing the
appellant’s appeal from the judgment of Wilson C.J. pronounced on August 7,
1967, dismissing the appellant’s motions for a Writ of Habeas Corpus ad
subjiciendum with certiorari in aid to direct the release of the
appellant from the sentence of preventive detention imposed upon him by
Magistrate John Hunter on April 22, 1958, at Cloverdale in the Province of
British Columbia following a finding that the appellant was a criminal sexual
psychopath. Norris J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal.

Under s. 691(3) of the Criminal Code as
enacted by Statutes of Canada 1964-65, c. 53, s. 1, assented to on April
3, 1965, the appellant has an appeal as of right to this Court from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal confirming the refusal of the application for a
Writ of Habeas Corpus. As s. 691 does not expressly provide a right
of appeal to this Court from the refusal of the relief sought in proceedings by
way of certiorari, counsel for the appellant moved for leave to appeal
and on October 7, 1968, this Court made an order granting leave to appeal from
the judgment of the Court of Appeal pronounced on June 3, 1968,

on all questions of law set forth in the Notice
of Motion of the Appellant subject to argument as to the right of the Supreme
Court of Canada to grant such leave.

and granting the necessary extensions of time.

In this Court counsel for the appellant,
pursuant to s. 61 of the Supreme Court Act, served a notice of
motion returnable at the hearing of the appeal for an order that a Writ of certiorari
issue out of this Court to bring up any papers or other proceedings had or
taken in the Courts below that are considered necessary with a view to this
appeal.

The appeal was first argued in this Court on
December 8, 1968, before a Bench of seven and judgment was reserved. At the
conclusion of the argument on that occasion the Court requested

[Page 114]

counsel to make written submissions on the
question, which had been raised by the Court during the argument, whether
clause (b) of s. 682 of the Criminal Code deprives
the Courts of jurisdiction to grant certiorari in this case and counsel
complied with this request. Later the Court directed a re-hearing. The appeal
was argued on June 2nd before the full Court and judgment was reserved.

While it is perhaps not altogether relevant to
the questions that we are called upon to decide, I propose to set out briefly
the history of the proceedings taken in this matter up to the present time so
far as this can be ascertained from the somewhat fragmentary records produced
in the Courts below and before us.

On March 6, 1958, the appellant pleaded guilty
before Magistrate Hunter to a charge of committing an act of gross indecency
with another male person, contrary to s. 149 of the Criminal Code.

On April 22, 1958, the appellant was found by
Magistrate Hunter to be a criminal sexual psychopath and was sentenced to two
years imprisonment on the charge of gross indecency and in addition was
sentenced to preventive detention.

On May 18, 1958, the appellant signed a waiver
stating that he had elected not to appeal from either the conviction or
sentence.

On February 8, 1964, the appellant gave notice
of an application to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time for
appealing.

On May 7, 1965, the matter came before the Court
of Appeal, composed of Bird C.J.B.C. and Davey and MacLean JJ.A. Counsel for
the Crown was not called upon and the Court delivered an oral judgment refusing
to grant an extention of time and refusing permission to withdraw the waiver of
appeal.

Bird C.J.B.C. concluded his reasons as follows:

…In the circumstances while I am not
disposed to make any direction, I would ask Crown Counsel if he would see to it
that the matter is reported in

[Page 115]

detail to the Attorney-General’s Department
in the hope that a thorough investigation of the allegations now made by the
man can be made.

As my brother Davey puts it, our purpose
is, first of all, to make sure no injustice has been done and while it is not
open to the court to investigate this situation which is alleged by Saunders at
this late date we do feel there might possibly be something in what he has had
to say and in those terms we would like to be sure that the matter is
thoroughly investigated by the law enforcement officers in this Province.

Davey J.A., as he then was, in the course of his
reasons concurred in the suggestion that counsel for the Crown should make an
investigation.

In September 1965, the appellant gave notice of
an application for a Writ of Habeas Corpus with certiorari in
aid.

On November 12 and 19, 1965, this application
was heard by Branca J., as he then was, and on November 23, 1965, that learned
Judge dismissed the application. It appears that the Warden of the Penitentiary
at New Westminster, B.C., where the appellant was confined had returned to the
Court the Warrant of Commitment in virtue of which the appellant was detained.
It reads as follows:

To the Peace Officers in the County of

Westminster, B.C.

[Page 116]

Whereas Francis Stewart SANDERS hereinafter
called the “accused”, was this day convicted upon a charge that Francis Stewart
SANDERS between the 1st day of December, A.D. 1957 and the 1st day of March,
A.D. 1958, at or near Newton, B.C., in the Municipality of Surrey being a male
person did unlawfully commit an act of gross indecency with Roy FLACK, another
male person, contrary to the form of Statute in such case made and provided.

Whereas the said Francis Stewart SANDERS
was, pursuant to Section 661 of the Criminal Code of Canada, found to be a
criminal sexual psychopath, and it was adjudged that the accused for his
offence be imprisoned in the British Columbia Penitentiary at New Westminster
for the term of Two (2) Years, and in addition a sentence of preventative
detention.

You are hereby commanded in Her Majesty’s
name to take the accused and convey him safely to the British Columbia
Penitentiary at New Westminster, B.C. and deliver him to the keeper thereof,
together with the following precept:

You, the said keeper, are hereby commanded
to receive the accused into custody in the said Prison and imprison him there
for the term of Two (2) Years, and in addition a sentence of preventative
detention, and for so doing this is sufficient warrant.

While the signature on this Warrant is illegible
it would seem to be that of Magistrate Hunter because an affidavit sworn by him
on October 13, 1965, concludes with the following paragraph:

12. That at the conclusion of the evidence
submitted on the hearing on the 22nd of April, 1958, I found that Francis
Stewart Sanders was a criminal

[Page 117]

sexual psychopath, and sentenced the said
Francis Stewart Sanders to a term of imprisonment for two years, and in
addition thereto I imposed a sentence of preventive detention and subsequently
I signed a Warrant of Committal according to my findings and sentences.

In his careful and detailed reasons Branca J.
examined the record of the proceedings before Magistrate Hunter but held that
he could not look at the evidence to determine whether the finding of the
Magistrate was correct. He concluded his reasons as follows:

I am in conclusion deeply regretful that in
this case acting strictly within the supervisory area reserved to this Court in
matters of this kind, that I must find that the Applicant is detained by a
Warrant in all respects regular on its face and upon a charge fully within the
jurisdiction of the convicting Magistrate. The Affidavit of the Applicant does
not allege or disclose any jurisdictional defect.

I hasten to say that if the supervisory
jurisdiction of this Court permitted a review of the evidence in this matter,
that the conviction or finding insofar as it relates to the fact that the
Applicant was a criminal sexual psychopath would be forthwith quashed for the
reasons stated.

I have deliberately reviewed the evidence
and the authorities at length in the hope and anxious expectation that counsel
will bring this matter to the attention of other authorities who may be able at
law to correct the injustice done in this case which this Court unfortunately
in the circumstances and for the reasons stated is unable to do.

The appellant appealed from the decision of
Branca J. The appeal was heard on March 24 and 25, 1966, and judgment was given
at the conclusion of the hearing. Davey J.A., as he then was, based his
judgment solely on s. 682(b) of the Criminal Code, holding
that an appeal from the sentence of preventive detention might have been taken
by the appellant but was not taken. Lord J.A. agreed. Bull J.A. expressed his
agreement as follows:

I agree that the appeal should be
dismissed, but I do so with some reluctance. I say with reluctance, however,
for the reason that it has appeared to me that there have been several errors
committed in the actual hearing. However, despite that, I consider

[Page 118]

there was full jurisdiction in the
Magistrate to make the finding and sentence that he did. As stated by my
learned brother, the appeal should be dismissed.

It should be noted at this point that neither
Branca J. nor the Court of Appeal said anything about the ground which was
chiefly relied on before us, Le., that it does not appear that the notice
required by s. 662(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, as it
read at the time of the hearing before Magistrate Hunter, had been given to the
appellant seven clear days before the hearing. It will be observed that in the
passage from his reasons quoted above Branca J. said that the affidavit of the
appellant did not allege any jurisdictional defect.

The only references to the notice contained in
the appellant’s affidavit were in paras. 20 and 22 which read as follows:

20. THAT the Crown Prosecutor did not
present in court proof of service of Notice of Application.

* *
*

22. THAT the Crown Prosecutor did not file
a copy of this Notice of Application with the Clerk of the Court or with the
Magistrate.

It will be observed that these do not raise a
question as to the length of notice given. It is clear from reading the whole
of his reasons that Branca J. made no reference to the question whether a
sufficient length of Notice of Application had been given to the appellant.

On March 31, 1966, the appellant filed a Notice
of Motion for leave to appeal and for an extension of time for appealing from
the finding of Magistrate Hunter. This application was heard on May 27, 1966,
by Bird C.J.B.C., Tysoe and McFarlane, JJ.A. and judgment was given on June 7,
1966, refusing it. The reasons of the Court of Appeal, delivered by Bird
C.J.B.C, set out three grounds relied on by the appellant and state that he
relied on no other ground. None of these grounds raises the question of whether
seven clear days notice of the application before Magistrate Hunter had been
given to the appellant.

On May 18, 1967, the appellant gave Notice of an
Application for a Writ of Habeas Corpus

[Page 119]

and certiorari in aid which was heard and
dismissed by Wilson C.J. on August 7, 1967, as set out in the opening paragraph
of these reasons.

The material before us does not contain any
recorded reasons of Wilson C.J. but on August 16, 1967, the learned Chief
Justice made a report to the Court of Appeal, pursuant to s. 588(1) of the
Criminal Code, reading as follows:

I have little to report on this matter. The
same conviction was dealt with by Mr. Justice Branca on a previous
application for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid and his written reasons,
dismissing the application, were handed down November 23, 1965. I cannot
improve on them. Generally I may say that since the warrant of committal was
not attacked I could see no opening for habeas corpus. So far as certiorari was
involved I thought Section 682 of the Criminal Code a bar and also thought that
the application must be dismissed for the reasons given by Branca J., as he
then was.

In support of his application before Wilson C.J.
the appellant filed an affidavit containing ninety-six paragraphs. Paragraph 20
reads as follows:

20. That I was not given seven clear days
Notice before trial as required by Law, before the Court has jurisdiction to
hold a hearing to determine if the Accused was a criminal sexual psychopath.

It will be observed that Wilson C.J. does not
deal with the question whether Magistrate Hunter was without jurisdiction
because of the alleged failure to give seven clear days notice of the
application to decide whether the appellant was a criminal sexual psychopath.

The appeal from the decision of Wilson C.J. was
heard by a Court of five Judges. As has already been stated, Norris J.A.,
dissenting, would have allowed the appeal. The judgment of the majority was
written by Tysoe J.A. and concurred in by Bull, McFarlane and Robertson JJ.A.

Before examining the reasons given in the Court
of Appeal it will be convenient to set out

[Page 120]

the terms of s. 691 of the Criminal Code
as it now reads and read at the date of the application to Wilson C.J.

691. (1) An appeal lies to the court of
appeal from a decision granting or refusing the relief sought in proceedings by
way of mandamus, certiorari or prohibition.

(2) Except as hereinafter in this
section provided, the provisions of Part XVIII apply, mutatis mutandis,
to appeals under this section.

(3) Where an application for a writ of habeas
corpus ad subjiciendum is refused by a judge of a court having jurisdiction
therein, no application may again be made on the same grounds whether to the
same or to another court or judge, unless fresh evidence is adduced, but an
appeal from such refusal shall lie to the Court of Appeal, and where on such
appeal the application is refused a further appeal shall lie to the Supreme
Court of Canada.

(4) Where a writ of habeas corpus ad
subjiciendum is granted by any judge no appeal therefrom shall lie at the
instance of any party including the Attorney General of the province concerned
or the Attorney General of Canada.

(5) Where a judgment is issued on the
return of a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, an appeal therefrom
lies to the Court of Appeal, and from a judgment of the Court of Appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada, with the leave of that court, at the instance of the
applicant or the Attorney General of the province concerned or the Attorney
General of Canada, but not at the instance of any other party.

(6) An appeal in habeas corpus matters
shall be heard by the court to which the appeal is directed at an early date,
whether in or out of the prescribed sessions of the court.

All the members of the Court of Appeal were of
opinion that “fresh evidence” was adduced before Wilson C.J. in that the first
transcript of the proceedings before Magistrate Hunter which had been supplied
to the appellant by the Court Reporter, and which was before Branca J., was
plainly incomplete and the second and much fuller transcript was not made
available to the appellant until after Branca J. had delivered his

[Page 121]

judgment. This finding was clearly right and
consequently the terms of subs. (3) of s. 691 did not prevent the making
of the application to Wilson C.J.

In his reasons, Tysoe J.A. after summarizing the
history of the earlier proceedings, stated the submission of the appellant that
the evidence before Wilson C.J. established that the appellant had not been
given seven clear days notice of the application to Magistrate Hunter for a
finding that he is a criminal sexual psychopath, that consequently the
Magistrate was without jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing, that the
appellant is unlawfully detained and entitled ex debito justitiae to the
remedy of habeas corpus. He next examined the submissions of counsel for
the Crown (i) that the Warrant of Committal is valid on its face, (ii) that in
these proceedings the Court cannot go behind the Warrant and (iii) that the
Magistrate when proceeding under s. 661 of the Criminal Code is not
an inferior court but a superior one.

Tysoe J.A. did not accept these submissions of
the Crown but does not appear to have finally decided that they were untenable.
He says in part:

If the attack on the jurisdiction of the
Magistrate succeeds, the warrant of committal must fall for, in that event, it
was issued by a person who was without power to issue it and so is invalid.

I am not convinced that this submission of
the Crown that the court cannot go behind the warrant of committal is sound.
Accordingly, I propose to proceed with my judgment on the assumption that the
Magistrate’s Court is an inferior court and that the court below and this court
are entitled to go behind the warrant of committal for the purpose of
determining whether the Magistrate who issued the warrant of committal had
jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing under Code Section 661 and to make the
finding on which the warrant rested.

It is clear that Magistrate Hunter constituted
an inferior and not a superior court. This appears from the Magistrates Act which
was in force at

[Page 122]

the time of the hearing, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 195, as
amended by Statutes of B.C. 1955, c. 45, now Statutes of B.C. 1962, c. 36,
particularly ss. 3, 4 and 5, and from the Criminal Code s. 2(10)(b),
s. 2(38)(d) and s. 659(a).

Immediately following the passage last quoted
above, Tysoe J.A. continued:

Counsel for the Crown conceded, in my
opinion, rightly, that, notwithstanding the provisions of Code Section
682 which are as follows:

682. No conviction or order shall be
removed by certiorari

(a) where an appeal was
taken, whether or not the appeal has been carried to a conclusion, or

(b) where the defendant
appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried and an appeal might have been
taken, but the defendant did not appeal.

certiorari will lie if the learned
Magistrate acted in this matter without jurisdiction to do so in the sense that
he was without power to hear the Crown’s application ab initio if the
appellant had not in fact been given seven clear days’ notice thereof.

This concession at first appears surprising in
view of the fact that the Court of Appeal which heard the appeal from the
judgment of Branca J. had based its judgment solely on the terms of s. 682
and Wilson C.J. had based his judgment in part on that section; but it must be
remembered that the only occasion prior to the hearing of the appeal in the
Court of Appeal from the judgment of Wilson C.J. on which the appellant was
represented by counsel was on the application before Branca J. and, as already
pointed out, there is nothing in the elaborate reasons of that learned Judge to
suggest that the point was raised before him. The hearing of the appeal from
the judgment of Wilson C.J. was the first occasion on which the argument was
put forward that because of the alleged failure to give seven clear days notice
the Magistrate was without jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing.

If it be the fact that seven clear days notice
was not given to the appellant as required by s. 662(1)(b) of
the Criminal Code, then the

[Page 123]

magistrate was without jurisdiction ab initio
and, as was held by every member of the Court of Appeal, the warrant of
committal must fall.

The two questions that arise are (i) whether in
these proceedings the Court can inquire whether the requisite notice was given
and (ii) if so, whether the finding should be that it was given. It was on the
second of these questions that Norris J.A. differed from the majority in the
Court of Appeal.

On the first question, while Tysoe J.A. accepted
the concession of counsel that the right to certiorari was not taken
away by s. 682 of the Criminal Code, he expressed the opinion that
the concession was rightly made and examined a number of decisions in support
of this conclusion. Before us counsel for the Crown contends that clause (b)
of s. 682 does deprive the Courts of jurisdiction to grant certiorari
in this case. In my opinion this submission should be rejected. I do not
propose to refer in detail to the numerous decisions in which s. 682 has
been considered by the courts, which are collected in Martin’s Annual
Criminal Code, 1968, at pp. 635 to 642. The great weight of authority
supports the view, that was so clearly expressed by Hall C.J.Q.B., as he then
was, in Regina v. Phillips[3] and
by Spence J. in Regina v. Heins[4],
that s. 682 is not a bar to the issue of certiorari where the
proceedings sought to be questioned are invalid ab initio.

If the submission of counsel for the Crown on
this branch of the matter were accepted it would mean that the case of Smith
v. The Queen[5] was
wrongly decided. In that case a motion for certiorari to quash a finding
that a boy aged fourteen was a juvenile delinquent was dismissed by Campbell J.
and the dismissal was affirmed by a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Manitoba. In this Court the judgments below were reversed and the finding
of delinquency was quashed. It is true that s. 682 is not referred to in
the reasons in this Court but it was referred to in the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba by Adamson C.J. in his dissenting judgment. The

[Page 124]

decision of that Court is reported sub nom
Regina v. Gerald X (or G.S.)[6]. At
p. 106 the learned Chief Justice said:

For want of jurisdiction in an inferior Court certiorari
is the appropriate remedy. Certiorari is the appropriate remedy to
raise the question of proper service: 13 Can. Abr. 1706; Re Ruggles (1902),
5 Can.C.C. 163, 35 N.S.R. 57; Cr. Code, ss. 682, 683 and 691; Paulowich
v. Dankochuk, 73 Can.C.C. 273, (1940) 2 D.L.R. 106, 48 Man. R. 6.

Coyne J.A. who wrote the reasons of the majority
said at p. 127:

Here the appellant has a right of appeal
under s. 37 but did not seek to exercise it. On such an appeal he could
have raised all points which arise in this proceeding. The finding of
delinquency by the Juvenile Court Judge was made and the fine imposed on
September 23rd. The time for application for leave to appeal expired on October
3rd and the limit of any extension by special leave of time for appeal was
October 23 rd. These proceedings were not instituted until November 23rd.

I do not think it should be assumed that this
Court gave no consideration to the terms of s. 682(b).

In my view the power to grant certiorari in
aid of the Writ of habeas corpus in the case at bar was not taken away
by the terms of s. 682, and the Courts below were entitled to examine the
record to determine whether the Magistrate was without jurisdiction ab
initio.

I have reached this conclusion because it
appears to me to accord with the great weight of judicial opinion; but if the
matter were res integra my view would be the same. Clearly clause (a)
of s. 682 has no application in the circumstances of the case at bar;
no appeal was taken.

The part of s. 682 with which we are
concerned is as follows:

682. No conviction or order shall be
removed by certiorari

* *
*

[Page 125]

(b) where the defendant
appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried, and an appeal might have been
taken, but the defendant did not appeal.

Applying this to the facts of the case at bar,
the finding of the Magistrate that the appellant was a criminal sexual
psychopath (which entailed the mandatory imposition of a sentence of preventive
detention) was not a “conviction” but it may be that it could properly be
regarded as an “order” within the meaning of that word as used in the section.
It is clear that the appellant appeared before the Magistrate and that an appeal
might have been taken from the Magistrate’s decision but it is equally clear
that no plea was taken; the provisions of s. 661 of the Criminal Code did
not contemplate the making of any plea by the person as to whom the inquiry
whether he was a dangerous sexual psychopath was to be held. It follows that
this case does not fall within the literal wording of s. 682.

But the matter does not rest there. How can it
be said that “the merits were tried” if in fact and in law the Magistrate who
purported to conduct the “trial” never acquired jurisdiction to enter upon the
hearing of the application? If the requisite notice was not given then the
proceedings before the Magistrate were not a trial but a nullity. On this point
there was no difference of opinion in the Court of Appeal. It is clear that
Tysoe J.A., who wrote for the majority, would have allowed the appeal if he had
not found that the required notice was in fact given.

The wording of s. 662(1)(b) of
the Criminal Code, as it read at the time of the hearing before
Magistrate Hunter, is explicit. It is as follows:

(b) an application under
subsection (1) of section 661 shall not be heard unless seven clear
days’ notice thereof has been given to the accused by the prosecutor and a copy
of the notice has been filed with the clerk of the court or with the
magistrate, where the magistrate is acting under Part XVI.

The giving of the notice and the filing of a
copy are clearly made conditions precedent to the right of the Magistrate to
hear the application.

[Page 126]

The writ of certiorari is a very old high
prerogative writ. Its purpose is to enable the Court which corresponds to the
Court of Queen’s Bench in England (in this case the Supreme Court of British
Columbia) to control the action of inferior courts and to make it certain that
they shall not exceed their jurisdiction. It is clear that in the case at bar
it would be an appropriate remedy available to the appellant unless the right
to it is taken away by the terms of s. 682. The power of Parliament to
take away this remedy is not open to question; but, in my opinion, it would
require clear and explicit words to bring about such a result. I have already
stated my reasons for holding that the facts of the case at bar do not bring it
within the terms of s. 682, even if, contrary as I venture to think to the
great weight of authority, it should be held that that section is ever
effective to take away the right to certiorari in cases where it is
alleged that the inferior court acted without jurisdiction ab initio.

In seeking to ascertain the intention of
Parliament it is permissible to consider the results which flow from two
alternative constructions of the words of a statute. If it be the fact (a
question which remains to be decided) that the notice required by s. 662(1)(b)
was not given to the appellant and it is held that s. 682 has taken away
the right to certiorari, then the appellant, who was without counsel,
having waived his right of appeal and having let the time for appealing go by
is left without any remedy although he is under sentence of imprisonment for
the remainder of his life imposed by a magistrate who was without jurisdiction
to make the finding that the appellant was a criminal sexual psychopath or to
impose the sentence that followed such finding. I cannot think that Parliament
intended such a result. When I say the appellant is left without remedy, I have
not overlooked the fact that the Court of Appeal for British Columbia had, and
I suppose still has, power to extend the time for appealing to that Court; but
the appellant cannot claim such an extension as a right, he can but seek it as
an indulgence. He has sought it twice without success. On the second of these
occasions the Court of Appeal, no doubt, had knowledge of what Branca J. had
said in those paragraphs of his judgment which I have quoted

[Page 127]

earlier in these reasons. On the other hand if
it appears that the Magistrate acted without jurisdiction the order of certiorari
would issue ex debito justitiae. In my opinion, if Parliament had
intended to take away the right to certiorari in a case where an
inferior court has acted without jurisdiction it would have added to the
opening words of s. 682 some such words as “even from an inferior court
which has acted without any jurisdiction whatever”. There is no need to dilate
upon the unlikelihood of Parliament having any such intention.

For all these reasons I am satisfied that in the
case at bar the right to certiorari has not been taken away.

Having reached this conclusion, it would seem to
become unnecessary for me to examine Mr. Kennedy’s alternative argument
that the Warrant of Committal returned to the Supreme Court of British
Columbia, which has been set out in full above, was defective on its face in
that it shows that the order under which the appellant is detained was made by
an inferior court and does not show that the notice imperatively required by
s. 662(1)(b) of the Criminal Code as a condition
precedent to the magistrate having power to hear the application was given to
the appellant and that a copy thereof was filed as required. However, as other
members of the Court have examined and rejected this argument I think I should
express my opinion upon it.

In approaching this argument is must be
remembered that the appellant’s application is not for certiorari
simpliciter but for a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in
aid. Section 691(3) of the Code expressly gives a right of appeal to
this Court from the refusal by the Court of Appeal of an application for a writ
of habeas corpus ab subjiciendum and section 61 of the Supreme
Court Act gives this Court power to issue a writ of certiorari to
bring up any papers or other proceedings had or taken before any court, judge
or justice of the peace, that are considered necessary with a view to any
inquiry, appeal or other proceeding to be had before this Court. It has already
been pointed out that Mr. Kennedy applied for a writ of certiorari under
s. 61.

[Page 128]

Section 691(3) of the Code and s. 61
of the Supreme Court Act must be read together. If there is a conflict
between their provisions and those of section 682 of the Code then
the former must prevail; generalia specialibus non derogant.

I have reached the conclusion that the warrant
of committal is defective on the ground argued by Mr. Kennedy which is
recited above. It has already been pointed out that Magistrate Hunter
constituted an inferior court and the rule has long been established which is
stated in the following words in Broom’s Legal Maxims, 10th ed. at page
101:

Lastly, it has been said that ‘there is a
distinction between process of superior and inferior Courts; in the former, omnia
praesumuntur rite esse acta, in the latter the rule de non apparentibus
et non existentibus eadem est ratio applies.’ The Superior Court need not,
but the inferior Court must, show jurisdiction on the face of an order.

and at page 646:

It is, however, important to observe in
addition to the above general remark, that, in inferior courts and proceedings
by magistrates, the maxim, omnia praesumuntur rite esse acta, does not
apply to give jurisdiction.

The italics are those of the author. These
statements of the rule are fully supported by the judgment of the House of
Lords, adopting the unanimous opinion of the judges, in Mayor and Aldermen
of the City of London v. Richard Henry Cox et al[7], particularly at pages 262 and 263.

To hold that the warrant must affirmatively show
that the required notice was given and a copy thereof filed will not permit the
release of a person detained where the notice was in fact given and filed. In
such a case an amended warrant could be filed and the provisions of s. 683
of the Code could be applied.

When, as in the case at bar, it is alleged that
a condition precedent to the inferior court ac-

[Page 129]

quiring jurisdiction to enter on the hearing was
not fulfilled and the warrant is silent, s. 61 of the Supreme Court Act
provides an expeditious method of ascertaining whether or not the
allegation is well founded.

The applicable rule is accurately stated in Broom’s
Legal Maxims, supra, at page 647, as follows:

But although it is necessary that the
jurisdiction of the inferior court should appear, yet there is no particular
form in which it should be made to appear. The Court above, which may control
the inferior court, must be enabled, somehow or other, to see that there is
jurisdiction such as will support the proceeding; but in what way it shall so
see it is not material, provided it does so see it. The rule, therefore, may be
stated to be, that where it appears upon the face of the proceedings that the
inferior court has jurisdiction, it will be intended that the proceedings are
regular; but that, unless it so appears—that is, if it appear affirmatively
that the inferior court has no jurisdiction, or, if it be left in doubt,
whether it has jurisdiction or not—no such intendment will be made. ‘The old
rule for jurisdiction is, that nothing shall be intended to be out of the
jurisdiction of the superior court but that which specially appears to
be so; nothing is intended to be within the jurisdiction of an inferior court
but that which is expressly alleged’. And again, ‘in all proceedings in
inferior courts it is necessary to show that the proceedings were within the
jurisdiction of the Court’.

While, in my view, it is not strictly necessary
as I think the proceedings below are already properly before us, I would direct
the issue of a writ of certiorari pursuant to s. 61 of the Supreme
Court Act to bring them here.

The result of all that I have said above is
that, in my opinion, the Courts below had the right and the duty to examine the
record of the proceedings before the Magistrate and the affidavits filed before
Wilson C.J. for the purpose of ascertaining whether notice was given and a copy
thereof filed as required by s. 662(1)(b), that is to say
for the purpose of ascertaining whether the Magistrate had jurisdiction to
enter upon the inquiry, and this Court has the same right and duty.

[Page 130]

The next question is whether the finding of the
majority in the Court of Appeal, that the requisite notice was in fact given to
the appellant seven clear days before the hearing, can be sustained. After a
consideration of all the material in the record I have reached the conclusion
that it cannot.

With respect I am unable to agree with the view
which Tysoe J.A. expressed as follows:

It is my opinion that in the circumstances
of this case the onus is on the appellant to establish that he did not receive
the seven clear days’ notice called for by Code Section 662(1)(b)
and the onus is a heavy one. It seems abundantly clear that when the
appellant acknowledged formally before the Magistrate that he had been served
with notice as shown in the foregoing extract of the proceedings, he must have
intended the Magistrate to believe that he was not questioning the adequacy of
the notice given to him of the hearing of the application. This circumstance,
it seems to me, adds to the onus upon the appellant to show conclusively, if he
can, that be had not in fact been given the notice which he was entitled to be
given under the Code Section.

The course of the proceedings would seem to
indicate that it was not until the hearing before the Court of Appeal that the
appellant realized that he was entitled to seven clear days’ notice. He does
not question the receipt of a notice. His whole case is that he did not receive
it seven clear days before the hearing. There is no presumption that he knew of
this when he acknowledged before the Magistrate that he had received notice. I
agree with what was said by Lord Atkin in Evans v. Bartlam[8]:

…For my part I am not prepared to accept
the view that there is in law any presumption that any one, even a judge, knows
all the rules and orders of the Supreme Court. The fact is that there is not
and never has been a presumption that every one knows the law. There is the
rule that ignorance of the law does not excuse, a maxim of very different scope
and application.

Had the proceedings before Magistrate Hunter
been properly conducted and recorded the record returned to the Supreme Court
of British Columbia would have contained a copy of the notice

[Page 131]

given to the appellant and evidence, by way of
affidavit of service or oral sworn testimony, showing the date on which it was
served. It contains none of these. How can it be said that an onus rests upon
the appellant to establish that which ought to be a matter of record?

As was pointed out by Norris J.A., the
appellant’s lengthy affidavit is largely argumentative; but there seems to be
no escape from the conclusion which he seeks to draw that, if the affidavit of
the constable who served the notice upon the appellant is correct in saying
that the service was made at the Court House at Clover-dale, the notice could
not have been served seven clear days before the hearing.

On this branch of the matter I am in substantial
agreement with the reasons of Norris J.A. and will not repeat what he has said.

Before parting with this appeal, I wish to make
one further observation. It is unquestionable that proceedings under s. 660
or s. 661 of the Criminal Code, in which the liberty of the accused
for the remainder of his life is at stake, are strictissimi juris. At
the trial of an indictable offence by the terms of s. 562 of the Code, and
at the trial of an offence punishable on summary conviction by the terms of
s. 708(5), an accused or his counsel may admit any fact alleged against
him for the purpose of dispensing with proof thereof. Where there is no plea of
guilty, an accused cannot effectively admit matters of mixed fact and law. In
my opinion, it is an undesirable practice for Crown counsel to refrain from
making strict proof of the giving of the notice required by the terms of
s. 662(1) and to seek to rely on a loosely worded oral admission made by
an accused who is not represented by counsel.

Since writing the above I have had the advantage
of reading the reasons of my brother Pigeon and wish to express my complete
agreement with them.

For the reasons given by my brother Pigeon and
for those set out above, I would allow the appeal, set aside the Orders of the
Court of Appeal and of Wilson C.J., and direct that judgment be entered (i)
quashing the finding of the Magistrate that the appellant is a criminal sexual

[Page 132]

psychopath, (ii) quashing the sentence of
preventive detention, (iii) quashing the Warrant of Committal and (iv) ordering
that the appellant be discharged from custody.

I would make an order pursuant to s. 689 of
the Criminal Code protecting the Magistrate and any officer who acted
under the Order or Warrant from any civil proceedings.

The judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland,
Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—The appellant, on March 6, 1958,
appeared before Magistrate Hunter, at Cloverdale, British Columbia, and pleaded
guilty to a charge of committing an act of gross indecency, contrary to
s. 149 of the Criminal Code, and was convicted of that offence. His
criminal record contained two prior convictions for the same type of offence,
and was admitted by the appellant to be correct.

He was not sentenced at that time, but the
hearing was adjourned to a subsequent date. He appeared before the magistrate
on March 28, 1958. On that occasion it appears that he was notified by the
prosecutor of the intention of the latter to apply to hear evidence as to
whether the appellant was a criminal sexual psychopath, because the appellant
was asked to appoint one of the two psychiatrists whose evidence is required
under s. 661(2) of the Code. The appellant says that he asked that his
personal physician should suggest a psychiatrist.

The hearing was adjourned to April 15, and, on
that date, again adjourned to April 22. It was on that date that the evidence
was heard by the magistrate. The magistrate imposed a sentence of two years in
respect of the offence charged, as to which the plea of guilty had been
entered, and also imposed a sentence of preventive detention.

The appellant did not appeal, within the time
limited for appeal. In February 1964, he applied for an extension of time
within which to appeal. The application was heard on May 7, 1965, by the Court
of Appeal, and was dismissed.

[Page 133]

In September, 1965, the appellant applied for a
writ of habeas corpus, with certiorari in aid. One of the grounds stated was:

THAT the court had no jurisdiction to hear
an application under section 661(1)(b), when the hearing
followed immediately after conviction, the procedure laid down that the
application be raised AFTER conviction and seven clear days notice, were not
complied with.

The appellant’s affidavit in support of that
application contained no statement as to where or when he was served with the
notice, nor did it contain any other material in support of the above
submission.

The appellant was represented by counsel on this
application, which was dismissed. The appeal from this decision was dismissed.
Counsel appeared on the appeal as “amicus curiae” as well as counsel for the
Crown.

On March 31, 1966, the appellant applied a
second time for an extension of time within which to appeal from the finding
that he was a criminal sexual psychopath and the sentence of preventive
detention. This application was heard on May 26 and was dismissed on June 7.
Written reasons were delivered by the Chief Justice, on behalf of the Court,
and I quote from those reasons:

In view of the submissions made by Sanders
to this Court on his Motion for extension of Time made in 1965, the Court
directed Crown counsel to inform the Attorney-General of the allegations which
had been made by Sanders before this Court regarding prejudicial conduct of the
proceedings before the Cloverdale Magistrate, with a view to a thorough
investigation of all the circumstances surrounding the proceedings taken before
Magistrate Hunter. Crown counsel has informed the Court during argument that
such an investigation was made by an officer of the Department of the
Attorney-General who reported thereon repudiating the allegations made by
Sanders.

Branca J. in his reasons for judgment in
the Habeas Corpus proceedings before mentioned, criticized adversely the
conduct of the proceedings before Magistrate Hunter, presumably based upon
allegations of the same nature as were made by Sanders in his first motion for
leave to appeal, but

[Page 134]

considered that there was not sufficient
proof of prejudicial conduct of the proceedings before the trial tribunal to
justify a finding that the Magistrate acted without jurisdiction.

On the opening of the current Motions before
this Court Sanders appeared in person, stated that he wished to appear on his
own behalf and did not desire legal aid counsel. He relied on the following
grounds:

1. That the Court is entitled to consider
the merits of his case before determining whether or not to grant an extension
of time to move for leave to appeal.

2. The merits warrant an extension of time
since it now appears from a further transcript of the proceedings before the
learned Magistrate on April 22, 1958 that the transcript presented to this
court on the first motion was not complete.

3. The waiver of appeal signed by the
Appellant on 18th May 1958 does not stand in the way of the granting of an
extension of time to move for leave to appeal.

He relied on no other ground.

* * *

I am satisfied from examination of the
transcript now produced by Sanders and particularly from the comments
attributed to him at the conclusion of the proceedings on April 22, that he
suffered no prejudice from the manner in which those proceedings were
conducted. His concluding comment, in my judgment, affords the fullest support
for the conclusion that he did not then consider he had suffered prejudice.

In view of Sanders’ allegation of prejudice the
Court has seen fit on this Motion for Extension of time to examine the record
of the proceedings before the Magistrate with care. In my judgment no grounds
have been shown to warrant the granting of an extension of time to permit the
appellant to prosecute an appeal from the finding that he is a criminal sexual
psychopath, or from the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate.

The application was dismissed.

It was on the hearing of this application that
the appellant, for the first time, produced a notice, dated March 31, 1958,
addressed to him, of the intention to apply, on April 15, 1958, at Cloverdale,
British Columbia, for a hearing to

[Page 135]

determine whether or not he was a criminal
sexual psychopath. It bore the name of A.K. Thompson, Crown Prosecutor.

The application which gave rise to the present
proceedings was a second application for a writ of habeas corpus, with certiorari
in aid, made on May 18, 1967. The application was dismissed, and an appeal
from that dismissal was heard by a court of five and was dismissed, Norris J.A.
dissenting.

Tysoe J.A., who delivered the reasons of the
majority, says:

The situation in the case before this Court
is somewhat unique. Some of the records of the Magistrate’s court cannot be
found. All the material that was available in the court below and in this court
is the warrant of committal, two transcripts of the proceedings before the
Magistrate on April 22, 1958, the notice of application served upon the
appellant, and the affidavits hereinafter mentioned.

The first transcript was supplied to the
appellant by the Court Reporter and it is plainly incomplete. The second
transcript was procured by the Crown and was prepared by the Court Reporter
after Branca, J. had delivered his judgment. It is much fuller than the first
and is certified to be “a true report of the evidence and proceedings as
transcribed from my shorthand notes taken on April 22nd, 1958.” Insofar as service
of notice of the application to Magistrate Hunter for a finding under Code Section
661 is concerned, the second transcript contains the following:

CROWN: Your Worship, you will recall in
this matter, the previous hearing, I made application under Section 661(1) of
the Criminal Code and Notice has been served upon the accused and the Accused
is prepared to admit it, to avoid the necessity of proof.

MAGISTRATE: Now, Mr. Saunders, you
have been served with a copy of this Notice?

MR. SAUNDERS: Right.

MAGISTRATE: And this is your signature on
the bottom, admitting it?

MR. SAUNDERS: Yes.

MAGISTRATE: That is a copy of what I have
here now?

MR. SAUNDERS: Yes, that is correct.

[Page 136]

EXHIBIT
1.

NOTICE.

The Notice of Application which became Exhibit 1
is not available, but the appellant has produced what he says was the Notice
served upon him.

Three of the affidavits, which are referred to
in this passage, had been filed by the Crown in relation to the first
application for habeas corpus to meet the allegation of insufficiency of
notice.

The affidavit of Magistrate Hunter stated:

7. That on the 28th day of March, 1958, at
Cloverdale in the Province of British Columbia, in the presence of Francis
Stewart Sanders and Crown Counsel Mr. A. Kenneth Thompson, evidence
was tendered to me that satisfied me that Francis Stewart Sanders had received
seven clear days’ notice in writing of an application under Section 661 of the
Criminal Code of Canada as it then was, to have the said Francis Stewart
Sanders declared to be a criminal sexual psychopath and to have him sentenced
to preventive detention.

The affidavit of the Crown Prosecutor,
Mr. Thompson, stated:

7. That I recall that Notice was given to
Francis Stewart Sanders of our intention to proceed against him as a criminal
sexual psychopath and I recall proving in Court to the satisfaction of the
Magistrate that the proper Notice had been given, but I am not now able to say
on what date the Notice was served upon Francis Stewart Sanders.

The affidavit of Corporal Dempsey of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police stated as follows:

4. That before the hearing to have Francis
Stewart Sanders declared a criminal sexual psychopath commenced, I personally
served on Francis Stewart Sanders a copy of the Notice of Application to have him
declared to be a sexual psychopath.

5. That the aforesaid service took place at
the Court House at Cloverdale, in the Municipality of Surrey in the Province of
British Columbia.

6. That I verily believe that the said
Notice was served by me on the said Francis Stewart Sanders at least seven
clear days before the commencement

[Page 137]

of the hearing, because this was the first
application of this nature in which I had been involved, and I clearly recall
reading the provisions of the then Criminal Code of Canada, namely Sections 661
and 662, before attending to the service on Francis Stewart Sanders.

The appellant filed an affidavit, which, for the
first time, referred to the notice of application dated March 31, 1958, which
he admitted having received. This affidavit did not state where or when it was
served upon him, or, in the alternative, that he did not remember either of
those matters. Instead, the affidavit says:

18. That I was not given any verbal or
written Notice prior to my Election and plea on March 6th, 1958, that a further
charge would be laid, regarding being a criminal sexual psychopath.

19. That I was not given any verbal or
written Notice of Application at any time before the Raising of the Application
in Court on March 28th, 1958.

20. That I was not given seven clear days
Notice before trial as required by Law, before the Court has jurisdiction to
hold a hearing to determine if the Accused was a criminal sexual psychopath.

On the issue of adequacy of notice, the
affidavit is in the form of an argument to this effect:

1. No notice was received prior to March 28,
1958.

2. The notice is dated March 31, 1958.

3. Corporal Dempsey says that he effected
service at the Court House at Cloverdale.

4. The appellant was only at that Court House
after March 28, on April 15 and 22.

5. If it was served on either of those two
dates, in April, the appellant did not have seven clear days’ notice of the
hearing on April 22.

The relevant sections of the Criminal
Code, as they were at the time of the hearing, are the following:

661. (1) Where an accused is convicted of

(a) an offence under

(i) section 136,

(ii) section 138,

[Page 138]

(iii) section 141,

(iv) section 147,

(v) section 148, or

(vi) section 149; or

(b) an attempt to commit an
offence under a provision mentioned in paragraph (a),

the court may, upon application, before
passing sentence hear evidence as to whether the accused is a criminal sexual
psychopath.

(2) On the hearing of an application under
subsection (1) the court may hear any evidence that it considers
necessary, but shall hear the evidence of at least two psychiatrists, one of
whom shall be nominated by the Attorney General.

(3) Where the court finds that the accused
is a criminal sexual psychopath it shall, notwithstanding anything in this Act
or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, sentence the accused to a term of
imprisonment of not less than two years in respect of the offence of which he
was convicted and, in addition, impose a sentence of preventive detention.

662. (1) The following provisions apply
with respect to applications under this Part, namely,

* *
*

(b) an application under
subsection (1) of section 661 shall not be heard unless seven clear
days’ notice thereof has been given to the accused by the prosecutor and a copy
of the notice has been filed with the clerk of the court or with the
magistrate, where the magistrate is acting under Part XVI.

(2) An application under this Part shall be
heard and determined before sentence is passed for the offence of which the
accused is convicted and shall be heard by the court without a jury.

The scheme of these provisions is that, upon a
person being convicted of one of the named offences, the court which convicted
that person is empowered, before imposing sentence, to hear further evidence as
to whether the person convicted is a criminal sexual psychopath. If he is found
to be such, the court must impose a sentence of not less than two years in
respect of the offence charged, and, in addition, a sentence of preventive
detention. The hearing of the further evidence is not a new proceeding. It is a
continuation of the proceedings which led to

[Page 139]

the conviction, and such hearing is for the
purpose of determining the sentence to be imposed.

The present application for habeas corpus, with
certiorari in aid, was dismissed by Wilson C.J. His reasons are set out in his
report to the Court of Appeal, as follows:

I have little to report on this matter. The
same conviction was dealt with by Mr. Justice Branca on a previous
application for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid and his written reasons,
dismissing the application, were handed down November 23, 1965. I cannot
improve on them. Generally I may say that since the warrant of committal was
not attacked I could see no opening for habeas corpus. So far as certiorari was
involved I thought Section 682 of the Criminal Code a bar and also thought that
the application must be dismissed for the reasons given by Branca J., as he
then was.

Section 682 provides as follows:

682. No conviction or order shall be
removed by certiorari

(a) where an appeal was
taken, whether or not the appeal has been carried to a conclusion, or

(b) where the defendant
appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried, and an appeal might have been
taken, but the defendant did not appeal.

In the Court of Appeal, counsel for the Crown
conceded that certiorari would lie if the magistrate acted in the matter
without jurisdiction, in the sense that he was without power to hear the
Crown’s application ab initio, if the appellant had not in fact been given
seven days’ notice.

On the first argument before this Court on
December 5, 1968, counsel were requested to file written submissions respecting
the application of s. 682 and these were filed. The appeal was
subsequently reargued before the full Court on June 2, 1969.

In my opinion s. 682 does prevent the
removal of the magistrate’s order by certiorari, for these reasons:

1. The sentence of preventive detention was an
order.

[Page 140]

2. The appellant had appeared before the magistrate.
He pleaded guilty to the charge under s. 149. Upon his conviction for that
offence, the court which had convicted him was empowered and required, upon
application, to hear the additional evidence as to whether or not the appellant
was a criminal sexual psychopath, and to impose sentence accordingly. No
further plea in relation to this inquiry was necessary.

3. He appeared on the hearing of the further
evidence as to whether he was a criminal sexual psychopath and that issue was
determined on the merits.

4. He could have appealed, under s. 667(1),
against the sentence of preventive detention, but he failed to do so within the
time limited.

In my opinion these circumstances bring this
case within the application of s, 682(b) of the Code.

It is, however, contended by the appellant that
it cannot be said that “the merits were tried”, as required by s. 682(b),
if the appellant did not receive the seven days’ clear notice provided for in
s. 662(1)(b) because, in that event, the court would lack
jurisdiction to hear the matter, and so there would be no trial at all.

If it can be said that those words can only be
applicable in a case where the court had jurisdiction, s. 682(b)
ceases to have any real meaning. The writ of certiorari is primarily concerned
with the matter of jurisdiction of an inferior court. In R. v. Nat Bell
Liquors, Limited[9], Lord
Sumner, at the foot of page 154, describes the object of a writ of certiorari
as follows: “The object is to examine the proceedings in the inferior Court to
see whether its order has been made within its jurisdiction.”

If the object of certiorari is to see whether an
order has been made within the jurisdiction of an inferior court, and if
certiorari is still available, notwithstanding s. 682(b), in any
case in which the court lacked jurisdiction, then it would appear that the
provision accomplishes very little. If the court had jurisdiction, certiorari
would not lie,

[Page 141]

altogether apart from s. 682. If the court
lacked jurisdiction, then, if this submission is correct, certiorari is
available despite s. 682.

In my opinion the section was intended to
apply, and by its terms does apply in a situation where, in the absence of the
section, the jurisdiction of the court might have been questioned on
certiorari. If the accused has appeared before the inferior court, and has
entered a plea, and if, thereafter, the court has proceeded to try the issue
raised by that plea upon the merits, then the accused, if he wishes to attempt
to set aside the court’s decision, must, if he is given by law a right to
appeal, seek his redress by way of appeal only. The intention of this
section was to preclude the co-existence of two remedies in those cases to
which it applies, and to compel resort to appeal procedures where they are available.

I am not overlooking the fact that certiorari is
also a remedy in a case where there is a failure to observe the law in the
exercise of jurisdiction as well as in a case where there has been an excess of
jurisdiction. Lord Sumner, in the Nat Bell case, supra, referring
to the supervision of a superior court over an inferior tribunal, said, at
p. 156:

That supervision goes to two points: one is
the area of inferior jurisdiction and the qualifications and conditions of its
exercise; the other is the observance of the law in the course of its exercise.

There is, however, nothing in the wording of
s. 682 which purports to limit its application only to cases in which the
proceedings before the inferior court are being attacked on the basis of
failure to observe the law in the exercise of jurisdiction, e.g., error of law
on the face of the record. By its terms it applies, in any case falling within
its provisions, to any attempt to remove a conviction or order by certiorari.

Notwithstanding what appear to me to be the
clear terms of s. 682, there have been decisions, in provincial courts,
holding that the section does not constitute a bar to certiorari in what
are sometimes referred to as “exceptional cases.”

[Page 142]

In Re Thibault[10], Aikins J. said this:

Sec. 682 is couched in language of the
utmost clarity and if the intention of parliament in enacting this
section was to wholly take away the power of a superior court to grant certiorari
in those cases which fall within sec. 682, it is difficult to see how
more apt or cogent language could have been selected.

However, in view of the position taken by
crown counsel that, notwithstanding the provisions of sec. 682, in
exceptional circumstances certiorari will still lie, and bearing in mind
the general principle that where an inferior court exceeds its jurisdiction,
even an express provision against certiorari is ineffective to deprive a
superior court of this jurisdiction: See In re Trade Union Act. 1944; Bruton
v. Regina City Policemen’s Assn., Local No. 155 (1945) 2 WWR 273 (Sask.
C.A.); Re Toronto Newspaper Guild and Globe Printing Co. (1953) 2 SCR
18, 106 CCC 225, affirming (1952) OR 345, 102 CCC 318; and Re Dauphin (Town)
and Director of Public Welfare and Close (1955-56) 17 WWR 628, 63
Man R 532, 23 CR 222, affirmed (1956) 19 WWR 97, 24 CR 238. I proceed on the
assumption that in exceptional circumstances the remedy of certiorari is
still available in respect of a conviction, notwithstanding the provisions of
sec. 682.

In R. v. Phillips[11], Hall C.J.Q.B., as he then was,
held that certiorari would lie in a case where the information was bad in law,
for duplicity, on the basis that the proceedings were invalid ab initio.

In Re Krakat[12], Hughes J. held that the
circumstances of the case were “so exceptional” that the writ could be issued
“ex debito justitiae.” The matter of complaint in that case was the conduct of
the trial by the magistrate.

In R. v. White[13], Riley J. said at p. 357:

I am of the opinion that the jurisdiction
of the superior court, bearing in mind the doctrines of

[Page 143]

“exceptional circumstances,” and “denial of
natural justice” and “complete absence of jurisdiction,” is not ousted by the
above statutory provision, and it would require a much more strenuously framed
section so to do.

These are examples of cases where certiorari has
issued despite the provisions of s. 682. The “exceptional cases” where
this has been done include those in which it was said that there was absence of
jurisdiction or a denial of natural justice. With respect to the views therein
expressed, it does appear to me, as has been stated earlier in these reasons,
that these are the very cases in which certiorari is the normal remedy. In
saying that although Parliament has decreed in the broadest terms that this
remedy shall not be available if the accused has pleaded, the merits tried, and
a right of appeal exists, the court may still permit the issue of the writ,
these decisions seem to me to constitute a refusal by the courts to apply the
section in a case which the court regards as “exceptional.”

The cases so far cited are trial decisions. I
now turn to consider those cases in which the matter has been considered by a
court of appeal. I am considering only cases which were decided after 1955,
because the provisions of s. 682(b) are substantially different
from the former s. 1129 of the earlier Code.

We were referred to two cases in the
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, R. ex. rel. Lotochinski v. Antonenko[14] and Re Wilfong[15]. In both cases certiorari was
refused. In the former case Gordon J.A. cites with approval a statement by
McKay J. in R. ex rel Sanderson v. Eremko[16] that: “Where there is a right of
appeal from a summary conviction, a certiorari should not be granted except
under special circumstances.” The case cited was determined long before
s. 682(b) was enacted, and there is no discussion of that provision
in the Antonenko case.

[Page 144]

In the latter case s. 682 is not discussed.
Reference was made to the decision of this Court in Smith v. R.[17] as follows, at p. 614:

With all respect, I do not think the
principle adopted in Reg. v. Gerald X. (or G.S.), supra, is applicable
to this case. The Supreme Court held in that case that where the court had
acted without jurisdiction, or in excess of jurisdiction, the order, though discretionary,
would be granted ex debito justitiae. In my view there is a great
difference between the case where the court so acts, and the case where the
court, acting within its jurisdiction, makes an order which may be bad in law: Vide
Rex v. Stafford JJ. (1940) 2 KB 33, 109 LJKB 584; and Reg. v.
Campbell (1956) 1 WLR 622, (1956) 2 All ER 280. In the former case the
right to proceed by way of certiorari is granted ex debito justitiae,
but in the latter, this is not necessarily so.

I will be discussing the effect of the Smith case
later in these reasons.

The Court of Appeal of British Columbia, in R.
v. Fawcus[18], refused
certiorari and did not have to decide whether s. 682 would have been a
bar. Maclean J.A., giving the judgment of the Court, said, at p. 98:

Having reached this conclusion it is not
necessary for me to decide whether s. 682(b) is a bar to certiorari
in this case. It was argued by respondent’s counsel that in “special
circumstances” the section would not apply. All I can say is that I doubt whether
there could be any “special circumstances” short of a complete lack of
jurisdiction ab initio which would prevent the full application of
s. 682(b) in a case where the applicant had an unrestricted right
of appeal by way of trial de novo.

In Manitoba, in Dauphin (Town) v. Director of
Public Welfare[19], Schultz
J.A., delivering the judgment of the Court, said, at p. 101, in referring
to the reasons of DuVal J., the trial judge:

DuVal, J. comes to a conclusion he expresses in
these words:

“The writ of certiorari, at common
law, is a prerogative writ to which, notwithstanding any

[Page 145]

statutory provisions to the contrary,
recourse may be had in order to control the action of inferior jurisdictions
and bring them back within the limits assigned by law, whenever there has been
a failure, an absence, or an excess of jurisdiction.”

This statement, in effect, says that where an
inferior court exceeds its jurisdiction nothing Parliament says to the contrary
is effective in restricting the power of the superior court to grant certiorari.
The literal interpretation of sec. 682(a) seems to leave
little doubt as to the intention of the legislation; that intention was to
remove the right of certiorari where “an appeal was taken.” Legislative
intention seldom has been expressed in words less ambiguous or more free from
doubt as to their meaning. Nevertheless an examination of the authorities would
seem to indicate that DuVal, J. was correct in his statement of the law. He
refers to the oft-quoted-and-followed opinion of Martin, C.J.S. in Bruton v.
Regina City Policemen’s Association (1945) 2 WWR 273, at 283, where the
learned Chief Justice states:

“In Canada it has been repeatedly held that
an express statutory abolition of certiorari does not oust the power of
the court to issue the writ or to quash a conviction if justices have acted
without jurisdiction, for in such a case the inferior court has not brought
itself within the terms of the statute taking away certiorari; even
express words do not take away the supervising power of a superior court when
there is want of jurisdiction in the inferior court.”

This case has been adopted in a number of cases
to be found in Tremeear’s Supplement, supra, at p. 360. DuVal, J.
refers in particular to In re Toronto Newspaper Guild and Globe Printing Co.
(1953) 2 SCR 18, and concludes:

“It would appear that no prohibition that
does not expressly take away the inherent power of the superior court to
exercise this very special remedy of certiorari is effective where the
inferior court or administrative tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction or has
declined jurisdiction.”

In answer to this reasoning, I prefer the view
expressed by Laidlaw J.A., in the Ontario Court of Appeal, in R. v. Kennedy[20]:

It may be said at the outset that a no
certiorari clause such as is contained in s. 682 was not designed 19
[1958] O.W.N. 41 at 44, 119 C.C.C. 200.

[Page 146]

or introduced into the legislation in order
to give validity to proceedings leading to conviction or an order of the Court
in cases where the Court had no jurisdiction. The section in the statute
was not intended to shelter an inferior Court or to permit a denial of
substantive justice by a pretended exercise of jurisdiction. But it appears to
me that the purpose of s. 682(b) was to prohibit two courses of
proceedings at the option or choice of a person seeking to overcome and set
aside a conviction or order of an inferior Court.

When dealing with the possible application of
s. 682 in the Court below, reference was made, as it was also made in Dauphin
v. Director of Public Welfare, supra, to Toronto Newspaper Guild, Local
87, American Newspaper Guild v. Globe Printing Company[21]. The Court in that case was dealing
with the conduct of an administrative board created by The Labour Relations
Act, 1948 (Ont.), c. 51, which statute provided that the orders, decisions
and rulings of the Board should be final and that the Board should not be
restrained by certiorari or otherwise.

Kerwin J., as he then was, at p. 23, said
this:

We start with the proposition that when an
administrative tribunal has been set up by a paramount legislative body it is
the intention that such tribunal keep within the powers conferred upon it. In
England and in Canada the decisions have been uniform that a Superior Court is
invested with the power and duty of seeing that such a tribunal as the Ontario
Labour Relations Board does not act without jurisdiction.

This statement is in line with the view
expressed in a number of decisions which hold that the enactment of a finality
clause will not enable an inferior tribunal, by its own decision, to exceed its
statutory jurisdiction. This proposition is based, as Kerwin J. indicates, on
the presumed intention of the legislative body which creates such a tribunal
that it is not to be permitted to exceed the powers conferred upon it by the
legislation which created it, even though the legislation purports to make its
decisions final.

[Page 147]

Section 682 of the Criminal Code is a
part of a complete code dealing with criminal law, and is contained in Part
XXIII wherein Parliament has legislated respecting the application, in criminal
proceedings, of the extraordinary remedies of certiorari, habeas corpus,
mandamus and prohibition. It is not a finality clause. It does not purport to
enable an inferior tribunal to exceed its jurisdiction, or to make its decision
as to its own jurisdiction final. What it does say is that if a person has
taken an appeal from a decision, he shall not thereafter be entitled to
certiorari. It also say that if a person pleads, and the case is tried on the
merits, then, if there is a right to appeal that decision, which is not
exercised, he shall not, thereafter, be entitled to certiorari.

A person who challenges the jurisdiction of a
tribunal which proposes to try him can take objection to the jurisdiction and
refuse to plead, in which event certiorari is available to him. But, if he does
plead, and the case then proceeds to a trial of the merits, and if he has a
right of appeal, his challenge to the jurisdiction can then only be made by way
of appeal.

There can be no doubt of the power of Parliament
thus to limit the exercise of an extraordinary remedy, and it has done so in
clear terms. Nor is there room here for implying a presumed intention that
certiorari be available to compel an inferior tribunal to keep within its
powers, because the obvious intention of s. 682 is that it is the
procedure by way of appeal, and not certiorari, that, where available, should
be used for that purpose.

Does this view of the effect of s. 682 run
counter to the judgment of this Court in Smith v. R., supra? In my
opinion it does not. That case involved a finding by a judge of the Winnipeg
Juvenile Court that the appellant was a delinquent. An application that the
finding be quashed without the actual issue of a writ of certiorari was
dismissed, and an appeal to the Court of Appeal from that dismissal failed. An
appeal to this Court was then taken successfully. I have examined the factums
filed on the appeal and the

[Page 148]

possible application of s. 682 was never
raised. No reference to the section is made in the reasons of this Court.
The possible application of s. 682 was not considered in that case. I do
not think the section could have been raised successfully because it seems
to be clear that the juvenile was not given a proper opportunity to plead and
he did not plead.

Reference has been made to the judgment of the
House of Lords in Crane v. Director of Public Prosecutions[22], as an example of a trial before a
court of competent jurisdiction, which was declared to be a nullity. In that
case two prisoners, indicted separately, had been tried together, and both the
Court of Criminal Appeal and the House of Lords held that the proceedings were
a nullity.

The case has no direct application to the
circumstances of this case, but it is of interest in that the procedure, by
means of which this finding was obtained, was by way of appeal from the
conviction. If Crane had not exercised his right of appeal, his conviction,
though the result of proceedings which, when examined on appeal, were held to
be a nullity, could not otherwise have been attacked, since it would appear
that in that case, which had been tried before a Recorder at Quarter Sessions,
proceedings by way of certiorari would not have been available (R. v. Boaler[23]; R. v. Justice of the Central Criminal
Court[24]; R.
v. Chairman, County of London Quarter Sessions[25]).

My interpretation of s. 682 does not
necessarily involve the conclusion that Parliament intended that that which was
a nullity should be validated. Even proceedings which are a nnullity, as in the
Crane case, can only be shown to have been a nullity by means of some
procedure before a higher court. Parliament can prescribe the nature of such a
procedure, and, in my view, in s. 682 has stated, in clear terms, that, in
any case falling within its provisions, that procedure must be by way of
appeal, and by that means only.

[Page 149]

I do not regard this interpretation as involving
the “monstrous consequences” contemplated by Lord Kenyon in relation to a
section of the bankruptcy statute under consideration in Fowler v.
Padget[26], but,
no matter what are the consequences, my view is that it is the function of
Parliament to consider whether they are such as to necessitate any amendment.

In my opinion s. 682(b) is a bar to
the removal of the order in this case by certiorari.

In view of this opinion it is unnecessary for me
to express any view on the issue which was raised before us as to whether, in
the light of the provisions of s. 691 of the Criminal Code, this
Court has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from the refusal by the Court of
Appeal to grant certiorari.

The other issue to be determined is the appeal
from the refusal to grant a writ of habeas corpus. The appellant is given an
express right of appeal on this issue by s. 691(3) of the Criminal
Code. For the appellant it was contented that the warrant of committal was
defective in that it did not disclose that the magistrate had acquired
jurisdiction by the prosecutor having given to the appellant seven clear days’
notice of the application, which is the notice required by s. 662(1)(b)
of the Criminal Code.

The warrant recited that:

Whereas Francis Stewart SANDERS hereinafter
called the “accused,” was this day convicted upon a charge that Francis Stewart
SANDERS between the 1st day of December, A.D. 1957 and the 1st day of March,
A.D. 1958, at or near Newton, B.C., in the Municipality of Surrey being a male
person did unlawfully commit an act of gross indecency with Roy FLACK, another
male person, contrary to the form of Statute in such case made and provided.

Whereas the said Francis Stewart SANDERS
was, pursuant to Section 661 of the Criminal Code of Canada, found to be a
criminal sexual psychopath, and it was adjudged that the accused for his
offence be imprisoned in the British Columbia Penitentiary at New Westminster
for the term of Two (2) Years, and in addition a sentence of preventative
detention.

[Page 150]

The simple issue is whether it was required also
to cite that he had been given seven clear days’ notice of the application.
None of the authorities cited by counsel for the appellant support this
proposition and Form 18, in Part XXVI of the Code, does not appear to make this
a necessary requirement in a warrant of committal. In my opinion this
submission fails.

Even if s. 682(b) were not to be
considered as constituting a bar to proceedings by way of certiorari, it is my
opinion that the appellant’s appeal fails on the merits.

There is no doubt that the magistrate had jurisdiction
to hear and determine the Crown’s application that, before passing sentence, he
determine whether the appellant was a criminal sexual psychopath. This is not a
case in which a court purports to deal with a subject-matter which it has no
lawful authority to determine. The magistrate was required by s. 662(1)(b)
not to hear the application unless the appellant had received seven clear
days’ notice.

On April 22, 1958, before any evidence on the
application was received, the magistrate was advised by counsel for the Crown,
in the appellant’s presence, that notice had been served upon the appellant,
who was prepared to admit service to avoid the necessity of proof, and the
appellant then admitted service of the written notice, which was filed as an exhibit.
The magistrate knew, at that time, that the appellant had been made aware, on
March 28, of the Crown’s intention to make such an application, because it was
on that date that the appellant, as he admits, had been asked to appoint one of
the two psychiatrists whose evidence would be required upon such application.
On these facts, the magistrate was entitled to infer, as undoubtedly he did,
that all of the requirements respecting notice had been satisfied.

If the admission of service had not been made,
then, if the proof of service had not established that the necessary notice had
been given, the magistrate would have adjourned the hearing until proper notice
had been given.

In the light of these circumstances it was
incumbent upon the appellant, when he applied

[Page 151]

for certiorari in May, 1967, on the ground that
he had not received adequate notice, to establish that fact by clear and
positive evidence. He admitted receipt of the notice. He did not say when he
received it. He did not say where it was served upon him. Nor did he say that
he did not remember when or where he received it. He says only, by way of
argument, that, on the basic of Corporal Dempsey’s affidavit as to the place of
service, and his own statement as to the dates when he was at that place, he
could not have had seven clear days’ notice.

As against this, we have the affidavit of the
magistrate that he was satisfied that seven clear days’ notice had been given,
the affidavit of the Crown Prosecutor that he proved to the satisfaction of the
magistrate that proper notice had been given, and the affidavit of Corporal
Dempsey, who recalls reading the requirements of the section as to notice,
and who states his belief that at least seven days’ notice was given.

The copy of the notice, which the appellant
produced as being the one served upon him, is dated March 31, 1958, and gives
notice of an application to be made, pursuant to s. 661(1) of the Criminal
Code, at the Court Room, Municipal Hall, Cloverdale, B.C., on April 15,
1958. The contention raised in the appellant’s affidavit is that, if Corporal
Dempsey’s affidavit as to service on the appellant at Cloverdale is correct, he
must have been served on either April 15, or April 22, 1958. This contention,
however, also involves the conclusion that although Corporal Dempsey read the
requirements as to notice, which call for seven clear days, he nonetheless
served the appellant on the very date set in the notice for the hearing, or one
week after that date. This, in the absence of any statement by the appellant as
to where or when he was served, I find it hard to accept.

I agree with the reasons of the majority of the
Court of Appeal, as delivered by Tysoe J.A., who said:

It seems to me this is particularly a case
where the appellant must produce convincing proof of his allegation that seven
clear days’ notice was not given him. As I have earlier said, I have no doubt
he

[Page 152]

knows very well when and where the notice
was given to him. Yet he has not seen fit to pledge his oath to these matters.
In the light of all the circumstances, I am of the opinion that the appellant
has not come forward with evidence of sufficient cogency to justify the court
in saying he has discharged the onus of proof that is upon him.

I would, therefore, dismiss this appeal.

HALL J. (dissenting)—I agree
fully with the reasons of my brother the Chief Justice. I have only some
observations to make regarding the interpretation and effect of s. 682 of
the Criminal Code. That section reads:

682. No conviction or order shall be
removed by certiorari

(a) where an appeal was
taken, whether or not the appeal has been carried to a conclusion, or

(b) where the defendant
appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried, and an appeal might have been
taken, but the defendant did not appeal.

The view that this section denies the right
to remove the order in question here requires holding that a person convicted
in a proceeding which is in law a nullity is without recourse by certiorari when
that person might have appealed and it is one I cannot accept. Section 682 does
not, in my opinion, achieve that result. I refuse to impute such an intention
to Parliament. I believe that when Parliament said “where the defendant
appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried,” it meant a lawful trial or
hearing and not a proceeding which was in law a nullity.

Parliament specified that the section would
be operative when:

(1) An appeal was taken; or

(2)(a) Where the defendant appeared;

(b) Where the defendant pleaded;

(c) The merits were tried;

(d) An appeal might have been
taken.

Each of the above conditions is as essential as
the others. Here, as the Chief Justice points out,

[Page 153]

no plea was taken nor was there any provision
for the taking of a plea. That fact cannot be ignored. Section 682 can be
invoked only when all its provisos have been met.

It is said that Parliament, by s. 682, has
decreed in the broadest terms that certiorari shall not be available if
the conditions named in the section exist. I recognize that the language
used in s. 682 is quite explicit, but it is no broader or more explicit
than that found in many statutes which contain privitive clauses of which the Labour
Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, is an example. The section in that
Act, being s. 80, reads as follows:

No decision, order, direction, declaration
or ruling of the Board shall be questioned or reviewed in any court, and no
order shall be made or process entered, or proceedings taken in any court,
whether by way of injunction, declaratory judgment, certiorari, mandamus,
prohibition, quo warranto, or otherwise, to question, review, prohibit or
restrain the Board or any of its proceedings.

Another example is that to be found in the Trade
Union Act, 1944, 2nd Sess., c. 69 (Sask), which was dealt with by Martin C.J.S.
in Bruton v. Regina City Policemen’s Association[27]:, when he said:

Sec. 15 of the Act provides that there
shall be no appeal from an order of the Board, and its orders shall not be
reviewable by certiorari. A statutory abolition of the right to certiorari
is not wholly effective, for it is clearly established by authority that,
notwithstanding a provision in a statute abolishing certiorari, the
Courts will still exercise the power to issue the writ where the conviction or
order complained of has been made without jurisdiction. In Colonial Bank of
Australasia v. Willan (1874) L.R. 5 P.C. 417, 43 L.J.P.C. 39, the
authorities are reviewed by Sir James W. Colville in delivering the opinion of
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council after concluding that the statute
in question had taken away the power of the Courts to issue certiorari. See
also Rex v. Nat Bell Liquors, Ltd. (1922) 2 W.W.R. 30, (1922) 2 AC. 128,
91

[Page 154]

L.J.P.C. 146, 37 C.C.C. 129; Halsbury’s
Laws of England, 2nd ed., vol. 9, p. 862; Dillon on Municipal
Corporations, vol. 4, 5th ed., p. 2791.

In Canada it has been repeatedly held that
an express statutory abolition of certiorari does not oust the power of
the Court to issue the writ or to quash a conviction if justices have acted without
jurisdiction, for in such a case the inferior Court has not brought itself
within the terms of the statute taking away certiorari; even express
words do not take away the supervising power of a Superior Court when there is
want of jurisdiction in the inferior Court: Rex v. Collier (1917) 51
N.S.R. 64, 28 C.C.C. 87; Rex v. Slipp; Ex parte Monahan (1928) 54
N.B.R. 550, 51 C.C.C. 15; Rex v. Cook (1908) 18 O.L.R. 215, 14 C.C.C.
495, Anglin, J. at p. 499; Rex v. Yarrow (1922) 51 O.L.R. 509, 38
C.C.C. 269, Meredith, C.J.C.P., p. 271; Rex v. Richmond (1917) 2
W.W.R. 1200, 12 Alta. L.R. 133, 29 C.C.C. 89, Stuart, J., p. 1204.

The explicit language of s. 80 of the Labour
Relations Act above quoted did not impede this Court in Jarvis v.
Associated Medical Services Inc.[28], from
exercising its supervisory jurisdiction by way of certiorari once it
found that the tribunal had exceeded or was without jurisdiction. I am unable
to see any consistency in holding that s. 682 is an absolute bar to certiorari
in a case involving the liberty of the person when equally explicit
enactments denying certiorari in labour relations legislation are not so
regarded. As Cartwright J. (as he then was) said in Jarvis at
p. 502:

The effect of this section, if it receives the
construction most favourable to the appellant, is to oust the jurisdiction of
the superior Courts to interfere with any decision of the Board which is made
in exercise of the powers conferred upon it by the Legislature; within the
ambit of those powers it may

[Page 155]

err in fact or in law; but I cannot take the
section to mean that if the Board purports to make an order which, on the
true construction of the Act, it has no jurisdiction to make the person
affected thereby is left without a remedy;…

No form of words can prohibit this Court from
determining whether the order under review was made by a tribunal having
jurisdiction; in other words, the assumption of jurisdiction by the inferior
tribunal is always an issue. This leads irresistibly to the conclusion that where
there is no jurisdiction there cannot be a trial on the merits within the
meaning of s. 682.

My brother Martland states in his reasons that
he prefers the view expressed by Laidlaw J.A. in the Ontario Court of Appeal in
R. v. Kennedy[29], where
the learned justice of appeal says that it appears to him:

…that the purpose of s. 682(b)
was to prohibit two courses of proceedings at the option or choice of a person
seeking to overcome and set aside a conviction or order of an inferior Court.

In Kennedy the jurisdiction of the
magistrate to enter upon the proceedings was not challenged. In the application
for certiorari it was urged that the magistrate had lost jurisdiction in
that: (1) no evidence was heard; (2) the conviction was made after an
adjournment for more than eight days; (3) the proceedings were conducted
maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause. Laidlaw J.A., after
fully reviewing the record and transcript of the proceedings before the
magistrate, found as a fact that there had been a trial on the merits by virtue
of a plea of “Guilty” entered to the charge in the presence of Kennedy by his
counsel and confirmed by Kennedy himself when the question was put to him
directly by the magistrate. Accordingly it seems clear that Laidlaw J.A.’s statement
went beyond what was necessary for the decision in the case and must be
regarded as obiter dicta. It is manifest also that Laidlaw J.A. was not

[Page 156]

purporting to give a definitive interpretation
to s. 682(b) because he introduced his statement above
quoted by saying:

It appears to me that the primary question
for consideration in this appeal is whether or not the accused had a right to
remove the proceedings before the Magistrate by certiorari into the higher
Court. Section 682(b) of the Criminal Code expressly provides
that no conviction or order shall be removed by certiorari “where the defendant
appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried and an appeal might have been
taken, but the defendant did not appeal.” It may be said at the outset that a
no certiorari clause such as is contained in s. 682 was not designed or
introduced into the legislation in order to give validity to proceedings
leading to conviction or an order of the Court in cases where the Court had no
jurisdiction. The section in the statute was not intended to shelter an
inferior Court or to permit a denial of substantive justice by a pretended
exercise of jurisdiction. (Emphasis added)

These last two sentences show that Laidlaw J.A.
was not regarding s. 682(b) as an absolute bar to certiorari but
only in cases where there had been a trial on the merits and an appeal might
have been taken.

One has but to appreciate the rigid conditions
precedent relating to the right to appeal from a summary conviction court under
ss. 722 and 724 of the Criminal Code (see R. v. Perehudoff[30] which followed Dennis v. The
Queen[31] to
see how erroneous Laidlaw J.A.’s obiter statement is as a general
proposition.

Section 724(1)(b), for instance,
provides:

724. (1) The following provisions apply in
respect of appeals to the appeal court, namely,

* *
*

(b) where an appeal is from a
conviction or order adjudging that a fine or sum of money be paid and imposing
a term of imprisonment in default of payment, the appellant shall

[Page 157]

(i) remain in custody until the appeal is
heard,

(ii) enter into a recognizance, or (iii)
deposit with the summary conviction court the amount of the fine or the sum of
money to be paid and an additional amount that, in the opinion of the summary
conviction court, is sufficient to cover the costs of the appeal;

This means that a person purportedly convicted
by a summary conviction court and sentenced to a fine of, say, $500 and in
default of payment to imprisonment for six months must, under s. 724(1)(b)
above, either remain in custody or enter into a recognizance in such amount
as may be ordered (which would be an amount in excess of $500) or deposit with
the Court the amount called for by s. 724(1)(b)(iii). He must do
one of these things even though the person constituting the Court under
s. 692(1)(g) was not in fact a person holding any judicial
office as required by that subsection. If the person so convicted did not
appeal but remained in custody for more than sixty days until his right to
appeal had lapsed, he could have redress and be released by habeas corpus and
that means that the interpretation put upon s. 682 in Kennedy that
s. 682 was enacted to prohibit two courses of proceedings at the option of
a person convicted falls. If, on the other hand, the person so convicted pays
the fine and costs and does not appeal within the sixty days and does not find
out that the conviction was made by one who was not a judicial officer until
after the time for appealing has passed, he would be, under the Kennedy interpretation
of s. 682, without redress at law and would have to carry the conviction
for the rest of his life. I cannot accept the view that Parliament ever
intended to put a person so convicted under such a handicap where the so-called
conviction was made by a volunteer or by one whose term of office had expired
when the “conviction” was made.

The example just given may be said to be one
that may not often occur, but instances of con-

[Page 158]

victions being made by magistrates whose
commissions had expired or been revoked are known. Then there are instances of
magistrates with limited territorial jurisdiction who have purported to convict
for an offence committed outside their territorial jurisdiction. Other examples
are readily available such as where the conviction fails to disclose an offence
known to the law. It cannot be doubted that a purported conviction which
discloses no offence known to the law is anything but a nullity: Rex v.
Perron[32],
Regina v. Jones[33], and
the very recent case of Regina v. Vallee[34] in which the Court of Appeal for
British Columbia held that certiorari was available despite s. 682
even after a person convicted by a magistrate had appealed unsuccessfully to
the County Court under Part XXIV of the Code where the “conviction” was
for an “offence” not known to the law.

Crane v. Director of Public Prosecutions[35] is an interesting case in point on the
effect of proceedings which are a nullity although heard by a Court that
clearly had jurisdiction to deal with the matter in the first place. In that
case the House of Lords held that a trial at the Leicester Quarter Sessions was
a nullity because two prisoners, indicted separately, were given in charge to
the same jury and tried together. The fact that the prisoners were not jointly
indicted was not brought to the notice of the Recorder or of counsel
appearing in the case. Lord Parmoor said of the proceedings before the
Recorder:

“…there has only been a form of trial which is
void ab initio…” and “In a void trial there is neither conviction,
verdict or judgment.” Yet if the Kennedy interpretation is accepted as
my brother Martland holds it should be, the result is that Parliament is said
to have enacted that what is in law a nullity, something void ab initio, is
nevertheless to stand for all time as a lawful conviction against a person who
was unlawfully convicted once the time for the limited right of appeal under
Part XXIV of the Code has passed.

[Page 159]

Crane is not a certiorari
case because the Court of first instance there was sitting as a Court of
Oyer and Terminer to try prisoners on indictment and was not an inferior court
nor was the Court in R. v. Chairman, County of London Quarter Sessions. The
same observation applies to the cases of The King v. Justices of the Central
Criminal Court[36] and
Reg. v. Boaler[37], the
Central Criminal Court being a superior court whose proceedings and decisions
are not subject to review by certiorari. Therefore, the fact that certiorari
was not available in Crane and the other three cases just mentioned
is not relevant. No enactment similar to s. 682 entered into the
consideration of these cases.

When Parliament enacted s. 682, it was not
done to prescribe or establish a remedy for declaring some void procedure a
nullity. Instead Parliament was purporting to deprive a citizen of his ancient
right to have that which is in law a nullity or made without or in excess of
jurisdiction so declared by recourse to the prerogative writ of certiorari, a
right which did not originate with Parliament. Accordingly, if Parliament is to
extinguish that right, it must do so by explicit language, and it said
explicitly that s. 682 is only to be applied where “the defendant appeared
and pleaded and the merits were tried”. Section 682 did not grant a remedy, but
purported to extinguish a right.

All of which impels me to say that I must refuse
to impute such an intention to Parliament adopting the language of Lord Kenyon
in Fowler v. Padget[38], where
he said:

I would adopt any construction of the
statute that the words will bear, in order to avoid such monstrous consequences
as would manifestly ensue from the construction contended for…

I would, accordingly, allow the appeal as
directed by the Chief Justice.

[Page 160]

PIGEON J. (dissenting)—On March 6, 1958,
appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of gross indecency. Then on April 22,
considering two similar previous convictions, he was sentenced to preventive
detention in addition to the sentence of two years imprisonment for the last
offence. He did not have counsel, did not appeal, but, on the contrary signed,
as authorized by s. 49 of the Penitentiary Act, R.S.C. 1952, c.
206, a waiver of his right of appeal. Only after more than five years of
imprisonment did he embark upon the numerous proceedings mentioned by my
brethren. This appeal is from a judgment affirming the dismissal of an
application for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid.

I must say at the outset, that, in my opinion,
proceedings leading to a sentence of preventive detention constitute a separate
issue distinct from the charge following which they are instituted, while, on
the contrary, the sentence imposed following a conviction is part of the issue
arising out of the charge. The character of being a separate issue appears from
a consideration of the provisions of the Criminal Code respecting
preventing detention (Part XXI) as a whole and especially from s. 667
concerning the right of appeal in such cases. The decisions of our Court
allowing appeals from such judgments by special leave under s. 41 of the Supreme
Court Act notwithstanding the exception of any judgment “acquitting or
convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an
indictable offence”, necessarily imply that a sentence of preventive detention
is pronounced in an issue separate from that in which the conviction arises (Poole
v. The Queen[39]).

It should be noted here that when Parliament, in
1947, (c. 55, s. 18) first enacted provisions for preventive detention, no
amendment to the Criminal Code was made concerning remedies other than
the right of appeal. Whereas in respect of those new proceedings a right of
appeal

[Page 161]

from the sentence was explicitly provided for,
no amendment was made to Part XXII, Extraordinary Remedies. The new Criminal
Code brought no change in that regard and nothing is to be found in it
referring specifically to such proceedings under the heading Extraordinary
Remedies (Part XXIII). In particular, Section 682 reads as follows:

682. No conviction or order shall be
removed by certiorari

(a) where an appeal was
taken, whether or not the appeal has been carried to a conclusion, or

(b) where the defendant
appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried, and an appeal might have been
taken, but the defendant did not appeal.

How is subsection (b) above to be
applied to a sentence of preventive detention when the procedure on an
application for such a sentence does not provide for a plea by the accused? Are
we to say that because he is only called upon to appear, it will suffice that
he did appear and did not appeal, to deprive him of any remedy by certiorari?
In a criminal matter, this does not seem possible. The deprivation of a
right can only result from an explicit enactment. If the provisions found in
the Code do not apply exactly because one of the conditions cannot be
met, the same conclusion must be reached as under s. 41 of the Supreme
Court Act: the privative provision not being literally applicable to a
sentence of preventive detention, it cannot be applied thereto by analogy or by
extension, such a construction of a privative clause as s. 682 of the Criminal
Code would be, I think, without precedent in British jurisprudence.

The special provisions enacted for the right of
appeal show that when Parliament introduced preventive detention into our
criminal law, the necessity of providing explicitly for the right of appeal mutatis
mutandis was seen, the ordinary provisions concerning appeals on
proceedings by indictment not being literally applicable to this

[Page 162]

new kind of proceeding. Until similar provisions
concerning extraordinary remedies are laid down, we cannot do otherwise than to
apply the law as it reads. For this reason, I am of the opinion that the
appellant is in the same situation as in Smith v. The Queen[40], he has not pleaded.

Having concluded that appellant is entitled to certiorari,
I must now say that, in my opinion, the record shows that it was not proved
before Magistrate Hunter that seven clear days’ notice was given as required
imperatively by s. 662 of the Criminal Code. The record indicates
that at the hearing before the Magistrate, instead of proving service of the
notice by the testimony of the officer who served it, a voluntary statement
before the Court by the accused was resorted to. The transcript supplied by the
Court reporter is as follows:

CROWN: Your Worship, you will recall in
this matter, the previous hearing, I made application under Section 661(1) of
the Criminal Code and Notice has been served upon the Accused and the Accused
is prepared to admit it, to avoid the necessity of proof.

MAGISTRATE: Now, Mr. Saunders, you
have been served with a copy of this Notice?

MR. SAUNDERS: Right.

MAGISTRATE: And this is your signature on
the bottom, admitting it?

MR. SAUNDERS: Yes.

MAGISTRATE: That is a copy of what I have
here now?

MR. SAUNDERS: Yes, that is correct.

EXHIBIT
1, NOTICE.

Unfortunately, the exhibit is lost; in the
record, there is only the copy which was served upon the accused and that he
recently filed with one of his affidavits.

[Page 163]

It will be noticed that appellant’s admission
covers only the service of the notice. No reference whatsoever is made to the
date of the service, nor to the prescribed interval between the day of service
and that of the hearing. In a civil case, such an admission might be sufficient
due to the rule that the parties are bound by the manner in which the
proceedings were conducted. In my opinion, it cannot be so in a criminal case,
in face of an imperative requirement of the law and especially where the
accused did not have the assistance of counsel. The principle to be followed is
that which applies where no objection is made to illegal evidence; in a
criminal matter, this omission does not necessarily cover the illegality.

Moreover, I doubt that the appellant could
validly admit having received the notice required by Section 662. The last
subsection is as follows:

(3) For the purposes of section 660,
where the accused admits the allegations contained in the notice referred to in
paragraph (b) of subsection (1), no proof of those
allegations is required.

(Even if the amendment was only made the
following year (1959, c. 71, s. 30), one must obviously read paragraph (a)
and not paragraph (b) in view of the reference to the
purposes of Section 660).

To say that “for the purposes of Section 660”
(habitual criminals), it is not necessary to prove the allegations contained in
the notice if the accused admits them, undoubtedly implies that it is always
necessary to prove the facts required to be established for the purposes of
s. 661 (criminal sexual psychopaths), otherwise the provision would be
entirely useless. Here, we are concerned with the application of s. 661:
it is therefore clear that the accused could not dispense from proving the
facts by admitting them. Without expressing a firm opinion on this point, I fail
to see how it can be held that this rule

[Page 164]

does not apply to the proof of a fact as
essential to the validity of such proceedings as the service of a seven clear
days’ notice, without which Parliament expressly forbids the hearing to take
place.

It must now be observed that nothing shows that
there was on the exhibit that was lost a date of service showing that the
required time had been allowed. There is no such date on the copy filed by the
appellant. It is true that he himself does not enlighten us on this point, but
legally it cannot be held against him. He does not have to rebut evidence that
is not in the record. He needs only point out its absence.

I do not think that it should be presumed that
the lost exhibit did show that the required interval of seven clear days had
been observed. The sentence having been pronounced by an inferior court, the
observance of the prescribed formalities cannot be presumed. Because the
exhibit was lost, proof by affidavits could no doubt have been made that this did
appear on the document. It was not done.

In his affidavit, the Magistrate merely states
that at the hearing it was proved to his satisfaction that the appellant
received a notice of seven clear days. In saying this, he only repeated his
finding on that point. However, it is well established that an inferior court
judge cannot give himself jurisdiction by making without sufficient evidence a
finding of fact on which his jurisdiction depends. As we have seen, the
admission made by the appellant at the hearing was incomplete and did not show
that an essential requirement had been complied with, namely seven clear days’
notice. In the absence of any other evidence that this fact was proven
otherwise, the only proper legal conclusion is that the Magistrate misapprehended
the admission made by appellant at the hearing. He undoubtedly believed that
appellant had implicitly admitted that the prescribed time had been allowed,
while the actual wording does not warrant such a conclusion.

[Page 165]

As to the Crown prosecutor’s affidavit, it is
sufficient to say that it adds nothing to that of the Magistrate.

There remains the affidavit of the police
officer. He also did not swear that the date of service was entered on the lost
exhibit and that that date was at least seven clear days prior to the date of
the hearing. All he says is that he believes he complied with the legal
requirements because he remembers looking up the requirements of the Code. On
the other hand, he also says that he effected service of the notice at
Cloverdale. But, after March 31, which is the date of the notice according to
the copy filed in the record, the authenticity of which is not disputed,
appellant was at Cloverdale only on April 15 and on April 22, the day of the
hearing. It is therefore impossible for the requirements as to notice to have
been met by service at the place named by the police officer.

Appellant’s affidavit concerning the dates of
his attendance at Cloverdale is not questioned. Furthermore, as he was a
prisoner, the Crown must have been able to verify its accuracy. As no evidence
was submitted to contradict that statement, this fact must now be considered as
proven. The conclusion is that the officer must have been mistaken as to the
required time and that the notice was not of seven clear days. Even if he did
carefully read Section 662, he did not necessarily understand the meaning of
“seven clear days”, nor correctly make the computation and he does not swear
that such is the case. Since he served the notice at Cloverdale, it must have
been on April 15.

On the whole, in my view, the police officer’s
affidavit does not remedy the defect in the record and it does not show that
proper notice was given. This is no doubt an omission which could have been
easily remedied if the accused had raised the point instead of admitting
without protest what he was asked to admit. Once again, in a civil case this
would no doubt amount to a waiver but, in my view, it cannot be so in a
criminal case as against an imperative require-

[Page 166]

ment of the law especially with regard to an
accused who was not assisted by counsel.

Having reached the conclusion that the
Magistrate proceeded without adequate proof of a notice served in accordance
with the requirements of the law, I must now, in view of the provisions of
subs. (1) of s. 683 of the Criminal Code, consider whether the
defect deprived the Magistrate of his jurisdiction. The provision requiring the
notice cannot be more explicit:

An application under subsection (1) of
section 661 shall not be heard unless seven clear days’ notice has
been given to the accused by the prosecutor…

I have underlined the words “shall not be heard”
because to me they necessarily imply that the Magistrate does not have
authority to hear the application unless the notice has really been given. The
law does not say that proof must be produced to the satisfaction of the
Magistrate that the notice was given. It forbids proceeding without notice. I
find it impossible to see in that subsection a provision the observance whereof
Parliament intended the Magistrate to be the judge. On the contrary, Parliament
seems to have clearly intended to make it a condition of jurisdiction.

In L’Alliance des Professeurs catholiques de
Montréal v. La Commission des Relations ouvrières[41], this Court held that the
respondent acted without jurisdiction in cancelling a certificate without
notice to the appellant. In Regina v. County of London Quarter Sessions
Appeals Committee, Ex parte Rossi[42], the
English Court of Appeal, on an application for certiorari, considered an
inferior court as having acted without jurisdiction for having erroneously
considered as sufficient notice a registered letter which had not been
delivered to the respondent. Finally, in Dennis v. The Queen[43], in the reasons for the

[Page 167]

majority, it was expressly held that, on an
appeal from a summary conviction, a County Court judge was right in deciding
that he had no jurisdiction because the appellant had not served the notice of
appeal upon the person specified in s. 722 of the Criminal Code. All
the Justices of Appeal who sat in this case have expressed the opinion that if
the required notice had not in fact been served in accordance with the
requirements of the Code, the Magistrate acted without jurisdiction.
This is the proper conclusion. We are not dealing here with a fact to be found
by the Magistrate, in which case an error cannot go to jurisdiction. On the
contrary, this is a condition precedent to jurisdiction. This condition must be
met before he can act validly.

For the above reasons, I agree with the
conclusions of the Chief Justice, including that pertaining to an order
pursuant to s. 689 of the Criminal Code protecting the Magistrate
and officers.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Escape from lawful
custody—Police officer grabbing accused’s shirt and saying “you are under
arrest”—Accused driving off—Whether in lawful custody—Criminal Code, 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, ss. 110, 125(a).

A police officer, who knew that a
warrant for the respondent’s arrest was outstanding, saw the latter at the
wheel of a motor vehicle which was then stopped for a red light. The officer
approached the respondent’s car and told him that he had a warrant for him. The
respondent, who had started to move forward, accelerated but had to brake
because of traffic. The officer ran up, reached in through the window and
grabbed the respondent’s shirt, saying “you are under arrest”. The respondent
accelerated, breaking the officer’s hold on the shirt and on the car. The
respondent was convicted after a trial by jury, on a charge of escaping from
lawful custody contrary to s. 125(a) of the Criminal Code. The
Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and directed that a verdict of acquittal
be entered. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court where the sole
question for determination was whether the respondent had been in lawful
custody.

Held (Hall and
Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the conviction
restored.

Per Fauteux,
Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.: The respondent was arrested, he
escaped from lawful custody and was guilty under s. 125(a) of the Criminal
Code. Arrest consists of the actual seizure or touching of a person’s body
with a view to his detention. A police officer has the right to use such force
as may be necessary to make an arrest. There is no room for what seems to be a
new subdivision of arrest into “custodial” arrest and “symbolical” or “technical”
arrest.

[Page 47]

Per Hall and
Spence JJ., dissenting: The police officer had a lawful right and duty
to arrest the respondent. The respondent accordingly was under a legal
obligation to submit to the lawful arrest. It is not necessary to touch or hold
the person being arrested. He must, of course, be informed that he is being
arrested. If he does not submit or tries to flee, the arresting officer may use
such force as may reasonably be necessary to detain his man having regard to
the nature of the offence for which the person is wanted. If the man flees and
is not in fact detained he cannot be said to have been in lawful custody. In
these circumstances he is clearly guilty under s. 110(a) of the Criminal
Code. Section 125(a) is not an included offence under s. 110(a)
and vice versa.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], quashing the
respondent’s conviction and directing a verdict of acquittal. Appeal allowed,
Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting.

C.J. Meinhardt, for the appellant.

David R.G. Griner and C.G. Stewart
McKeown, for the respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux, Martland, Judson,
Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

JUDSON J.—The respondent, James Whitfield, was
convicted on October 23, 1967, after a trial by jury, on a charge of escaping
from lawful custody contrary to s. 125(a) of the Criminal Code. He
was sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of six months definite and six
months indeterminate. The Court of Appeal1 allowed his appeal,
quashed the conviction and directed that a verdict of acquittal be entered. The
appeal to this Court is by leave granted on January 29, 1969.

The ratio of the Court of Appeal is that
Whitfield could not be convicted under s. 125(a) because he had never
been “custodially arrested” and that for a conviction there must be more than
what is termed an “arrest in symbolical form”. A distinction is drawn between
an arrest amounting to custody and a mere or bare arrest. In some parts of the
reasons of the Court of

[Page 48]

Appeal it is referred to as a “technical
arrest”. It is said that the judge ought to have told the jury in view of the
evidence in the case that it was not enough that there was an arrest by
touching and that it was incumbent on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that the constable had taken or captured the accused and that the accused
had thereafter broken away. These propositions enunciated by the Court of
Appeal are, in my opinion, erroneous.

The correct proposition of law is stated in 10
Hals., 3rd ed., p. 342, in these terms:

631. MEANING OF ARREST. Arrest consists of
the actual seizure or touching of a person’s body with a view to his detention.
The mere pronouncing of words of arrest is not an arrest, unless the person
sought to be arrested submits to the process and goes with the arresting
officer. An arrest may be made either with or without a warrant.

There is no room for what seems to be a new
subdivision of “arrest” into “custodial” arrest and “symbolical” or “technical”
arrest. An accused is either arrested or he is not arrested. If this accused
was arrested, he escaped from lawful custody and is guilty under s. 125(a)
of the Criminal Code.

The law on this matter was stated without
qualification by the Court of Exchequer Chamber in Sandon v. Jervis
and Dain[2]. This
judgment was delivered in 1858 and was stating not a new principle but
established law based on sound public policy. Pollock C.B., Williams J.,
Crowder J., Willes J. and Bramwell B., were all of the same opinion:

It is a matter of positive law whether a mere
touch is to constitute an arrest or not. It might have been reasonably
prescribed either that it should or should not be necessary to an arrest that
there should be a possession of the person. But probably the reason which led
to the laying down of the law as it stands was that it was thought desirable to
avoid unnecessary violence; and therefore it was determined that, if the
officer was near enough to the debtor to touch him, it was the duty of the
debtor to submit;

[Page 49]

and this for the purpose of preventing
conflict. I may remark parenthetically that what the law of England most
aims at is the preservation of peace. It will not allow a man to take forcible
possession of even his own property. But, whatever be the reason, the law is
that, if the officer is near enough to the debtor to touch him, and does touch
him, and gives him notice of the writ, it is an arrest. I can well understand
the reason for its being so held.

It is true that this problem was under
consideration in relation to an action against a sheriff by an execution
creditor for permitting an execution debtor to escape from lawful custody. But
the proposition of law stated by Pollock C.B., is not so limited in its
application. Bramwell B., in his agreement with Pollack C.B., on the general
proposition, introduced an element of qualification when the issue was the
liability of the sheriff for permitting an escape. I quote his precise words:

I am of the same opinion: but I wish to
guard myself against being supposed to lay it down that the sheriff would be
liable to an escape where the officer had been unable to do more than touch the
debtor. The capture might be good as against the debtor so as to preclude him
from saying that he had not been arrested, and yet not complete so as to make the
sheriff liable for an escape... I wish not to be understood as asserting that
the sheriff would have been liable for an escape if the debtor had got away
after he had merely been touched.

This qualification which Bramwell B., alone
wished to introduce was intended to ease the lot of the sheriff when sued for
an escape. It does not touch the general proposition. It was not accepted by
the other members of the Court and it had been argued and rejected in the
earlier case of Nicholl v. Darley[3],
where it was said that the cases “abundantly show that the slightest touch
is an arrest in point of law.”

In Sandon v. Jervis and Dain the Court
was, therefore, following long established authority based on sound principle
which goes back at least as far as the judgment of Holt C.J., in Genner v.
Sparks[4].

[Page 50]

These authorities which have stood so long
should not now be limited to a process which has become obsolete. The reason
for the rule is equally compelling today as it was in the past. A police
officer has the right to use such force as may be necessary to make an arrest.
What kind of arrest are we to expect if it becomes a principle of law that a
police officer, acting under a warrant of which he informs the accused, and who
actually seizes the accused’s person, is found not to have made an arrest
because the accused is in the driver’s seat of a motor car which enables him to
shake off the arresting officer?

I would allow the appeal and restore the
conviction.

The judgment of Hall and Spence JJ. was
delivered by

HALL J. (dissenting)—The respondent, James
Whitfield, was a person for whose arrest a warrant was outstanding. He was
wanted with two others on a charge of having wilfully damaged three seat
cushions in a restaurant some three weeks before. On June 10, 1967, he was driving a motor
vehicle in an eastbound direction at the corner of St. Clair
 Avenue and Dufferin Street in the City of Toronto. At the same time, Constable Kerr, a member of the Toronto Police
Force, who knew that a warrant for Whitfield’s arrest was outstanding, was
driving a police car accompanied by a fellow officer and at the
intersection in question saw Whitfield who was then stopped for a red
light. Kerr got out of the police car and approached Whitfield’s car, and as he
came to the car window Whitfield started to move forward, the light having
changed to green. Kerr, who knew Whitfield, said through the open window: “I
have a warrant for you, Whitfield” and added: “Stop the car and shut off the
ignition”. Whitfield accelerated, veering to the left across the centre line of
St. Clair Avenue but had
to brake abruptly because of westbound traffic. He then proceeded in the
intersection and Kerr was unable to shout at or speak to the accused at
that time. However Whitfield had to brake again in the middle of Dufferin Street because of traffic. Kerr
ran up and groped for the ignition key while Whitfield moved forward again and
continued to turn left. As Whitfield completed the turn to go

[Page 51]

north, travelling then at about 5 miles per hour,
Kerr reached in through the window and grabbed Whitfield’s shirt with both
hands, saying, “You are under arrest”, but Whitfield accelerated breaking
Kerr’s hold on the shirt and on the car. As Kerr’s hold on the car was being
broken, he was dragged a few feet and then fell to the pavement. At some time
when he had hold of Whitfield’s shirt, Kerr struck his neck on the frame of the
car door, and when he fell to the pavement he sustained some bruises to an
elbow joint and his right leg was injured. In the result he was unable to
perform his duties as a police officer for three days. Whitfield was taken into
custody a short time later at another location by two other police officers. He
was indicted on October 23, 1967, under two counts as follows:

1. The said jurors further present that
James Edward Whitfield on or about the 10th day of June in the year 1967 at the
Municipality of Metropolitan
  Toronto in the County of York, by criminal negligence, caused bodily harm to one (Frederick) Kerr, contrary to the Criminal
Code. (Amended Oct. 19, 1967 by Judge Sheppard)

2. The said jurors further present that
James Edward Whitfield on or about the 10th day of June in the year 1967 at the
Municipality of Metropolitan
  Toronto in the County of York, escaped from lawful custody, contrary to the Criminal
Code.

He was tried before His Honour Judge Sheppard
and a jury and found “Not Guilty” by the jury on Count 1 but “Guilty” under
Count 2 and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six months definite and six
months indefinite.

Whitfield appealed on the ground that he could
not be found guilty under s. 125(a) of the Criminal Code as he
had not been in lawful custody at the time in question. The Court of Appeal[5] (Gale C.J.O., Laskin and Jessup JJ.A.)
allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction and directed that an acquittal be
entered on the charge of escaping from lawful custody.

The Crown applied and was given leave to appeal
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal

[Page 52]

on the terms that the Crown pay to the
respondent his costs of the appeal in this Court, including the costs of the
motion for leave, the whole on a solicitor and client basis in any event of the
cause.

The sole question for determination is whether
or not, on the facts as hereinbefore set out, Whitfield was, at the relevant
time in question here, in lawful custody because it follows that unless he was
in lawful custody he could not escape from lawful custody as the
section states.

In the argument before this Court a great number
of old English cases were cited dealing with whether an arrest had been
effected or not in certain given circumstances. Virtually all the cases cited
by counsel for the appellant as well as for the respondent had to do with the
purported arrest of an execution debtor under a writ of capeas ad
satisfaciendum usually known as a ca. sa. being the writ directed to
a sheriff to take into custody an execution debtor and: “… him safely keep so
that the sheriff may have the body before the High Court of Justice to satisfy
the execution creditor the amount payable under the judgment order.”: Halsbury,
3rd ed., vol. 16, para. 98. This was a procedure frequently invoked before
imprisonment for debt was abolished by the Debtors Act, (1869) 32-33
Vict., c. 62, s. 4. The ca. sa. writ is still theoretically available
but has fallen out of use and is now regarded for practical purposes as
obsolete: Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 16, footnote (g), p. 63. In the cases cited
by counsel the action was against the sheriff either for not having taken the
debtor into custody or for having allowed the debtor to escape when he might
have been taken into custody. This was at a time when the common law favoured
the man of property and a fictional or notional idea of what constituted an
arrest under a ca. sa. writ was adopted by the courts as cases such as Nicholl
v. Darley[6] show,
and the sheriff who did not hold and keep the debtor once he touched him was
held liable to the creditor. The extent to which the courts stretched the
notional idea of arrest is illustrated by the rejection by the majority in Sandon
v. Jervis and Dain[7] of
the

[Page 53]

qualification which Bramwell B. sought to
introduce in that case. In my view Nicholl v. Darley and Sandon
v. Jervis and Dain cannot be accepted as establishing a principle of law applicable
to situations arising 100 years after the situations to which they applied
became obsolete. The dead hand of the past cannot reach that far. These
outdated procedures evolved before the organization of police forces as we now
know them and had no relation to the arrest or taking into custody of a person
charged with a criminal offence.

Accordingly in my view this case does not fall
to be decided upon the authority of cases applicable to the taking into custody
under writs of capeas ad satisfaciendum obsolete since 1869, civil in
their nature, and not involving the criminal law doctrine of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt but should be decided upon principles applicable to the
circumstances obtaining in this century and particularly since Parliament has
legislated in the very matter to cover both resisting lawful arrest and
escaping from lawful custody as two distinct and separate offences.

In the instant case the police officer, Kerr,
had a lawful right and duty to arrest Whitfield. There is no question as to the
fact that a warrant was outstanding and Kerr’s attempt to arrest was lawful.
Whitfield accordingly was under a legal obligation to submit to the lawful
arrest. It is only by the recognition of these corresponding duties and
obligations that we can avoid the notion that the person being arrested has to
be restrained physically before he can be said to be ‘arrested’. I do not see
that it should be necessary to touch or hold the person being arrested. He
must, of course, be informed that he is being arrested. If he does not submit
or tries to flee, the arresting officer may use such force as may reasonably be
necessary to detain his man having regard to the nature of the offence for
which the person is wanted. If the man flees and is not in fact detained he
cannot be said to have been

[Page 54]

in lawful custody, but that does not mean he has
not committed an offence. Parliament has legislated specifically in this
regard. In these circumstances he is clearly guilty under s. 110(a)
which reads:

110. Every one who

(a) resists or wilfully
obstructs a public officer or peace officer in the execution of his duty or any
person lawfully acting in aid of such an officer,

* * *

is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for two years.

Parliament had to deal with two situations: (1)
the arrest or taking of a person into custody when authorized by law; (2) the
keeping of such a person in custody once he has been lawfully arrested and/or
sentenced. By creating two offences, the earlier dealing with the actual arrest
or attempt to arrest and the later dealing with escaping from lawful custody,
Parliament clearly recognized that the two situations were different and not
interchangeable and Parliament must be presumed to have known that the words
“arrest” and “custody” are not synonymous. Section 125(a) is not an
included offence under s. 110(a) and vice versa. This becomes very clear
from the wording of subss. (b) and (c) of s. 125 as
distinct from the whole of s. 110 which patently deals with the arrest process
itself and not with the custodial situation following upon a lawful arrest.

I would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal with
costs payable in accordance with the order for leave to appeal on the grounds
above mentioned. The Crown should charge an accused with the actual offence it
says he has committed. This is not asking too much of those in charge of
prosecutions. Here Whitfield was avoiding arrest and should have been charged
under s. 110(a) and would have been liable to imprisonment for two
years. This is the sanction Parliament has provided for a person such as
Whitfield, who at the wheel of a motor car, shakes off an

[Page 55]

arresting officer. He is made liable to the same
punishment under s. 110(a) as is provided for in s. 125. Both offences are
equally grave but distinct.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA,
APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Evidence—Habitual
criminal—Preventive detention—Evidence concerning charge in which appellant
acquitted—Evidence admissible at hearing in respect of sentence of preventive
detention—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 660.

Following his conviction upon a charge of
breaking and entering and theft, the appellant, who had fifteen previous
convictions, was found to be an habitual criminal and sentenced to preventive
detention. At the hearing in respect of the sentence of preventive detention,
the trial judge admitted evidence given, before him, by two witnesses one of
whom gave evidence as to having been awakened

[Page 370]

one early morning by the sound of glass
breaking in the entrance door of his shop and who found N, a man with an
extensive criminal background, at the cash register and then encountered the
appellant. The latter was acquitted in respect of that incident, and it was
submitted that this evidence should be expunged on the ground that it related
to a matter in respect of which the appellant had been acquitted and which was,
therefore, res judicata. The Court of Appeal affirmed the finding that
the appellant was an habitual criminal and the sentence of preventive
detention. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The trial judge properly found that the
appellant had not attempted to rehabilitate himself after his last release from
prison, prior to the commission of the primary offence, and properly found that
he was an habitual criminal. On the facts of this case, the trial judge was
warranted in holding that it was expedient, for the protection of the public,
to impose a sentence of preventive detention. The admission of the evidence of
the two witnesses, which was introduced only to establish the appellant’s
association with N, a fact which was later conceded by counsel at the trial,
was not a sufficient basis for ordering a new trial in the present case.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of
Alberta, Appellate Division, affirming a sentence of preventive detention.
Appeal dismissed.

J. F. Pecover, for the appellant.

B.A. Crane, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—This is an appeal from the unanimous
judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta dismissing
the appellant’s appeal from the decision at trial, which, after finding that
the appellant was an habitual criminal, imposed upon him a sentence of
preventive detention. This sentence was in lieu of a term of. six years’
imprisonment, imposed upon him on June 7, 1967, following his conviction upon a
charge of breaking and entering and theft.

The appellant, who was born on March 12, 1928,
committed a considerable number; of

[Page 371]

offences over a period of time commencing in the
year 1948 up to the commission of the primary offence in 1966. The list of his
convictions is as follows:

1948, October 29th, Winnipeg, Manitoba, theft, 2
months.

1949, January 7th, Winnipeg, Manitoba, shop
breaking and theft, 1 year.

1951, June 12th, Winnipeg, Manitoba, fraud, 2
years suspended sentence.

1952, August 8th, Winnipeg, Manitoba, nine
charges of fraud, six months on each charge concurrent; a second charge of
breach of recognizance, 3 months consecutive.

1953, July 20th, Winnipeg, Manitoba, two charges
of fraud, 26 months concurrent, and a further five charges of fraud, 6 months
concurrent.

1955, July 18th, High Prairie, Alberta, four
charges of obtaining by false pretences, 6 months concurrent.

1956, April 12th, Edmonton, Alberta, attempted
theft, 3 months.

1956, June 21st, Edmonton, Alberta, attempted
breaking and entry, 2 years.

1958, April 10th, Calgary, Alberta, two charges
of obtaining by false pretences and two charges of uttering forged documents, 2
years concurrent.

1958, July 15th, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan,
two charges of uttering forged documents, 1 year, concurrent with the sentence
dated April 10th, 1958.

1959, November 3rd, Edmonton, Alberta, breaking
and entry with intent, 2 years.

1961, November 17th, Edmonton, Alberta,
possession of stolen property, three charges of forgery and three charges of
uttering, three and a half years concurrent.

1964, obtaining by false pretences and theft
Under fifty dollars, 2 years less 1 day, concurrent.

[Page 372]

1966, December 5th, Winnipeg, Manitoba, theft, 3
months.

1967, June 7th, Edmonton, Alberta, breaking and
entering and theft, 6 years.

The Crown clearly established that the
appellant, since attaining the age of 18 years, had, on more than three
separate and independent occasions, been convicted of an indictable offence for
which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more, as required by
s. 660 of the Criminal Code, and the learned trial judge so found.
He then went on to consider the further requirement as to whether the Crown had
established that the appellant “is leading persistently a criminal life.” After
properly charging himself as to this requirement of s. 660, he made the
following findings of fact:

1. The primary offence of breaking and entering,
while not premeditated, could not be said to be a sudden yielding to temptation
in the proper sense of that term.

2. The appellant left Fort Saskatchewan Gaol on
February 12, 1966, on completion of his then sentence. The substantive offence
was committed on March 3, 1966. On May 31, 1966, the appellant was not present
in court for his trial. A warrant was issued for his arrest. While at large he
was arrested and on December 5 was convicted on a charge of theft under $50.

3. The appellant was associated with one Nugent
in the commission of the primary offence, and had admitted that, just prior to
that time, he and Nugent had been living with one Tonner. Both Nugent and
Tonner had extensive criminal backgrounds.

The learned trial judge properly found that the
appellant had not attempted to rehabilitate himself after his last release from
prison, prior to the commission of the primary offence, and properly found that
he was an habitual criminal.

The next issue is as to whether, because of that
finding, it was expedient for the protection of the public that the appellant
be sentenced to preventive detention. The learned trial judge was of the

[Page 373]

opinion that the sentence should be imposed.
After referring to s. 660(1) (b), which refers to this matter, he
said:

The object of this section is to
protect the public from people who have shown by their history that they are a
menace, not just a nuisance to society, and when this situation is clear, the
question is not one of punishment since that has proven to be a futile
exercise, but rather it is a matter of putting them away, so to speak, for the
protection of the public. In my opinion it is important that the public be
protected from criminals, not only from crimes involving violence against the
person, but as well from crimes against property, which are in themselves very
serious.

The accused was sentenced to six years
imprisonment on the substantive offence. No doubt the trial judge gave
consideration to the matter of protecting the public in passing sentence.
Nevertheless, I am satisfied from the accused’s history and conduct that he is
a recidivist in crime and cannot be trusted in society. The public is not
sufficiently safeguarded by the sentence and requires the additional protection
resulting from a sentence of preventive detention. The Crown, I find has proven
this ingredient and all other essential ingredients beyond a reasonable doubt
and, therefore, has made out its case to support a sentence of preventive
detention.

It was held in Poole v. The Queen[1], that, on the issue of the expediency of a
sentence of preventive detention, this Court is entitled to substitute its
opinion for that of the trial judge. Both in that case and in the later case of
Mendick v. The Queen[2], the
decision of the lower court to impose a sentence of preventive detention was
reversed. It was stated, in the reasons of the majority in the Poole case,
that the expediency of the sentence of preventive detention was a question of
fact, or perhaps a question of mixed law and fact. Each of these cases was
determined upon its own particular facts, as must any other case involving the
question of the expediency of imposing a sentence of preventive detention.

[Page 374]

There is not much to be gained from a comparison
of the facts of other cases. It may, however, be pointed out that in the Poole
case it was found that there was some evidence of the appellant’s, trying
to live a normal life. In Mendick, some point was made of the fact that
out of 47 convictions, 27 related to unlawful possession and use of gasoline
credit cards and that 23, involving a total sum of $249.95, resulted from “a
single spree” extending over December 1964, and early January 1965. Reference
was also made to the fact that his last employer would be willing to re-employ
him upon his release. There was no similar evidence in the present case, and no
witnesses were called on behalf of the appellant, who did not, himself,
testify.

In my opinion, on the facts of this case, the
learned trial judge was warranted in holding that it was expedient, for the
protection of the public, to impose a sentence of preventive detention.

It was contended, on behalf of the appellant,
that the learned trial judge had erred in admitting evidence given, before him,
by Alfred Ernest Shepherd and Barbara Jean Shepherd, his wife, on the ground
that it was tendered to prove an issue which was res judicata. When the
appellant was tried in respect of the primary offence, of which he was
convicted, he was also tried in respect of three other offences, two of these
being:

(1) Theft with violence from Shepherd of $100.

(2) Breaking and entering the Beverly Hills Gift
and Hobby Centre, of which Shepherd was the proprietor.

The appellant was acquitted in respect of these
two charges, the court holding that, though the Crown had proved that he was
probably guilty, guilt had not been established beyond a reasonable doubt. He
was convicted on the other two charges, but successfully appealed against one
of them. Evidence in respect of the two charges on which he was acquitted at
trial was given by Mr. and Mrs. Shepherd.

[Page 375]

On the hearing in respect of the sentence of
preventive detention, Shepherd gave evidence as to having been awakened in the
early morning of March 3, 1966, by the sound of glass breaking in the entrance
door of his shop. He said that he found a man at the cash register and that,
after a struggle, held him to the floor. This man, he said, was Nugent. He then
rose to encounter the appellant, whom he forced to the floor. Nugent escaped
and returned later with another man, at which time the witness received a blow
on the head. He identified the appellant in court.

Mrs. Shepherd gave an account of coming
downstairs and finding her husband struggling with a man. She tried,
unsuccessfully, to telephone the police. She did not identify the appellant or
Nugent.

Shepherd’s evidence went in, without objection,
but subsequently counsel for the appellant submitted that it should be expunged
on the ground that it related to a matter in respect of which the appellant had
been acquitted and which was, therefore, res judicata. This objection
was not sustained.

The position taken by the Crown was stated, at
trial, as follows:

My Lord, the proceedings in this case are
not a re-trial of the person on the charge, the finding at the end of the
substantive trial is final and there is no attempt being made to alter it.
However, the associations of the accused at the time of the substantive offence
remain relevant and the evidence may be reconsidered by Your Lordship to
ascertain whether or not an association is proved notwithstanding the fact that
in the trial the guilt of the accused in connection with the robbery itself was
not proven.

It was later conceded by counsel for the
appellant, in argument, at the conclusion of the evidence in respect of the
sentence of preventive detention that the appellant was associating with Nugent
on the night when the primary offence was committed. This concession was not
made as a result of the admission of the Shepherds’ evidence, but for other
reasons.

The effect of a verdict of acquittal in criminal
proceedings was considered by the Privy Council

[Page 376]

in Sambasivam v. Public Prosecutor,
Federation of Malaya[3]. Lord
MacDermott, at p. 479, said:

The effect of a verdict of acquittal
pronounced by a competent court on a lawful charge and after a lawful trial is
not completely stated by saying that the person acquitted cannot be tried again
for the same offence. To that it must be added that the verdict is binding and
conclusive in all subsequent proceedings between the parties to the
adjudication The maxim “Res judicata pro veritate accipitur” is no less
applicable to criminal than to civil proceedings. Here, the appellant having
been acquitted at the first trial on the charge of having ammunition in his
possession, the prosecution was bound to accept the correctness of that verdict
and was precluded from taking any step to challenge it at the second trial. And
the appellant was no less entitled to rely on his acquittal in so far as it
might be relevant in his defence.

In that case the accused had been tried on two
charges, under the Emergency Regulations, 1948, of carrying a firearm
and of being in possession of ammunition respectively. He was acquitted of the
second charge, but a new trial was ordered on the first one.

At the second trial a statement of the accused
was introduced which had not been in evidence at the first trial. If accepted
as the truth, it went to prove his guilt on the second charge, of which he had
been acquitted, as clearly as it would establish his guilt on the first charge.
The statement was admitted and no intimation was given to the assessors of the
fact that the accused had been acquitted on the second charge, and was,
therefore, to be taken as innocent of that offence.

In view of these circumstances it was felt that
the acquittal of the appellant on the charge of being in possession of
ammunition was relevant to the consideration by the assessors in the second
trial of the effect of this statement. It might have been a ground for
excluding the statement in its entirety, because it could not have been severed
satisfactorily. The result of the omission to refer to the acquittal on the
second charge was that the Crown was enabled to rely upon the existence of
facts in respect of which there had already been a contrary finding in favour
of the accused.

[Page 377]

The situation in the present case is quite
different. The learned trial judge was well aware of the appellant’s acquittal
on two charges at the time the primary offence was tried. It was made clear to
him that the purpose of introducing the evidence was only to establish the
appellant’s association with Nugent, a fact which was later conceded. The
learned trial judge made no reference whatever to the evidence of the
Shepherds, but did refer to counsel’s admission. In my opinion the admission of
that evidence is not a sufficient basis for ordering a new trial in the present
case.

Counsel for the appellant also raised various
technical objections to the validity of the present proceedings. In my opinion
they lack substance and it is unnecessary, in these reasons, to deal with them
further.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Possession of housebreaking
instruments—Failure of counsel to appear before Court of Appeal—Appeal
dismissed—Court of Appeal rescinded its judgment—Administration of
justice—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 295(1).

The respondent was found guilty by a judge of
the Court of Sessions of the Peace of possession of housebreaking instruments,
and appealed to the Court of Queen’s Bench. On the day of the hearing his
counsel failed to appear. Thereupon, the Crown requested and was granted
dismissal of the appeal. A few weeks later, on a motion explaining counsel’s
default, the Court of Appeal, constituted differently, rescinded its judgment
dismissing the appeal. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The two judgments were given by the Court of
Appeal in the exercise of the discretionary power relating to practice
concerning the proper administration of justice in criminal matters. The Court
accepted the explanations offered by the respondent’s counsel and held that the
latter was not to suffer the loss of his right to appeal on account of the
oversight of his counsel’s secretary. It was virtually held and correctly so
that the remedy sought by the respondent was due him ex debito justitiae.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Queen’s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec, rescinding its own
previous judgment. Appeal dismissed.

Claude Chamberland, for the appellant.

F.D. Shoofey, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

[Page 93]

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The appellant appeals from a
unanimous decision, delivered on April 18, 1969, by the Court of Queen’s
Bench (Appeal Side), Province of Quebec, rescinding, at the request of the
respondent, a unanimous decision delivered by the same Court, on March 24
preceding.

The circumstances giving rise to this appeal may
be stated immediately.

On October 31, 1968, the respondent, Joseph
Jacobs, was found guilty by a judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace of
having, in Montreal on or about July 8, 1968, committed the offence described
in s. 295(1) of the Criminal Code, namely possession of
housebreaking instruments.

The respondent entered an appeal to the Court of
Queen’s Bench (Appeal Side) against this conviction. This appeal came up for
hearing on March 24, 1969. Counsel for Jacobs, then duly called upon to proceed
with his case, failed to appear. Thereupon, in view of this default, counsel
for the Crown requested and was granted dismissal of the appeal by the Court,
then composed of Hyde, Rivard and Salvas JJ.

Jacob’s counsel, who was informed of this
decision the same day it was handed down, immediately went to one of the judges
of the Court of Appeal, and, in the presence of the Crown counsel, gave reasons
to justify or excuse his absence, all with a view to having the case put back
on the list of appeal cases. The Crown counsel did not agree in any manner to
this request by respondent’s counsel, but a few days later, on April 1, 1969,
the latter served his opponent with a motion returnable to the Court of Queen’s
Bench on April 3, 1969, to obtain rescission of the decision given the previous
March 24. After taking the matter under advisement, the Court of Appeal, then composed
of Tremblay C.J. and Rinfret and Taschereau JJ., gave judgment on April 18
following, granting respondent’s motion.

[Page 94]

The Crown then applied to this Court for leave
to appeal from this judgment. Respondent Jacobs opposed the motion for leave:
he contended that the Supreme Court did not have jurisdiction, in the matter,
to grant leave to appeal. Without prejudice to this objection, the Court
granted the Crown’s motion, and left it to the Court that would be hearing it
to decide whether it was well founded.

Neither the judgment of April 18, 1969,
rescinding that of March 24, nor in fact the latter judgment, deal in any way
with the merits of the appeal lodged by Jacobs against the conviction
pronounced against him. These are judgments given by the Court of Appeal in the
exercise of the discretionary power relating to practice concerning the proper
administration of justice in criminal matters. In this case the Court of
Appeal, which pronounced the judgment a quo, accepted the explanations
offered by Jacobs’ counsel, and held that the latter was not to suffer the loss
of his right to appeal on account of the oversight of his counsel’s secretary,
who failed to inform the latter, as she ought to have done, of the date on
which the case would be called for hearing. It was virtually held—and correctly
so, in my humble opinion—that the remedy sought by Jacobs was due him ex
debito justitiae.

This being the case, there is no need to
consider the objection raised by the respondent as regards the jurisdiction of
this Court. I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Jury trial—Improper address by
Crown counsel—Prejudice—Fair trial—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss.
393(b), 592(1)(b) (iii).

Criminal law—Jurisdiction—Right of appeal to
Supreme Court of Canada—Question
of law.

The appellant was convicted on a charge of
possession of counterfeit money. He had a criminal record not related to any
offence involving such money. He gave evidence in denial of knowledge of the
presence in his car of a package consisting of three tightly rolled counterfeit
notes. These were found by the police wedged among the wires under the
dashboard next to the steering column. The Crown’s theory was that the accused
was a distributor rather than a pusher of counterfeit bills. In his address to
the jury, Crown counsel put, as facts to be considered for conviction, matters
of which there was no evidence and which came from Crown counsel’s personal
experience or observations. The Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction. Leave
to appeal to this Court was granted on two questions of law: (1) Did the Court
of Appeal err in failing to hold that the trial judge should have declared a
mistrial by reason of the nature of counsel’s address; and (2) Did the Court of
Appeal err in not holding that the address to the jury by counsel deprived the
accused of a fair trial?

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.

There can be no unyielding general rule that
an inflammatory or improper address to the jury by Crown counsel is per se conclusive
of the fact that there has been an unfair trial and that a conviction thereat
cannot stand. However, in the present case, what Crown counsel at the trial
improperly said to the jury bore so directly on the central issue in the

[Page 739]

case, namely knowing possession, and was so
prejudicial in respect of that issue and of the related question of credibility
of the accused, of whose criminal record the jury were aware, as to deprive the
accused of his right to a fair trial. No case was made out for the application
of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, affirming the
appellant’s conviction on a charge of possession of counterfeit money. Appeal
allowed.

Claude Thomson and John Morin, for the
appellant.

R.M. McLeod, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LASKIN J.—This appeal, from the affirmation by
the Court of Appeal of Ontario of the conviction of the accused on a charge of
possession of counterfeit money, is here by leave on two questions of law that
were formulated as follows:

1. Did the Court of Appeal err in failing
to hold that the learned trial judge should have declared a mistrial on the
motion of counsel for the accused by reason of the nature of Crown counsel’s
address to the jury?

2. Did the Court of Appeal err in not
holding that the address to the jury by Crown counsel was of such a nature as
to deprive the accused of a fair trial and hence resulted in a miscarriage of
justice?

Counsel for the Crown contended that these
questions did not disclose any issue of law, and hence that this Court was
without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. It is sufficient to get to the
merits to found jurisdiction on question 2, and to rely in this respect on the
views of this Court on such a question as expressed in Boucher v. The
Queen[1].

[Page 740]

The reasons for judgment given separately in Boucher
by Kerwin C.J., Rand, Locke and Cartwright JJ. amply point up the
obligation of Crown counsel to be accurate, fair and dispassionate in
conducting the prosecution and in addressing the jury. Overenthusiasm for the
strength of the case for the prosecution, manifested in addressing the jury,
may be forgivable, especially when tempered by a proper caution by the trial
judge in his charge, where it is in relation to matters properly adduced in
evidence. A different situation exists where that enthusiasm is coupled with or
consists of putting before the jury, as facts to be considered for conviction,
matters of which there is no evidence and which come from Crown counsel’s
personal experience or observations. That is the present case.

At the conclusion of Crown counsel’s address in
this case, counsel for the accused moved for a declaration of a mistrial. The
trial judge did not act on the motion but proceeded to charge the jury. There
was nothing in his charge that can be regarded as directed to the serious
breaches of duty exhibited by Crown counsel. The charge was in the general
pattern that is followed when there is no untoward situation that demands
particular consideration and instruction to the jury. I do not consider that
the familiar observation or reminder to the jury that they alone are judges of
the facts and that they may disregard any comments, whether of the trial judge
or of counsel, on the facts in evidence, can meet a situation where Crown
counsel, who addresses the jury last, puts extraneous prejudicial matters to
the jury as if such matters were part of the record of evidence.

Of course, there can be no unyielding general
rule that an inflammatory or other improper address to the jury by Crown
counsel is per se conclusive of the fact that there has been an unfair
trial and that a conviction thereat cannot stand. The issues in a case and the
evidence that is presented are highly relevant in this connection, as is the
supervision exercised by the trial judge in

[Page 741]

relation to the addresses of counsel and in the
course of his charge. In the present case, I am satisfied that what Crown
counsel at the trial improperly said to the jury bore so directly on the
central issue in the case, namely knowing possession, and was so prejudicial in
respect of that issue and of the related question of credibility of the
accused, of whose criminal record the jury were aware, as to deprive the
accused of his right to a fair trial. I have already observed that the trial
judge did nothing to erase the effect of Crown counsel’s remarks, and I should
add that nothing said by defence counsel in his preceding address can be
regarded as justifying what Crown counsel intruded into the trial.

I wish to refer to some of the facts of the case
and to portions of Crown counsel’s address as reproduced in the transcript. The
accused was a man with a record not related to any offence involving
counterfeit money, and he gave evidence in denial of knowledge of the presence
in his car of a package consisting of three tightly rolled up counterfeit
notes. They were found by the police wedged among the wires under the dashboard
next to the steering column. He had $700 in cash on his person in genuine
notes. There was evidence that his wife and two relatives had access to his
car. He denied police evidence that he said, when the counterfeit notes were
found, “I don’t know. It looks like funny money”, but admitted that he said to
the police, “I guess you’ve got me good. I want to see a lawyer”.

The Crown’s theory was that the accused was a
“distributor” rather than a “pusher” of counterfeit bills; that is, that he
was, so to speak, a wholesaler who showed samples to “pushers” who would buy
from the samples and then “sell” to the public. In opening to the jury before
any evidence was led Crown counsel spoke as follows:

So the essence of the charge as you heard
from the indictment is that he had it in his custody or posses-

[Page 742]

sion. It was his car. He had the car for
some time; apparently nobody had access to it—that he had placed this money in
this hiding place, and he had it for some purpose. I will explain the purpose
to you when I address you later.

No evidence was adduced as to any purpose, nor
was there any evidence as to how counterfeit bills are distributed or marketed.
There was no evidence as to any association of the accused with so-called
distributors or pushers.

The transcript of Crown counsel’s address to the
jury includes the following passages:

All right, so what happens. The officers
found it, and he has all his notes. He is going underneath like that. Now, if a
person knew, if somebody in fact had put it there—I suggest he did—you would
know where it is. You would be able to put your hand underneath, probably while
you are still sitting there and pull it out notwithstanding that it was wedged
in; you would know where it is, so you would measure it up and if you needed
it—and I will explain why he needed it—you are not going to carry three ten
dollar counterfeit bills on your person because in fact you may be stopped by
the police. They stop people and they interview people and check people, and he
is not going to carry the bills on him; that is for sure. He is not going to
put it in his car. You heard the evidence about the $700 on his person at that
time, and this comes to the reason why I had Corporal Dore explain what type
and quality this money was, going from fair to good to fairly deceptive. He
said they were at the top range, deceptive, the best at that time.

Now, I suggest to you that what in fact
Pisani had these bills for, was for specimens, for samples, and he would go
out, and he was a distributor. He would not carry any of this money on him. It
was too dangerous. The police might stop him, so he hides it in this very
unusual hiding place in the car; somewhere where he could get it out fast if he
wanted to show somebody, but he wouldn’t carry it on his person. He would try
to find pushers. People with records don’t push counterfeit money. They are
distributors. They sell it to pushers. They sell it to people without records
and they push it. Pisani wouldn’t be caught dead pushing ten dollar bills. It
is not worth it to him. He has got a record, so he

[Page 743]

goes, he finds his pusher, he brings it to
wherever the pusher is and then calls them as he reaches underneath the
dashboard where it is. He tries to persuade the pusher. He says, “Look, it is
good quality ten dollar bills.” Here is the sales pitch. He takes the three ten
dollar bills, he goes in and he says to the man, and he will take one or two
perhaps; he will say: all right, take a look at this. The person looks at it,
and if he has another ten dollar bill he would look at it, and he would say: It
looks pretty good. Then he would say, all right take a look at this, and then
lo and behold they have the same serial number; they have got to be
counterfeit. He looks at it and says: This is pretty good; these are top-notch
counterfeit, I probably could get rid of this. Maybe that person wouldn’t do
it, he pushes it through his girlfriend or an associate. He says: Take another
look at this. This is another sample. This is another of the batch with a
different serial number; have a look at it. That is pretty good top. So that is
the sales pitch. He has one. He shows them to everyone. It has to be
counterfeit, because it has the same serial number. So he has three samples,
and they are top-notch quality and people want it. It is good quality. The type
of people that would push them say: Yes, I could fool a person with them.

How many of you people know what a
counterfeit looks like? My Dad owns a store. He doesn’t know. I work in a
store. I don’t know what counterfeit is unless there is something drastically
wrong with the bill. That is when he questions it.

I suggest to you that Pisani had secreted
these three counterfeit ten dollar bills, and he wouldn’t touch it. He probably
figured the police aren’t going to find it there. You will recall that it took
the officer quite some time. He would put it there knowing that it was
dangerous to have it on his person, on his physical person, and only at the
last minute when he arrives where the pusher is, whether it be in a store or an
apartment, and he would park, look around and make sure there are no police
officers, no detectives that he recognizes, he would take it out and would show
the samples to the person who is doing the pushing. Then when he comes back he
would hide it in the same place.

Later on in the address, Crown counsel after
referring to Pisani’s seven previous convictions

[Page 744]

and to the legal limitation that these
convictions could only be used to assess his credibility, said this:

He had $700 in his possession at that time
made up of hundreds, fifties, twenties and tens. Is it possible that he got
that as down payment from one of his pushers? He wouldn’t bring money to the
pusher. The pusher would have to go to somebody else, another person or
party that has no record to get money. Pisani wouldn’t be caught dead with the
money. He would arrange for the pusher to get the money. He wouldn’t be caught
dead with large quantities of counterfeit money.

Again, in a succeeding portion of the address he
spoke as follows:

You heard the evidence that if you put the
bills through the silver nitrate processing solution you would ruin the paper
itself. It would turn to dark brown as we have heard, and they handle this
money gingerly in Ottawa. You
don’t lift prints off counterfeit; that was known to Pisani. Pisani is, as I
suggest to you he is not a pusher, but a distributor. He knows these technical
things. He knows you can’t lift a print, so I suggest to you that there is a
matter of credibility. The story at the scene contrast. There is no one that he
mentions. No person that he mentioned that would plant this money, and I
suggest to you if that was so there would be a good quantity of money put there
instead of three ten dollar bills.

There was no evidence that Pisani knew that
fingerprints cannot be lifted from counterfeit money, and Crown counsel was
also again repeating as facts matters not in evidence.

Two more passages of the address should be
quoted:

I would ask you then to disbelieve Pisani
entirely when he says he didn’t know who put it there. I suggest to you exactly
that he put it there. He might have been on a selling jaunt at that time. He
might have gotten a deposit to line up the place where the pusher would have
got the money from a third party

[Page 745]

who had no record and he was coming back.
He had a large quantity of money and unfortunately he was stopped and his car
was searched.

There is no direct evidence in this case
that anyone saw Pisani put it there. There is no statement, and you don’t
expect statement from a person like this, do you really? A person, I suggest to
you, that a person without a record may give a statement, not a person like
this. There is no statement: Yes, I put it there. There is nothing like that,
so I ask you—I am going to have to ask you to draw your conclusion that he put
it there on the basis of circumstantial evidence.

The foregoing passages bear out the assessment I
made of the effect of the address.

In my view, no case was made out for the
application of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code. In the
result, I would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and direct a new
trial.

Appeal allowed and new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR THE
YUKON TERRITORY

Criminal law—Charge to jury—Circumstantial
evidence—Erroneous example—Misdirection—Duty to relate evidence to issues—Test
in Hodge’s case—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 207.

Criminal law—Evidence—Confession—Statement
admitted without voir dire—Substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice—Criminal
Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 592(1)(b)(iii).

The appellant had been living with a girl. On
August 22, he drove with his nephew to an Indian reservation and broke into a
house in which the girl had stayed overnight. He then sent his nephew on an
errand. When the latter returned, the appellant and the girl were no longer
there. The girl was never seen alive again. Ten days later, the appellant told
his nephew that “the girl was finished”, that “he did not know what he should
do” and that he “did not know if he should turn himself in or not”. Two weeks
after that, while the appellant was being held in custody for questioning
concerning the girl’s whereabouts, he led three police officers to a place in
the bushes where her dead body was found wrapped in a blanket inside a canvas
covering and trussed up with a rope. The appellant was charged with
manslaughter. The trial judge opened his instructions to the jury by stating
that all the evidence was circumstantial; and, he gave them the following
illustration of the difference between circumstantial and direct evidence: If a
witness gives evidence that he saw A stab B with a knife, that is direct evidence
that A stabbed B. If a witness gives evidence that he found a dagger with an
unusually long blade in the possession of A and another witness testified that
such a dagger could have caused B’s wounds, that is circumstantial evidence
tending to prove that A did in fact stab B. The appellant was convicted and his
appeal was dismissed by a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for the
Yukon Territory. The accused appealed to this Court.

[Page 782]

Held (Hall,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: Although the illustration
was potentially misleading if it had stood alone, the fact that it was almost
immediately followed by a correct statement of the effect to be given to
circumstantial evidence, served to offset any wrong impression of the law which
it might have left in the minds of the jurors. The language used in Hodge’s case
does nothing more than provide a graphic illustration of the principle that
where the evidence is purely circumstantial it must be made plain to the jury
that in order to be satisfied of the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable
doubt, they must first be satisfied that the circumstances are such as to be
inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused was the
guilty person. If the jury is left in doubt as to whether or not the
circumstances are equally consistent with some conclusion other than guilt,
then it is their duty “to give the accused the benefit of the doubt and not to
convict him on the circumstantial evidence standing alone”. When read as a
whole the charge contains no errors in regard to circumstantial evidence which
would warrant this Court in quashing the conviction and ordering a new trial.

There is no duty upon a trial judge when
instructing a jury to relate each item of evidence to the issues in the case
and to give the jury specific instructions as to whether it could or could not
properly form the basis of an inference as to those issues. Nor is it necessary
that each item of circumstantial evidence be subjected to the test in Hodge’s
case.

The statement made by the appellant to the
police that he had last seen the girl on August 25 was not objected to by
counsel on his behalf on the ground that it was exculpatory. It was admissible
not because it was exculpatory but because it was volunteered by the appellant.
The question of whether a statement is inculpatory or exculpatory and whether
or not it is voluntary are two different matters, and where it has been shown
that a statement made to a person in authority was not voluntarily made, it is
to be excluded whether it be exculpatory or inculpatory. The question of
whether or not all of the statements made by the appellant to the police could
be said to have been voluntary and therefore admissible without the holding of
a voir dire, did not have to be decided because even if the appellant’s
rambling account of his activities after August 22 should not have been
admitted as it was, this would in no way affect the relevancy and admissibility
of the all important evi-

[Page 783]

dence that he led the police officers to the
place where the body of the girl was concealed. However, even if some error had
been made by the trial judge, the circumstances were consistent with the
appellant having unlawfully killed the girl and the facts were inconsistent
with any other rational conclusion, so that a jury properly instructed would
necessarily have returned a verdict of guilty. There was therefore no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

Per Pigeon J.:
The illustration of circumstantial evidence was erroneous in its entirety. This
could not properly be said to be circumstantial evidence as it does no more
than reveal a possibility, suggest a conjecture or at most raise a suspicion.
The fact that this was presented only for the purpose of explaining the
distinction between the two kinds of evidence does not mean that it was not in
itself misleading. While it is literally true the jury must give an accused the
benefit of the doubt if the evidence is equally consistent with the innocence
of the accused as with his guilt, it is highly misleading because the obvious
implication is that if the circumstantial evidence is more consistent with the
guilt than with the innocence then they may convict. Circumstantial evidence
requires facts from which guilt is the only rational inference and if innocence
is an equally rational inference there is no proof of guilt at all. The rule on
circumstantial evidence is nothing more than a formula to assist in applying
the accepted standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to a criminal case
resting upon such evidence. It is misleading to couple that rule with a
statement that really implies a different and much lower standard. However, by giving
clear instructions on the burden of proof and enumerating the elements of the
offence, the trial judge has clearly dissipated any unfortunate implication as
to the standard of proof. The illustration cannot possibly have misled the jury
and, on the whole, this inaccuracy did not constitute misdirection. In any
event, this is a proper case for applying the provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code.

Per Hall J., dissenting:
The charge on circumstantial evidence constituted misdirection, and were it
not for the admission in evidence of statements made

[Page 784]

by the appellant without a voir dire, this
would have been a proper case for applying the provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii)
of the Code. However, a voir dire was not held despite the fact that one
was asked for by the appellant’s counsel. That error was of such a consequence
that the Court ought not to say that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice had occurred.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: The misdirection constituted a fatal error in the charge. It
was not cured by other statements in the charge in which the rule as to
circumstantial evidence was stated correctly. The faults would have the effect
of permitting the jury to apply to the assessment of the probative value of the
circumstantial evidence a much less stringent test than that set out in Hodge’s
case. The admission of the accused’s statement without any determination of
its voluntary character in a proper voir dire resulted in there being
placed before the jury inadmissible evidence of a most important and a most
damaging character. The provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Code
could not be applied. One cannot conclude that a jury properly charged on
admissible evidence could not have done otherwise than convict the appellant.

Per Laskin J.,
dissenting: The question whether the charge taken as a whole was
adequate notwithstanding the standing misdirection is quite separate from the
issue of no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. If the misdirection is
fatal to the conviction the least to which the accused is entitled is a new
trial. The trial judge did not explain the meaning of circumstantial evidence
except by reference to an illustration which was clearly unacceptable. This
error could only have been regarded as immaterial if the trial judge had not
been obliged in this case to do more than point out to the jury in general
words the difference between direct and circumstantial evidence. The trial
judge aggravated the deficiency by simply narrating what each witness had said,
without relating the evidence to the issues in the case and without indicating
to the jury the need to distinguish between those facts which were reasonably
probative of the issues and those which could not be regarded as justifying
inferences to that end. The generalities in the charge cannot serve as a cover
for the inadequacies in this case because the medical evidence, taken alone,
could not support a finding that the deceased came to her death as a result of
the wrongful act of another person, because the statements of the appellant
which were admitted without a voir dire involved a variety of admissions

[Page 785]

which, without proper direction, could
mislead the jury into inferences of guilt and because the trial judge’s
omission to mention, let alone relate to it, certain qualiflying evidence of
the witness Kerry. The failure of the Crown to establish the voluntariness of
the accused’s statements warrants the quashing of the conviction and a new
trial. The defect in the charge goes beyond a mere mix-up of the principle of
reasonable doubt with the rule of circumstantial evidence as the trial judge
suggested a lower burden of proof upon the Crown than proof beyond a reasonable
doubt. It would aid clarity in charging a jury if proof of issues by
circumstantial evidence was dealt with in a way that would not suggest that
there were possibly colliding or separate burdens of proof in a case involving
such evidence. It is preferable, where all or part of the case against an
accused is based on circumstantial evidence, to bring only the traditional
burden of proof in relation to such evidence, but at the same time to emphasize
the function of inference through which that evidence has vitality and show its
bearing on the issues to which the evidence is addressed.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for the Yukon Territory[1],
affirming the appellant’s conviction for manslaughter. Appeal dismissed, Hall,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting.

Ralph Hudson and B.A. Crane, for the
appellant.

John Scollin, Q.C., and Stephen Hardinge,
for the respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux C.J. and of Abbott,
Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for the Yukon Territory1 dismissing the appellant’s
appeal from his conviction of manslaughter by the Honourable Mr. Justice
Madison sitting with a jury at Whitehorse in the Yukon Territory, on May 16,
1969.

[Page 786]

The charge against the appellant is

THAT HE, between the 21st day of August, 1967,
and the 7th day of September, 1967, in the Yukon Territory, did unlawfully kill
Graffie George, thereby committing Manslaughter, contrary to Section 207 of the
Criminal Code.

The evidence discloses that prior to August
21st, Graffie George had been living with the appellant for about eighteen
months but on the afternoon of that day she was found to be hiding in the
bushes near her sister’s house at an Indian reservation outside of Whitehorse;
she was then “very dirty” and her sister took her into the house where she
stayed over night. On the following evening (August 22nd) the sister went out
to play bingo at Whitehorse at about 7 p.m., but Graffie George remained in the
house because, as her sister says “she was scared to come with me.” Later that
evening, while the sister was still out, the appellant and his nephew, Lester
John, drove to the reserve and the appellant broke into her house leaving it,
with Graffie George, through the window by which he had broken in. The
appellant then sent Lester John on an errand and when he returned the appellant
and Graffie George were no longer there.

There is no evidence that Graffie George was
ever seen again alive, but on September 14th, after the police had started to
investigate her disappearance and while the appellant was being held in custody
for questioning concerning her whereabouts, he led three police officers to a
place in the bushes off the Alaska Highway where Graffie George’s dead body was
found wrapped in a blanket inside a canvas covering and trussed up with rope so
that it “appeared to be in a foetal position with head down around the knees
and the knees drawn up towards the head area and the rope went around the head
area and down around the ankles.”

The canvas covering in which the body was found was
identified as a tent which, with a mattress and two blankets, had been stolen
from a campsite set up by two boys not far from a camp which had been occupied
by the appellant. The blanket covering the body was identified as similar

[Page 787]

to one of the stolen blankets while the mattress
was found at the appellant’s campsite.

Lester John testified that on September 1, 1967,
ten days after the girl had last been seen, the appellant called at the house
where he was staying and told him that “the girl was finished” that “he did not
know what he should do” and that he “did not know if he should turn himself in
or not.”

In conducting the autopsy on Graffie George’s
body, Dr. D.F. Morrow, an experienced pathologist, found that the cause of
death was a sub-dural haemorrage covering the left side of the brain which had
been pushed downwards by the pressure of the haemorrage. He also found two
bruises located on the chest wall over the ribs and in the abdomen two
haemorrages in the liver approximately 2¼” to 2½” by ¾” which he thought
to be related to the chest bruises. The doctor indicated that the injuries were
caused by “a blunt type of force”, on cross-examination he agreed that the head
injury was such as could be caused by “a person striking their head getting out
of a car” and that the other injuries were possibly compatible with a person
having fallen on a two-pronged object, but that they were also consistent with
having been caused by blows from a fist.

There is no evidence as to how the dead girl’s
body came to be trussed up in the fashion in which it was found, but it is
self-evident that this was the deliberate work of some human agency, and the
facts are that the appellant was the last person that any witness had seen in
the dead girl’s company and that on the 14th of September he knew where the
body was concealed in the woods.

I have not attempted to make an exhaustive
review of the evidence, the greater part of which is discussed at length in the
dissenting reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Branca in the Court of
Appeal, but the facts which I have recited are uncontradicted and in my opinion
afford more than sufficient evidence upon which a properly instructed jury
could have convicted the appellant of manslaughter.

[Page 788]

The question on his appeal, however, is whether
there was such misdirection in the charge of the learned trial judge as to
justify this Court in ordering a new trial.

In the course of his dissenting reasons for
judgment, Mr. Justice Branca found that the learned trial judge had
misdirected the jury in a number of respects, but I think it fair to say that
his main objections were related to the instructions given to the jury as to
the nature of circumstantial evidence and the effect to be given to it. It is
not disputed that the evidence was entirely circumstantial and in this regard
the trial judge opened his direction to the jury by furnishing them with an
example of the difference between direct and circumstantial evidence. This
example was criticized by Mr. Justice Branca and is now said to have
amounted to misdirection. In this regard the learned trial judge said:

All of the evidence that has been given in
this trial is what is known as circumstantial evidence. To refresh your memory
as to the difference between circumstantial evidence and what is known as
direct evidence I will give you an illustration. If a witness gives evidence
that he saw A stab B with a knife, that is direct evidence that A stabbed B. If
a witness gives evidence that he found a dagger with an unusually long blade in
the possession of A and another witness testified that such a dagger could have
caused B’s wound, that is circumstantial evidence tending to prove that A did
in fact stab B.

The two forms of evidence are equally
admissible but the superiority of direct evidence is that it contains only one
source of error, namely the unreliability of human testimony, where
circumstantial evidence in addition to the unreliability of human testimony
suffers from the difficulty of drawing a correct inference from the
circumstantial evidence.

As the trial judge said, the above illustration
was designed exclusively for the purpose of refreshing the memory of the jury
as to the difference between direct and circumstantial evidence and although it
was so unhappily phrased as to have been potentially misleading if it had stood
alone, I think the fact that, as will hereafter appear, it was; almost
immediately followed by a

[Page 789]

correct statement of the effect to be given to
circumstantial evidence, served to offset any wrong impression of the law which
it might have left in the minds of the jurors.

It seems to me that the only valid criticism of
this illustration must relate to the final words “tending to prove that A did
in fact stab B”. There can be no doubt that it was correct to say “If a witness
gives evidence that he saw A stab B with a knife, that is direct evidence that
A stabbed B”, and I think it was also correct to say that “If a witness gives
evidence that he found a dagger with an unusually long blade in the possession
of A and another witness testified that such a dagger could have caused B’s
wound, that is circumstantial evidence”, but standing alone it is not evidence
“that A did in fact stab B” although, taken in conjunction with evidence of
other facts, it might afford a link in a chain of circumstantial evidence so
that when the whole was taken together a jury might be justified in reaching
the conclusion that the circumstances were consistent only with guilt and
inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. Having stated correctly that
it was circumstantial evidence, it will be observed that the trial judge
proceeded to point out that while the value of direct evidence is dependant
upon the reliability of human testimony, the value of circumstantial evidence
suffers also “from the difficulty of drawing a correct inference” from the
testimony as to the existence of the circumstances, and he went on to state
correctly the rule which has been established for the evaluation of such
evidence, saying:

It is therefore my duty to urge you not to
find the accused guilty on circumstantial evidence alone, unless you are
satisfied, not only that the circumstantial evidence is consistent with the
conclusion that the accused committed the offence with which he is charged, but
also that the facts which have been proved are such as to be inconsistent with
any other rational conclusion than that the accused is guilty of the offence
with which he is charged.

There can be no exception taken to this part of
the charge as it is phrased in very much the same

[Page 790]

language as that employed by Baron Alderson in Hodge’s
case[2], which
was approved and adopted in this Court in R. v. Comba[3].

It is contended, however, that the next
paragraph of the charge constituted misdirection and indeed in the opinion of
Mr. Justice Branca, it was “completely erroneous”. This paragraph reads as
follows:

If you come to the conclusion that the
evidence is equally consistent with the innocence of the accused as with the
guilt of the accused, then it is your duty to give the accused the benefit of
the doubt and not convict him on circumstantial evidence standing alone.

Mr. Justice Branca expressed his opinion of
this direction in the following language:

The direction, in my humble judgment, should
have been that if the jury found the evidence consistent with guilt but
likewise consistent with a rational hypothesis of innocence the jury should
acquit the appellant, not on the basis of giving the appellant the benefit of a
reasonable doubt, but because the evidence did not satisfy the test laid down
in the Hodge’s case. It was only if the evidence satisfied the test in Hodge’s
case that the jury would have to consider the doctrine of reasonable doubt
and then only if upon the whole of the evidence they entertained a reasonable
doubt as to the guilt of the accused.

I think that these observations of the learned
judge must be read in light of the following statement made on behalf of this
Court in McLean v. The King[4], where
it is said:

The respect in which the learned judge’s
charge is said to be insufficient as a proper direction to the jury is that he
did not instruct them that, in so far as they relied upon circumstantial
evidence in the case before them, they must be satisfied not only that the circumstances
proved were all consistent with the guilt of the accused, but also that they
were inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. This is the rule laid
down by Baron Alderson as far back as the Hodge case, and it has ever
since been recognized as a proper direction to jurors.

It is of last importance, we do not doubt,
where the evidence adduced by the Crown is solely or mainly of what is commonly
described as circumstantial, that

[Page 791]

the jury should be brought to realize that
they ought not to find a verdict against the accused unless convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt that the guilt of the accused is the only reasonable
explanation of the facts established by the evidence. But there is no single
exclusive formula which it is the duty of the trial judge to employ. As a rule
he would be well advised to adopt the language of Baron Alderson or its
equivalent.

More recently, in The Queen v. Mitchell[5], which was a case of capital murder,
where Mr. Justice Spence was dealing with the effect of the rule in Hodge’s
case in relation to proof of planning and deliberation, he had occasion to
say, at page 479:

The direction in Hodge’s case did
not add to or subtract from the requirement that proof of guilt in a criminal
case must be beyond a reasonable doubt. It provided a formula to assist in
applying the accepted standard of proof in relation to the first only of the
two essential elements in a crime; i.e., the commission of the act as distinct
from the intent which accompanied that act. The first element, assuming every
circumstance could be established by evidence, would be capable of proof to a
demonstration. The latter element, save perhaps out of the mouth of the accused
himself, could never be so proved. The circumstances which establish the former
not only can be, but must be consistent with each other, as otherwise a
reasonable doubt on the issue arises.

With the greatest respect for the views
expressed by Mr. Justice Branca, I think that his criticism of the last of
the above-quoted paragraphs of the charge of the learned trial judge is founded
on too rigid an adherence to the letter of the charge given by Baron Alderson
to the jury in Hodge’s case which resulted in his treating the words of
that charge as if they embodied a principle which was quite distinct from the
question of reasonable doubt. It appears to me on the contrary that, on
analysis, the language used in Hodge’s case does nothing more than
provide a graphic illustration of the principle that where the evidence is
purely circumstantial it must be made plain to the jury that in order to be
satisfied of the guilt of the ac-

[Page 792]

cused beyond a reasonable doubt, they must first
be satisfied that the circumstances are such as to be inconsistent with any
other rational conclusion than that the accused was the guilty person.

If the jury is left in doubt as to whether or
not the circumstances are equally consistent with some conclusion other than
guilt, then it is their duty “to give the accused the benefit of the doubt and
not to convict him on (the) circumstantial evidence standing alone”. I do not
think that the learned judge was saying any more than this and I am satisfied
that there was no misdirection in this passage.

I think it pertinent to observe also that much
later in his charge to the jury, in discussing the theory of the defence in
detail, the learned trial judge said:

The defence also relies heavily on the rule
on circumstantial evidence. The defence says that there are many conclusions
they may come to by making inferences from the evidence that are equally
consistent with the innocence of the accused as with the guilt of the accused
and if you apply these doctrines—these three doctrines, presumption of
innocence, reasonable doubt and the rule of circumstantial evidence—you can
only arrive at a verdict of acquittal.

While I do not consider that the charge to the
jury in this case afforded a model of the way in which juries should be
instructed with respect to circumstantial evidence, I am nevertheless satisfied
that when read as a whole it contains no errors in this regard which would
warrant this Court in quashing the conviction and ordering a new trial.

Further objection is taken to the charge of the
learned trial judge to the jury on the ground that after he had directed them
as to the law and recited the theory of the Crown and that of the defence, he
proceeded to review the evidence of each of the witnesses without relating each
item of evidence to the issues in the case and giving the jury specific
instructions as to whether it could or could not properly form the basis of an
inference as to those issues.

I do not think that any such duty lies upon a
judge when instructing a jury, but I find it unnecessary to trace the details
of the learned trial judge’s charge in this regard because I do not

[Page 793]

question the accuracy of the comment made by
Chief Justice Davey in the last two paragraphs of his reasons for judgment
where he said:

After explaining to the jury in the light
of the evidence the case for the Crown and the weaknesses in it alleged by the
defence, and the defence’s case the learned trial Judge proceeded to give to
the jury a summary of the evidence witness by witness, instead of analysing it
and relating it to the cases of Crown and defence.

For myself, when I was on the trial bench,
I preferred the latter method when it was suitable, but there have been many
eminent Judges who preferred the former. I think it must be left to each trial
Judge to use the method that he considers best suited to the case then before
him, provided his charge meets the requirements laid down by the authorities.
In my respectful opinion the present charge did.

It was suggested in argument that each item of
circumstantial evidence should be subjected to the test in Hodge’s case
and I think in this regard that it is well to bear in mind the language used in
this Court by Taschereau J. in Côté v. The King[6], where he said:

It may be, and such is very often the case,
that the facts proven by the Crown, examined separately have not a very strong
probative value; but all the facts put in evidence have to be considered each
one in relation to the whole, and it is all of them taken together, that may
constitute a proper basis for a conviction.

Counsel on behalf of the appellant contended
also that the conviction should be quashed on the ground that a statement made
by the appellant to the police on the 7th of September was admitted in evidence
without a voir dire having first been conducted. The statement was made at 2
o’clock on the afternoon of the day on which the appellant had been taken into
custody for interrogation, no charge had been laid against him and the police
were simply seeking to determine the whereabouts of Graffie George. The
statement which was finally admitted purported to be an account of the
appellant’s activities during the summer of 1967 and particularly after the
22nd of August,

[Page 794]

and in the course of it he stated that he had
last seen Graffie George on the 25th of August. This statement was made after
careful warning had been given to the accused by the police officers concerned
and it was treated by the trial judge as being exculpatory in character, but it
has been suggested that because no voir dire was held to determine the
voluntary character of the statement, it should not have been admitted on the
ground that the circumstances are governed by the recent decision of this Court
in Piché v. The Queen[7], where
the trial judge, after conducting a lengthy voir dire, ruled that a statement
made by the accused was inadmissible on the ground that it had not been made
voluntarily and it was contended that the statement should have been admitted
on the ground that it was exculpatory.

The most significant part of the statement made
on the 7th of September was that the accused had last seen Graffie George on
the 25th of August, but this information had already been given to Constable
Pelletier on the 5th of September when he was on patrol in the neighborhood of
Haines Junction and encountered the accused with his brother and sister-in-law.
In this regard the Constable gave the following evidence:

Q. Without referring to the text of the
conversation you had with any of these people and particularly any conversation
you might have had with the accused Alec John, will you tell the court of the
encounter with these people—what happened?

A. We stopped and talked with these three
individuals.

Q. What about?

A. We talked in generalities, to begin
with, then I asked Alec John where Graffie George might be.

Q. And did he reply? A. He did, sir.

The answer given by the accused to this question
was that the last time he had seen Graffie George was on the 25th of August and
counsel for the appellant expressly stated that he had no objection to the
admissibility of this statement on the ground that it was exculpatory. In my
view, this statement was admissible not because it was exculpatory, but because
it was volunteered by the

[Page 795]

appellant, and I can see no objection to the
admissibility of the evidence to the effect that the appellant repeated it to
the police on the 7th of September under the circumstances above described.

In the concluding paragraph of the reasons for
judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Hall on behalf of the majority of this
Court in the Piché case (page 40) he summarized the effect of that
decision by saying:

On the basis that there is no distinction
to be drawn between inculpatory and exculpatory statements as such in so far as
their admissibility in evidence when tendered by the Crown is concerned, I
would allow the appeal and restore the verdict of acquittal rendered by the
jury.

The question of whether a statement is
inculpatory or exculpatory and whether or not it is voluntary, are two entirely
different matters and it is made plain in the Piché case that where it
has been shown that a statement made by an accused to a person in authority was
not voluntarily made, it is to be excluded whether it be exculpatory or
inculpatory.

The question of whether or not all the
statements made to the police on and after September 7th can be said to have
been voluntary and therefore admissible without the holding of a voir dire, in
my opinion does not have to be decided in the present case because even if the
appellant’s rambling account of his activities after August 22nd should not
have been admitted as it was, this would in no way affect the relevancy and
admissibility of the all important evidence that he led the police officers to
the place where the body of Graffie George was concealed. This circumstance
places this case in the same category as that of The Queen v. Wray[8], which was also recently decided in
this Court. In that case the location of the murder weapon was pointed out to
the police by the accused and, following the judgment of McRuer C.J. in Rex
v. St. Lawrence[9], it
was held that although a confession made by the respondent was legally
inadmissible because it was not

[Page 796]

voluntary, nevertheless the Crown was entitled
to prove not only the finding of the murder weapon, but also the fact that its
location had been pointed out to the police by the accused and so much of the
confession as was verified by the fact of the finding was held to be
admissible.

In the concluding paragraph of his reasons for
judgment in the Wray case, Mr. Justice Martland, speaking for the
majority of the Court at page 19, said:

…on the issue of the admissibility of the
evidence sought to be introduced by the Crown in this case, notwithstanding the
exclusion of the confession, the law in Canada is correctly stated by McRuer
C.J.H.C. in The King v. St. Lawrence, at page 391:

Where the discovery of the fact confirms
the confession—that is, where the confession must be taken to be true by reason
of the discovery of the fact—then that part of the confession that is confirmed
by the discovery of the fact is admissible, but further than that no part of
the confession is admissible.

Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the
learned trial judge erred in law in excluding evidence as to the facts leading
up to the finding of the rifle, and in excluding such parts of the confession
as were confirmed as true by the discovery of such facts.

In the present case the appellant did not lead
the police officer to the place where the body was concealed until he had been
in custody for seven days during which time he had been subjected to constant
questioning, but, as I have indicated, I have no doubt that the evidence of the
body having been found under those circumstances was both relevant and
admissible, and when this evidence is considered in conjunction with the
statement made by the appellant to his nephew on September 1st that he “did not
know if he should turn himself in or not”, then, as I have indicated, I think
it becomes unnecessary to pursue any further the question of whether or not the
statements made by the appellant to the police on or after September 7th should
not have been admitted without the holding of a voir dire.

It will be seen that I am in general agreement
with the reasons for judgment of Chief Justice Davey in the Court of Appeal,
but I would add

[Page 797]

that even if this were not so and I considered
that some error had been made by the learned trial judge, I am of opinion that
the circumstances were consistent with the appellant having unlawfully killed
Graffie George and that the facts are inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion, so that a reasonable jury properly instructed would necessarily
have returned a verdict of guilty and I would therefore have applied the
provisions of s. 592(1)(b) (iii) of the Criminal Code.

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

HALL J. (dissenting)—I agree with my
brothers Spence, Pigeon and Laskin that the five paragraphs referred to in
their reasons constitute misdirection, and were it not for the admission in
evidence of statements made by appellant on September 7th and September 14th to
Staff Sergeant Dwernichuk without a voir dire having been held, I would
agree with my brother Pigeon that this was a proper case for applying the
provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code.

However, I cannot ignore that a voir dire was
not held, and this despite that one was asked for by appellant’s counsel. The
record is clear in this regard.

The statements made by appellant to Dwernichuk
cover two interviews. The first was on September 7th, the day he was arrested,
when notes were made by Dwernichuk of what appellant said. The second was on
September 14th during which the notes made by Dwernichuk on September 7th were
produced, discussed with appellant, handed to him and, according to Dwernichuk,
torn up by appellant as being untrue and following which appellant eventually
led the police officers to the place where the body of the deceased, wrapped in
a blanket, was found hidden underneath a willow windfall. She had been dead
some time as the body was in an advanced state of decomposition.

I do not suggest that the evidence of the
finding of the body in the place pointed out to the police officers by
appellant or of appellant’s movements

[Page 798]

leading up to the finding of the body were not
admissible, but as was held in The Queen v. Wray[10], that does not involve admitting
the whole of the confession but only those parts leading up to the finding of
the body unless the confession as a whole has been ruled to be voluntary. In
the present case, extracts of what appellant said on September 7th and the
whole of the interview of September 14th were admitted and in both cases
without a voir dire to determine whether either or both statements were
made voluntarily. It is true that Staff Sergeant Dwernichuk said that he warned
the accused, but that evidence was given in the presence of the jury.

Piché v. The Queen[11], referred to by my brother Ritchie, decided that “exculpatory
statements made to a person in authority by an accused shall be subject on a voir
dire to the same requirements as inculpatory statements…”. Piché is
not authority for the proposition that the question of whether a statement
being tendered in evidence by the Crown was or was not voluntary can be decided
in the presence of the jury. That situation did not arise in Piché. The
only way a trial judge, trying an accused with a jury, can determine whether or
not any statement given by the accused to a person in authority being tendered
by the Crown is voluntary or involuntary is by holding a voir dire in
the absence of a jury. That was not done here and, in my view, it is an error
of such consequence that this Court ought not to say that no substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice has occurred.

I would, accordingly, set aside the conviction
and direct a new trial.

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—I have had the
opportunity of reading the reasons of my brethren Ritchie, Pigeon and Laskin
JJ., however, I feel I must deliver short additional reasons. I shall not

[Page 799]

repeat the outline of the facts except in so far
as they are relevant to these reasons.

I concur with the view of Pigeon and Laskin JJ.
that the five paragraphs in the charge of the trial judge to the jury recited
in the reasons of Laskin J. do constitute a misdirection. I cannot, however,
agree with Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. that this misdirection did not constitute a
fatal error in the charge or that it was cured by other statements in the
charge of the learned trial judge in which the rule as to circumstantial
evidence was stated correctly. On the other hand, I concur with Laskin J. that
the faults pointed out would have the effect of permitting the jury to apply to
the assessment of the probative value of the circumstantial evidence a much
less stringent test than that set out by Baron Alderson in Hodge’s case[12]. That test has, on numerous occasions,
been approved by this Court and its use, although certainly not in its exact
words, has been required when the evidence is wholly or largely circumstantial.

In my view, another ruling during the course of
the trial resulted in an error which could not be corrected by any statement in
the charge and which must result in a new trial. Laskin J. has outlined these
circumstances in reference to Staff Sergeant Dwernichuk’s evidence. That officer
testified that he interviewed the accused on September 7th, the day on which
the latter was arrested. The learned trial judge ruled without carrying on any
proper voir dire that the Staff Sergeant’s evidence as to such interview was
admissible giving as his reason that the statements made during the interview
by the accused were altogether exculpatory. After the trial judge had so ruled,
the officer was recalled; he testified that he had warned the accused and that
the accused had acknowledged that he knew the meaning of the warning and then
the officer outlined in very considerable detail the accused’s account of his
actions from June of that year until his arrest on the 7th of September. The
Staff Sergeant testified that he had made notes of that long statement by the
accused and that later, on the 14th of September, one of the many occasions
when he had questioned the accused, the latter tore up such notes.

[Page 800]

Although counsel for the accused cross-examined
Staff Sergeant Dwernichuk as to the voluntary nature of that long statement,
such cross-examination took place in the presence of the jury. As I have said,
there was never a proper voir dire in the absence of the jury. Counsel for the
accused was never given an opportunity to adduce evidence as to the voluntary
nature of the statement nor to address argument thereon after the Crown’s
evidence had been adduced. The argument as to admissibility made in the absence
of the jury was prior to the testimony given by the Staff Sergeant and was
addressed to the court on the basis of what that evidence would be. The
argument and the decision to admit the evidence was solely on the basis that
the statement was wholly exculpatory. Counsel for the accused had objected to
the admission of the evidence stating the issues in these words:

MR. HUDSON: Oh, yes. It is something that I
am aware of, but it is lengthy, and there are two issues to be concerned with.
One is, I think, is it exculpatory or inculpatory. And secondly, is it
voluntary.

to which the Court had replied:

The voluntariness only applies in the event
we find it is inculpatory.

The record contains no transcript of the address
of counsel but one may well imagine how damaging would be the Crown’s reference
to a statement made by the accused on the day of his arrest the untruth of
which the Crown had proved as to one item after another. The learned trial
judge, in his charge, as my brethren have pointed out, merely recited short
summaries of the evidence of the various witnesses for the Crown, no evidence having
been adduced for the defence, in the chronological order in which it had been
adduced. His reference to the evidence given on this topic by Staff Sergeant
Dwernichuk was:

Staff Sergeant Dwernichuk gave evidence of
the accused setting out in detail what he had done from August 14th to
September 7th, and further gave evidence of the accused tearing up those notes
when he was having a subsequent conversation with him on September 14th. Staff
Sergeant Dwernichuk also

[Page 801]

told of the journey which they had made,
that is, McLeod, the accused and himself, on September 14th, ending up with
finding the body at the location north of 1011.6.

However, much earlier in his charge, the learned
trial judge had said:

The Crown’s theory is that the actions of
the accused on the night—evening—of August 22nd and during the day at the
Chapman home on August 23rd, the false statements which the accused—the Crown
alleges the accused made, the fact that the Crown alleges that the accused knew
where the body of Graffie George was, all indicate that he knew of her death.

This Court in Piché v. The Queen[13], by its judgment delivered on June
26, 1970, has decided that no statement made by an accused to a person in
authority whether such statement is alleged to be exculpatory or inculpatory
may be admitted in evidence unless and until its voluntary nature had first
been determined on a proper voir dire. That judgment, of course, was delivered
long after the date of the learned trial judge’s charge to the jury in the
present case. It does, however, set out the law of Canada now and when the
present appeal is to be decided and I am of the opinion that it applies
particularly to the present case. The result must be that the admission of the
accused’s statement to Staff Sergeant Dwernichuk made on the 7th of September
without any determination of its voluntary character in a proper voir dire
resulted in there being placed before the jury inadmissible evidence of a most
important and a most damaging character. The accused, on September 7th, was
under arrest. It is true that no charge had been laid and that Staff Sergeant
Dwernichuk in his evidence testified that the charges which were then
contemplated were those of kidnapping and breaking and entering. The Staff
Sergeant admitted, however, that he told the accused he was investigating the
whereabouts of Graffie George, as to whose death the accused was convicted of
manslaughter. Therefore, there can be no doubt that the accused knew he was in
jeopardy when the statement was made.

[Page 802]

In my opinion, the decision of this Court in The
Queen v. Wray[14], delivered
on the same 26th of June 1970, cannot affect this issue. I am not
concerned with the evidence as to the finding of the body of the deceased woman
as a result of statements and actions of the accused long after September 7th
but I am concerned with the admission of the statement made by the accused on
that September 7th without any proper determination of its voluntary character.

I turn finally to the provisions of
s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code. Both of my brethren
Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. would apply such section to dismiss the appeal. I
must, however, concur with my brother Laskin J. and would refuse to do so. The
proper application of that paragraph of the Code had been determined in this
Court in a series of cases from Allen v. The King[15] to Colpitts v. The Queen[16] and, in the latter decision at
p. 755, the words of the judgment in Brooks v. The King[17] are adopted:

Misdirection in a material matter having
been shown, the onus was upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that the jury,
charged as it should have been, could not, as reasonable men, have done
otherwise than find the appellant guilty.

I am of the opinion that such a test is as
applicable to the adducing of inadmissible evidence as to misdirection in the
charge. One cannot conclude that a jury properly charged on admissible
evidence, that is, without it having heard very damaging and inadmissible
evidence, which this jury did hear, could not have done otherwise than convict
the accused.

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and
direct a new trial.

PIGEON J.—The facts and the issues in this case
are stated in the reasons of my brothers Ritchie and Laskin. Although I am in
general

[Page 803]

agreement with the former, I feel obliged to say
that taken by themseves, the five paragraphs dealing with circumstantial
evidence, at the outset of the charge, would, in my opinion, constitute
misdirection.

In the second of those paragraphs, namely the
illustration of the difference between direct and circumstantial evidence, the
second sentence, the illustration of circumstantial evidence, is, in my view,
erroneous in its entirety, not only in the concluding words. Although the facts
that (a) “a dagger with an unusually long blade was found in the possession of
A”, and (b) “such a dagger could have caused B’s wound”, would be admissible in
evidence on a charge that A stabbed B, this could not properly be said to be
“circumstantial evidence”. It does no more than reveal a possibility, suggest a
conjecture or, at most, raise a suspicion.

The concept of circumstantial evidence as
defined by the authorities, especially McLean v. The King[18], requires facts such that their
existence is a premise from which the existence of the principal fact may be
concluded by necessary laws of reasoning. To support a conviction those facts
must be such that guilt can properly be inferred from them by the jury. If the
guilt cannot rationally be deduced from the set of facts proved, there is no
need to consider the further question whether any other rational conclusion is
possible. The question whether the weight of the evidence is sufficient to
support a conclusion does not arise: there is no evidence. Such is clearly the
situation in the hypothetical case presented to the jury as an illustration of
“circumstantial evidence”. I cannot agree with the Court of Appeal that,
because this was presented only for the purpose of explaining the distinction
between the two kinds of evidence, it is not in itself misleading.

Then, in the last of the five paragraphs above
referred to, the jury are told that it is their duty “to give the accused the
benefit of the doubt” if “the evidence is equally consistent with the innocence
of the accused as with the guilt of the accused”. Although this is literally
true, it is, in

[Page 804]

my view, highly misleading because the obvious
implication is that if the circumstantial evidence is more consistent with the
guilt than the innocence, then they may convict. If, on a criminal charge
resting on circumstantial evidence, the facts are equally consistent with
innocence as with guilt, it is not a question of giving the accused “the
benefit of the doubt”. There is simply no evidence because, as previously
stated, circumstantial evidence requires facts from which guilt is the only rational
inference. If innocence is an equally rational inference, there is no proof of
guilt at all.

I cannot accept that the defect in the last
paragraph is overborne by the correct statement of the rule in the immediately
preceding paragraph. However, I agree that the rule on circumstantial evidence
is nothing more than a formula to assist in applying the accepted standard of
proof “beyond a reasonable doubt” to a criminal case resting upon such
evidence. It is therefore seriously misleading to couple that rule with a
statement that really implies a different and much lower standard.

I have considered it specially necessary to deal
at some length with the above-mentioned five paragraphs of the charge because,
as pointed out by my brother Laskin, they are taken verbatim from model
instructions proposed in a current book. Those are not therefore improvised
directions, but prepared instructions written in advance. It is to be hoped
that proper steps will be taken to ensure that the necessity of correcting the
offending paragraphs is brought to the attention of all users of the work and
of its French version as well.

Although for the above reasons I must hold that
the five above-mentioned paragraphs constituting the trial judge’s instructions
on circumstantial evidence at the beginning of his charge would, if considered
by themselves, constitute misdirection, the charge must be considered in its
entirety in the context of the actual facts of the case in order to determine
whether, on the whole, there is really misdirection. At this point, it must be
noted that, after the above-mentioned prelim-

[Page 805]

inary instructions, the judge went on to explain
the nature of the offence Charged. In conclusion of that part of his address,
after enumerating the elements that must be proved, he said:

Therefore, if after considering all the
evidence, the arguments of counsel, and my charge, you come to the conclusion
that the Crown has proved to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt, each
and every one of such items then in such circumstances it is your duty to find
the accused guilty of the offence of manslaughter.

Alternatively, if after considering all the
evidence, the arguments of counsel, and my charge, you come to the conclusion
that the Crown has failed to prove to your satisfaction, beyond a reasonable
doubt, either or both of such items, then in such circumstances it is your duty
to give the accused the benefit of that doubt and to acquit him.

In my view, those perfectly clear instructions
on the burden of the proof, coming as they did after an enumeration of the
elements of the offence, clearly dissipated any unfortunate implication as to
the standard of proof, that might have arisen out of the concluding paragraph of
the preliminary instructions on circumstantial evidence.

The trial judge then went on “to deal with the
theory of the crown’s case” and he concluded that part of his address as
follows:

The Crown says the way in which Graffie
George met her death was inconsistent with accident—that she met her death
while with the accused, and that she met her death by the actions of some other
person, and the Crown says that this was the accused. The Crown says there is
only one rational conclusion—she died at the hands of the accused, by assault.

Then, going on to the defence theory, he said
among other things, after a paragraph quoted by my brother Ritchie:

The Defence says that one rational
conclusion that is not inconsistent with the evidence is that Graffie George suffered
accidentally a fall on the hills or into the creek which could have rationally
caused the injuries in question, and that there are many other rational
conclusions as to how the deceased met her death.

[Page 806]

Lastly, before going on to review the evidence,
he concluded that part of his address by saying:

…the Crown says if accident was the cause
of death, why was the body wrapped, and the Defence answer to the Crown’s
theory is that on the Doctor’s evidence—Doctor Morrow’s evidence—death would occur
at a time when a person in whose company she was would not know the reason for
the death, and being apprehensive would wrap the body. That is the Defence
answer to that part of the Crown’s theory.

It is therefore apparent that in explaining the
rule on circumstantial evidence in its application to the actual facts of the
case, the trial judge always correctly relied exclusively on the proper
statement, that is that it must exclude any other rational conclusion. Also he
correctly related it to facts which undoubtedly constituted circumstantial
evidence and not merely grounds for conjecture or suspicion.

In the instant case, the facts relied on as
circumstantial evidence could, in no way, be likened to those in the
unfortunate illustration. They undoubtedly came within the proper concept of
such evidence and it could not possibly be contended that there was no
evidence. Therefore, in view of the manner in which, after the preliminaries,
the trial judge put the concrete facts of the case to the jury, I must hold
that the unfortunate illustration of the difference between direct and
circumstantial evidence cannot possibly have misled the jury and that, on the
whole, this regrettable inaccuracy did not constitute misdirection.

I also agree with Ritchie J. that in any event
this is a proper case for applying the provisions of s. 592(1)(b).(iii)
of the Criminal Code and it is on that basis that I concur in the
dismissal of the appeal notwithstanding what was decided in Piché v. The
Queen[19].

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 807]

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—In this case there
was, admittedly, misdirection by the trial judge which, again admittedly, was
not cured in any other part of his charge to the jury. We confront hence the
recurring question whether, notwithstanding the standing misdirection, the
charge taken as a whole was adequate. This question is quite separate from the
issue of no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. Indeed, there is not
the remotest justification for invoking the provisions of s. 592(1)(b)
(iii) of the Criminal Code against the accused in this appeal. If
the misdirection is fatal to the conviction, the least to which the accused is
entitled is a new trial.

I have no doubt that it is fatal, and that there
must be a new trial. My reasons will be all the shorter because of the summary
of the case, which I adopt, found in the dissenting reasons of Branca J.A. in
the Yukon Territory Court of Appeal[20].

The fundamental problem in this appeal is with
the legal and factual elements of circumstantial evidence and their relation to
the duty of the trial judge in charging the jury thereon. At the forefront of
the case, as it was developed through the evidence, were three issues: First,
was there an assault of the deceased? Second, did the assault cause the death
of the deceased? Third, was the accused the assailant? There was here no direct
evidence that any offence had been committed, and no direct evidence to
implicate the accused in the offence charged. Although the accused had been
living with the deceased, there was no suggestion of any friction between them
nor of any motive for the commission of any offence against her.

Since the trial turned completely on the
strength of the circumstantial evidence offered by the Crown (the defence
proffered no evidence), the important inquiry is whether the trial judge met or
failed to meet the obligation resting upon him

[Page 808]

in charging the jury in such a situation. What
was he obliged to say about the nature of circumstantial evidence, and did he
instruct the jury adequately on the legal standards applicable to
circumstantial evidence, before the jury would be warranted in making findings
against the accused on the issues in the case?

The following passages, which appear
sequentially in the charge, constitute the whole of the trial judge’s direction
on the legal and factual aspects of circumstantial evidence:

All of the evidence that has been given in
this trial is what is known as circumstantial evidence. To refresh your memory
as to the difference between circumstantial evidence, and what is known as
direct evidence. I will give you an illustration. If a witness gives evidence
that he saw A stab B with a knife, that is direct evidence that A stabbed B. If
a witness gives evidence that he found a dagger with an unusually long blade in
the possession of A and another witness testified that such a dagger could have
caused B’s wound, that is circumstantial evidence tending to prove that A did
in fact stab B.

The two forms of evidence are equally
admissible but the superiority of direct evidence is that it contains only one
source of error, namely the unreliability of human testimony, where
circumstantial evidence in addition to the unreliability of human testimony
suffers from the difficulty of drawing a correct inference from the
circumstantial evidence.

It is therefore my duty to urge you not to
find the accused guilty on circumstantial evidence alone, unless you are
satisfied, not only that the circumstantial evidence is consistent with the
conclusion that the accused committed the offence with which he is charged, but
also that the facts which have been proved are such as to be inconsistent with
any other rational conclusion than that the accused is guilty of the offence
with which he is charged.

If you come to the conclusion that the
evidence is equally consistent with the innocence of the accused as with the
guilt of the accused, then it is your duty to give the accused the benefit of
the doubt and not convict him on circumstantial evidence standing alone.

It is patent that the trial judge did not
explain the meaning of circumstantial evidence except by reference to an
illustration which was clearly

[Page 809]

unacceptable. With great respect to the majority
of the Yukon Territory Court of Appeal, I cannot agree with its conclusion that
this error was immaterial because (1) the trial judge’s purpose was merely to
illustrate the difference between direct proof and inferential proof; and (2)
the improper illustration was followed by a correct statement of the rule in Hodge’s
case[21]. This
is simply to confound the legal standard, by which, according to Hodge’s case,
circumstantial evidence is to be judged, with the reasoning process on which
the cogency of circumstantial evidence depends. In my opinion, if the error
made by the trial judge is to be regarded as immaterial, it would be because he
was not obliged in this case to do more than point out to the jury, in such
general words as he in fact used, the difference between direct and
circumstantial evidence. I do not see this as being sufficient for the purposes
of the case with which he had to deal, and the less so in view of his error in
illustration.

Moreover, the deficiency is aggravated by the
way in which the trial judge presented the case to the jury. Once he had
directed the jury on the law, and had given them the theory of the Crown and
stated the defences open on the evidence, he simply narrated (with one
important exception to which I will refer later) what each witness had said,
without relating the evidence to the issues in the case and without indicating
to the jury, either by direct reference or by general caution, the need to
distinguish between those facts which were reasonably probative of the issues
and those which could not be regarded as justifying inferences to that end.

What is required of a trial judge in charging a
jury in a homicide case depends, of course, on the issues and on the nature of
the evidence brought to bear upon them. The generalities that a charge need not
follow any particular formula and that it must not be “fine-combed” are simply
generalities; and the latter observation is as applicable to analysis of a
charge to support its adequacy as it is to scrutiny for fatal fault. Why the
generalities I have mentioned cannot serve

[Page 810]

as a cover for what I consider to be serious
inadequacies in the present case is pointed up by the following references.

First, whether or not an offence had been
committed by anyone, resulting in the death of the deceased, depended on the
evidence of a pathologist called by the Crown. He found no external abrasions,
bruises, cuts or lacerations on the body. An internal examination revealed two
bruises on the chest wall over the ribs, but the ribs and chest organs showed
no injury. Related to the internal bruises were two haemorrhages of the liver.
There was a large bruise in the tissues of the scalp over the crown of the head
but no breach of the skin; and although the skull showed no sign of fracture,
there was a sub-dural haemorrhage over the left side of the brain, which had
been pushed down by the haemorrhage, and this was the cause of death. The
witness testified that the bruise on the head was the result of the application
of a blunt type of force, and it could come from a self-inflicted bump or from
an accidental fall. Death, according to the witness, would not be instantaneous
but could take some hours, possibly up to ten, and during this period there
would be headaches, sometimes dizziness and staggering.

The medical evidence, taken alone, could not
support a finding that the deceased came to her death as a result of the
wrongful act of another person, if such a finding had to meet the probative
test of being inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The trial judge
made no point of this in his charge, but allowed his narration of the
pathologist’s evidence to speak for itself in that respect. I would not regard
this as in itself fatal to the charge but it does not stand alone.

Second, the trial judge’s narration of the
evidence as given by each witness faltered in respect of the evidence of Staff
Sergeant Dwernichuk. That witness gave evidence of statements by the accused
made during a one and one-half hour interview on September 7, 1967, the date

[Page 811]

on which the accused was arrested. He was not
arrested on any charge but was told only that the police were investigating the
whereabouts of the deceased. Interviews were held also on September 8,
September 9, September 10, September 11 and September 14. Indeed, as the
witness put it “I don’t recall the exact—exact number of times. At least twice
a day, and I believe on a few days three times a day”. Notes were taken by the
police of what was said by the accused on these occasions but there was no
formal reduction to writing of what he had said and nothing was signed by him.
On September 14, the notes of the interview of September 7 were handed to the
accused and he tore them up. Crown counsel told the trial judge that the
accused had asked for the notes, and said, in tearing them up, “that’s not
right’ or something to that effect”. Thereafter, on the same day, the accused
drove with the police to a number of places and eventually to a place where the
body of the deceased was found wrapped in canvas tenting.

What the police sought to put in evidence was
the recollection of Staff Sergeant Dwernichuk of what the accused said on
September 7 and what was done on September 14. The question of a “voir dire”
was raised in respect of the September 7 interview but the trial jury ruled
that the proposed evidence was totally exculpatory and was therefore admissible
without a voir dire. Defence counsel had also objected to the selective
proposal of the Crown to put in only the statements of the one interview and
not all the statements made by the accused.

The statements of the accused so put in through
the mouth of the Staff Sergeant were a detailed account of his activities and
his movements and association with the deceased during the summer of 1967 and
particularly from August 14, 1967 until his arrest on September 7. The trial
judge’s reference to this evidence was in these words:

Staff Sergeant Dwernichuk gave evidence of
the accused setting out in detail what he had done from

[Page 812]

August 14th to September 7th, and further
gave evidence of the accused tearing up those notes when he was having a
subsequent conversation with him on September 14th. Staff Sergeant Dwernichuk
also told of the journey which they had made, that is, McLeod, the accused and
himself, on September 14th, ending up with finding the body at the location
north of 1011.6.

Counsel for the accused did not challenge the
admissibility per se of the evidence of the accused’s statements (once
they had been declared to be totally exculpatory), and hence the issue recently
canvassed by this Court in Piché v. The Queen[22], decided on June 26, 1970, (and
with the disposition of which I agree) did not arise. But he did object to the
unbalanced reference to this evidence made by the trial judge, especially in
the light of an earlier reference in the charge to “the false statements which
the accused—the Crown alleges the accused made”. If the basis of the
admissibility of the statements was that they were all exculpatory—and I can
only so regard them in the blunt sense that there was no confession of
guilt—the trial judge could not let them stand without comment (and without
even telling the jury that the statements were evidence for the accused as well
as against him), when they involved a variety of admissions which, without
proper direction, could mislead the jury into inferences of guilt. The
probability of such inferences would be fed by the erroneous illustration of
circumstantial evidence given by the trial judge.

Third, the failure of the trial judge to relate
the evidence to the issues in the light of the circumstantial nature of the
Crown’s case is additionally highlighted by his reference to the evidence of
Linda Chapman (who later became Mrs. Boily), and his omission to mention,
let alone relate to it, certain qualifying evidence of the witness Kerry.
Branca J.A. dealt with this point and I need not review it in detail here.

[Page 813]

Equally relevant to the point under discussion,
although not reversible error if considered in isolation, was the evidence
relating to the time of the theft of the tent material in which the body of the
deceased was wrapped; and also the evidence respecting the box of cut-up wild
meat transported by the accused by truck on August 27, evidence which could
lead more to conjecture than to inference that the accused was concealing the
deceased’s body in the box.

I can best sum up my conclusion that there was
fatal non-direction amounting to misdirection in this case by quoting remarks
attributed to Baron Alderson, who presided in Hodge’s case, as found in
a contemporaneous manuscript report and reproduced in Wills on
Circumstantial Evidence (1937, 7th ed.), at p. 45:

It was necessary to warn the jury against
the danger of being misled by a train of circumstantial evidence. The mind was
apt to take a pleasure in adapting circumstances to one another, and even
straining them a little, if need be, to force them to form parts of one
connected whole; and the more ingenious the mind of the individual, the more
likely was it, in considering such matters, to overreach and mislead itself, to
supply some little link that is wanting, to take for granted some fact
consistent with its previous theories and necessary to render them complete.

Notwithstanding the fact that the issue
determined by this Court in Piché v. The Queen was an open one at the
time of the trial herein, I do not think that this should militate against the
rights of the accused to enjoy its protection so far as it can be provided in
this appeal. Hence, apart from all other considerations canvassed in these reasons,
the failure of the Crown to establish the voluntariness of the accused’s
statements, albeit they were exculpatory, warrants the quashing of the
conviction and a direction for a new trial.

Counsel for the Crown in this appeal conceded
that the trial judge had incorrectly mixed up the principle of reasonable doubt
with the rule as to circumstantial evidence, but urged that neither this nor
other errors were, on an overall assess-

[Page 814]

ment of the charge, fatal to the conviction. The
reference to the incorrect mix-up was to the last paragraph of the portions of
the charge already quoted and which I repeat here:

If you come to the conclusion that the
evidence is equally consistent with the innocence of the accused as with the
guilt of the accused, then it is your duty to give the accused the benefit of
the doubt and not convict him on circumstantial evidence standing alone.

If the paragraph reflected merely a mix-up of
the kind mentioned, I would not have thought that the jury could have been
misled because in either case they would have understood the heavy burden of
proof upon the Crown. The defect in the paragraph goes, however, beyond the
concession of counsel; it suggests a lower burden of proof upon the Crown than
proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and is a formulation that ought not to be
used. In any event, counsel’s concession requires comment.

Where circumstantial evidence is admitted
against an accused, it has become obligatory in this country to charge a jury
in accordance with the formula taken from the report of Hodge’s case[23], or for a trial judge sitting alone to pay
heed to that formula. I do not regard the formula as fixing a different or
higher burden of proof for the Crown to meet than the traditional burden of
proof beyond a reasonable doubt. This burden of proof is, of course, the
ultimate one, to be met at the conclusion of all the evidence. In a manner of
speaking, it may be said that this traditional burden rests upon the Crown with
respect to each issue in the particular case. Thus, it is not wrong for a trial
judge to instruct the jury, or to direct himself, that where proof of any issue
depends on circumstantial evidence alone, that evidence must provide a basis
for the necessary inferential proof of that issue to a degree that would make
it unreasonable to come to any other conclusion. Indeed, it was pointed out by
Cartwright J., as

[Page 815]

he then was, in Lizotte v. The King[24], that a direction in the Hodge terms
is obligatory where proof of any essential ingredient of an offence is sought
to be made by circumstantial evidence.

I have deliberately used the word “unreasonable”
rather than the formula of “inconsistent with any other rational conclusion”
because I think it may confuse or create a double standard, to the bewilderment
of a jury, if different key words are used to instruct them on their ultimate
duty. In a recent judgment of this Court in Wild v. The Queen[25], given on March 19, 1970, both
Cartwright C.J.C. and Spence J., each speaking in dissent on the question
whether an alleged misapplication of the rule in Hodge’s case raised a
question of law, referred to that rule, respectively, as being “only an example
of the application of the rule that an accused can be convicted of a criminal
offence only if the tribunal is satisfied of his guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt” and as involving “a certain degree of intermixture [with] the doctrine
of ‘reasonable doubt’”.

These observations indicate to me that it would
aid clarity in charging a jury if proof of issues by circumstantial evidence
was dealt with in a way that would not suggest that there were possibly
colliding or separate burdens of proof in a case involving such evidence. In my
opinion, the concurrent use of the Hodge formula and the traditional
formula of the burden of proof, in the comprehensive way relative to the case
as a whole in which they are often employed, may obscure or lead to the neglect
of proper instruction on the meaning of circumstantial evidence and on the
process of inference through which the cogency, if any, of circumstantial
evidence is manifested. The present case is an example of what I mean in this
connection.

I would think it preferable, where all or part
of the case against an accused is based on cir-

[Page 816]

cumstantial evidence, to bring only the
traditional burden of proof into relation to such evidence, but at the same
time to emphasize the function of inference through which that evidence has
vitality and show its bearing on the issues to which the evidence is addressed.
This approach may better serve to distinguish for the jury, if not also for the
trial judge, the difference between appraisal of the credibility and weight of
evidence and the burden on the Crown on the whole of it to establish guilt of
an accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

In concluding these reasons, I would point out
that the illustration of circumstantial evidence used by the trial judge is in
the exact words given in Kennedy, Aids to Jury Charges—Criminal (1965),
at p. 25; and, indeed, the trial judge borrowed heavily throughout his
charge from the model instructions proposed in that book.

In the result, I would allow the appeal, set
aside the judgment of the Yukon Territory Court of Appeal and the conviction
entered against the accused, and direct a new trial on the charge of
manslaughter.

MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL

Criminal law—Appeals—Leave to appeal—Refusal
by trial judge to allow counsel for the accused to use French language in the
examination of French-speaking witnesses—Error in law—No wrong or miscarriage
of justice—B.N.A. Act, 1867, s. 133—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51,
s. 592(1)(b)(iii).

[Page 215]

At the trial of the petitioners on an
indictment for attempted murder, counsel for the accused sought to use the
French language in the examination of French-speaking witnesses. The trial judge
refused the request on the grounds that the two accused were English-speaking,
that the jury was made up entirely of jurors speaking that language and that
counsel for the accused, although French-speaking, was perfectly familiar with
the English language. The conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The
petitioners applied for leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The
application should be dismissed.

In view of the provisions of s. 133 of
the B.N.A. Act, the refusal by the judge to accede to the request was an
error on a question of law. However, no wrong or miscarriage of justice had
resulted from that error. The appeal was therefore properly dismissed under the
provisions of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Code.

APPLICATION for leave to appeal from a judgment
of the Court of Queen’s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the conviction of the
petitioners. Application dismissed.

Cyrille Goulet, for the petitioners.

Louis Carrier, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

FAUTEUX J.—On December 2, 1966, a jury of the
Court of Queen’s Bench sitting in the district of Beauharnois, province of
Quebec, Peter V. Shorteno J. presiding, found the petitioners guilty on two
counts of an indictment for attempted murder.

An appeal from this conviction was dismissed on
August 7, 1969, by a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal1,
then composed of Casey, Taschereau, Choquette, Brossard and Salvas JJ.

The petitioners apply for leave to appeal from
this judgment.

We are all of the opinion that this motion
should be dismissed. We find it desirable, how-

[Page 216]

ever, to say a few words on the main point
raised by the motion and which was urged in support of the appeal to the Court
of Queen’s Bench. This is based on the following facts.

At the trial, counsel for the accused sought to
use the French language in the examination of French-speaking witnesses. The
judge refused to allow him to do so considering that the two accused were
English-speaking, that they had elected to be tried by a jury made up entirely
of jurors speaking that language, that such was effectively the actual
composition of the jury and that, in addition, counsel for the accused,
although French-speaking, was perfectly familiar with the English language.

There is nothing to indicate, nor has it been
contended before us, that the request made by counsel for the accused was
intended to obstruct the regular course of the proceedings. It should therefore
be said that, in view of the provisions of s. 133 of the British North
America Act, the refusal by the presiding judge to accede to the
request is an error on a question of law. It may be added that, in answer to a
question put on that point to counsel for the respondent at the outset of the
hearing of the motion, the latter did not hesitate to concede that this was
indeed an error.

However, we agree with the unanimous opinion of
the Court of Appeal, that no wrong or miscarriage of justice has resulted from
that error or from the other grievances raised in support of the motion. It
follows that the appeal was properly dismissed under the provisions of
section 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code.

The motion for leave to appeal is dismissed.

Application dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Evidence—Act of gross
indecency—Psychiatric evidence of state of mind of
accused—Intent—Admissibility—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 149.

The respondent was convicted of attempting to
commit an act of gross indecency. He was found by the police in a hotel bedroom
in bed with another man, who was a female impersonator, and their respective
positions in relation to each other were such as to justify the police in
thinking that an act of gross indecency was taking place or was about to take
place. The respondent seemed stunned after the entry of the police and during
the interview that then took place. His defence was that he had believed his
companion to be a woman. He sought to support his own evidence in this regard
by the evidence of a psychiatrist. The trial judge excluded the psychiatric
evidence based on interviews and tests which was tendered for the purpose of
showing that the respondent had a certain type of defence mechanism which made
him react violently against any homosexual activity and that he therefore would
not have knowingly engaged in the homosexual practices which formed the subject
of the charge.

[Page 264]

The majority of the Court of Appeal held the
evidence to be admissible, set aside the conviction and directed a new trial.
The Crown appealed to this Court.

Held (Ritchie
and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the conviction
restored.

Per Martland
and Judson JJ.: The evidence in question was inadmissible. The psychiatrist was
being tasked for an opinion, not as to whether the respondent was mentally
capable of formulating an intent to commit the crime, but as to whether he did,
on the facts of this case, formulate such an intent. There is no authority
which establishes that the evidence of a psychiatrist can be introduced for a
purpose such as this. What is sought to be done here is to enable a
professional man to express his view to the jury upon the issue of the intent
of the accused, upon evidence which is not before the jury, and which is, in
part, hearsay evidence from the accused himself. The decision of this Court in Wilband
v. R., [1967] S.C.R. 14, is not contrary to this conclusion.

Per Hall J.:
The trial judge should have admitted all the evidence which the psychiatrist
was prepared to give. Whatever other causes there may be for the condition of
homosexuality, psychological factors are of great importance. It follows that
the evidence of psychiatrist is particularly relevant in cases involving
homosexuality and the admissibility of opinion evidence from psychiatrists must
be determined by its relevancy to the matter in issue at the trial. The
evidence was relevant to the defence being put forward on behalf of the
respondent, it was therefore admissible and the trial judge erred in rejecting
it.

However, this was a proper case for the
application of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code. The
evidence against the respondent was overwhelming and the verdict would
necessarily have been the same even if the jury had heard the opinion which the
psychiatrist was prepared to give.

Per Ritchie
and Spence JJ., dissenting: The trial judge should have admitted the
evidence in question. The fact that the methods pursued by the psychiatrist in
reaching his opinion necessitated dependence on information obtained from the
respondent and others which was not before the jury, does not make his opinion
inadmissible although it may well be a fact to be considered in assessing the
weight to be attached to it. The admission of the psychiatrist’s

[Page 265]

evidence as to the respondent’s normal state
of mind would not have offended the rule against the admissibility of hearsay.
On the record, the evidence was tendered for the purpose of proving the
doctor’s opinion that this particular man had a certain type of defence
mechanism that made him react violently against homosexual behaviour. The
question of whether or not a man is homosexually inclined or otherwise sexually
perverted is one upon which an experienced psychiatrist is qualified to express
an opinion and if such opinion is relevant, as it is here, it should be
admitted at a trial such as this even if it involves the psychiatrist in
expressing his conclusion that the accused does not have the capacity to commit
the crime with which he is charged.

APPEAL by the Crown from a majority judgment
of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1],
setting aside the conviction of the respondent and directing a new trial.
Appeal allowed and conviction restored, Ritchie and Spence JJ. dissenting.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
appellant.

G.A. Martin, Q.C., and R.V. Carter, for
the respondent.

The judgment of Martland and Judson JJ. was
delivered by

MARTLAND J.—This is an appeal by the Crown from
a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1, Davey C.J.
dissenting, which set aside the conviction of the respondent of attempting to
commit an act of gross indecency, and directed a new trial.

The facts are as follows:

On February 3, 1967, in the early hours of the
morning, the respondent was observed leaving a cabaret with a person dressed
and made up as a woman and taking a taxi to a hotel where, after registering
under a false name, the two went to a room. Police officers listened at the
locked door for some minutes, heard male voices conversing

[Page 266]

in French, obtained the key for the room from
the hotel clerk and entered. They found the respondent and the other person
naked on a bed. They noticed that the other person was a male, still wearing
the blond female wig and heavy facial makeup in which he had been seen earlier.
Although the officers saw no activity between the two on the bed, at the time
of entry, their position was such that the respondent’s head was lying a very
short distance from the female impersonator’s genital organs. The officers saw
the respondent swing around on the bed away from that position. The respondent
seemed stunned after the entry and during the interview that then took place
with the police officers.

The respondent’s defence was that he had
believed his companion to be a woman.

The legal issue to be determined in this appeal
is as to the admissibility of psychiatric evidence tendered on behalf of the
respondent, which the trial judge ruled was inadmissible, but which the
majority of the Court of Appeal held to be admissible.

The nature of the proposed evidence was
described by counsel for the respondent in the following statement to the Court
at trial:

The purpose for which I am attempting to
tender this evidence is for the Doctor to describe what is the normal state of
mind of Mr. Lupien, and on that basis compare the normal state of mind to
the events that occurred in the room. When that is done then the Doctor has a
norm from which to draw, upon which to base his opinion. Now that fundamentally
is the basis upon which this evidence is being tendered.

Counsel then proceeded to review the nature and
extent of the proposed psychiatric evidence as follows:

The Doctor will say that this man had a
certain type of defensive mechanism that made him react violently to any
homosexual overtone. He will say that is the normal state. And then he will
compare that opinion with what occurred this night and say, “Taking the two
together and having regard to the impact of one upon the other I have the
following opinion to say, namely, he must have believed this

[Page 267]

person was a woman,” and in so far his
perception was diminished because of the things I did state in the hypothetical
question, that because his perception was diminished one of two things occur,
either he was not consciously aware of the genital organ he saw in front of him
in the sense of being able to understand the person was a male or as soon as he
became aware of it he should have rejected it and it would be inconceivable for
him not to reject it.

The psychiatric examination involved the
obtaining of information from the respondent and the psychiatrist said:

This is where I would have to assume the
truthfulness of what he said referable to his background, his attitudes, his
feelings, his beliefs, those things that would allow me to gain some idea and
some opinion as to the sort of person that this man is, basically. As far as an
answer to the question as to the state of this man’s mind at the time or what
happened at that time or what his thinking was at that time, no, it was not
necessary to rely upon the truthfulness of what he had to say.

Essentially, the opinion would be that, based
upon the psychiatric examination, the respondent’s defence must be true.

In criminal trials, psychiatric evidence is most
frequently introduced in cases where a plea of insanity is raised. There the
issue is as to mental capacity and the opinions of experts on the subject of
disease of the mind are clearly relevant and admissible.

In cases under s. 661 of the Criminal Code,
involving the determination as to whether or not the accused is a dangerous
sexual offender, the Court is required to hear the evidence of at least two
psychiatrists. The reason for this provision would appear to be that the Court
is being asked to forecast the likelihood, in the future, of a particular form
of behaviour. The issue is not as to guilt in respect of a crime. It was in
respect of this kind of inquiry that Fauteux J., delivering the judgment of the
Court in Wilband v. R.[2],
defined the permissible sources of information upon which the psychiatrist
could properly rely, including second-hand information.

[Page 268]

In Fisher v. R.[3], which involved a charge of murder, the
defence was that the accused was top drunk to have been capable of forming the
requisite intent. The evidence of the Crown consisted largely of a statement
given by the accused, which gave details of his movements before and after the
killing, which he admitted. Psychiatric evidence was admitted in that case, in
relation to the issue of mental capacity. The witness, having read the
statement and being asked a hypothetical question, in which were included
substantially the material facts related in the statement, stated that, in his
opinion, anyone capable of doing what the accused was alleged to have done,
would have the capacity to form an intent to murder, even if he had consumed 25
glasses of beer, or more.

There is no submission by the respondent in this
case as to incapacity to form an intent to commit the crime charged, on the
basis of insanity, drunkenness, or any other cause. The evidence which counsel
for the respondent sought to lead was not to show that he was mentally
incapable of forming the intent to commit the crime with which he was charged.
Its purpose was to establish (partly on the basis of what the respondent had
told the witness) that because the respondent normally reacted violently to
homosexual practices he must have been telling the truth when, in the proved
situation in which he was discovered, he said he thought his companion was a
women. In other words, the psychiatrist is being asked for an opinion, not as
to whether the respondent was mentally capable of formulating an intent, but as
to whether he did, on the facts of this case, formulate such intent. We have
not been referred to any Canadian or English authority which establishes that
the evidence of a psychiatrist can be introduced for a purpose such as this. If
such evidence is held to be admissible in a case of this kind, then there would
seem to be no reason why, on a charge of murder, psychiatric evidence could not
be led as to the innate abhorrence of the accused

[Page 269]

in respect of physical violence, or on a charge
of theft, of the innate respect of the accused for private property rights.

I agree with the view expressed by Davey C.J. in
this case:

The opinion that Lupien would not have
knowingly engaged in the acts alleged is in the particular circumstances of
this case too dangerous to be admitted, because without any necessity it comes
too close to the very thing the jury had to find on the whole of the evidence.

The jury is required to determine the intent of
the accused upon the evidence before it. What is sought to be done here is to
enable a professional man to express his view to the jury upon that issue, upon
evidence which is not before the jury, and which is, in part, hearsay evidence
from the accused himself. In my opinion evidence of this kind should not be
admitted.

I do not regard the decision of this Court in
the Wilband case, supra as being contrary to this conclusion. As
I have already indicated, the psychiatric evidence in question in that case was
required to be heard by virtue of s. 661(2) of the Criminal Code on
a hearing to determine whether an accused person, already convicted, was a
dangerous sexual offender. That determination involved an inquiry as to whether
he was a person likely to cause injury, pain or other evil to any person
through failure to control his sexual impulses or was likely to commit a
further sexual offence. On that issue Parliament has required that the Court
have the assistance of evidence from at least two psychiatrists. The Wilband
case held that, in giving their evidence, they were entitled to form an
opinion through recognized psychiatric procedures and to consider all possible
sources of information.

In the present case the issue is as to guilt on
the basis of proved facts, which already exist, not a forecast as to future
conduct. In this case there is no statutory requirement to hear psychia-

[Page 270]

tric evidence. It is sought to adduce such
opinion evidence on the very issue which the jury is bound to determine on the
facts proved before it.

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and
restore the conviction and sentence.

The judgment of Ritchie and Spence J.J. was
delivered by

RITCHIE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
brought by the Attorney General of British Columbia under the provisions of
s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia[4] (Davey
C.J. dissenting) whereby that Court set aside the conviction of the respondent
for attempting to commit an act of gross indecency and ordered a new trial
limited to that issue.

The respondent was found by the police in a
hotel bedroom in bed with another man, who was a female impersonator, and there
is, in my view, no doubt that their respective positions in relation to each
other were such as to justify the police in thinking that an act of gross
indecency was taking place or was about to take place.

The respondent’s main defence was that at all
times, until just before the police entered the room, he thought that his
companion was a woman, and it was sought to support his own evidence in this
regard by the evidence of Dr. Newman, a highly qualified psychiatrist, who
was present throughout the trial and who had interviewed the respondent and
others and subjected the respondent to certain psychiatric tests for the
purpose of determining what his normal state was in relation to sex.

Counsel for the Crown took objection to the
introduction of this evidence from Dr. Newman and after lengthy argument
from counsel on both sides, the learned trial judge ruled that questioning by
defence counsel in this regard should be limited to asking the doctor a hypothetical
question based on the assumption of the truth of the evidence adduced at the
trial in order to

[Page 271]

obtain his opinion as to the effect which the
respondent’s lack of sleep, heavy work schedule and consumption of liquor had
had on his state of mind at the time when he was found in such a compromising
position by the police officers in the early hours of the morning.

The learned trial judge, however, excluded the
psychiatric evidence based on interviews and tests which was tendered for the
purpose of showing that, in Dr. Newman’s opinion, Lupien had a certain
type of defence mechanism which made him react violently against any homosexual
activity and that he therefore would not have knowingly engaged in the
homosexual practices which formed the subject of the charge.

The members of the Court of Appeal were
unanimous in expressing the opinion, with which I agree, that the doctor’s
opinion given in answer to the hypothetical question which was put to him was
properly admitted in evidence, but the majority of the Court, in ordering a new
trial, took the view that the learned trial judge had erred in excluding the
doctor’s opinion based on the interviews he had conducted and on the
psychiatric tests and procedures to which he subjected the respondent. It is the
dissenting opinion of the learned Chief Justice in this latter regard which
forms the basis of this appeal.

In excluding the opinion formed by the doctor as
a result of his own investigations and tests, the learned trial judge cited the
decision of this Court in Bleta v. The Queen[5], where it was said, at p. 564:

The question of whether or not an accused
person was in a state of automatism so as not to be legally responsible at the
time when he committed the acts with which he is charged, is a question of fact,
and indeed may be the most vital question of fact in a criminal case, and it is
because the opinion of an expert witness on such a question can serve only to
confuse the issue unless the proven facts upon which it is based have been
clearly indicated to the jury that the practice has grown up of requiring
counsel,

[Page 272]

when seeking such an opinion, to state
those facts in the form of a hypothetical question.

The case of Bleta v. The Queen, supra, was
concerned with the proper way in which to elicit an opinion from an expert
witness based upon evidence which has been adduced in his presence at the
trial. The sentence cited by the learned trial judge from the decision of this
Court is directly followed in the same paragraph by these words:

In cases where the expert has been present
throughout the trial and there is conflict between the witnesses, it is
obviously unsatisfactory to ask him to express an opinion based upon the
evidence which he had heard because the answer to such a question involves the
expert in having to resolve the conflict in accordance with his own view of the
credibility of the witnesses and the jury has no way of knowing upon what
evidence he based his opinion. Where, however, there is no conflict in the
evidence, the same difficulty does not necessarily arise and different
considerations may therefore apply.

The Bleta case came to this Court on
appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which had allowed an
appeal by the Crown and ordered a new trial on the ground, inter alia, that
a doctor called for the defence “was improperly permitted to express an opinion
based on his assessment of the evidence.” There is no such suggestion in the
present case and I do not think that the Bleta case is to be taken as
deciding that a counsel is precluded from eliciting the opinion of a doctor as
to a person’s state of health based on his medical knowledge and on his
questioning of his patient out of the presence of the jury.

It was contended in the present case that
Dr. Newman’s opinion as to the way in which the respondent would normally
react to homosexual advances was inadmissible as offending the rule against the
introduction of hearsay evidence in that it must of necessity have been based
upon what he was told by the respondent and others in the course of the
interviews he conducted and on the results of the tests which he had carried
out.

[Page 273]

The truth of any statements made to the doctor
in the course of his psychiatric enquiry was not at issue in the present case.
What was being sought here was evidence of the opinion which he had formed as
the result of applying his medical knowledge of an analysis of the respondent’s
disposition as manifested by his words, attitudes and reactions when subjected
to questioning, and to other psychiatric procedures designed to reveal his true
character. It is the admissibility or inadmissibility of an opinion so formed
which is at issue here and, in my view, the fact that the methods pursued by
the psychiatrist in reaching his opinion necessitated dependence on information
obtained from the respondent and others which was not before the jury, does not
make his opinion inadmissible although it may well be a factor to be considered
in assessing the weight to be attached to that opinion. If it were otherwise,
the Courts would be denied many medical opinions based on clinical methods of
diagnosis.

In the case of Wilband v. Her Majesty the
Queen[6], the
point was taken that certain evidence given by psychiatrists under the
provisions of s. 661(2) of the Criminal Code was inadmissible as
offending against the hearsay rule, and in the course of his reasons for
judgment, Mr. Justice Fauteux had this to say, at p. 21:

Dealing with hearsay:—The evidence, in this
case, indicates that to form on opinion according to recognized normal
psychiatric procedures, the psychiatrist must consider all possible sources of
information, including second-hand source information, the reliability,
accuracy and significance of which are within the recognized scope of his
professional activities, skill and training to evaluate. Hence, while
ultimately his conclusion may rest, in part, or second-hand source material, it
is nonetheless an opinion formed according to recognized normal psychiatric
procedures. It is not to be assumed that Parliament contemplated that the
opinion which the psychiatrists would form and give to assist the Court would
be formed by methods other than those recognized in normal psychiatric
procedures. The value of a psychiatrist’s opinion may be affected to

[Page 274]

the extent to which it may rest on second-hand
source material; but that goes to the weight and not to the receivability in
evidence of the opinion, which opinion is no evidence of the truth of the
information but evidence of the opinion formed on the basis of that
information.

It is true that in the Wilband case
Mr. Justice Fauteux was considering psychiatric evidence on the issue of
whether an accused person who had already been convicted was “a dangerous
sexual offender”, and that it was the status of the accused rather than his
guilt or innocence which was at issue, but I am satisfied that what was said in
that case in relation to the hearsay rule applies with equal force to the
present circumstances.

In view of the above, I am of the opinion that
the admission of the psychiatric evidence sought to be adduced from
Dr. Newman as to the respondent’s normal state of mind would not have
offended the rule against the admissibility of hearsay, but this is far from
the end of the matter as the dissent of the learned Chief Justice is based on
broader grounds. In the course of his reasons for judgment he said:

I would exclude the evidence on the broad
ground that it was not admissible for the purpose it was tendered. It must be
clearly understood what that purpose was, so I reiterate that it was to show
that Lupien’s normal personality and his defence mechanisms would cause him to
reject homosexual advances or commerce, and so in the opinion of the experts he
would not knowingly have engaged in them. They sought to explain the evidence
on the ground that Lupien must have honestly believed Boisvert to be a woman,
or by impairment of his understanding and judgment.

The opinion that Lupien would not have
knowingly engaged in the acts alleged is in the particular circumstances of
this case too dangerous to be admitted, because without any necessity it comes
too close to the very thing the jury had to find on the whole of the evidence.
But there is a more basic objection. Put in simple English the doctors were
being invited to say that Lupien was a normal man, and as a normal man he would
be instinctively repelled by and recoil from a homosexual act. The jurors were
the proper people to say what a normal

[Page 275]

man would do in those circumstances for that
would depend upon their knowledge of people.

I agree with the Chief Justice that if the
evidence had been tendered for the purpose of showing that Lupien was a normal
man, the conclusion as to how he would have acted under the circumstances would
have been a question for the jury; but, with all respect, as I understand the
record, the evidence was not tendered for this purpose at all but rather for
the purpose of proving the doctor’s opinion that this particular man bad a
certain type of defence mechanism that made him react violently against
homosexual behaviour. The evidence which the learned trial judge excluded was
described by the respondent’s counsel in the following terms:

Now, here the doctor will say—and I am
going to be a little bit inept in doing it—the doctor will say that this man
had a certain type of defensive mechanism that made him react violently to any
homosexual overtone. He will say that is the normal state. And then he will
compare that opinion with what occurred this night and say, “Taking the two
together and having regard to the impact of one upon the other I have the
following opinion to say, namely, he must have believed this person was a
woman”, and (2) in so far his perception was diminished because of the things I
did state in the hypothetical question, that because his perception was
diminished one of two things occur, either he was not consciously aware of the
genital organ he saw in front of him in the sense of being able to understand
the person was a male or (2) as soon as he became aware of it he should have
rejected it and it would be inconceivable for him not to reject it.

As I understand it, the evidence thus sought to
be adduced was directed towards obtaining Dr. Newman’s opinion to the
effect that the respondent was so constituted as to be incapable of formulating
the intention to commit a homosexual act, and it appears to me that the
question of whether or not a man has homosexual tendencies or inclinations is
one which is well adapted to the diagnosis of a psychiatrist and that such an

[Page 276]

opinion formed in this area of human behaviour
is relevant and admissible in a case such as the present one.

This was not a question of adducing character
evidence in the sense of reputation, and I think that the rule laid down in
1865 by Cockburn C.J., in Reg. v. Rowton[7],
to the effect that evidence of character can only be introduced by seeking
evidence of the accused’s general reputation in the neighbourhood to which he
belongs, is singularly inappropriate to the introduction of evidence from
psychiatrists as to the accused’s disposition.

The Rowton case was decided many years
before the development of psychiatry as an accepted branch of medicine and we
were not referred to any case in which the rule there stated was applied so as
to exclude such evidence.

In the course of his reasons for judgment in the
case of Fisher v. The Queen[8], with
which nine members of this Court were “in substantial agreement” (see [1961]
S.C.R. 535 at 538) Aylesworth J.A. said at page 21, speaking of the evidence of
the pyschiatrist called by the Crown in that case:

He was, of course, assuming the facts given
him as an hypothesis to be true, giving his opinion upon one of the vital
issues to be decided by the jury, but that does not per se render his
opinion inadmissible. …Psychiatry is a comparatively modern and special branch
of medical science which deals with the study of the mind, the working of the
mind, the mental state of an individual as demonstrated by his conversation,
attitude and actions. I entertian no doubt that Dr. Easton as a specialist
in psychiatry for many years and with the experience which his position
entails, is qualified to express an opinion upon the mental capacity of an
individual such as appellant to form a certain intent,…

In the Fisher case the accused, who was
charged with murder, had given a statement to the police in which he described
in great detail his activities during the evening up until the time when the
murder was alleged to have taken place. In the course of the cross‑examination
of certain Crown

[Page 277]

witnesses it became apparent that an attempt was
being made to make out a defence of drunkenness and before closing the case for
the prosecution, the Crown called Dr. Baston, the Director of Psychiatry
at the Ontario Hospital in New Toronto, who was asked a hypothetical question
based in large measure on the statement made by the accused to the police in
answer to which he expressed the opinion that anyone able to do what the
appellant was alleged to have done could have the capacity to form the intent
to murder, even after he had consumed 25 glasses of beer or more. It appears to
me that the opinion so sought by the Crown came as close as possible to being
evidence of the very thing that the jury had to find if the defence of
drunkenness was to be negated and the accused convicted. In approving the
admission of the psychiatrist’s evidence, Aylesworth J.A. concluded, at page
21:

The relation of appellant’s actions and
conduct, as posed to the doctor, to appellant’s mental capacity, was surely a
matter upon which the witness could call into play his special knowledge in
that field. The fact that the witness did not examine the appellant, in my
opinion, can have no bearing upon the question of the admissibility of his
evidence; the whole basis of his evidence, as has been said already, was the
effect of appellant’s activities as demonstrating to an expert in the field of
psychiatry, the presence or absence of a specific degree of mental capacity.
While the value of that evidence was for the jury, it was in my view,
admissible evidence.

(The italics are my own.)

What was sought to be introduced in the present
case was evidence from a specialist in the field of psychiatry as to the
absence of a specific degree of behavoural capacity and I think that
Mr. Justice Aylesworth’s language applies and that “while the value of
that evidence was for the jury it was… admissible evidence.”

I am far from saying that as a general rule
psychiatric evidence of a man’s disinclination to commit the kind of crime with
which he is charged should be admitted, but the present case is con-

[Page 278]

cerned with gross indecency between two men and
I think that crimes involving homosexuality stand in a class by themselves in
the sense that the participants frequently have characteristics which make them
more readily identifiable as a class than ordinary criminals. See Reg. v.
Thompson[9]. In any
event, it appears to me that the question of whether or not a man is
homosexually inclined or otherwise sexually perverted is one upon which an
experienced psychiatrist is qualified to express an opinion and that if such
opinion is relevant it should be admitted at a trial such as this even if it
involves the psychiatrist in expressing his conclusion that the accused does
not have the capacity to commit the crime with which he is charged.

For all these reasons, as well as for those
expressed in the reasons for judgment rendered by Mr. Justice Bull on
behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal, I would dismiss this appeal.

HALL J.—The facts relative to this appeal are
set out in the reasons of my brothers Martland and Ritchie.

I agree with my brother Ritchie that the learned
trial judge should have admitted all the evidence which the psychiatrist,
Dr. Newman, was prepared to give.

Homosexuality is not a disease of the mind nor a
mental illness nor a condition arising out of mental incapacity or deficiency.
It is a sexual attraction and interest between members of the same sex. There
are all gradations of the condition from those at the one end of the scale who
have never had a normal sexual impulse to those at the other end who are only
homosexual under exceptional conditions; e.g., when they are totally segregated
from the opposite sex, and in their case their homosexuality generally
disappears as soon as they return to a normal environment. In between, others
have both homosexual and heterosexual impulses and are known as “bisexuals”. In
whatever category the homosexual falls, his condition is an acquired aberration
from the normal state. No one is destined at birth to be a homosexual any more
than any given individual is earmarked to be an alcoholic or a drug addict.

[Page 279]

Heredity plays no part in the development.
Environment is said to be the decisive factor.

The literature on the subject of homosexuality
is very divergent in attributing specific causes or reasons for the condition,
but all writers are agreed that whatever other causes there may be
psychological factors are of great importance and are to be considered in what
might be termed an ascending scale of complexity of explanation. Psychiatry has
concerned itself in a special way with the study of homosexuality, and

…throughout psychiatry one finds that the
structure of the personality is an interplay between environment and
constitutional endowment, so much so that it is almost possible to devise an
equation that constitution X the environment = a constant. (“They Stand Apart”,
Windmill Press, London, 1955, p. 78.)

Accordingly it follows that the evidence of
psychiatrists is particularly relevant in cases involving homosexuality and the
admissibility of opinion evidence from psychiatrists must be determined by its
relevancy to the matter in issue at the trial. In the present case the learned
trial judge admitted all the evidence being tendered from Dr. Newman
except the opinion he was prepared to give to the effect that Lupien’s normal
personality and his defence mechanisms would cause him to reject homosexual
advances and that he would not knowingly have engaged in them. Dr. Newman
was allowed to answer the hypothetical question put to him based on the
assumption of the truth of the evidence adduced at the trial but was not
permitted to give the opinion above set out based on tests made by and for him
and in conversations with Lupien.

It is a question where the line between
admissibility and inadmissibility is to be drawn. If the evidence was relevant
to the defence being put forward on behalf of Lupien, and I think it was, then
it was admissible and the learned trial judge erred in rejecting it.

It is true, as Davey C.J.B.C. points out in his
dissent, that the answer which the psychiatrist was expected to give “comes too
close to the very

[Page 280]

thing the jury had to find on the whole of the evidence”.
I do not think that this is a valid reason for rejecting the evidence. Actually
it cannot be considered an innovation in regard to medical evidence.
Psychiatrists are permitted to testify that from their examination and study,
sometimes long after the event, of an accused, including conversations with him
and from facts proven in evidence, that the accused was incapable of forming
the intent necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged. That
type of evidence is very close, if not identical, to the conclusion the jury
must come to in such a case if it is to find that the accused was not guilty
because he did not have intent necessary to support conviction. The weight to
be given the opinion of the expert is entirely for the jury, and it is the
function of the trial judge to instruct the jury that the responsibility for
weighing the evidence is theirs and theirs alone.

The next question for decision is whether the
error in this instance was fatal to a valid conviction or whether the provisions
of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) which read:

592. (1) On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction, the court of appeal

(b) may dismiss the appeal where…

(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of
the opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a)
the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion
that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred;

should be applied.

The conditions under which this provision should
be invoked are set out in the reasons of Cartwright J. (now C.J.C.) in Colpitts
v. The Queen[10] as
follows:

A number of authorities which should guide
the Court of Appeal in deciding whether, misdirection

[Page 281]

having been shewn, it can safely be
affirmed that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred are
quoted in the reasons of my brother Spence. Upon reading these it will be
observed that, once error in law has been found to have occurred at the trial,
the onus resting upon the Crown is to satisfy the Court that the verdict would
necessarily have been the same if such error had not occurred. The satisfaction
of this onus is a condition precedent to the right of the Appellate Court to
apply the terms of the subsection at all. The Court is not bound to apply
the subsection merely because this onus is discharged.

The section recognizes that there are cases
in which, notwithstanding error on the part of the learned trial judge, the
appeal court may in its discretion, where the weight of the evidence impels it
to do so, conclude that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has
occurred. This is such a case. The evidence against the accused was
overwhelming, and in my view the verdict would necessarily have been the same
even if the jury had heard the opinion which Dr. Newman was prepared to
give.

I think that this is a proper case for the
application of the provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii). I would,
accordingly, allow the appeal and restore the conviction and sentence.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Trial—Capital murder—Admissions
of fact at trial—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 562.

The appellant was convicted of the capital
murder of his wife. It was conclusively proved that her death was caused by
arsenical poisoning and that she had ingested quantities of arsenic throughout
a period of several months prior to her death. This was not contested by the
defence. The first day of the trial, after the evidence of one Crown witness
had been heard, counsel for the appellant tendered a formal written admission
of facts and asked that

[Page 311]

this be received pursuant to s. 562 of
the Criminal Code. The Crown objected to the inclusion of one of these
facts. The trial judge did not permit the admission of the fact in question.
The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge should have permitted the
admission but that the error had caused no prejudice to the appellant and that
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred. The appellant
appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The trial judge was not in error. In a
criminal case, an accused cannot admit a fact alleged against him until the
allegation has been made. When recourse is proposed to be added to s. 562,
it is for the Crown, not for the defence, to state the fact or facts which it
alleges against the accused and of which it seeks admission. The accused, of
course, is under no obligation to admit the fact so alleged but his choice is
to admit or to decline to do so. He cannot frame the wording of the allegation
to suit his own purposes and then insist on admitting it. The idea of the
admission of an allegation involves action by two persons, one who makes the
allegation and another who admits it.

The reasons of Bull J.A. of the Court of
Appeal on all the other grounds of appeal urged in the Court of Appeal and
before this Court, should be adopted.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[1],
affirming the appellant’s conviction for capital murder. Appeal dismissed.

C.R. MacLean, for the appellant.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This is an appeal from the
unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1, pronounced on
July 19, 1968, dismissing the appellant’s appeal from his

[Page 312]

conviction before Dryer J. and a jury on October
6, 1967, of the capital murder of his wife.

Esther Castellani, the wife of the appellant,
died on July 11, 1965. It was conclusively proved by medical and scientific
testimony that her death was caused by arsenical poisoning and that she had
ingested quantities of arsenic throughout a period of several months prior to her
death. That this was the fact was not contested by the defence. The question
for the jury was whether they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the
poison had been administered to her by the appellant. The learned trial Judge
rightly instructed the jury that only two verdicts were open to them, “Not
Guilty” or “Guilty of Capital Murder”.

The grounds of appeal relied upon by the
appellant in the Court of Appeal are accurately summarized as follows in the
reasons of Norris J.A. and of Bull J.A.:

1. The learned trial Judge erred in
refusing to allow the appellant or his counsel to admit at the trial certain
facts under Section 562 of the Criminal Code.

2. The learned trial Judge erred in law in
not ordering certain portions of the address to the jury by the appellant’s
counsel to be read to the jury when the jury so requested.

3. The learned trial Judge misdirected the
jury by:

(a) failing to adequately
deal with the evidence given by Mrs. Sheila Luond, and

(b) after having the evidence
of Mrs. Sheila Luond read to the jury as it requested, made references to
certain facts which were not in evidence, thereby suggesting that a prejudicial
inference could be drawn therefrom, and not correcting that error until the
next day just before the verdict was delivered, and

(c) creating a prejudicial effect by
the combination of (a) and (b) above.

4. In view of the circumstantial nature of
the evidence, the jury could not have given proper weight to the direction of
the learned trial Judge as to the

[Page 313]

rule in Hodge’s case (1838) 2 Lewin
227, 168 E.R. 1136, or the doctrine of reasonable doubt, and so its verdict was
perverse or unreasonable.

As to the first of these grounds, it appears
that on September 25, 1967, the first day of the trial, after the evidence of
one Crown witness had been heard, counsel for the appellant tendered a formal
written admission, of facts “for the purpose of freeing the Crown of the
responsibility for proving same” and asked that this be received pursuant to
s. 562 of the Criminal Code which reads as follows:

562. Where an accused is on trial for an
indictable offence he or his counsel may admit any fact alleged against him for
the purpose of dispensing with proof thereof.

The document tendered consisted of eight
paragraphs; following the style of cause it read as follows:

Pursuant to the provisions of
section 562 of the Criminal Code of Canada, Counsel for Rene Emile
Castellani hereby admit the following facts:—

1. That at the Vancouver General Hospital,
in the City of Vancouver in the County of Vancouver, in the Province of British
Columbia, on July 12th, 1965, an autopsy was performed by Dr. Frank H.
Anderson on the body of Esther Castellani, deceased.

2. That on July 14th, 1965, at Forest Lawn
Memorial Park in the Municipality of Burnaby, in the Province of British
Columbia, the body of Ester Castellani, deceased, was buried in a casket placed
in a closed cement crypt.

3. That on August 3rd, 1965, the body of
Esther Castellani, deceased, was exhumed from the cement crypt of Forest Lawn
Memorial Park in the Municipality of Burnaby, and delivered to the morgue in
the City of Vancouver where a post‑mortem examination was conducted by
Dr. Thomas Redo Harmon.

4. That control specimens of embalming
fluid from the same source as were used by the undertakers who embalmed the
body of Esther Castel-

[Page 314]

lani, deceased and who buried her, namely
Simmons & McBride Ltd. of the City of Vancouver, were delivered to Eldon
Rideout at the City of Vancouver on August 3rd, 1965.

5. That on July 28th, 1965, at the Broadway
and Cambie Branch of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in the City of
Vancouver, Rene Emile Castellani signed a certain application for a loan form
from Kinross Mortgage Corporation, in the presence of Mr. R.S. Keyes.

6. That no action or proceeding for
dissolution of the marriage between Rene Emile Castellani and Esther
Castellani, which marriage was solemnized on July 16th, 1946, was ever
commenced in any Court having jurisdiction to hear such an action.

7. That scientific tests known as X-ray
diffraction procedures were done by Mrs. Thomson at the Ontario
Attorney-General’s Crime Detection Laboratory, in an effort to determine from
the hair samples removed from the body of Esther Castellani what salt or
compound the arsenic had originated from, but the results were inconclusive
because there was not a sufficient quantity of hair.

8. That Rene Emile Castellani and Adelaide
Miller mutually engaged in an extra‑marital sexual relationship from
approximately the Fall of A.D., 1964 to the Spring of A.D., 1966.

It was dated September 25, 1967, and signed by
both of the counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial.

Counsel for the Crown objected and the question
was adjourned to the following day for argument. During the adjournment counsel
for both parties agreed that the first seven paragraphs should be admitted but
Crown counsel objected to the inclusion of para. 8 while counsel for the
appellant insisted that under s. 562 he had the right to make that admission
and intended to do so.

Following argument in the absence of the jury
the learned trial Judge, after expressing regret that counsel for the Crown had
not seen fit to

[Page 315]

accept the admissions as tendered, ruled that
while the Crown’s case was being put in the defence did not have the right to
make an admission unless the Crown were willing to accept it. Later the
admission consisting of the seven paragraphs was signed and filed with the
consent of both parties but counsel for the appellant maintained that they had
the right to insist on also making the admission contained in para. 8.

The Court of Appeal were of the view that the
learned trial Judge should have permitted the admission set out in para. 8
to be made, interpreting the words of s. 562 as giving the accused an
unqualified right to make an admission of any fact alleged against him. They
held therefore that the learned trial Judge had erred in law but went on to
hold that the error had caused no prejudice to the appellant and that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred. If I were in
agreement with the Court of Appeal that the learned trial Judge had erred in
law in the manner stated I would also have agreed with their conclusion that
this occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice; but, with
respect, I do not agree that the learned trial Judge was in error in the ruling
which he made.

In a criminal case, there being no pleadings,
there are no precisely worded allegations of fact which are susceptible of
categorical admission. An accused cannot admit a fact alleged against him until
the allegation has been made. When recourse is proposed to be had to
s. 562 it is for the Crown, not for the defence, to state the fact or
facts which it alleges against the accused and of which it seeks admission. The
accused, of course, is under no obligation to admit the fact so alleged but his
choice is to admit it or to decline to do so. He cannot frame the wording of
the allegation to suit his own purposes and then insist on admitting it. To
permit such a course could only lead to confusion. The idea of the admission

[Page 316]

of an allegation involves action by two persons,
one who makes the allegation and another who admits it.

I have formed the above opinion as to the
meaning and effect of s. 562, simply from a consideration of its words and
of what is necessarily involved in the notion of an admission of an allegation
of fact in a criminal case. If it were necessary to have recourse to rules of
construction my view would be strengthened by the application of the rules set
out by Lord Coke in Heydon’s Case[2].
It seems reasonably clear that before the enactment of s. 690 in the Criminal
Code, 1892, the predecessor of s. 562, an accused on his trial for
felony could not be allowed to make an admission in court although he desired
to do so and counsel for the Crown was willing to accept it. This is indicated
in the following passage in the report of the Commissioners who prepared the
English draft code in 1879, which is quoted in Taschereau’s Criminal Code (1893),
3rd ed. at p. 800:

At present if the accused is proved before
his trial to have made an admission it is evidence against him, but though he
offers to make the same admission in court it is thought that in cases of
felony the judge is obliged to refuse to let him do so.

The same view as to the common law rule was
expressed by Osler J.A. giving the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Regina
v. St. Clair[3] as
follows:

… Under the former convenient
classification of crimes as felonies and misdemeanours, the abolition of which,
I think for my own part, is much to be regretted, such a charge was a
misdemeanour simply and the competency of the accused or her counsel to make
admissions at the trial for the purposes of the trial was undoubted.

In Rex v. Foster (1836), 7 C.
& P. 495, on an indictment for felony for having in his possession a

[Page 317]

mould for the purpose of coining, the prisoner
was acquitted; a second indictment for a related felony was then presented, the
evidence on which was to be the same as in the former case. Counsel for the
prosecution said that with the assent of the prisoner’s counsel he proposed not
to call the witnesses again. Patteson, J., said he doubted if that could be
done, even by consent, in a case of felony, though he knew it might be in a
case of misdemeanour. The witnesses were, therefore, recalled and resworn, and
the evidence they had given read over to them from the Judge’s notes.

In my opinion the purpose of enacting
s. 562 and its predecessors was to alter the common law rule by
eliminating the necessity, on the trial of an indictable offence, of proof by
the Crown of any fact which it desires to prove and which the accused is
prepared to admit at his trial.

On all the other grounds of appeal urged in the
Court of Appeal and before us I find myself so fully in agreement with the
reasons of Bull J.A. that I am content simply to adopt them. Nothing would be
gained by repeating or summarizing what he has said. Each of the learned
Justices of Appeal performed the duty placed upon the Court of Appeal by
s. 583A(3) of the Criminal Code and could find no grounds in the
record other than those alleged in the notice of appeal upon which the
conviction ought to be set aside.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Lottery—Montreal voluntary
tax—Prizes determined by lot and answers to questions printed on official
receipt—Prizes in silver ingots—Violation of Criminal Code—Court of Queen’s
Bench Reference Act, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 10, ss. 1, 5—Criminal Code, 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, s. 179(1)(d), (e)—Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259,
s. 37.

To a question referred to it by the
Lieutenant-Governor in council, the Court of Appeal answered that the carrying
out of a scheme adopted by the City of Montreal to obtain additional revenue would contravene the provisions of
s. 179 of the Criminal Code. The scheme which was well publicized
in the newspapers, consists in inviting the general public to become voluntary
taxpayers of the City by making monthly contributions of a fixed amount of $2,
or multiples thereof, and in inducing the public to participate by saying that
every month there will be drawn, from the names of all those who will have
contributed during that month, the names of 151 persons who will then be
called, at a later date, to be questioned, in an order determined by lot, on
their knowledge of the City of Montreal and win, if they answer correctly,
prizes ranging from $100 to $100,000 depending on the order in which they are
questioned, the 151st person being the only one in a position to win $100,000.
The advertisements published in the newspapers stated that the prizes will be
given after the candidates have answered correctly and in public some of the
questions which correspond to the answers printed on the reverse side of the
official receipt. By resolution of the Executive Committee prizes were to be in
the form of silver ingots. The City appealed to this Court.

[Page 333]

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The majority judgment in the Court of Appeal
rightly decided that the advertisements published in the newspapers clearly
showed that the intention of the City, as regards the examination, was to make
it as easy and as painless as possible, and that in fact, what the City had
told the public, by necessary implication if not expressly, was that the
statements printed on the reverse of the official receipt were the answers to
the questions that will be asked; that the ability to memorize these simple
statements and to repeat them in public could at best be considered as a
minimal degree of skill incapable of keeping the scheme within the law, as
attempted by the introduction of this type of examination as the final step of
an operation based essentially on chance; and that the form of the prizes was
another device to shield the scheme against the application of the law.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen’s
Bench, Appeal Side, province of
Quebec[1], on a
reference concerning the carrying out of a scheme by the City of Montreal to obtain additional revenue.
Appeal dismissed.

Michel Côté, Antonio Lamer and Jacques
Fortin, for the appellant.

Fred Kaufman, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

FAUTEUX J.—This appeal, submitted to this Court
on November 26, 1969, was inscribed under the provisions of s. 37 of the Supreme
Court Act and those of the Act Respecting a Reference to the Court of
Queen’s Bench, Statutes of Quebec, 17 Eliz. II, c. 83, assented to on May 9, 1968.

The City of Montreal appeals from a majority
opinion of the Court of Queen’s Bench (Appeal side) on a Reference ordered by
Order-in-council No. 1354, adopted on May 8, 1968, by the Lieutenant-Governor
of the Province of Quebec, to have the Court determine if the carrying out of a
scheme adopted by the City of Montreal to obtain additional revenue would
contravene any provision of the Criminal Code.

[Page 334]

Described in the Order-in-council and the
Appendices thereto, the scheme, which was well publicized in the newspapers,
consists, in brief, in inviting the general public, through the appropriate
media, to become voluntary taxpayers of the City by making monthly contributions
of a fixed amount of $2 (or multiples thereof) and in inducing the public to
participate by saying that every month there will be drawn, from the names of
all those who will have contributed during that month, the names of 151 persons
who will then be called, at a later date, to be questioned, in an order
determined by lot, on their knowledge of the City of Montreal and win, if they
answer correctly, prizes ranging from $100 to $100,000 depending on the order
in which they are questioned, the 151st person being the only one in a position
to win $100,000. The description of the examination is found, in different
terms, in the text of the resolution passed by the City council when the
principle of the scheme was approved, in the text of the resolution passed by
the Executive Committee to determine the mechanics thereof, and in the
advertisements published by the City of Montreal in various newspapers. This description, which is vague in the text
of the resolutions, becomes more precise in the advertisements meant for the
general public, in which we find the following:

[TRANSLATION] …prizes will be given after
they (the candidates) have answered correctly and in public some of the
questions which correspond to the answers printed on the reverse side of the
official receipt.

We find, printed on the reverse of that receipt
which is given to the taxpayer upon payment of the so-called voluntary tax,
twenty answers of which the following four are typical:

1. Montréal was founded in 1642.

3. Montréal is the Metropolis of Canada.

5. The great river linking Montréal to the
Atlantic Ocean is the St. Lawrence River.

9. The mountain located within the limits
of the City of Montréal is
Mount Royal.

In the advertisement, published in the newspaper
La Presse, we find the following:

[TRANSLATION] If a child is too young to
answer the questions, his father, mother or other person having paid on his
behalf may answer in his stead.

[Page 335]

Although the resolution of the Executive
Committee provides that:

[TRANSLATION] All the prizes will be
physically in the form of silver ingots, worth at least the amount advertised,

the description of the prizes is as follows in
the same advertisement:

[TRANSLATION]


 
  
  1ST PRIZE.................................... 
  
  
  $100,000 IN
  SILVER
  
 
 
  
  AND:
  
 
 
  
  30 Prizes of................................... 
  
  
  $1,000 each, in
  Silver
  
 
 
  
  20 Prizes of................................... 
  
  
  $ 500 each, in
  Silver
  
 
 
  
  100 Prizes of................................. 
  
  
  $ 100 each, in
  Silver
  
 


After having heard counsel for the Attorney
General of the Province and for the City of Montreal, the Court of Appeal
(Tremblay C.J., Casey, Rinfret, Taschereau and Owen JJ.) reserved judgment and
on a later date, answered the question as follows: of the five members of the
Court, three (Casey, Taschereau and Owen JJ.) answered affirmatively on the
ground that the execution of the scheme would contravene, in the opinion of the
first two, the provisions of s. 179(1)(d) and (1)(e) of the Criminal
Code, and in the opinion of the third, the provisions of s. 179(1)(d).
The Chief Justice and Rinfret J., dissenting, answered in the negative.
However, the Chief Justice indicated that, [TRANSLATION] “if they (the persons
called for the examination) were being asked only the questions for which the
answers are provided on the reverse of the receipt given by the City” he would
have answered in the affirmative.

In his reasons, which are concurred in by
Taschereau J., Casey J. states, in brief, that the advertisements published in
the newspapers clearly show that the intention of the City, as regards the
examination which a certain number of taxpayers of this so-called voluntary tax
must undergo, is to make it as easy and as painless as possible, and that in
fact, what the City has told the public, by necessary implication if not
expressly, is that the statements printed on the reverse of the official
receipt are the answers to the questions that will be asked. In the learned
Judge’s opinion the ability to memorize these simple

[Page 336]

statements and to repeat them in public can at
best be considered as a minimal degree of skill incapable, in the light of
jurisprudential criteria, of keeping the scheme within the law, as attempted by
the introduction of this type of examination as the final step of an operation
based essentially on chance.

Casey J. adds that he is satisfied that the
prizes offered to the public in the newspaper advertisements are cash prizes
and that the above-mentioned provision of the Executive Committee’s resolution,
dealing with the form of the prizes, is another device to shield the scheme
against the application of the law.

With all due respect for the contrary opinion, I
must say that we are all in agreement with the reasons and findings stated in
the opinion of Casey J., which reasons and findings we adopt in their entirety
and to which we feel nothing can usefully be added.

With these views, it is unnecessary to pursue
any further consideration of the question submitted in the Reference. It
follows that the appeal must be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Obtaining money by false
pretences and with intent to defraud—Evidence
of obtaining lesser sum than that mentioned in charge—Conviction of obtaining amount
mentioned in charge—Whether conviction for
obtaining smaller amount should be confirmed—Whether conviction should be amended—Criminal Code, 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, ss. 304(1)(a), 592(8), 600(1).

The appellant was convicted
on a charge of obtaining a sum of $285 by false pretences and with intent to
defraud, contrary to s. 304(1) (a) of the Criminal Code. There
was evidence on which the magistrate could find that the appellant had obtained
by false pretences a sum of $56. The conviction was affirmed by the Court of
Appeal. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be
dismissed and a conviction entered for the lesser amount.

It was not possible to
affirm the conviction as to the obtaining by false pretences of the entire sum
of $285, but the conviction for obtaining the smaller amount should be
affirmed. R. v. Scott, 34 C.C.C. 180 and R. v. Castle, 68 C.C.C.
78. It was proper to amend the conviction as it appears that upon the evidence
the appellant should only have been convicted of obtaining the amount of $56.
This Court has the jurisdiction to make the appropriate amendment by virtue of
s. 600(1) of the Code.

déclaration de culpabilité—Code criminel, 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, art. 304(1)(a), 592(3), 600(1).

L’appelant a été déclaré coupable d’avoir obtenu une somme de
$285 par faux‑semblants et avec l’intention de frauder, contrairement à
l’art. 304(1) (a) du Code
criminel. Il y avait une preuve sur laquelle le magistrat pouvait se baser
pour conclure que l’appelant avait obtenu une
somme de $56 par faux-semblants. La déclaration de culpabilité a été confirmée
par la Cour d’appel. L’appelant a obtenu la
permission d’en appeler à cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel doit être rejeté et une
déclaration de culpabilité doit être enregistrée pour le montant moindre.








Il n’est pas possible de
confirmer la déclaration de culpabilité quant à l’obtention par faux-semblants du plein
montant de $285, mais la déclaration de culpabilité d’avoir obtenu le montant moindre doit
être confirmée. R. v. Scott, 34 C.C.C. 180 et R. v. Castle, 68
C.C.C. 78. Il s’agit ici d’un cas où la déclaration de
culpabilité doit être amendée puisqu’il
appert de la preuve que l’appelant n’aurait dû être déclaré
coupable que d’avoir obtenu la somme de
$56. Cette Cour a juridiction, en vertu de l’art. 600(1) du Code, pour faire l’amendement qu’il convient.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’appel de l’Ontario, confirmant une
déclaration de culpabilité. Appel
rejeté.

APPEAL from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the appellant’s conviction. Appeal
dismissed.

Reginald Lake, in person.

E.G. Achborn, for the
respondent.



The
judgment of the Court was delivered by



SPENCE
J.:—This is an appeal by leave
of this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced
November 23, 1967. By that judgment the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal
from the conviction registered by the Magistrate at Ottawa on October 14, 1966,
upon the charge that:



Reginald
Lake between the 6th day of June A.D. 1966 and the twenty-eighth day of July
A.D. 1966, at the City of Ottawa, in said

[Page 51]



County
of Carleton, did unlawfully obtain a sum of or about $285.00 from Wilfred
Bauer, by false pretences and with intent to defraud, contrary to
section 304(1) (a) of the Criminal Code.



The
leave to appeal granted by this Court was upon the following questions of law:



1.
Was there any evidence on which it was open to the learned Magistrate to hold
that there was a false pretence made by the appellant which induced Wilfred Bauer
to pay money to him?



2.
Was there any evidence on which it was open to the learned Magistrate to hold
that the appellant had the intent to defraud Wilfred Bauer?



3.
Was there any evidence on which it was open to the learned Magistrate to hold
that Wilfred Bauer was defrauded of anything?










It is
not necessary for these purposes to recite the evidence in any detail, and it
is sufficient to say that there was evidence on which the Magistrate could find
reasonably that the appellant did obtain from the said Wilfred Bauer by false
pretences the sum of about $56, the said false pretences being that the
appellant falsely represented himself to be a bailiff of the Division Court at
Ottawa acting on a process of that Court and in particular that he falsely
represented that he was empowered to and did take a bond from the said Wilfred
Bauer and demanded and obtained certain amounts of money for the “registration” of the said bond as fees
therefor.



It is
true that the Magistrate said in giving judgment after a recess:



Continuing
my remarks regarding judgment in this case, and considering the evidence I
would have to find that the whole of the monies obtained by Mr. Lake in
this case—some $285.00—that all of that money was
obtained by false pretences, and I say this because of the use of the word “bailiff” by the accused when he
wasn’t a bailiff and knew it.



Although
this Court is not ready to affirm the conviction as to the obtaining by false
pretences of the whole $285, it is apparent that the Magistrate had earlier in
his reasons addressed his mind to the obtaining by false pretences of the smaller
sum only when he said:



I
find him guilty of obtaining funds by false pretences, and in particular,
monies pertaining to the bond, six dollars whatever it was on this occasion,
and the monies listed on those receipts for costs.



and
that therefore the conviction for obtaining the smaller amount by false
pretences should be confirmed. That such a course is a proper one is, I think,
demonstrated by the

[Page 52]



judgments
in R. v. Scott[1], Ontario Court of Appeal,
as confirmed in this Court[2] in the same volume at p.
187, where at p. 186 Magee J. said:



The
amount charged as being stolen $7,835, no doubt corresponds with the total of
the three credits; but if, instead of five cheques amounting to $755, the
accused had cashed one, two, or three cheques for $7,000 in all, three days
after the fraudulent entries, could it be said that, although his act amounted
to theft, proof could not be given of it? What the Crown set out to prove, as I
venture to think, is that Scott’s employers had been
defrauded out of $7,835, or some greater or less sum, by some act which
amounted to theft. The evidence might fail to shew theft at all. It would be
sufficient if part were stolen. The Criminal Code, sec. 857, allows
proof of three distinct charges of theft.



(The
underlining is my own.)



and the
decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Castle[3], where at p. 80, Rowell
C.J.O. said:










In
reference to the first ground of appeal, it is quite clear that a person
accused of theft can be convicted upon an indictment charging theft upon proof
of theft of a smaller sum than that charged in the indictment: Rex v. Scott
(1920), 57 D.L.R. 309, 34 Can. C.C. 180, 48 O.L.R. 452, affirmed in the
Supreme Court, 58 D.L.R. 242, 34 Can. C.C. 187.



The
question arises whether this Court in dismissing the appeal and confirming the
conviction should amend the latter. I am of the opinion that it is proper to do
so. It would appear that upon the evidence the appellant should only have been
convicted of obtaining by false pretences the amount of $56. The charge as laid
contained a reference to a figure of about $285. This Court has the jurisdiction
to make the appropriate amendment by virtue of s. 600(1) of the Criminal
Code which provides:



600.
(1) The Supreme Court of Canada may, on an appeal under this part, make any
order that the court of appeal might have made and may make any rule or order
that is necessary to give effect to its judgment.



The
Court of Appeal for Ontario has power to amend the conviction to set out the
smaller amount by virtue of s. 592(3) of the Criminal Code which
provides:



592.
(3) Where a court of appeal dismisses an appeal under subparagraph (i) of
paragraph (b) of subsection (1), it may substitute the

[Page 53]



verdict
that in its opinion should have been found and affirm the sentence passed by
the trial court or impose a sentence that is warranted by law.



The
paragraph referred to therein, i.e., 592(1)(b)(i), provides:



592.
(1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction, the court of appeal



...



(b)
may dismiss the appeal where



(i)
the court is of the opinion that the appellant, although he was not properly
convicted on a count or part of the indictment, was properly convicted
on another count or part of the indictment,



(The
underlining is my own.)



1. In R.
v. Norcross[4], (B.C.C.A.), the Court
amended a conviction of theft by reducing the amount mentioned in the charge.










I would
therefore dismiss the appeal. Acting under the provisions of the Criminal
Code, I would substitute a conviction that the appellant between the 6th
day of June 1966 and the 28th day of July 1966, at the City of Ottawa, in the
County of Carleton, did unlawfully obtain the sum of $56 from Wilfred Bauer by
false pretences and with intent to defraud, contrary to s. 304(1) (a) of
the Criminal Code.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Appeal to Court of Appeal—Question of law alone—Minimum resale, price
specified by manufacturer—Whether acquittal of
attempt resale price maintenance subject to appeal—Presumptions—Whether sufficiency of evidence
question of fact or law—Combines Investigation Act,
R.S.C. 1952, c. 814, ss. 34(2), 41(2)—Criminal
Code, 1953-54. (Can.), c. 51, s. 584(1)(a).

The appellant corporation,
a manufacturer of electrical appliances, was indicted on four counts of
attempting to induce retail dealers to resell its products at prices not less
than the minimum prices specified by it, contrary to s. 34(2) (b) of the
Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 314. The evidence tendered
consisted in large measure of documents such as letters addressed to all
dealers in certain commodities, price lists distributed to dealers and
interdepartmental correspondence. The appellant was convicted on two counts and
an order of prohibition was granted. The trial judge acquitted on the other two
counts on the ground that there was insufficient evidence of inducement. An
appeal by the Crown from the acquittal was allowed by a majority judgment of
the Court of Appeal which also varied the order of prohibition. The corporation
appealed to this Court.

Held (Judson, Spence and Pigeon
JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed in part and the verdict of
acquittal restored.

Per Cartwright C.J. and
Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The finding by the trial judge that the case
presented by the Crown did not

[Page 222]








establish the appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt does not involve “a question of law alone” so as to entitle the
Attorney General to appeal to the Court of Appeal under the provisions of s.
584(1) (a) of the Criminal Code. Section 41(2) (c) of
the Combines Investigation Act provides that documents, such as the
letters in this case, which were in the possession of the accused “shall be admitted in
evidence without further proof thereof and shall be prima facie evidence” that the accused had
knowledge of the documents and their contents and that anything recorded in
them as having been done, said or agreed upon by the accused or its agent, was
done, said or agreed upon. The trial judge is in no way precluded by that
section from considering the weight to be attached to that evidence in
considering the issue of the accused’s
guilt or innocence. Accepting the view of the Court of Appeal that the evidence
here was sufficient to support a conviction, the further question of whether
the guilt of the accused should be inferred from that evidence, was one of fact
within the province of the judge. It is well settled that the sufficiency of
evidence is a question of fact and not a question of law. However wrong the
Court of Appeal or this Court may think that the trial judge was in reaching
the conclusion that the evidence was not sufficient to satisfy him beyond a
reasonable doubt, this error cannot be determined without passing judgment on
the reasonableness of the verdict or the sufficiency of the evidence, and these
are not matters over which the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction under s.
584(1)(a) of the Code.

Per Judson, Spence and Pigeon
JJ., dissenting: The evidence contained in the documents produced at the
trial amounted to an admission of an attempt to induce dealers to sell at not
less than a specified minimum price. There was no evidence which could give
rise to a reasonable doubt that the accused had committed the offence so as to
rebut the presumption created by s. 41 of the Combines Investigation Act. Reasonable
doubt must be based upon evidence adduced at the trial. There was therefore no
course but to convict the accused.

The Court of Appeal had
jurisdiction to consider the appeal from the acquittal by the trial judge. It
was an error in law for the trial judge to charge himself, as it would appear
that he did, that the Crown in order to support the charges had to prove an
inducing by agreement, threat or promise. The Crown had only to prove the
intent to induce and an overt act toward the accomplishment of that intent.
These were proven on prima facie evidence which by lack of contradiction became
conclusive evidence. When there is, as in the present case, a statutory
presumption to be applied, once the facts necessary to give rise to it are
found by the trial judge to be established beyond reasonable doubt, the
question whether the inference of guilt should be made is no longer anything
but a question of law alone.

La compagnie appelante, qui
fabrique des appareils électriques, a été poursuivie par acte d’accusation sous quatre
chefs d’avoir tenté d’engager des marchands au
détail à revendre ses produits à un prix non inférieur à un prix minimum
spécifié par elle, le tout contrairement à l’art. 34(2) (b) de la Loi
relative aux enquêtes sur les coalitions, S.R.C. 1952, c. 314. La preuve
offerte consistait en grande partie en documents tels que des lettres adressées
à tous les marchands de certains produits, en listes de prix distribuées aux
marchands et en correspondance interdépartementale. L’appelante a été déclarée coupable sous
deux chefs et un ordre de prohibition a été émis. Le juge au procès a rendu un
verdict d’acquittement sur les deux
autres chefs pour le motif que la preuve d’incitation était insuffisante. Un
appel de la Couronne du jugement d’acquittement
a été accueilli par un jugement majoritaire de la Cour d’appel qui a aussi modifié l’ordre de prohibition. La
compagnie en a appelé à cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel doit être accueilli en partie et
le verdict d’acquittement rétabli, les
Juges Judson, Spence et Pigeon étant dissidents.








Le Juge en Chef Cartwright et
les Juges Fauteux, Martland et Ritchie: La conclusion du juge au procès que la
preuve de la Couronne n’établissait pas hors d’un doute raisonnable la
culpabilité de l’appelante ne comporte pas
une «question de droit seulement» permettant au procureur
général d’en appeler à la Cour d’appel en vertu des
dispositions de l’art. 584(1) (a) du Code
Criminel. L’article 41 (2) (c)
de la Loi relative aux enquêtes sur les coalitions stipule que les
documents qui, tels que les lettres dans cette cause, étaient en la possession
du prévenu «font foi sans autre preuve
et attestent prima facie» que le prévenu connaissait
les documents et leur contenu et que toute chose inscrite dans ces documents
comme ayant été accomplie, dite ou convenue par le prévenu ou son agent, l’a été ainsi que le document
le mentionne. Cet article n’empêche pas le juge au
procès de considérer le poids qu’il
doit attaché à cette preuve lorsqu’il
considère la question de la culpabilité du prévenu. Si on accepte le point de
vue de la Cour d’appel que la preuve était
suffisante pour permettre de conclure à la culpabilité, la question
supplémentaire de savoir si on doit tirer de cette preuve une conclusion de
culpabilité, est une question de fait de la compétence du juge. D’après une jurisprudence
bien établie, la suffisance de la preuve est une question de fait et non pas
une question de droit. Même si la Cour d’appel ou cette Cour sont d’avis que le juge au procès
a erré en concluant que la preuve n’était
pas suffisante pour le convaincre hors d’un doute raisonnable, cette erreur ne
peut pas être constatée sans passer un jugement sur le caractère raisonnable du
verdict ou la suffisance de la preuve, et ce ne sont pas là des questions sur
lesquelles la Cour d’appel a juridiction en
vertu de Fart. 584(1) (a) du Code.

Les Juges Judson, Spence et
Pigeon, dissidents: La preuve qui se trouve dans les documents produits au
procès équivaut à l’aveu d’une tentative d’engager les marchands à
vendre à pas moins qu’à un prix minimum spécifié.
Il n’y a aucune preuve pouvant
faire naître un doute raisonnable que le prévenu a commis l’infraction de manière à ce
que la présomption créée par l’art. 41 de la Loi
relative aux enquêtes sur les coalitions puisse être réfutée. Le doute
raisonnable doit être basé sur la preuve produite au procès. Dans le cas
présent, il n’y avait pas d’autre alternative qu’une déclaration de
culpabilité.

La Cour d’appel avait juridiction
pour déterminer l’appel du verdict d’acquittement. Le juge au
procès a erré en droit en se donnant les

[Page 224]

directives, ainsi qu’il semble l’avoir fait, que la Couronne
devait, en vue de supporter les chefs d’accusation, prouver une incitation par
entente, menace ou promesse. La Couronne n’avait qu’à prouver l’intention d’engager les marchands et un acte
manifeste en vue de l’accomplissement de cette
intention. Ces choses ont été prouvées par une preuve prima facie qui, vu l’absence de contradiction,
est devenue une preuve concluante. Lorsqu’il s’agit, comme dans le cas présent, de l’application d’une présomption statutaire,
et que le juge a conclu que les faits nécessaires pour la faire naître sont
établis hors d’un doute raisonnable, la
question de savoir si on doit en tirer une conclusion de culpabilité est une
question de droit seulement.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’Appel de l’Ontario[1] accueillant un appel de la

APPEAL from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 allowing an appeal by the Crown
from an acquittal. Appeal allowed in part, Judson, Spence and Pigeon JJ.
dissenting.








George D. Finlayson, Q.C.
and Burton Tait, for the appellant.

B.J. MacKinnon, Q.C. and
R.B. Tuer, for the respondent.



The
judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was
delivered by



RITCHIE
J.:—This is an appeal from a
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] (Laskin J.A. dissenting)
whereby that Court allowed an appeal by the Crown from the acquittal of the
appellant on the 3rd and 4th counts of an indictment charging attempted resale
price maintenance contrary to s. 34(2) (b) of the Combines
Investigation Act, which reads as follows:



34.
(2) No dealer shall directly or indirectly by agreement, threat, promise or any
other means whatsoever, require or induce or attempt to require or induce any
other person to resell an article or commodity



(b)
at a price not less than a minimum price specified by the dealer or established
by agreement.

[Page 225]



The
indictment contains four counts, each specifying offences contrary to s. 34(2)
(b) and the evidence tendered consisted in large measure of documents
such as letters addressed to “all dealers” in certain commodities,
price lists distributed by the appellant to various dealers, and
interdepartmental correspondence between some of the appellant company’s salesmen and the company’s head office.



The
circumstances giving rise to these charges were that the appellant had devised
and was seeking to implement a plan which it described as its “minimum profitable resale
price plan” or “M.R.P.” plan. This plan purported
to be conceived in conformity with the provisions of s. 34(5) of the Act
which are generally accepted as having been enacted in order to enable dealers
to control the practice employed by some retailers of selling a product or
products at a loss in order to induce customers to patronize their sales outlet
for other products. Section 34(5) reads as follows:



(5)
Where, in a prosecution under this section, it is proved that the person
charged refused or counselled the refusal to sell or supply an article to any
other person, no inference unfavourable to the person charged shall be drawn
from such evidence if he satisfies the court that he and any one upon whose
report he depended had reasonable cause to believe and did believe










(a)
that the other person was making a practice of using articles supplied by the
person charged as loss-leaders, that is to say, not for the purpose of making a
profit thereon but for purposes of advertising;



(b)
that the other person was making a practice of using articles supplied by the
person charged not for the purpose of selling such articles at a profit but for
the purpose of attracting customers to his store in the hope of selling them
other articles;



(c)
that the other person was making a practice of engaging in misleading
advertising in respect of articles supplied by the person charged; or



(d)
that the other person made a practice of not providing the level of servicing
that purchasers of such articles might reasonably expect from such other
person.



There
was ample evidence to show that in putting its “M.R.P.” plan into effect, in purported
compliance with this section, the appellant had in fact violated s. 34(2) (b)
of the Act in the cities of Toronto and St. Catharines in the Province of
Ontario in the manner alleged in the 1st

[Page 226]



and 2nd
counts of the indictment upon which it was convicted, but the 3rd and 4th
counts related to attempts- to induce retailers in the City of Vancouver to
comply with the plan in the same fashion and, as I have indicated, the learned
trial judge did not find that these charges had been proved beyond a reasonable
doubt.



The
evidence has been extensively reviewed in the judgment rendered by Mr. Justice
Schroeder on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal and I do not find it
necessary to deal with it in any detail because I am satisfied that the point
to be determined on this appeal is a very narrow one and turns on the question
of whether or not the grounds of appeal alleged before the Court of Appeal
involved “a question of law alone” so as to give that court
jurisdiction under the provisions of s. 584(1) of the Criminal Code which
read as follows:



584.
(1) The Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose may
appeal to the court of appeal



(a)
against a judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by
indictment on any ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone,…



In
support of the allegations of attempted inducement contained in the 3rd and 4th
counts, the Crown produced correspondence between two of the Company’s salesmen in Vancouver,
(Schell and Thompson) and the Company’s
head office which described their dealings with the Army and Navy Department
Store Limited and ABC Television & Appliances Limited respectively in
furtherance of the Company’s “M.R.P.” plan.










As to
the allegation respecting the Army and Navy Department Store Limited, (count
3), the learned trial judge, after reviewing the Schell correspondence and
pointing out that the Company’s representative at head
office had written to say that he had never called on this retailer during the
whole time that he was in Vancouver, went on to say:



This
would indicate that Army & Navy was not a Sunbeam retailer and may not have
received copies of Exhibits 4 and 5. While it would appear that the period of
three weeks in which the calls were made by Schell on Army & Navy Stores
was within the period set out in the count,

[Page 227]



such
fact is not clear. The evidence as to inducement on this count does not bear
that quality of certainty that ought to exist in the case of a criminal charge
and it will therefore be dismissed.



In
considering the 4th count, the learned trial judge reviewed the evidence
contained in the letter from Thompson to his head office concerning ABC
Television & Appliances Limited and concluded:



There
is here neither sufficient evidence of inducement on the part of the
accused nor that the alleged offence took place within the time charged. This
charge must therefore be dismissed.



The
italics are my own.



As the
evidence on the 3rd and 4th charges was almost entirely documentary, the
judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal turns in some measure on the
meaning to be attached to the provisions of s. 41(2) of the Act which read as
follows:



(2)
In a prosecution under Part V,



(a)
anything done, said or agreed upon by an agent of a participant, shall prima
facie be deemed to have been done, said or agreed upon, as the case may be,
with the authority of that participant;



(b)
a document written or received by an agent of a participant shall prima
facie be deemed to have been written or received, as the case may be, with
the authority of that participant; and



(c)
a document proved to have been in the possession of a participant or on
premises used or occupied by a participant or in the possession of an agent of
a participant shall be admitted in evidence without further proof thereof and
shall be prima facie evidence



(i)
that the participant had knowledge of the document and its contents,










(ii)
that anything recorded in or by the document as having been done, said or
agreed upon by any participant or by an agent of a participant was done, said
or agreed upon as recorded and, where anything is recorded in or by the
document as having been done, said or agreed upon by an agent of a participant,
that it was done, said or agreed upon with the authority of that participant,



(iii)
that the document, where it appears to have been written by any participant or
by an agent of a participant, was so written and, where it appears to have been
written by an agent of a participant, that it was written with the authority of
that participant.



In the
course of his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice Schroeder expressed the
view that the Crown’s proof as to the 3rd and
4th counts was “sufficiently clear and cogent to support
a conviction on these charges” (the italics are

[Page 228]



my own)
and that as no evidence was called on behalf of the defence, the trial judge
was not justified as a matter of law in acquitting the accused. In reaching
this conclusion, Mr. Justice Schroeder cited, amongst other cases, the
decision of this Court in Girvin v. The King[3] where Sir Charles
Fitzpatrick C.J.C., speaking for the Court at page 169, said:



I
have always understood the rule to be that the Crown in a criminal case is not
required to do more than produce evidence which if unanswered and believed is
sufficient to raise a prima facie case upon which the jury might be
justified in finding a verdict.



I do
not think that any authority is needed for the proposition that, when the Crown
has proved a prima facie case and no evidence is given on behalf of the
accused, the jury may convict, but I know of no authority to the effect
that the trier of fact is required to convict under such circumstances.
The Girvin case was an appeal from the verdict of a jury which had found
that the Crown’s evidence established the
accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt, and it was held that there was sufficient evidence to support that
verdict. In the present case the learned trial judge found that the case
presented by the Crown did not establish the appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and
as I have indicated, the main question raised by this appeal is whether that
finding involved a question of law alone so as to entitle the Attorney General
to appeal to the Court of Appeal under the provisions of s. 585(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code, or whether it was a finding of fact or one of
mixed fact and law.










In
dealing with the evidence contained in the letters from the appellant’s salesmen in which
reference was made to their conversations with the retailers named in counts 3
and 4 of the indictment, Mr. Justice Schroeder, applying the provisions of
s. 41(2), found that the statements so made by the salesmen “constitute direct proof by
way of admissions of the attempts charged against the respondent in both counts” and he went on to say:



That
evidence is not only sufficient to get the case past the judge to the
jury, but there being no issue as to the weight or credit to be given to

[Page 229]



it,
it is sufficient to counterbalance the general presumption of innocence
and require affirmative action by the court in convicting the accused where, as
here, it is not countered or controlled by evidence tending to contradict it or
render it improbable, or to prove facts inconsistent with it.



The
italics are my own.



With
the greatest respect I cannot agree with Mr. Justice Schroeder that the
provisions of s. 41(2) in any way preclude a judge or jury from considering the
weight to be attached to the evidence contained in the letters in
question in determining the issue of whether the Crown has proved its case
beyond a reasonable doubt.



Section 4(2)(c)
simply provides that documents, such as these letters, which were in the
possession of the accused “shall be admitted in
evidence without further proof thereof and shall be prima facie evidence” that the accused had
knowledge of the documents and their contents and that anything recorded in
them as having been done, said or agreed upon by the accused or its agent, was
done, said or agreed upon. This does not mean that the trial judge, having
accepted the letters as prima facie evidence of their contents, is
precluded from assessing the weight to be attached to that evidence in
considering the issue of the accused’s
guilt or innocence.



Mr. Justice
Schroeder, however, went on to say:










Looking
at the correspondence between these two salesmen and the Assistant General
Sales Manager of the respondent in the light of all the evidence as to the
formulation of its carefully conceived plan and the various steps taken to put
it into execution across the country, there is no ground upon which their
statements—in effect admissions—should be disbelieved. In
simply basing his dismissal of the charge against the accused on counts 3 and 4
on the doctrine of reasonable doubt, the learned Judge failed to direct his
mind to the fact that the Crown had raised a prima facie case against
the accused which clearly afforded evidence of facts from which the accused
might have cleared itself, but which it did not even attempt to answer or
explain. In the absence of such explanation or contradiction the Crown’s proof was confirmed and
became sufficiently clear and cogent to support a conviction. The
learned Judge’s failure to direct himself
upon this well-settled principle was nondirection amounting to misdirection,
and his consequent non-observance of it constituted an error in law which
afforded the Crown a right of appeal against the acquittal.



The
italics are my own.

[Page 230]



It
appears to me that Mr. Justice Schroeder’s reasoning in the last quoted
paragraph is predicated on his finding that the Crown’s proof was “sufficiently clear and cogent to support
a conviction”. This may well be so and
if a judge or jury had convicted the accused on the 3rd and 4th counts on the
evidence tendered by the Crown, I doubt very much whether such a conviction
could have been set aside, but we are not dealing with an appeal from a conviction;
here the accused was acquitted by the trial judge and the appeal to the Court
of Appeal for Ontario was an appeal from that acquittal. While the reasoning
employed by Mr. Justice Schroeder would be sound in the case of an appeal
from a conviction it is not, in my respectful opinion, applicable to such an
appeal as this.



In
considering whether or not this appeal “involves a question of law alone” I think that reference may
usefully be had to what was said by Rinfret J., speaking on behalf of this
Court in Fraser v. The King[4], where he was considering
the submission made on behalf of the accused that circumstantial evidence
adduced by the Crown was equally consistent with innocence as with guilt, and
he had occasion to say of that argument, at p. 301:



To
a certain extent, this would assimilate verdicts based on circumstantial
evidence ‘as consistent with the
innocence as with the guilt of the accused’ to verdicts where it is claimed that
there is no evidence at all to support them, the view being that the court of
appeal is empowered to set aside those verdicts on the ground that they are
unsatisfactory, whether on account of a total lack of evidence or for want of
sufficient legal evidence to support them.



Let
it be granted, however, that such a question should be deemed a question of
law, or of mixed law and fact, when once it is established that the evidence is
of such a character that the inference of guilt of the accused might, and
could, legally and properly be drawn therefrom, the further question whether
guilt ought to be inferred in the premises is one of fact within the province
of the jury…



I think
that these observations have a direct bearing on the present case and that,
accepting the view of Mr. Justice Schroeder that the evidence here was
sufficient to support a conviction, the further question of whether the guilt
of the accused should be inferred from that evidence, was one of fact within
the province of the judge.








[Page 231]



The law
applicable to the meaning to be placed on s. 584(1) (a) under the present
circumstances is stated in the judgment of this Court delivered by Taschereau
J. in Rose v. The Queen[5], where he said at p. 443:



The
trial judge sitting without a jury was fulfilling a dual capacity. He had,
therefore, to discharge the duties attached to the function of a judge and also
the duty of a jury. As a judge he had to direct himself as to whether any facts
had been established by evidence from which criminal negligence may be
reasonably inferred. As a jury he had to say whether from these facts
submitted, criminal negligence ought to be inferred. Metropolitan Railway
Company v. Jackson, 1877 3 A.C. 193 at 197, The King v. Morabilo, 1949
S.C.R. 172 at 174. I think that the trial judge directed himself properly and
that when he decided on the facts submitted to him that criminal negligence ought
not to be injerred, he was fulfilling the functions of a jury on a
question of fact.



The
italics are in the original judgment.



In the
quotations which I have taken from the judgment of the trial judge and of
Mr. Justice Schroeder, I have italicized the words “sufficient” and “sufficiently” wherever they occur, as it
appears to me that the fundamental difference between the trial judge and the
majority of the Court of Appeal was that the Court of Appeal was of opinion
that the evidence on the 3rd and 4th counts was sufficient to require a
verdict of guilty, whereas the trial judge did not consider it to be sufficient
to support such a verdict. It is well-settled that the sufficiency of
evidence is a question of fact and not a question of law and the law in this
regard is well stated by Trenholme J., speaking on behalf of the Quebec Court
of King’s Bench in Rex v. White[6], where he said at p. 75:



We
hold White had gone through his trial legally and the question of sufficiency
of the evidence to convict is a question of fact for the judgment of the
magistrate. A question of no evidence is a question of law. But it is a
question of sufficiency of evidence here; it is not a question of law.
Sufficiency of evidence, is always a matter for the jury to decide, or the
Judge in place of the jury, and the Judge is entitled to say there is no
evidence to go to the jury, but as to whether the evidence brought before the
jury-supports the condemnation or acquittal is for the jury alone, and is a
question of fact. Therefore, the question of the sufficiency of the evidence in
the case is a question of fact and not a question of law.

[Page 232]



The
reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice St. Jacques in Regina v.
Boisjoly[7] are to the same effect. He there said, at page 23:










Alors,
le jury a rendu son verdict et a déclaré le prévenu non coupable, et cela a été
dit par chacun des jurés. Il y a donc eu un verdict et c’est, en effet, ce verdict
que la Couronne demande à la Cour d’Appel
de mettre de côté.



Comment
cette Cour peut-elle le faire, à moins de prendre connaissance de toute la
preuve versée au dossier, afin de déclarer, contrairement à l’opinion du juge et au
verdict du jury, qu’il y avait suffisamment de
preuve pour rendre un autre verdict que celui qui a été prononcé? Est-ce là un
appel en droit uniquement? Assurément non, puisque la Cour aurait à étudier les
faits prouvés pour déduire une autre conclusion que celle à laquelle le jury en
est arrivé.



These
cases were both followed in the Quebec Court of Queen’s Bench in 1961 in the case of Regina
v. Ferland[8], and it will be found that
the courts of the other Provinces have been uniform in their adoption of the
views above expressed. See for example, Rex v. Gross[9], per Roach J.A., page 19; R.
v. J.[10] (Alberta); The King v.
Toubret and Davis[11] (N.S.); Rex v. F.W.
Woolworth Company[12] (B.C.), in which latter
case the respondent company was charged with discriminating against its
employees contrary to s. 4(2) (a) of the Industrial Conciliation
Arbitration Act, 1947 (B.C.), c. 44, and Chief Justice Sloan, speaking on
behalf of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, said, at page 176:



I
am unable to see how we can say that the learned judge below erred in finding
that the Crown had failed to prove the offence charged, unless we ourselves
weigh the evidence and reach our own and differing conclusions of fact thereon.



This,
however, as a Crown appeal, is limited to questions of law alone. It follows
therefore that in my opinion we have no jurisdiction to entertain it.



In the
case of The Queen v. Warner[13], the Court of Appeal of
Alberta had allowed an appeal from a conviction of murder on the ground that
the evidence at trial was not sufficient to support it and this Court decided
that

[Page 233]



that
ground did not raise a question of law so as to give it jurisdiction to hear a
further appeal. In the course of the reasons for judgment which he rendered on
behalf of himself, Taschereau and Abbott J., Chief Justice Kerwin said, at page
147:



In
my opinion there is no jurisdiction in the Court to hear this appeal. The first
two sentences of the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice of Alberta,
speaking on behalf of the Appellate Division, are as follows:










I
am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot be supported by the
evidence. But I feel I must go further, and set out other reasons for setting
aside the conviction.



I
read the first sentence as meaning that the Chief Justice considered that the
evidence was not sufficient to support a conviction,—which is a question of fact.



In the
same case, the present Chief Justice, with whom Taschereau and Abbott J.
agreed, said, at page 149:



I
do not find it necessary to consider the several errors of law alleged by the
appellant to have been made by the Appellate Division as I think it is clear
that the Appellate Division allowed the appeal on two main grounds:



(1)
that, in the opinion of the Appellate Division, the verdict of guilty of murder
should be set aside on the ground that it could not be supported by the
evidence, and



(2)
that there had been errors in law in the charge of the learned trial judge.



So
far as the judgment of the Appellate Division is based on the first ground
mentioned, this Court is powerless to interfere with it. The question whether
the Appellate Division was right in proceeding on this ground is not a question
of law in the strict sense. It is a question of fact or, at the best from the
point of view of the appellant, a mixed question of fact and law.



The
effect of these observations, which represent the view of the majority of the
Court, is that the question of whether or not the evidence was sufficient to
support a conviction is a question of fact.



Mr. Justice
Schroeder, however, while recognizing that there was nothing in the reasons for
judgment of the learned trial judge to “disclose ex facie what may be
denoted as a positive error of law…” went on to say:



It
is not essential that a misconception of law should appear on the face of the
judgment or the reasons therefor if the determination upon the evidence was
such that, in the opinion of a reviewing court, no person acting judicially and
properly instructed as to the relevant principles of law could have reached. If
that is readily apparent, as I believe it is here, then this Court is entitled
to assume that some misconception of law is responsible for the decision.

[Page 234]










It
appears to me that Mr. Justice Schroeder has cited an excerpt from the
reasons delivered on behalf of this Court by Anglin C.J., in Belyea and
Weinraub v. The King[14] as some authority in
support of this proposition. That was a case in which the trial judge had
acquitted the appellants on charges of offences against the Combines
Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 26, and of conspiracy contrary to
the provisions of s. 498 of the Criminal Code and, holding that the
error of the trial judge raised a question of law, this Court affirmed the
judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario which had
reversed the acquittal on the following grounds:



…the Appellate Division…s of the opinion that the
learned trial judge had misdirected himself, in that he held that, although it
was proven, if not admitted, that they (the appellants) ‘took an active part in the
original scheme,—the conspiracy which formed
the basis for the prosecution,…use (they) were not proved
to have taken part in subsequent overt acts,’ they should be acquitted,…



In my
view that case is distinguishable from the case at bar because the trial judge
had there made a clear finding of fact against the accused, (i.e., that
they had participated in the formation of the combine or agreement which was
charged as a conspiracy) from which it followed as a matter of law that they
were guilty of the offence with which they were charged. The trial judge did
not appear to appreciate the fact that the agreement was the essence of the
offence and seems to have thought that in order to find the accused guilty
there had to be evidence from which he could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt
that they had participated in overt acts done in furtherance of the agreement.
This was a manifest error in law which raised a question over which the Court
of Appeal had jurisdiction. I cannot see that any such question as was there
decided arises in the present case because here there was no finding of fact
against the accused in respect of the 3rd and 4th counts which, as a matter of
law, required the trial judge to convict.



In the
present case the trial judge accepted the evidence as contained in the letters
above referred to and thus gave

[Page 235]



full
effect to s. 41(2) of the Combines Investigation Act, but he concluded
that this evidence was not sufficient to satisfy him beyond a reasonable doubt
that the accused were guilty on the 3rd and 4th counts. However wrong the Court
of Appeal or this Court may think that he was in reaching this conclusion, I am
of opinion, with all respect for those who hold a different view, that this
error cannot be determined without passing judgment on the reasonableness of
the verdict or the sufficiency of the evidence, and in my view these are not
matters over which the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction under s. 584(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code.










Mr. Justice
Schroeder, however, further relies upon the case of Edwards (Inspector of
Taxes) v. Bairstow[15] and he makes particular
reference to the reasons for judgment of Lord Radcliffe in that case. That was
an appeal from a decision of the Commissioners for the General Purpose of the
Income Tax Act on a case stated by them. The facts were not in dispute and the
sole question was whether a taxpayer’s
profits arose out of an “adventure or concern in the
nature of trade” within the meaning of s.
237 of the English Income Tax Act, 1918.



In the
course of his reasons for judgment, Lord Radcliffe said, at page 33:



My
Lords, I think that it is a question of law what meaning is to be given to the
words of the Income Tax Act ‘trade, manufacture,
adventure or concern in the nature of trade’ and for that matter what constitute ‘profits or gains’ arising from it. Here we
have a statutory phrase involving a charge of tax, and it is for the courts to
interpret its meaning, having regard to the context in which it occurs and to
the principles which they bring to bear upon the meaning of income.



His
Lordship then observed that:



…the law does not supply a
precise definition of the word ‘trade’:…



and
went on to say:



In
effect it lays down the limits within which it would be permissible to say that
a ‘trade’ as interpreted by
section 237 of the Act does or does not exist.



But
the field so marked out is a wide one and there are many combinations of
circumstances in which it could not be said to be wrong to arrive at a
conclusion one way or the other. If the facts of any particular case are fairly
capable of being so described, it seems

[Page 236]



to
me that it necessarily follows that the determination of the Commissioners,
Special or General, to the effect that a trade does or does not exist is not ‘erroneous in point of law’; and, if a determination
cannot be shown to be erroneous in point of law, the statute does not admit of
its being upset by the court of appeal. I except the occasions when the
commissioners, although dealing with a set of facts which would warrant a
decision either way, show by some reason they give or statement they make in
the body of the case that they have misunderstood the law in some relevant
particular.



All
these cases in which the facts warrant a determination either way can be
described as questions of degree and therefore as questions of fact.










Lord
Radcliffe was, however, of the opinion that the agreed facts in the Bairstow
case were consistent only with the conclusion that the profit there in
question “was the profit of an
adventure in the nature of trade”.
In concluding his judgment, Lord Radcliffe made the following general
observation concerning appeals from income tax commissioners at page 38:



As
I see it, the reason why the courts do not interfere with commissioners’ findings or determinations
when they really do involve nothing but questions of fact is not any supposed
advantage in the commissioners of greater experience in matters of business or
any other matters. The reason is simply that by the system that has been set up
the commissioners are the first tribunal to try an appeal, and in the interests
of the efficient administration of justice their decisions can only be upset on
appeal if they have been positively wrong in law. The court is not a second
opinion, where there is reasonable ground for the first. But there is no reason
to make a mystery about the subjects that commissioners deal with or to invite
the courts to impose any exceptional restraints upon themselves because they are
dealing with cases that arise out of facts found by commissioners. Their duty
is no more than to examine those facts with a decent respect for the tribunal
appealed from and if they think that the only reasonable conclusion on the
facts found is inconsistent with the determination come to, to say so without
more ado.



I am
satisfied, after having read the reasons for judgment of Lord Radcliffe, that
the Bairstow case was one in which the court was required to decide
whether the facts found by the Commissioners were such as to bring the taxpayer
within the language employed in s. 237 of the English Income Tax Act,
1918, and that the question of law upon which the House of Lords decided that
case was “what is the meaning to be
given to the words of the Income Tax Act of ‘trade, manufacture, adventure or
concern in the nature of trade’ “? I must say, with all respect, that
that case does not appear to me to afford any authority

[Page 237]



for the
proposition that in an appeal against a judgment of acquittal under s. 584(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code “a question of law alone” is involved whenever a
reviewing court is of opinion that the finding of the trial judge was
unreasonable and improper having regard to the evidence.



If the
phrase “a question of law alone” as it occurs in that
section were to be so construed, then the result in my opinion would be
not only to extend the Attorney General’s right to appeal under that section,
but also to enlarge the meaning of the phrase “a question of law” as it occurs in other
sections of the Criminal Code dealing with appeals not only to the
Court of Appeal but to this Court. In my opinion such an interpretation could
result in a broadening of the scope of appellate jurisdiction under the Criminal
Code beyond the limitations which are stipulated in the express language of
the Code itself.










The
provisions of s. 592(1) (a) of the Code provide that:



592.
(1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction, the court of appeal



(a)
may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that



(i)
the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or
cannot be supported by the evidence.



(ii)
the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong
decision on a question of law, or



(iii)
on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;…



The
italics are my own.



Parliament
has thus conferred jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal to allow an appeal
against a conviction on three separate grounds, one of which is the very ground
upon which the Court of Appeal allowed the present appeal, i.e., that “the verdict should be set
aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the
evidence”. The fact that s. 592(1) (a)
recognizes this ground as being separate and distinct from “the ground of a wrong
decision on a question of law” appears to me to be the
best kind of evidence of the fact that Parliament did not intend the phrase “a question of law” as it is used in the Code
to include the question of whether the verdict at trial was unreasonable or
could not be supported by the evidence. It is noteworthy that having accorded
the Court of Appeal

[Page 238]



jurisdiction
to hear appeals against conviction on the ground that the verdict was
unreasonable, Parliament did not confer the same jurisdiction on that Court in
appeals by the Crown. No authority is needed for the proposition that appellate
jurisdiction must be expressly conferred and with all respect for those who may
hold a different view, I am of opinion that the Court of Appeal has exceeded
its jurisdiction by allowing this appeal on a ground reserved for appeals
against conviction which does not extend to appeals by the Attorney General.



For all
these reasons I would allow the appellant’s appeal against the verdict of guilty
on counts 3 and 4 of the indictment which was substituted by the Court of
Appeal for the verdict of acquittal at trial on these counts and I would set
aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal in this regard.










The
appellant has also appealed from that part of the judgment of the Court of
Appeal which varied the Order of Prohibition made by the learned trial judge.
As Mr. Justice Laskin has said:



The
heart of the variation lies in extending the prohibition to cover the
commission of the like offence in respect of any person other than the
retailers particularly mentioned in the counts on which convictions were made
and to cover the use of any other means by which, within the definition of the
offence, it may be committed. In my view, section 31 of the Combines
Investigation Act is ample enough to comprehend a prohibitory order in such
terms.



I would
not disturb the order of the Court of Appeal in this regard.



In the
result, I would allow the appellant’s
appeal in part.



The
judgment of Judson, Spence and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by



SPENCE
J. (dissenting):—This is an appeal from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[16] delivered on March 31,
1967, whereby that Court in a majority judgment allowed an appeal from the
judgment of Grant J. delivered

[Page 239]



on
March 18, 1966, by which he convicted the accused (here appellant) on counts 1
and 2 in the indictment and acquitted the accused (here appellant) on counts 3
and 4 in the said indictment.



From
the acquittal on counts 3 and 4, the Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal and
the accused (here appellant) cross-appealed from the conviction on counts 1 and
2.



At the
hearing of the appeal before the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the accused
abandoned its appeal against the conviction on counts 1 and 2. The Court of
Appeal for Ontario by reasons delivered by Schroeder J.A. and concurred in by
Porter C.J.O., F.G. MacKay and J.L. McLennan JJ.A., allowed the appeal of the
Crown and registered a conviction upon the said counts 3 and 4, and also
altered and extended the form of the order for prohibition which had been
granted by Grant J. after trial. Laskin J.A., dissenting, would have dismissed
the appeal by the Crown.



The
accused corporation was charged as follows:










1.
The Jurors for Her Majesty the Queen present that Sunbeam Corporation (Canada)
Limited, a corporation having its chief place of business at the City of
Toronto, in the County of York and being a dealer within the meaning of
Section 34 of The Combines Investigation Act, between the 1st day of
September, 1960 and the 31st day of December, 1960, by actions taking place
partly in the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York, in
the Province of Ontario and culminating in the City of St. Catharines, in
the Province of Ontario, unlawfully did by agreement, threat, promise or other
means attempt to induce Cavers Brothers Limited, sometimes known as Cavers
Bros., of the said City of St. Catharines to resell articles or
commodities, to wit, electric shavers at prices not less than the minimum
prices specified therefor by said Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited and did
thereby contravene the provisions of The Combines Investigation Act,
Section 34(2)(b).



2.
The said Jurors further present that Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited, a
corporation having its chief place of business at the City of Toronto, in the
County of York and being a dealer within the meaning of Section 34 of The
Combines Investigation Act, between the 1st day of September, 1960 and the 31st
day of December, 1960 at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County
of York, unlawfully did, by agreement, threat, promise or other means attempt
to induce New Era Home Appliances Limited sometimes known as New Era, of the
City of Toronto, to resell articles or commodities, to wit, electric floor
conditioners at prices not less than the minimum prices specified therefor by
Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited and did thereby contravene the provisions
of The Combines Investigation Act, Section 34(2)(b).



3.
The said Jurors further present that Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited, a
corporation having its chief place of business at the City of

[Page 240]



Toronto,
in the County of York and being a dealer within the meaning of Section 34
of The Combines Investigation Act, between the 1st day of September, 1960 and
the 31st day of December, 1960, by actions taking place partly in the
Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York, in the Province of
Ontario and culminating in the City of Vancouver, in the Province of British
Columbia, unlawfully did by agreement, threat, promise or other means attempt
to induce Army & Navy Department Store Limited, sometimes known as Army
& Navy Stores, of the said City of Vancouver to resell articles or
commodities, to wit, electric fry pans at prices not less than the minimum
prices specified therefor by said Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited and did
thereby contravene the provisions of The Combines Investigation Act,
Section 34(2) (b).










4.
The said Jurors further present that Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited, a
corporation having its chief place of business at the City of Toronto, in the
County of York and being a dealer within the meaning of Section 34 of The
Combines Investigation Act, between the 1st day of September, 1960 and the 31st
day of December, 1960 by actions taking place partly in the Municipality of Metropolitan
Toronto in the County of York, in the Province of Ontario and culminating in
the City of Vancouver, in the Province of British Columbia, unlawfully did by
agreement, threat, promise or other means attempt to induce ABC Television
& Appliances Ltd., sometimes known as ABC T.V. to resell articles or
commodities, to wit, electric floor conditioners at prices not less than the
minimum prices specified therefor by said Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited,
and did thereby contravene the provisions of The Combines Investigation Act,
Section 34(2) (b).



At
trial, before Grant J. sitting without a jury, as directed by s. 40(3) of the Combines
Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 314, the Crown’s case was put simply by the
production of the admission of the accused given under the provisions of s. 562
of the Criminal Code, and by producing and having filed as exhibits a
very large number of documents which had been seized by investigators in the
premises of the accused corporation in Toronto, Ontario, and which were
submitted as proof under the provisions of s. 41 of the said Combines
Investigation Act, as amended. Specified reference will be made to this
section hereafter.



Section 34
of the said Combines Investigation Act was amended in the year 1960 by
c. 45 of the Statutes of Canada for that year by the addition of subs. (5)
thereto. This section, which has been referred to from time to time as the “loss leader section”, was as Schroeder J.A.
points out in his reasons for judgment, enacted as a measure of relief to a
dealer who had refused to sell or supply or who had counselled the refusal to
supply of commodities contrary to s. 34(3) of the statute if he could establish
certain things.

[Page 241]



Almost
immediately thereafter the accused corporation evolved a scheme known as the
Minimum Profitable Resale Price Scheme, to which I shall refer hereafter as
MPRP, and proceeded to put into effect throughout Canada the said MPRP scheme.



The
representatives of the accused attended meetings with retail dealers in many
cities throughout Canada, forwarded, first to their distributors and later to
the retail dealers, literature outlining the scheme making statements therein
which statements proved relevant to the counts in the indictment.










To
summarize very briefly, the scheme was as follows: The accused corporation was
in the business of manufacturing and selling a very large range of electrical
appliances including such things as electric razors, toasters, coffee
percolators, floor polishers, and many others. The accused corporation sold
directly to a very limited number of large retailers such as the T. Eaton
Company Limited, the Robert Simpson Company Limited, the Hudson Bay Company and
some few others. The remainder of its sales was made by the accused corporation
to distributors throughout Canada and those distributors in turn sold the
products to retail dealers who again resold to the consuming public. The
accused corporation purported, through its long experience in the marketing of
electrical appliances, to know the average gross profit which a distributor
needed in order to carry on its business profitably and also the average gross
profit which a retail dealer, in turn, needed to carry on its own business
profitably. The accused corporation having fixed its selling price on each of
the appliances to the distributors calculated the gross profit which in its
opinion any distributor should obtain on the sale of such appliances to a
retail dealer and thereby to use its own words, “establish the distributors’ price”. Then again it calculated
the gross profit which a retail dealer should obtain upon its cost on the
purchase of an appliance from the distributor and established what it calls the
Minimum Profitable Resale Price, i.e., the MPRP. The circular which was
forwarded to all the distributors and with which was

[Page 242]



enclosed
a schedule showing the various appliances and in successive columns the
distributors’ net price, the suggested
dealers’ price (i.e., the price
from distributor to dealer), the Minimum Profitable Resale Price (i.e., the
price from dealer to consumer), the fair retail value and sales tax allowance,
concluded with a paragraph:



hereafter
if we find that sales are being made at prices less than those suggested above,
we shall give consideration as to whether such sales are loss leader sales and
assess our position as it relates to the marketing of our products.



Similarly,
the circular to retail dealers in which was included a price list containing in
columns the suggested dealer price, the minimum profitable resale price (MPRP),
and fair retail value, contained these two paragraphs:



It
is our opinion that a person loss-leads our products when he sells them at a
gross margin less than his average cost of doing business plus a reasonable
profit.



We
have drawn conclusions from evidence available as to the operating costs of a
variety of dealers who sell appliances and are efficiently organized to
merchandise effectively and provide reasonable service. These conclusions are
set forth specifically in the column headed “Minimum Profitable Resale Price” in our new Dealer Price
Sheet enclosed, effective September 15, 1960. The offering of our products
below these prices will be investigated as cases of loss-leading. It is our
intention to withhold supply, from persons who make a practice



—of loss leading our
products…










It was
the contention of counsel for the accused corporation throughout that this MPRP
scheme was only intended as notice that distributors and dealers advertising
for sale and selling at less than that MPRP price would be investigated as
possible examples of loss leading and that if after investigation such loss
leading were established then supply could be cut off from the offending
dealer.



The
Crown showed as to the first two counts involving Cavers Brothers Limited of
St. Catharines, and the New Era Home Appliances Limited of Toronto, that
in fact the said corporation had attempted to induce the dealer to sell the
article at not less than a specified minimum price. The learned trial judge
therefore convicted the accused corporation on those counts which were, it
should be noted, counts of breach of s. 34(2) (b) of the Combines
Investigation Act, which provides:

[Page 243]



34.
(2) No dealer shall directly or indirectly by agreement, threat, promise or any
other means whatsoever, require or induce or attempt to require or induce any
other person to resell an article or commodity



(b)
at a price not less than a minimum price specified by the dealer or established
by agreement.



Count 3
in the indictment laid exactly the same charge against the accused corporation
as to the Army and Navy Stores of the City of Vancouver, and count 4 of the
said indictment again laid the same charge against the accused corporation as
to ABC Television and Appliances Limited, also of the City of Vancouver. It
should be noted that the charge was of an attempt to induce the specified
dealer to resell appliances at not less than the specified minimum price. The
same evidence as to those two counts as had been relevant to counts 1 and 2,
was adduced, i.e., the circular letter to the distributor with its attached
price list and the circular letter to the dealer with its attached price list.
I have already referred to these documents.



There
was in addition as to count 3, the count in reference to the Army and Navy
Stores, a letter from one A. R. D. Schell, an employee of the accused
corporation in British Columbia, to one J. C. Hall, an officer in the head
office of the corporation in Toronto, dated October 9, 1960, which I quote in
full:



Dear
Joe:



Army
& Navy Stores, Vancouver, have been stocking some of our items and selling
them at very low prices. For instance, they have the S 5 iron on at $14.49, FPM—$15.95 FPL $19.49 and a few
other items.



I
have called on Mr. Ludwig who is in charge of this department and
presented our resale pricing programme to him. Each time I called, he would
agree to bring the prices up to the minimum, but when I went back, they were
exactly the same. This has now been going on for three weeks, in which time I
have called on Mr. Ludwig five times.










As
yet I have had no complaints from any Account on this matter, but I feel should
we let it go, it just might start something. He has been giving G.E. the same
run around.



They
have been buying their Sunbeam and G.E. from Mc. & Mc.



Joe,
these are the details, and am passing them on to you for your advice.



R. D. Schell.



(The
underlining is my own.)

[Page 244]



The
learned trial judge pointed out that that letter had been replied to by one
from Mr. J. C. Hall to R. D. Schell, dated October 14, 1960, which read,
in part:



I
would suggest, Dick, that seeing you are going in and calling on this Mr. Ludwig
that you continue to do so endeavouring to obtain his co-operation by pointing
out that no one will be selling any less than he is and doing your best to get
him to come up to our prices on this basis.



The
trial judge pointed out that there is no evidence that Schell ever made any
further calls on Ludwig or in any way thereafter attempted to carry out Hall’s suggestion or passed on
any of the contents of Hall’s letter to Ludwig, and.
the learned trial judge then concluded:



The
evidence as to inducement on this count does not bear that quality of certainty
that ought to exist in the case of a criminal charge and it will therefore be
dismissed.



It must
be remembered that the evidence at trial as I have pointed out consisted so far
as the Crown’s case was concerned of the
admissions and of the production of all of these documents. Counsel for the
accused corporation called two witnesses neither of whom in his evidence dealt
with the two letters of October 9 and of October 14, 1960, to which I have just
referred.



Section 41
of the Combines Investigation Act provides:



41.
(1) In this section,



(a)
“agent of a participant” means a person who by a
document admitted in evidence under this section appears to be or is
otherwise proven to be an officer, agent, servant, employee or representative
of a participant,



(b)
“document” includes any document
appearing to be a carbon, photographic or other copy of a document, and



(c)
“participant” means any accused and any
person who, although not accused, is alleged in the charge or indictment to
have been a co-conspirator or otherwise party or privy to the offence charged.



(2)
In a prosecution under Part V,










(a)
anything done, said or agreed upon by an agent of a participant shall prima
facie be deemed to have been done, said or agreed upon, as the case may be,
with the authority of that participant;



(b)
a document written or received by an agent of a participant shall prima
facie be deemed to have been written or received, as the case may be, with
the authority of that participant; and



(c)
a document proved to have been in the possession of a participant or on
premises used or occupied by a participant or in the possession of an agent of
a participant shall be admitted in evidence without further proof thereof and
shall be prima facie evidence

[Page 245]



(i)
that the participant had knowledge of the document and its contents,



(ii)
that anything recorded in or by the document as having been done, said or
agreed upon by any participant or by an agent of a participant was done, said
or agreed upon as recorded and, where anything is recorded in or by the
document as having been done, said or agreed upon with the authority of that
participant,



(iii)
that the document, where it appears to have been written by any participant or
by an agent of a participant, was so written and, where it appears to have been
written by an agent of a participant, that it was written with the authority of
that participant.



Therefore,
by virtue of s. 41(2) (c), the documents, i.e., those two letters
of the 9th and 14th of October 1960, having been proved to be in the possession
of the accused or on its premises, were prima facie evidence (1) that
the accused had knowledge of the documents and their contents, and (2) that
anything recorded therein as having been done was done and was done by the
agent with the authority of the accused. Therefore, the only evidence before
the learned trial judge as to count 3 was the evidence that the agent Schell
with the authority of the accused, had on five occasions in the three weeks
prior to October 9, 1960, called on Mr. Ludwig in the Army and Navy Stores
in Vancouver and presented to him a resale pricing programme and that on each
of those occasions Ludwig “would agree to bring the
prices up to the minimum”. Under those
circumstances, it matters not whether Mr. Ludwig or the Army and Navy
Stores had ever received a copy of the circular to dealers to which I have
referred above, or had any previous knowledge of the MPRP programme, the plain
statement in the letter reporting is that on five different occasions Schell
had attempted to have Ludwig agree to increase his prices to a specified
minimum price.










There
can be no doubt as to the occasions having been within the time specified in
the indictment and that therefore the attempt in count 3 was between September
1, 1960, and December 31, 1960. The letter reporting was dated October 9, 1960,
and it speaks of actions within the previous three weeks, i.e., commencing
some time after September 1, 1960. In fact, the letters to distributors had
only gone out on September 14, 1960, and the report by the head office

[Page 246]



of the
accused corporation in Toronto to the U.S. head office in Chicago, Illinois,
outlining the MPRP scheme which was produced at trial as an exhibit was only
forwarded on September 14, 1960.



As I
have already pointed out, this was the only evidence before the learned trial
judge. Reasonable doubt must be based upon evidence adduced at the trial and
there was, therefore, no basis upon which reasonable doubt that the accused had
committed the offence as charged in the indictment could arise.



In
prosecuting on the 4th count, i.e., that dealing with ABC Television,
the Crown relied on the said circulars to distributors and dealers to which
reference has been made above, and also on a letter from one Bill Thompson, an
agent of the accused corporation in Vancouver, to Mr. J. C. Hall, dated
September 20, 1960, the third paragraph of which read:



I
have been checking with dealers, and not one of the dealers I have contacted
have received the letter from Sunbeam that I understood was to be sent out the
15th. Has there been a change of plans? Dick and I are trying to get prices set
here, and without actual price sheets it is a difficult job. As far as my Floor
Care Div dealers go, the only dealer that is cutting our polishers at present
(that I know about) is Collin Ryan of A.B.C. TV. I talked to Collin today, but
he wouldn’t assure me of raising and
I hesitate to do anything until the before-mentioned letters and price sheets
are here.



Mr. Hall
replied to that letter by his of September 29, 1960. The third paragraph of
that letter reads as follows:



I
can imagine that Collin Ryan of A.B.C. Television is causing you a problem. I
have had similar ones with him in the past, Bill, but after a lot of hard
talking I have managed to persuade him to come up to the price that I wanted
him to do so. I can only suggest first that you try every means you can to
get him to raise his prices to our minimum profitable resale prices, then if he
absolutely refuses and if he runs any ads, let us have them and we will take
action immediately. I would like you to keep me posted on this or any other
discrepancies there may be with other dealers in the British Columbia area.



(The
underlining is my own.)



The
learned trial judge in dealing with count 4 concluded:










There
is no evidence that Thompson carried out Hall’s instructions concerning Ryan except
that the latter had put his prices up after a

[Page 247]



long
talk. There is.here neither sufficient evidence of inducement on the part of
the accused nor that the alleged offence took place within the time charged.
This charge must therefore be dismissed.



Therefore,
the only evidence upon this count in addition to the outline of the scheme as
contained in the circulars to dealers and distributors was Thompson’s report of September 20,
in which he said “I talked to Collin today
but he wouldn’t assure me of raising and
I hesitate to do anything until the before mentioned letters and price sheets
are here” and his report of October
15 where he said Ryan had put his price up yesterday “after quite a long talk”. Surely, this being the
only evidence, it is the plain statement by Thompson, the agent of the accused
corporation, that he had attempted, before the 20th of September, to induce
Ryan to raise his sale price to a specified minimum price and that he had again
made an attempt, which was successful, on October 13, 1960, there can be no
other conclusion than that none of the acts took place prior to the 1st of
September 1960 as the scheme only went into effect in the middle of that month
and since the inducement and successful inducement was reported on October 14,
1960, and that the acts took place within the period charged. Again I point out
that the charge was a charge of attempting to induce and these letters amount
to an admission of an attempt to induce a dealer to sell at not less than a
specified minimum. That such minimum was the MPRP price is shown clearly by
Mr. Hall’s letter to Bill Thompson
dated September 29, 1960 which I have quoted. Since a reasonable doubt must be
based on evidence and there was no evidence which could give rise to any such
reasonable doubt to rebut the presumption created by s. 41 of the Combines
Investigation Act, there was no course but to convict the accused.



The
problem arises as to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to consider the
appeal from the acquittal by the learned trial judge. The appeal to the Court
of Appeal was taken by virtue of s. 584 of the Criminal Code which
provides:



584.
(1) The Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose may
appeal to the court of appeal

[Page 248]



(a)
against a judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by
indictment on any ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone,…










(The underlining is my own.)



Counsel
for the accused corporation took the position before the Court of Appeal for
Ontario and before this Court that the appeal of the Crown was not based on a
ground of law alone but at best was upon a ground of mixed law and fact and
upon such ground no appeal lay.



Schroeder
J.A. in his reasons sets out the grounds of law advanced by the Crown in, the
Court of Appeal for Ontario as follows:



1.
He erred in law in refusing to consider the entire documentation as relevant to
each count;



2.
He erred in law in failing to give effect to uncontradicted documentary
evidence which had made out a prima facie case under section 41 and which,
not having been contradicted or explained by the accused, became conclusive;



3.
He erred in the effect which he gave to the words “attempt to induce” as they are used in
section 34(2)(b).



With
respect, I agree with Schroeder J.A. that it does not appear from the record
that the learned trial judge erred in refusing to consider the entire
documentation as relevant to each count and that ground, therefore, need not be
considered further.



I turn
next to ground 3 in the list above. Laskin J.A. said in his reasons:



Counsel
for the Crown did not press the third ground because it did not involve a
question of law alone on the basis on which he proposed to argue it.



I am
unable to understand this statement. It would appear at any rate that counsel
for the Crown held no such view before this Court as in the first paragraph of
the argument in the respondent’s factum it is set out:



37.
It is respectfully submitted that the learned trial judge misdirected himself
as to the meaning and effect of Section 34(2) (b) of The Combines
Investigation Act in considering the evidence relating to inducement and
thereby erred in law.



Schroeder
J.A. in reference to the third ground of appeal said:



The
third ground of error assigned by counsel is more serious, since in stating
that the “evidence of inducement” in counts 3 and 4 was

[Page 249]



inadequate
to support a criminal charge, the learned Judge either overlooked the fact that
the charge was confined to attempted inducement or disregarded the decision of
this court in Regina v. Moffatts Limited. (1957) O.R. 93, as stated at
p. 106, . . .










With
respect, I agree with Schroeder J.A. Although the learned trial judge on the
same page of his reasons said:



The
substance of the third count is that the accused within the same period of time
by actions taken [sic] place partly in Metropolitan Toronto, partly in the City
of Vancouver, unlawfully by agreement, threat, promise or other means attempted
to induce Army and Navy Department Stores to resell…



(The
underlining is my own.)



when he
concluded his consideration of the third count, he said:



The
evidence as to inducement on this count does not bear that quality of
certainty that ought to exist in the case of a criminal charge and it will
therefore be dismissed.



(The
underlining is my own.)



The
learned trial judge pointed out earlier in his reasons what Estey J. said in,
this court in Rex v. Quinton[17]:



This
section requires that one to be guilty of an attempt must intend to commit
the completed offence and to have done some act toward the accomplishment of
that objective, that act must be beyond preparation and go so far toward the
commission of the completed offence that but for some intervention he is
prevented or desists from the completion thereof. It is the existence of both
the intent and the act in such a relationship that the former may be regarded
as the cause of the latter. The intent unaccompanied by the act does not
constitute a criminal offence.



In the
present case, the charge in count 3 was that the accused, here appellant, “…unlawfully did by
agreement, threat, promise or other means, attempt to induce Army and Navy
Department Stores…to resell articles or
commodities. at prices not less than the minimum prices specified…”



The
intention to commit the completed offence is quite clearly demonstrated by
Mr. Hall’s letter to Mr. Schell
dated October 14, 1960, to which I have referred, when he states:



I
would suggest, Dick, that seeing you are going in and calling on this
Mr. Ludwig that you continue to do so endeavouring to obtain his

[Page 250]



co-operation
by pointing out that no one will be selling any less than he is and doing your
best to get him to come up to our prices on this basis.



(The
underlining is my own.)










Again,
in his general reporting letter dated September 13, 1960, to Mr. R.P.
Gwinn, the chief officer of the U.S. head office, E.F. Bond, the vice-president
of the appellant corporation said, in part:



We
have held and will hold distributor meetings in all major marketing centres
throughout Canada for the purpose of explaining our programme. Actually it is
similar to GE’s in that we will do the
following two things:



(1)
Establish maximum discounts allowed by distributors for quantity purchases by
dealers (5% on any assortment of 12)



(2)
Establish minimum profitable resale prices for dealers.



The
second item is a clear statement of the intent. The acts toward the
accomplishment of the objective in the case of count 3 were Schell’s five attendances upon
Mr. Ludwig in an attempt to obtain Ludwig’s agreement to sell only at the
specified minimum prices. Whether or not Schell was successful in such attempt
is irrelevant. I accept the law as outlined in Regina v. Moffatts Limited[18] that it is not essential
on an attempt-charge under s. 34(2) (b) of the Combines Investigation
Act to prove that the attempt was successful.



Similarly,
when one deals with count 4 which was that the appellant, “unlawfully, did by
agreement, threat, promise or other means attempt to induce…ABC Television and
Appliances Ltd. to resell articles or commodities…at prices not less than the minimum
prices specified…”, one finds the attempt
specified in the Bond letter to Gwinn of September 13, 1960, to which I have
referred, and also in the paragraph I have quoted from the letter of Bill
Thompson to J.C. Hall dated September 20, 1960. The overt act toward the accomplishment
of the objective is set out in the same letter, i.e., the attendance
upon Collin Ryan, and in the further report of October 15,

[Page 251]










1960 “Collin Ryan of ABC TV took
his price up to that figure yesterday after quite a long talk”. Again, in this case, both
elements necessary to prove an attempt to induce, which was the offence
charged, are proved conclusively in the documentation. There was no evidence
given to contradict them although Mr. Bond was called as a witness for the
defence. The prima facie case wrought by s. 41 (2) (c) of the Combines
Investigation Act being the only evidence upon the topic therefore becomes
the uncontradicted evidence and it was the duty of the learned trial judge upon
such uncontradicted evidence to register convictions. It was an error in law to
charge himself as, with respect, it would appear that the learned trial judge
had charged himself, that the Crown in order to support the charges had to
prove an inducing by agreement, threat or promise. “Other means” seems to have been forgotten. In
order to prove the offence charged all the Crown had to prove was the intent to
induce and an overt act toward the accomplishment of that intent. As I have
said the Crown in each of the counts proved these on prima facie evidence which
by lack of contradiction became conclusive evidence.



There
is, therefore, in this ground 3 submitted by the appellant an error in law
sufficient to give the Court of Appeal jurisdiction under the provisions of s.
584(1) of the Criminal Code. It will be realized that in coming to this
conclusion I have in fact dealt with the second ground of appeal in that I have
stated that the prima facie evidence wrought by the provisions of s. 41 of the Combines
Investigation Act not having been contradicted became conclusive. It has
been objected by counsel that such a view of the effect of s. 41 takes from the
learned trial judge the right and the duty to weigh all the evidence and to
come to his conclusion upon the whole case whether the Crown has proved the
necessary ingredients of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.



I, of
course, agree that the Court is always under the duty of so weighing all the
evidence in order to come to that conclusion. The learned trial judge had
already con-

[Page 252]



sidered
in reference to counts 1 and 2 and in his general outline of the MPRP scheme
the establishment of the intent to induce the dealers to resell at not less
than the minimum specified prices and before he could have registered a
conviction on counts 1 and 2 had come to the conclusion that such intent had
been established beyond reasonable doubt. The intent was exactly the same in
the case of counts 3 and 4 as it had been in the case of counts 1 and 2. If it
were established beyond reasonable doubt as to counts 1 and 2 it had been
established also beyond reasonable doubt as to counts 3 and 4.










The
only evidence as to the overt act toward the accomplishment of that end in the
case of counts 3 and 4 is in the correspondence to which I have referred. If
the learned trial judge had weighed that evidence upon the question as to
whether it proved beyond reasonable doubt that such overt act had taken place
rather than upon the question of whether or not there had been an inducing then
he could not have failed to find such an overt act proved beyond reasonable
doubt as there was no evidence to weigh contra. The faults which the learned
trial judge cites as to this evidence were faults as to its evidentiary value
in proving beyond reasonable doubt the inducing and not the overt act in a
charge of attempting to induce.



In my
view, my conclusion, therefore does not infringe on the right and duty of a
trial judge to weigh all the evidence in order to determine whether the Crown
has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.



So in Girvin
v. The King[19], as pointed out by
Sohroeder J.A. in his reasons for judgment, Fitzpatrick C.J. said at p. 169:



I
have always understood the rule to be that the Crown, in a criminal case is not
required to do more than produce evidence which, if unanswered, and believed,
is sufficient to raise a prima facie case upon which the jury might be
justified in finding a verdict.



And in Belyea
v. The King[20], the learned trial judge
had found as a fact upon the evidence and this Court was of

[Page 253]



the
opinion that such was fully justified on the evidence, that the accused took an
active part in the original scheme—the
conspiracy which formed the basis of the prosecution—but acquitted him on the ground that
there was no evidence which connected him with any of the illegal operations
subsequent thereto. The Appellate Division was of the opinion that the learned
trial judge had misdirected himself in that he held that the latter finding
entitled the accused to an acquittal. This Court upheld the decision of the
Appellate Division finding that there was a ground of error in law which
entitled the Crown to appeal to the Appellate Division.



In that
case as in the instant case, it must be noted, the trial judge’s error in law was not
expressly formulated in his judgment. On the contrary he had, as here,
expressed his erroneous conclusion as resting on a question of fact:



In
arriving at this conclusion I have in mind the provisions of s. 69 of the
Criminal Code, but, notwithstanding that section, I cannot find upon the
evidence that there was any participation or complicity by O’Connor in the offences
established in evidence and therefore a verdict of not guilty must be found in
this case.



(The
underlining is my own.)










However,
having quoted, among others, the above passage, Anglin C.J.C. speaking for the
Court had no difficulty in holding that on the basis of the whole judgment and
record, the acquittal was not actually based on wrong findings of fact nor on
an incorrect weighing of the evidence, but on an unstated error of law that should
be inferred. He said at p. 292:



Presumably
on the ground that the purpose of the organization was “professedly” (i.e., ostensibly) lawful, and that
there is not sufficient evidence that the appellants participated in, or were
privy to, the subsequent admittedly illegal acts of the Windsor group, the
learned judge acquitted them.



And at
p. 296:



Here,
the learned trial judge apparently had already found facts from which the
conclusion was inevitable that there was participation on the part of Belyea
and Weinraub in the formation of the illegal combine and the conspiracy, the
existence of which he had already found to be proven. On these findings,
coupled with the admissions made by Belyea

[Page 254]



and
Weinraub in their testimony, and the documents of which they were proved to
have had knowledge, their convictions, as was held by the Appellate Division,
were a necessary consequence.



Concerning
the extent of the jurisdiction of this Court in such a case, the Chief Justice
said on the same page:



The
right of appeal by the Attorney-General, conferred by s. 1013(4), Cr.C., as
enacted by c. 11, s. 28, of the Statutes of Canada, 1930, is, no doubt,
confined to “questions of law”. That implies, if it means
anything at all, that there can be no attack by him in the Appellate Divisional
Court on the correctness of any of the findings of fact. But we cannot regard
that provision as excluding the right of the Appellate Divisional Court, where
a conclusion of mixed law and fact, such as is the guilt or innocence of the
accused, depends, as it does here, upon the legal effect of certain findings of
fact made by the judge or the jury, as the case may be, to enquire into the
soundness of that conclusion, since we cannot regard it as anything else but a
question of law,—especially where, as here,
it is a clear result of misdirection of himself in law by the learned trial
judge.










It is
contended that even if the evidence is found to be sufficient to support a
conviction, the further question of whether the guilt of the accused should be
inferred from that evidence is a question of fact and reference is made to Fraser
v. The King[21] and Rose v. The Queen[22]. Those were cases in which
facts necessary to establish the guilt of the accused had to be inferred, in
the first, from circumstantial evidence, in the other, from other proven facts.
In neither case was there a statutory provision enacting that the proven facts
would constitute prima facie evidence of the other facts required to
establish the guilt of the accused and, therefore, the making or not making of
an inference was not a question of law alone although it might be unreasonable.
However, when there is, as in this case, a statutory presumption to be applied,
once the facts necessary to give rise to it are found by the trial judge to be
established beyond reasonable doubt, the question whether the inference should
be made is no longer anything but a question of law alone: the statute does not
provide that the facts to be inferred may be deemed to exist but that
they shall be. To say that such evidence does not bear the quality of
certainty that ought to exist

[Page 255]



in the
case of a criminal charge is to ignore or contradict the statute and is,
therefore, an error in law and nothing else.



As
against this, it is contended that the legal presumption is not a presumption
of guilt but a presumption of some facts and that the trier of the facts has to
weigh the evidence before reaching a final conclusion.



In Rose
v. The Queen, supra, Taschereau J., as he then was, said at p. 443:



The
trial judge sitting without a jury was fulfilling a dual capacity. He had,
therefore, to discharge the duties attached to the functions of a judge, and
also the duties of a jury. As a judge he had to direct himself as to whether
any facts had been established by evidence from which criminal negligence may
be reasonably inferred. As a jury he had to say whether, from those facts
submitted, criminal negligence ought to be inferred. Metropolitan Railway
Company v. Jackson, (1877), 3 App. Cas. 193 at 197, King v. Morabito, [1949]
S.C.R. 172 at 174. I think that the trial judge directed himself properly, and
that when he decided on the facts submitted to him that criminal negligence ought
not to be inferred, he was fulfilling the functions of a jury on a
question of fact.










However,
in that case, the trial judge in coming to his decision that the accused should
have been acquitted was performing a function of weighing the evidence. The
charge was one of causing death by the operation of a motor vehicle, and the
evidence dealt with the conduct of the accused in driving his automobile
against a red traffic signal. The learned trial judge found that the accused
was not keeping a proper lookout but that his speed was not above the normal at
the intersection and reached the conclusion that the accused had not seen
the red light. The trial judge, weighing those facts, came to the conclusion
that they did not show the wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety
of other persons required for conviction of the offence charged. Therefore, the
learned trial judge had evidence one way and the other way to weigh and a
conclusion to arrive at as a result of that weighing whether such conduct
showed the standard of negligence required by the provisions of the Criminal
Code. In the present case, the learned trial judge had no such task of
weighing. There was no evidence contra; there was nothing which needed to be
inferred

[Page 256]



beyond
the inference required by the section of the statute. There was a simple
admission established as prima facie evidence by the provisions of s. 41 of the
Combines Investigation Act that the accused through its agent had
attempted to induce these persons to sell at not less than the specified
minimum price. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the enunciation of the
varying duties of the judge and jury as set out above with which, with respect,
I agree, do not apply in the present case to make the learned trial judge’s acquittal of the accused
a mere matter of fact.



With
respect, I agree with the view expressed by Evans J.A. in Regina v. Torrie[23] where he said at p. 11:



I
recognize that the onus of proof must rest with the Crown to establish the
guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, but I do not understand this
proposition to mean that the Crown must negative every possible conjecture, no
matter how irrational or fanciful, which might be consistent with the innocence
of the accused.



For
these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and confirm the judgment of the Court
of Appeal for Ontario including its direction as to the amendments of the Order
of Prohibition issued by Grant J.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Motor vehicles—Negligence—Pedestrian struck
in crosswalk of traffic-controlled intersection—Failure of driver to give
right-of-way—Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 253, s. 128(9)(b),
(11)(a).

Trial—Questions to jury as to negligence of
parties—Usual order reversed—Effect thereof—Indication by trial judge that
ultimate negligence doctrine could be invoked—Jury misled.

Evidence—Witness identifying injured person
as woman seen running at intersection ten minutes before accident—Evidence
improperly admitted.

The female plaintiff was injured when she was
struck by an automobile owned and driven by the defendant while she was
crossing an intersection of a main arterial highway running north and
south and a road running east and west. The said intersection was a
controlled intersection within the meaning of s. 128 of the Motor-vehicle
Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 253. It was dark at the time of the accident
and the plaintiff was crossing to the west in a crosswalk. She was wearing a
long, light coloured winter coat. She testified that she looked to the north
and to the south, and seeing no vehicles approaching, started to cross. She
remembered taking a few steps but nothing more. She was rendered unconscious,
sustaining extremely serious injuries.

The defendant was travelling southward on the
west side of the highway. He said that he saw a form darting from his left to
his right in the crosswalk area and immediately applied his brakes. The
plaintiff was hit by the front of the car towards the left centre. She had
travelled westward some 55 feet in the crosswalk before she was struck. The
defendant knew of the crosswalk and that pedestrians might be expected to be
crossing the highway at this point. He had been travelling at about 50 m.p.h.
as he came southward, and as he approached the intersection took his foot
off the accelerator and poised it over the brake pedal.

At the trial of the plaintiffs’ action for
damages, the jury found that the accident was caused solely by the negligence
of the female plaintiff. The judgment dismissing the action was affirmed by the
Court of Appeal and the plaintiffs then appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial held limited to the question of
damages.

The first question put to the jury should
have been as to whether there was any negligence on the part of the defendant
which caused or contributed to the accident. If the jury found negligence on
the part

[Page 258]

of the defendant and gave particulars, the
next question would be whether there was any contributory negligence on the
part of the plaintiff which caused or contributed to the accident. The
reversing of this order had a serious effect upon the manner in which the trial
judge charged the jury and in the jury’s consideration of the whole question of
liability.

It was a serious error on the part of the
trial judge to indicate that the ultimate negligence doctrine could be invoked
in this case, and evidence given by the driver of another car to the effect
that some ten minutes before the accident he had seen a woman, whom he later
identified as the injured person, run out from a curb at the
intersection and then dart back was improperly admitted.

There was no evidence on which the jury could
find or infer that the female plaintiff left a curb or other place of safety or
that she walked or ran into the path of the defendant’s vehicle and,
accordingly, s. 169(2) of the Motor-vehicle Act did not apply.

The defendant had failed in his duty to (1)
keep a proper look-out; (2) to enter the intersection at such a speed that
he could slow down or stop, if necessary, before striking a pedestrian who was
lawfully in the pedestrian crosswalk; and (3) to yield right-of-way to the
pedestrian as he was required to do by s. 128(11)(a) of the Act.
There being no evidence upon which a finding could be made that the female
plaintiff started across the highway without looking to see if it was safe to
do so or that she did anything to jeopardize her own safety, she was entitled
to assume that the driver of the motor vehicle in question would obey the law
and yield right-of-way.

Jardine v. Northern Co-operative Timber
and Mill Association, [1945] 1 W.W.R. 533; Toronto
Railway Co. v. King, [1908] A.C. 260, applied.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia, rejecting an appeal from a judgment of Macdonald J. with
a jury, dismissing the appellants’ action for damages. Appeal allowed and new
trial ordered.

Thomas Braidwood and Robert Brewer, for
the plaintiffs, appellants.

R.E. Ostlund, for the defendant,
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

HALL J.:—This is an appeal from the Court of
Appeal of British Columbia which rejected an appeal from a judgment of
Macdonald J. with a jury, dismissing the appellants’ action for damages. The
appellants are husband and wife.

The female appellant was injured when she was
struck by an automobile owned and driven by the respondent while she was
crossing from east to west on the King George Highway near Vancouver at the
intersection of the highway with what is known as Kennedy Road (88th

[Page 259]

Avenue). King George Highway is a main arterial
highway. There are residential areas on either side. Provision for pedestrians
to cross was made at the intersection of Kennedy Road by a pedestrian
crosswalk on the south side of the intersection. This crosswalk was outlined by
lines painted on the pavement.

The situation at the intersection in
question was as shown on the following plan:

There was no safety island or curbed area in the
centre of the highway, only the painted lines as indicated.

[Page 260]

At or about 5:30 p.m. on December 16, 1963, the
female appellant, age 51, was on her way home from visiting her daughter who
lives in the area east of the King George Highway. She had to cross the highway
to reach her home which was on Kennedy Road west of the highway. On her way
home she purchased some loaves of bread and arrived at the south‑east
corner of the intersection of the highway and Kennedy Road where she
proceeded to cross to the west in the crosswalk shown on the plan. It was dark
at this time. She was wearing a long, light coloured winter coat and carrying
the bread in a paper bag. She testified that she looked to the north and to the
south, and seeing no vehicles approaching, started to cross. She remembers
taking a few steps but nothing more. She was rendered unconscious, sustaining
extremely serious injuries and she remained unconscious for several days.

The respondent was travelling southward on the
west side of the highway, and as he came towards the intersection in
question he was in the lane to the west of the left turn lane as shown on the
plan. He knew the intersection well and that there was a pedestrian
crosswalk on the south side of the intersection. It was the only pedestrian
crosswalk for a considerable distance north or south of the area. He had driven
over this intersection a great many times. He said he saw “this form
darting from my left to my right” in the crosswalk area and immediately applied
his brakes. Skid marks extending from 40 feet north of the crosswalk were
identified and traced to his car which came to rest some 91 feet south of the
crosswalk. The overall skid marks measured 141 feet. The skid marks north of
the crosswalk came in a straight line, showing that the car had not been turned
nor had it swerved either to right or to left. The respondent said that his car
struck this form or object at about the south side of the crosswalk at a point
some 8 to 10 feet into the lane for southbound traffic. It was only then that
he realized that it was a pedestrian that had been hit. His evidence as to this
was as follows: “Yes, I hit at this time an object. I understand later it was a
pedestrian, and I carried her on the hood of my car for some distance…” The
female appellant was hit by the front of the car towards the left centre. The
distance from the edge of the asphalt at the north side of the crosswalk

[Page 261]

was, as the plan shows, some 85 feet. This means
that the pedestrian had travelled westward at least 55 feet in the: cross-walk
before she was struck. The respondent also testified that when he first saw
her, she was running and that she moved about 8 or 9 feet from when he first
saw her until the car hit her. His testimony as to the impact was as follows:

Q. How many steps would you say you saw
this object move before you struck it?

A. I don’t believe I would even attempt
to—as soon as I saw this object I tried to avoid it.

Q. Did you continue to look at this object
or did you direct your attention to something else?

A. I tried to avoid it.

Q. I am asking you what you did with your
eyes, with your vision. Did you continue to look at this object or did you
direct—

A. You naturally look at it.

Q. You did continue to look at it until you
struck it?

A. Yes.

Q. And you cannot say how far you saw it
move or how many steps at any rate?

A. No.

Q. Can you say how far you saw it move in
terms of feet or yards?

A. Well, it was—I first saw it in through
my windshield running from my left to my right.

Q. Yes. How far did you see it?

A. Now, it hit the left front of my car.

Q. Or may we also put it this way, the left
front of your car hit the pedestrian?

A. Well, I say the pedestrian was running.

Q. Yes?

A. My car, we’ll put it this way, my car
came in contact or vice versa, we came in contact.

Q. How far did you see this object move,
can you say?

A. A very short distance from when I first
saw it.

On his examination for discovery he said:

175 Q. Now, what was she doing when you
first saw her?

A. Moving rapidly from my left to my right,
and I presume she was running.

The respondent said that he did not see the
pedestrian (object) sooner because the lighting conditions at the
intersection were bad; that the intermittent flashing amber light
suspended above the intersection as indicated on the plan caused a blind
area to the south which was the area which contained the crosswalk. He knew the
crosswalk was there and that pedestrians might be expected to be crossing

[Page 262]

the highway at this point. He had been
travelling at about 50 miles per hour as he came southward, and as he
approached the intersection took his foot off the accelerator and poised
it over the brake pedal. He estimates that his speed was reduced to about 45
miles per hour. However, it must be noted that the highway in question has a
slight downhill grade from north to south at this point which could negative
the effect of taking the foot off the accelerator. Other than the respondent,
no eye witness gave evidence as to the impact.

As the intersection in question was a
controlled intersection within the meaning of s. 128 of the Motor-vehicle
Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 253, the provisions of subss. 9(b) and 11(a)
apply. These read:

(9) When rapid intermittent flashes of red
light are exhibited at an intersection by a control signal,

(b) A pedestrian facing the
flashes of red light may proceed across the roadway within a marked or unmarked
crosswalk with caution.

(11) When rapid intermittent flashes of
yellow light are exhibited at an intersection by a traffic-control signal,

(a) The driver of a vehicle facing
the flashes of yellow light may cause the vehicle to enter the
intersection and proceed only with caution, but shall yield the right‑of‑way
to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk;

The learned trial judge put the following
questions to the jury and these questions were answered as shown:

THE CLERK: Number one, was the plaintiff
Rodojka Petijevich guilty of negligence which caused or contributed to the
cause of the accident? Yes. If so, what was her negligence? One, proceeded
without reasonable caution through crosswalk. Two, by running through
crosswalk. Three, did not employ an evasive action, such as stopping or
stepping back.

Two, was the defendant guilty of negligence
which caused or contributed to the cause of the accident? No. If so, what was
his negligence? None.

It will be observed that the usual order of
questions was reversed. The first question should have been as to whether there
was any negligence on the part of the defendant which caused or contributed to
the accident. This is the prime question. If the answer is “No” that ends the
matter. The foundation of the action are the allegations of negligence made
against the defendant. Then, if the jury finds

[Page 263]

negligence on the part of the defendant and
gives particulars, the next question would be whether there was any
contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff which caused or contributed
to the accident. This reversing of the order had, I think, a serious effect
upon the manner in which the learned trial judge charged the jury and in the
jury’s consideration of the whole question of liability.

Although a question involving ultimate
negligence was not put to the jury, the learned trial judge, in charging the
jury, indicated that the ultimate negligence doctrine could be invoked, and he
proceeded to tell the jury that they might, in effect, find that the female
appellant had had the last clear chance to avoid the accident. This was not a
case for the application of the ultimate negligence doctrine. It was a serious
error which, apart from everything else, must have misled the jury and which,
according to the record, caused the jury to ask questions which showed that
they did not correctly understand the law applicable to the case.

Evidence was tendered on behalf of the
respondent and received without objection from one Jack Melvin Shaw to the
effect that some minutes before the female appellant was struck he had been
driving westward on Kennedy Road intending to turn north on the King George
Highway. He had come to a stop before entering the highway as he was required
to do and he said that as he started up a woman ran out from the curb at the
north-east corner of the intersection and that when she saw his vehicle
was moving towards her, she darted back. He continued northward, picked up a
passenger and returned some 10 minutes later to the intersection, and seeing
that an accident had happened, stopped and said he identified the injured
person as the woman he had seen a few minutes before by recognizing the coat
she was wearing. That was his only item of identification. Now, regardless of
whether he was able to identify the woman or not, his evidence was not
admissible and its admission was, in my view, fatal to the verdict because not
only was the evidence improperly admitted, but in his charge to the jury the
learned trial judge said:

Then the defendant says to you that she
failed to take reasonable care for her own safety because she was running, and
points out to you

[Page 264]

that this is the evidence that the
defendant Law gave. The defendant says that you should infer from what happened
according to Mr. Shaw’s evidence, when he testified that he saw the female
plaintiff running from the northeast corner in a westerly direction, and from
evidence suggesting that she was late in getting home, that from these things
you should infer that she was running just before impact in this case.

Norris J.A., in his reasons for judgment in the
Court of Appeal, stated that in his opinion the evidence of Shaw was admissible
as part of the res gestae. I cannot agree. He also said that in any
event, even if the evidence was not admissible, no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice was occasioned thereby. With respect, I am of the view
that the admission of this evidence, coupled with the reference thereto in the
learned trial judge’s charge to the jury, was bound to have an adverse effect
on the appellants’ case with the jury.

In addition to quoting the relevant
subsections of s. 128 to the jury, the learned trial judge instructed
the jury that s. 169(2) of the Motor-vehicle Act of British
Columbia applied in the instant case and had to be considered. Section 169(2)
reads:

No pedestrian shall leave a curb or other
place of safety and walk or run into the path of a vehicle that is so close
that it is impracticable for the driver to yield the right-of-way.

There was no evidence on which the jury could
find or infer that the female appellant left a curb or other place of safety or
that she walked or ran into the path of respondent’s vehicle. She was more than
half way across the intersection when she was hit and was at least 55 feet
from the curb or east edge of the highway and had only two or three steps to go
before she would be clear of the path of respondent’s vehicle and out of harm’s
way. Accordingly, s. 169(2) was not applicable in the circumstances of
this case.

Section 128(11)(a) says that the driver
of a vehicle facing flashes of yellow (amber) light may cause his vehicle to
enter the intersection and proceed only with caution but shall yield
right‑of-way to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an
adjacent crosswalk. The female appellant was lawfully in the crosswalk and the
respondent was, accordingly, required to yield right-of-way to her. The reason
he gave for not doing so was because he did not see

[Page 265]

her soon enough and he did not see her sooner
because the lighting conditions at the intersection in question were such
that the crosswalk area was a blind area to him as he came from the north. His
duty in those circumstances was to enter the intersection at such a speed
and keeping such a look-out that if a pedestrian should be in the crosswalk he
would be able to yield the right-of-way to that pedestrian. There is nothing in
the evidence to justify any suggestion that the female appellant ran from the
east side of the highway because she says she started across walking slowly,
and the evidence as to her running comes at a time almost coincident with being
struck and perhaps she was making a last second effort to avoid being hit.

I have no doubt that the jury’s verdict cannot
stand. The next question is whether there should be a new trial on the question
of liability and damages or as to damages only. The Court of Appeal of British
Columbia has the power to give the judgment which the trial court could have
given: Rex v. Hess (No. 2)[1]. The
power of the Court is discussed by O’Halloran J.A. at pp. 597 and 598 and this
Court has the power to do the same. The principle to be applied in determining
whether there should be a new trial as to liability or as to damages only was
discussed by O’Halloran J.A. in Jardine v. Northern Co-operative Timber and
Mill Association[2], where
he says at p. 535:

Where as here the evidence is of such a
character that only one view can reasonably be taken of its effect, it is not a
case for a new trial, see McPhee v. E. & N. Ry. Co. (1913) 5 W.W.R.
926, 49 S.C.R. 43, Duff, J. at p. 55 (with whom Sir Charles Fitzpatrick,
C.J. and Brodeur, J. concurred) and also the decision of the old Full Court
(Hunter, C.J., Irving and Martin, JJ.) in Yorkshire Guar. & Securities
Corpn. v. Fullbrook & Innes (1902) 9 B.C.R. 270, but we ought now give
the judgment which the plain facts proven conclusively at the trial demanded,
and that is, judgment for the plaintiff-appellant as asked for in the statement
of claim, less the sum of $286.48, mentioned shortly; see also Paquin Ltd.
v. Beauclerk [1906] A.C. 148, 75 L.J.K.B. 395 (H.L.) and also Canada
Rice Mills Ltd. v. Union Marine and Gen. Insur. Co. (No. 1) [1941] 3 W.W.R.
401, [1941] A.C. 55, 110 L.J.P.C. 1, Lord Wright at 65.

In the instant case all the evidence that could have
any bearing on the liability of the respondent or on the contributory
negligence, if any, of the female appellant was before the Court. There is no
suggestion that anything new

[Page 266]

in the way of evidence would be forthcoming if
the question of liability were to be retried. Any verdict which would exonerate
the respondent from negligence in this case would, in my view, be perverse
because on the evidence of the respondent himself, it is incontrovertible he
failed in his duty to (1) keep a proper look-out; (2) to enter the
intersection at such a speed that he could slow down or stop, if
necessary, before striking a pedestrian who was lawfully in the pedestrian
crosswalk; and (3) to yield right-of-way to the pedestrian as he was required
to do by s. 128(11)(a) of the Motor-vehicle Act. On the
other hand, the only evidence lawfully before the Court regarding the
contributory negligence, if any, of the female appellant is that of the
respondent that as he saw her she was running or walking very fast and this
was, as he says, within “a very very short time” of the impact. There is no
evidence upon which any finding could be made that the female appellant started
across the highway in question without looking to see if it was safe to do so
or that she did anything to jeopardize her own safety once she had made a
substantial entry into that intersection. She was then entitled to assume that
the driver of a motor vehicle coming from the north would obey the law and
yield her right-of-way: Toronto Railway Co. v. King[3].

I would accordingly allow the appeal and direct
a new trial limited to the question of damages only. The appellants will have
judgment against the respondent for the damages so assessed. The appellants are
entitled to their costs in this Court and in both Courts below.

Appeal allowed and new trial ordered with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA,
APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Plea of guilty—Charge of non
capital murder—Accused represented by counsel—Whether Court should have
questioned the accused before accepting plea.

The appellant, who was a 22 year old Cree
Indian with a Grade II education, was charged with capital murder to which he
pleaded not guilty. The charge was subsequently reduced to non capital murder,
and in the presence of his counsel, the appellant pleaded guilty thereto and
was sentenced to life imprisonment. The Court of Appeal dismissed his
application for leave to withdraw that plea and affirmed the conviction on the
charge of non capital murder. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this
Court on the question as to whether the trial judge erred in law in accepting
the plea of guilty without making inquiry as to whether the appellant
understood the nature of the charge and the effect of such plea.

Held (Spence
J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: When a plea of guilty is offered and
there is any reason to doubt that the accused understands what he is doing,
there is no doubt that the judge will make inquiry to ascertain whether he does
so; and the extent of the inquiry will vary with the seriousness of the charge
to which the accused is pleading. Failure to make due inquiry may well be a
ground on which the Court of Appeal will exercise its jurisdiction to allow the
plea of guilty to be withdrawn if it is made to appear that the accused did not
fully appreciate the nature of the charge or the effect of his plea or if the
matter is left in doubt. However, it cannot be said that where, as in the case
at bar, an accused is represented by counsel and tenders a plea of guilty to
non capital murder, the trial judge is bound as a matter of law to interrogate
the accused before accepting the plea.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: It is the duty in law of the trial tribunal to
satisfy itself that the accused understands the nature of the charge and the
effect of the plea before it is entitled to accept a plea of guilty. The trial
judge could not, in the circumstances of this case, in exercising his
discretion to accept the plea of guilty, rely only on the fact that the accused
was represented by counsel. In so doing, he could not satisfy himself that the
accused knew either the nature of the plea or the consequences thereof.

Droit criminel—Plaidoyer de
culpabilité—Accusation de meurtre non qualifié—Accusé représenté par un
avocat—Est-ce que la Cour aurait dû questionner l’accusé avant d’accepter le
plaidoyer.

[Page 182]

L’appelant, un Indien Cri âgé de 22 ans et
ayant une éducation allant jusqu’au grade II, a été accusé d’un meurtre
qualifié auquel il a plaidé non coupable. L’accusation a été subséquemment
réduite à celle de meurtre non qualifié, et en présence de son avocat,
l’appelant a plaidé coupable à cette accusation et a été condamné à
l’emprisonnement à vie. La Cour d’appel a rejeté sa demande pour obtenir la
permission de retirer ce plaidoyer et a confirmé la déclaration de culpabilité
sur l’accusation de meurtre non qualifié. L’appelant a obtenu la permission
d’appeler à cette Cour sur la question de savoir si le juge au procès a erré en
droit en acceptant le plaidoyer de culpabilité sans faire une enquête pour
déterminer si l’appelant comprenait la nature de l’accusation et l’effet d’un
tel plaidoyer.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté, le Juge Spence étant dissident.

Le Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges
Martland, Judson et Ritchie: Lorsqu’un plaidoyer de culpabilité est offert et
qu’il y a raison de douter que l’accusé comprend ce qu’il fait, il n’y a aucun
doute que le juge fera une enquête pour s’assurer qu’il comprend; et l’étendue
de cette enquête variera selon la gravité de l’accusation à laquelle l’accusé
plaide. Le défaut de faire l’enquête requise peut être un motif sur lequel la
Cour d’appel s’appuiera pour exercer la juridiction qu’elle possède de
permettre que le plaidoyer de culpabilité soit retiré s’il appert que l’accusé
n’a pas complètement apprécié la nature de l’accusation ou l’effet de son
plaidoyer ou si la chose est laissée dans le doute. Cependant, on ne peut pas
dire que lorsqu’un accusé est, comme dans le cas présent, représenté par un
avocat et offre un plaidoyer de culpabilité à une accusation de meurtre non
qualifié, le juge au procès est tenu en droit d’interroger l’accusé avant
d’accepter le plaidoyer.

Le Juge Spence, dissident: En droit,
le juge au procès doit s’assurer que l’accusé comprend la nature de l’accusation
et l’effet du plaidoyer avant qu’il lui soit permis d’accepter un plaidoyer de
culpabilité. Dans les circonstances de cette cause, le juge au procès ne
pouvait pas, dans l’exercise de sa discrétion d’accepter le plaidoyer de
culpabilité, s’appuyer uniquement sur le fait que l’accusé était représenté par
un avocat. En ce faisant, il ne pouvait pas s’assurer que l’accusé connaissait
la nature du plaidoyer ou ses conséquences.

The judgment of Cartwright C.J and of Martland,
Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—This appeal is brought,
pursuant to leave granted by this Court on October 17, 1968, from a judgment of
the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta pronounced on September
10, 1968, dismissing, without recorded reasons, the application of the
appellant for leave to withdraw his plea of guilty, granting leave to appeal
and dismissing the appellant’s appeal from his conviction on a charge of
non-capital murder.

Leave was granted to appeal on the following
question:

Did the learned trial judge err in law in
accepting the Appellant’s plea of guilty to non‑capital murder without
making inquiry to satisfy himself that the Appellant understood the nature of
the charge and the effect of such a plea?

It appears that the appellant was indicted on
the charge that on or about March 11, 1967, he unlawfully killed Robert George
Sidener, thereby committing capital murder. The indictment is dated September
5, 1967. The appellant appeared before Primrose J. on September 5, 1967, was
arraigned and pleaded not guilty and the case was remanded to October 30, 1967,
for the purpose of fixing a date for trial. The appellant appeared on October
30 before Greschuk J.; he appeared on January 2, 1968, before Primrose J.;
he appeared on January 15, 1968, before Manning J.; on each of these
occasions the case was further remanded for the purpose of fixing a date for
trial. The appellant appeared on February 26, 1968, before Greschuk J. and was
remanded to March 11, 1968, for trial. On March 11, 1968, he appeared before
O’Byrne J. and the notation on the back of the indictment as to what occurred
on that day is as follows:

The transcript of the proceedings on March 11,
1968, opens as follows:

MR. STAINTON: In this case, my Lord, might
the amendment which has been proposed and which has been written into the
indictment be granted so that the charge will read non-capital murder instead
of capital murder?

THE COURT: Yes, the amendment is granted.

MR. STAINTON: Might the accused be
rearraigned, my Lord?

THE COURT: Yes. Mr. Clerk:

THE CLERK OF THE COURT: Lawrence Willard
Brosseau, you stand charged that you on or about the 11th day of March, A.D.
1967, at or near Tulliby Lake in the Judicial District of Edmonton, did
unlawfully kill and slay Robert George Sidener, thereby committing non-capital
murder contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code. How say you to this
‘charge, do you plead guilty or not guilty?

THE ACCUSED: Not guilty.

THE CLERK OF THE COURT: Harken to your plea
as the Court doth record it, Lawrence Willard Brosseau, not guilty.

MR. MOUSSEAU: My Lord, if we may, would the
Court grant a five-minute adjournment?

THE COURT: Yes, we will adjourn for five
minutes.

The Court adjourned at 10.05 a.m. and reconvened
at 10.20 a.m., at which time Mr. Mousseau asked the Court to stand the
matter over to two o’clock in the afternoon, Mr. Stainton stated that he
had no objection, and the trial Judge adjourned the matter accordingly. The
transcript as to what occurred at 2 p.m. is as follows:

MR. MOUSSEAU: I might at this time, my
Lord, before Mr. Brosseau arrives, explain that whilst Mr. Brosseau
appears to have a sufficient command of the English language, I have on prior
occasions interviewed him with an interpreter, and when I spoke with
Mr. Brosseau earlier this morning he did indicate to me that he preferred
that the present proceedings be interpreted to him. Mr. Callihoo, who is
an ex-agent of the then Department of Indian Affairs, has agreed to do so, and
I would request of Your Lordship that he be sworn in order to perform his
function.

THE COURT: Very well.

PATRICK CALLIHOO, sworn in as English/Cree
interpreter.

THE COURT: It’s just a matter of reading
the charge again to the accused, Mr. Mousseau?

[Page 185] 

MR. MOUSSEAU: It is, yes, my Lord.

THE CLERK: Lawrence Willard Brosseau, you
stand charged that you on or about the 11th day of March, A.D. 1967, at or near
Tulliby Lake, in the Judicial District of Edmonton, did unlawfully kill and
slay Robert George Sidener, thereby committing non‑capital murder,
contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code. How say you to this charge, do
you plead guilty or not guilty?

THE ACCUSED: Guilty.

THE CLERK: Harken to your plea as the Court
doth record it, Lawrence Willard Brosseau, guilty.

Mr. Stainton then outlined the
circumstances of the killing to the trial Judge at some length. The trial Judge
then asked Mr. Mousseau if he wished to say anything and Mr. Mousseau
addressed the Court as follows:

MR. MOUSSEAU: Only to indicate to the Court
that the accused is describable only in terms of an absolute primitive. I don’t
pretend to have any particular understanding of his mind or of his intent. I
can point out to evidence given in the preliminary both by the wife of the
deceased as well as by Mr. Wendt, that there was absolutely no antagonism
or ill feeling between the accused and Mr. Sidener. I can point out also
the accused’s evidence to the effect that he drank what for him was a
substantial amount of beer. I can point out also the fact that whilst he did
give one profession or did make certain admissions to Mr. Nolin, as my
friend has pointed out, he gave a totally different reason for the commission
of the act when speaking to the police.

These factors, of course, in view of the
statutory penalty, do not involve this Court presently. However, this Court, to
the extent that it is a Court of law, is involved with the matter of justice
generally, and whilst I am not absolutely certain as to the Court’s powers with
respect to cases of like nature, I would ask of the Court that it recommend
that this matter be gone into by the Parole Board and that it may, upon
examination, prove to be one of the special cases that the enactment setting
out the Parole Board envisages. That is my submission, my Lord.

The transcript continues as follows:

THE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Mousseau.

Stand up, Mr. Brosseau. Section 206(2)
of the Criminal Code provides that a person guilty of non-capital murder shall
be sentenced to imprisonment for life. I have no discretion in the matter. I
sentence you to imprisonment for life. At the request of Mr. Mousseau a
report will be made to the Parole Board along the line suggested by him.

MR. MOUSSEAU: Thank you, my Lord.

THE COURT: That’s all, Mr. Stainton?

MR. STAINTON: Yes, my Lord.

THE COURT: Thank you.

(Court
adjourned at 3:01 p.m.)

[Page 186]

It will be observed that no inquiry was made by
the learned trial Judge either of the appellant or of his counsel as to whether
the appellant understood the charge and the consequences of his plea of guilty.

On March 18, 1968, the appellant gave a written
notice of appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta
stating that he wished to apply “for leave as required” and to appeal his
conviction and sentence on the following grounds:

(a) I wish to appeal my conviction
and sentence on the grounds that I only have a grade 2 education and my lawyer
told me that if I didn’t plead guilty to the charge that they would sentence me
to hang. When he told me this I was scared and pleaded guilty.

On August 26, 1968, the appellant swore an
affidavit stating that he is a Cree Indian, that he reached only grade 2 in
school and left school when he was fifteen years old, that he is now twenty-two
years old, that he was drunk at the time of the offence and did not know what
he did, that he was drunk when he gave a statement to the police, that he
understood that for capital murder he would be hanged but that non-capital
murder was not so serious, that his lawyer told him in February 1968 that he
might get five or seven or eight years but did not say on what charge he could
get this sentence, that, in March 1968, his lawyer told him that if he was
found guilty they would sentence him to be hanged, that he pleaded not guilty
in Court and the case was put over till two o’clock and that his lawyer told
him that if he was found guilty he could be sentenced to be hanged but that if
he pleaded guilty, he would get life imprisonment; that he pleaded guilty
because he was scared of being hanged, that when he pleaded guilty he did not
understand that the Judge had no choice but to impose a life sentence. He
concluded by saying that he did not believe he had killed Robert George Sidener
as he always got along well with him when he worked for him over six years and
that he had no grudge against him.

Mr. Mousseau, at the specific request of
counsel then acting for the appellant and with the written authorization of the
appellant, made an affidavit which appears to have beep sworn on September 12,
1968. (This would seem to be

[Page 187]

in error as the judgment of the Appellate
Division refers to the affidavit of Mr. Mousseau). In this affidavit,
Mr. Mousseau states that he arranged the delays in the case being brought
to trial in the expectation of a change in the legislation regarding capital
crimes, “that the amendments made the Criminal Code, and relevant to the
proceedings at bar, were not of a nature as would assist the Appellant”, that
subsequent to the enacting of the amendment aforesaid a tentative arrangement
was entered into between counsel for the Crown and himself, as a result of
which it was suggested that the charge should be reduced to non‑capital
murder.

The amendments referred to were doubtless those
contained in Statutes of Canada 1967-68, c. 15, and by virtue of
s. 3 of that Act, as the date of the killing of Sidener was March 11,
1967, and the indictment was dated September 5, 1967, prior to the date that
the amendments were brought into force, December 29, 1967, it is clear that had
the appellant been convicted on the indictment for capital murder the
imposition of a sentence of death would have been mandatory.

The affidavit continues as follows:

6. THAT subsequent to the above, I met with
my client on a number of occasions (the last of those meetings took place on
either of the 9th or the 10th days of March, A.D. 1968); we together
reviewed the facts of the matter; I discussed with him the nature of the charge
with which he was faced, as well as the consequences attendant upon a finding
of guilty thereon; I also indicated that, on the evidence, the charge might, at
trial, be reduced to one of either ‘non-capital murder’ or ‘manslaughter’—I
explained to him the nature of these charges as well as the consequences
attendant thereon; I recommended that, in my opinion, his interests would best
be served by his pleading guilty to a reduced charge of ‘non-capital murder’—I
indicated to him that the sentence in a case of this nature was dictated by the
Statute; that, notwithstanding, the Parole Regulations permitted review and
release upon his having served seven years of his sentence or, in the event
that special circumstances be shown to exist, at the Board’s discretion—I was
able, in this last regard, to assure him of the co-operation and assistance of
officials of the Native Friendship Centre as well as to indicate to him that I would
move that the Court, in its ‘Report’, recommend review in the light of the very
peculiar nature of his person and circumstances; MR. BROSSEAU indicated that he
would be guided by my recommendation.

7. On March 11th, A.D. 1968, MR. BROSSEAU
appeared before O’BYRNE, J., and. was re-arraigned on a charge of non-capital
murder he recorded a plea of “not guilty”; in view of the circumstances
surrounding the reduction of the charge as well as of my uncertainty as to
whether he was fully cognizant of that which he had done—I requested
adjournment of the matter to the afternoon.

[Page 188]

8. I then called upon P. CALIHOO, an
interpreter, and together with MR. CALIHOO, attended upon MR. BROSSEAU at the
R.C.M. Police cells; at that time, through the intermediary of MR. CALIHOO I
clearly indicated to MR. BROSSEAU that he was wholly at liberty to proceed to
trial and that, should he so desire, I would request a further adjournment of
the proceedings; I again reviewed the circumstances of the occurrence; explained
the consequences attendant upon a finding of “guilty” on each of the three
charges aforementioned; I reiterated my advice to the effect that his best
interests would be served by his pleading “guilty” to the reduced charge as it
presently stood; I requested that he indicate his desire and assured him that I
would do as he requested; at 2:00 o’clock that afternoon he again appeared
before The Honourable, Mr. Justice M.B. O’BYRNE, the charge was re-read to
him and translated into the Cree language by MR. CALIHOO—he recorded a plea of
“guilty” thereto.

9. THAT MR. BROSSEAU’S circumstances are
such that, in my opinion, notwithstanding the above, it may well be that he was
throughout incapable of understanding or appreciating the nature and
consequences of the plea instantly recorded; that his background is such that
he cannot be regarded other than as a true ‘primitive’.

There was also before the Appellate Division an
affidavit exhibiting a letter from an M.D., a psychiatric consultant,
concluding with the sentence:

Certainly he (the appellant) would not rate
higher than a Borderline I.Q.—that is, just above the Defective level.

and a psychological report of which the last
sentence reads:

It can be concluded that he is functioning
within the borderline group.

I have recited the evidence which was before the
Appellate Division at perhaps undue length. It was within the powers of that
Court, if it saw fit to do so, to make an order permitting the appellant to
withdraw his plea of guilty and directing a new trial but their decision not to
do so was one involving questions of fact or mixed fact and law, not a question
of law in the strict sense, unless it can be said that the question on which
leave to appeal to this Court was granted should be answered in the affirmative.

The question before us is whether the learned
trial Judge erred in law in accepting the plea of guilty without making inquiry
as to whether the appellant understood the nature of the charge and the effect
of such plea.

No doubt when a plea of guilty is offered and
there is any reason to doubt that the accused understands what he is doing, the
judge or magistrate will make inquiry to ascertain whether he does so and the
extent of the inquiry will vary with the seriousness of the charge to which the

[Page 189]

accused is pleading. An illustration of the care
exercised in a case where the accused pleaded guilty to murder at a time when
the imposition of the death sentence was obligatory, is furnished by the case
of Rex v. Bliss[1].

The extent of the duty of inquiry resting on a
judge or magistrate before whom a plea of guilty is offered is discussed in R.
v. Johnson and Creanza[2] and
in Rex v. Hand (No. 1)[3], both
decisions of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. In the second of these,
Bird J.A., as he then was, speaking for the Court said at page 389:

This Court in two recent cases has had
occasion to express the opinion that a plea of guilty ought not to be accepted
unless the Judge or Magistrate is sufficiently informed in open Court of the
facts upon which the accused pleads guilty, to provide assurance that the
accused understands the offence to which his plea relates: Cf. R. v.
Theriault (unreported) and R. v. Johnson & Creanza, (1945) 4
D.L.R. 75, 85 Can. C.C. 56. This course is more particularly essential where
the offence, as here, involves a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and
whipping.

In Rex v. Milina[4], the Court of Appeal for British Columbia
consisting of Sloan C.J.B.C. and O’Halloran, Robertson, Sidney Smith and Bird
JJ.A. again considered the cases above referred to. Sidney Smith J.A., with
whom Sloan C.J.B.C. and Robertson J.A. agreed, said at page 592, after
referring to the language used in the Hand case:

But however that may be, it is desirable to
state now quite plainly that in my opinion when an accused person pleads guilty
it is not the law that the magistrate must go into the facts in order to
satisfy himself that the accused is in fact guilty. If that were so there would
be an end at once to any efficacy in a plea of guilty.

What the quoted language does mean is that
upon a plea of guilty the magistrate should satisfy himself that the accused
knows exactly what he is doing when he so pleads, and knows and understands the
exact nature of the offence with which he is charged. And the accused must
plead guilty in “plain, unambiguous and unmistakable terms” (Rex v. Golatham
(1915) 84 L.J.K.B. 758, 112 L.T. 1048, per Lord Reading, C.J.). The cases
will be rare indeed in which a magistrate will feel himself obliged to make any
special inquiry when the accused, as here, is represented by counsel. The
circumstances which are contemplated by the expressions used in the above cases
are those in which the accused may be a foreigner, or illiterate, or the charge
is one of unusual complexity or of an unusually grave nature. Instances of
these are to be

[Page 190]

found in Crankshaw’s Criminal Code, 6th
ed., pp. 1062-3. The practice in England is to the same effect and is thus
stated in Kenny’s Outlines of Criminal Law, 15th ed., at p. 558:

If he confesses, i.e., ‘pleads guilty’, he
may be at once sentenced. But in certain cases, lest he should be confessing
under some misapprehension as to the law or even as to the facts of his case,
the Court often advises him to withdraw his plea of guilty, and so let the
matter be fully investigated.

This passage, in my view, furnishes a useful
guide to the practice which should be followed when a plea of guilty is offered
and there is reason to doubt that the accused understands what he is doing.
Failure to make due inquiry may well be a ground on which the Court of Appeal
will exercise its jurisdiction to allow the plea of guilty to be withdrawn if
it is made to appear that the accused did not fully appreciate the nature of
the charge or the effect of his plea or if the matter is left in doubt; but in
my opinion, it cannot be said that where, as in the case at bar, an accused is
represented by counsel and tenders a plea of guilty to non-capital murder, the
trial Judge before accepting it is bound, as a matter of law, to interrogate
the accused.

I have reached the conclusion that the question
on which leave to appeal was granted should be answered in the negative.

I would dismiss the appeal.

SPENCE J. (dissenting):—I have read the
reasons of the Chief Justice as set out herein. In those reasons, the facts are
set out with considerable clarity and detail and there is no need to repeat
them in these reasons. With respect, I am of the opinion that it is the duty in
law of the trial tribunal, whether it be magistrate or judge, to satisfy
himself that the appellant understands the nature of the charge and the effect
of the plea before he is entitled to accept a plea of guilty. I am in accord
with the analysis made by Sidney Smith J.A. in Regina v. Milina[5], when he said, referring to the language
used in Rex v. Hand (No. 1)[6]:

What the quoted passage does mean is that
upon a plea of guilty the magistrate should satisfy himself that the accused
knows exactly what he is doing when he so pleads, and knows and understands the
exact nature of the offence with which he is charged.

[Page 191]

I realize, as Avory J. said, in Vent v. The
Queen[7]:

It is only in a case where there is some
reason to doubt whether an accused person appreciates the nature of his
confession or the consequences resulting from it that a jury is empanelled to
try that issue.

I also agree with Smith J.A. when he pointed out
in Rex v. Milina, supra, that the cases will be rare indeed in which a
magistrate will feel himself obliged to make any special inquiry when the
accused, as here, is represented by counsel; but Smith J.A. pointed out that
one of those cases may well be where “the accused may be a foreigner or
illiterate or the charge is of unusual complexity or of an unusually grave
nature”. Certainly even the reduced charge of non-capital murder was a charge
of an unusually grave nature. Moreover, the accused man, a Cree Indian, was
certainly an illiterate, an illiterate who was described by counsel to the
learned trial judge as a “primitive”.

I am of the opinion that the present case is not
one in which the learned trial judge exercised his discretion. Perhaps, to put
it more accurately, if it is such a case then it is one in which the learned
trial judge failed to exercise his discretion in accordance with judicial
principles. It would appear that the judge, in exercising the discretion to
accept the plea of guilty, relied only on the fact that the accused was
represented, and apparently very adequately represented, by counsel. I am of
the respectful opinion that he could not, under the circumstances, so rely on
counsel for in doing so he could not satisfy himself that the accused
knew either the nature of the plea or the consequences thereof. Therefore, in
failing to so satisfy himself, the learned trial judge was wrong in law.

I would grant the appeal and direct a new trial.

Appeal dismissed, SPENCE J.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR THE
NORTHWEST TERRITORIES

Criminal law—Dangerous sexual
offender—Homosexual—Preventive detention—Whether a dangerous sexual
offender—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 149, 659(b) [as enacted by
1960-61 (Can.), c. 43, s. 32], 661.

The appellant pleaded guilty to four charges
of gross indecency under s. 149 of the Criminal Code. Following the
imposition of a sentence, an application was made under s. 661 of the Criminal
Code to have him declared a dangerous sexual offender within the meaning of
s. 659(b) of the Code. The appellant’s previous record showed a
conviction some five years before on eighteen charges for similar offences. The
evidence of the two psychiatrists was to the effect that the appellant was
likely to commit further sexual offences of the same kind with other consenting
adult males, that he had never caused injury, pain or other evil to any person
and was not likely to do so in the future. The judge imposed a sentence of
preventive detention. His appeal to the Court of Appeal for the Northwest
Territories was dismissed. He was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the
following questions of law: (i) whether there was evidence that he was a person
who had shown a failure to control his sexual impulses, and (ii) whether the
evidence could support the conclusion that he had shown such a failure and was
likely to cause injury, pain or other evil to any person, through failure in
the future to control his sexual impulses or was likely to commit a further
sexual offence.

Held (Cartwright
and Hall JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux,
Judson and Spence JJ.: Under the new definition of “dangerous sexual offender”,
as enacted by 1960-61 (Can.), c. 43, s. 32,

[Page 823]

the likelihood of the commission of a further
sexual offence has been added and made an alternative element to that of the
danger of injury to others. Applied to this case, this new definition justified
the concurrent findings of the Courts below that the appellant, having shown a
failure to control his sexual impulses and that he was likely to commit further
sexual offences of the same kind, was a dangerous sexual offender within the
meaning which Parliament ascribed to this expression. The intent and object of
the provisions dealing with dangerous sexual offenders is not solely to protect
persons from becoming the victims of those whose failure to control their
sexual impulses rendered them a source of danger.

Per Cartwright
and Hall JJ., dissenting: The intent and object of the sections of
the Code dealing with dangerous sexual offenders is to protect persons from
becoming the victims of those whose failure to control their sexual impulses
renders them a source of danger. The words “a further sexual offence” are
general words wide enough to embrace every type of offence containing a sexual
element. Applying the maxim verba generalia restringuntur ad habilitatem rei
vel personae to s. 659(b) of the Code, the concluding words of
the section should be given the meaning “or is likely to commit a further
sexual offence involving an element of danger to another person”. On this view
of s. 659(b), it was clear that the finding that the appellant was
a dangerous sexual offender could not stand as it would be directly contrary to
the evidence.

décrété par 1960-61 (Can.), c. 43, art. 32], 661.

L’appelant a admis sa culpabilité sur quatre
chefs d’accusation de grossière indécence sous l’art. 149 du Code Criminel. Une
fois la sentence imposée, une demande a été présentée en vertu de l’art. 661 du
Code Criminel pour qu’il soit déclaré que l’appelant était un délinquant
sexuel dangereux dans le sens de l’art. 659(b) du Code. Le dossier
antérieur de l’appelant montrait une condamnation, quelque cinq ans plus tôt,
sur dix-huit chefs d’accusation pour des infractions semblables. Le témoignage
des deux psychiatres fut à l’effet que l’appelant commettrait vraisemblablement
d’autres infractions sexuelles de la même nature avec d’autres adultes mâles
consentants, qu’il n’avait jamais causé de lésions corporelles, douleurs ou
autre mal à quelqu’un et que vraisemblablement il n’en causerait pas à
l’avenir. Le juge a imposé une sentence de détention préventive. L’appel à la
Cour d’Appel des Territoires du Nord-Ouest a été rejeté. Il a obtenu la
permission d’en appeler devant cette Cour sur les questions de droit suivantes:
(i) Existait-il une preuve à l’effet que l’appelant était une personne ayant
manifesté une impuissance à maîtriser ses impulsions sexuelles? (ii)
Existait-il une preuve pouvant supporter la conclusion qu’il avait démontré une
telle impuissance et qu’il causerait vraisemblablement des lésions corporelles,
des douleurs ou autre mal à quelqu’un, à cause de son impuissance à l’avenir à
maîtriser ses impulsions sexuelles ou qu’il commetrait vraisemblablement une
autre infraction sexuelle?

Les Juges
Fauteux, Judson et Spence: Dans la nouvelle définition de l’expression
«délinquant sexuel dangereux» telle que décrétée par 1960-61 (Can.), c. 43,
art. 32, on a ajouté comme élément alternatif à la probabilité de lésions
corporelles à d’autres personnes, la probabilité de la commission d’une autre
infraction sexuelle. L’application de cette nouvelle définition au cas présent
justifie les conclusions concordantes des Cours inférieures à l’effet que
l’appelant, ayant démontré son impuissance à maîtriser ses impulsions sexuelles
et que vraisemblablement il commettrait d’autres infractions sexuelles de la
même nature, était un délinquant sexuel dangereux dans le sens que le Parlement
a attribué à cette expression. L’intention et le but des dispositions se
rapportant aux délinquants sexuels dangereux n’est pas seulement d’empêcher les
autres de devenir les victimes de ceux dont l’impuissance à maîtriser leurs
impulsions sexuelles en fait une source de danger.

Les Juges
Cartwright et Hall, dissidents: L’intention et le but des articles du
Code se rapportant aux délinquants sexuels dangereux est d’empêcher les autres
de devenir les victimes de ceux dont l’impuissance à maîtriser leurs impulsions
sexuelles en fait une source de danger. Les mots «une autre infraction
sexuelle» sont des mots au sens général et ayant une portée assez grande pour
englober toute offense ayant un élément sexuel. Appliquant la maxime verba
generalia restringuntur ad habilitatem rei vel personae à l’art. 659(b)
du Code, on doit donner aux derniers mots de l’article la signification «ou qui
commettrait vraisemblablement une autre infraction sexuelle comportant un
élément de danger pour une autre personne». Si l’on interprète l’art. 659(b)
de cette manière, il est clair que la conclusion que l’appellant était un
délinquant sexuel dangereux ne peut pas être maintenue puisqu’elle serait
directement en conflit avec la preuve.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’Appel des
Territoires du Nord-Ouest, confirmant une sentence de détention préventive. Appel rejeté, les Juges Cartwright et Hall étant dissidents.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for the Northwest Territories, affirming a sentence of preventive detention.
Appeal dismissed, Cartwright and Hall JJ. dissenting.

B.A. Crane, for the appellant.

John A. Scollin, for the respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright and Hall JJ. was
delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—This is an
appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories
pronounced on October 26, 1966, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Sissons
J. pronounced on March 9, 1966, finding that the appellant was a dangerous
sexual offender within the meaning of the Criminal Code

[Page 825]

and imposing a sentence of preventive detention
upon him in lieu of the sentences imposed by Magistrate Parker to be mentioned
hereafter.

The appeal to this Court was by leave granted on
March 22, 1967, under the provisions of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act,
R.S.C. 1952, c. 259. The order of this Court granted leave to appeal on the
following questions of law:

(1) Whether there was evidence before
Mr. Justice Sissons that Klippert was a person who had shown a failure to
control his sexual impulses.

(2) Whether the evidence before
Mr. Justice Sissons can support the conclusion that the accused “has shown
a failure to control his sexual impulses and is likely to cause injury, pain or
other evil to any person, through failure in the future to control his sexual impulses
or is likely to commit a further sexual offence”.

The facts are not in dispute and may be stated
briefly.

On the morning of August 16, 1965, the appellant
was arrested by the R.C.M.P. at Pine Point, N.W.T., as a result of an
investigation with respect to a charge of arson (in which he was not involved).
In the evening of August 16 he was taken to Hay River after he had given the
police a statement. On August 17 the accused was arraigned before Magistrate
Parker on four charges of gross indecency under s. 149 of the Criminal
Code as follows:

1. That Everett George Klippert, mechanic’s
helper of Pine Point, Northwest Territories, between the 21st day of December,
1964 and the 6th day of August 1965 at or near the settlement of Pine Point in
the Northwest Territories, being a male person, did unlawfully commit an act of
gross indecency with William Gordon Mellett, another male person, contrary to
Section 149 of the Criminal Code.

2. That Everett George Klippert, mechanic’s
helper of Pine Point, Northwest Territories, between the 1st day of May, 1965
and the 15th day of July, 1965, at or near the settlement of Pine Point in the
Northwest Territories, being a male person, did unlawfully commit an act of
gross indecency with Patrick Betty, another male person, contrary to Section
149 of the Criminal Code.

3. That Everett George Klippert, mechanic’s
helper of Pine Point, Northwest Territories, between the 10th day of July,
1965, and the 31st day of July, 1965, at or near the settlement of Pine Point
in the Northwest Territories, being a male person, did unlawfully commit an act
of gross indecency with David Frank L’Heureux, another male person, contrary to
Section 149 of the Criminal Code.

4. That Everett George Klippert, mechanic’s
helper of Pine Point, Northwest Territories, between the 1st day of July, 1965
and the 10th day of August, 1965, at or near the settlement of Pine Point in
the Northwest Territories, being a male person, did unlawfully commit an act of
gross indecency with Christopher Logan Wolff, another male person, contrary to
Section 149 of the Criminal Code.

[Page 826]

Pleas of guilty were entered to each charge and
the appellant was remanded in custody until August 24, 1965, at Fort Smith, at
which time Magistrate Parker imposed a sentence of three years concurrent with
respect to each charge.

Following such conviction and sentence a notice
of application under s. 661 of the Criminal Code to have the
appellant declared a dangerous sexual offender was served on him. The appellant
was examined by two psychiatrists on behalf of the Crown, Dr. Donald
Griffith McKerracher, nominated by the Attorney General pursuant to
s. 661(2) of the Criminal Code, and Dr. Ian McLaren McDonald.

The application was heard before Sissons J. The
Crown proved the four convictions before Magistrate Parker. Corporal Armstrong
of the R.C.M.P., who had laid the information and had been present at the trial
before the Magistrate, identified the appellant as the person convicted but was
not asked by either counsel for the Crown or for the defence for any
particulars of the offences to which the appellant had pleaded guilty. Corporal
Armstrong produced the fingerprints and fingerprint certificates of the
appellant which included a record of his conviction on May 4, 1960, on eighteen
charges of gross indecency contrary to s. 149 of the Criminal Code on
which he was sentenced to four years imprisonment on each charge, the sentences
to run concurrently.

No evidence was adduced as to the nature of the
acts committed by the appellant in respect of either the four substantive
charges to which he had pleaded guilty before Magistrate Parker or the eighteen
other charges upon which he had been convicted in 1960.

The Crown called the evidence of the two
psychiatrists mentioned above, each of whom gave evidence as to, inter alia,
statements made to him by the appellant during his examination.

It was held by this Court in Wilband v. The
Queen[1], that a
psychiatrist acting pursuant to s. 661(2) of the Criminal Code is
not a person in authority to whom the rule as to proof by the Crown of the
voluntary nature of a statement applies and no question is raised as to the
admissibility of any of the evidence which these two witnesses gave.

[Page 827]

The effect of their evidence is shown by the
following extracts.

Dr. Donald Griffith McKerracher testified:

He (the appellant) did say that he had had
homosexual activities at the age of 15 for the first time;…

* *
*

Further that he had not married; that
sexual behaviour, homosexual behaviour had existed since the age of 15; that to
him homosexual activity provided his only satisfactory method of the release of
sexual tensions. It was his only satisfactory sexual outlet. He found the
thought of heterosexual conduct abhorrent. He told me he never had had
heterosexual relations, that during 24 years of fairly active homosexual
practice he had many partners whose ages varied from the middle teens to 30 or
35. He obtained his sexual partners through previous contacts through some,
what I would judge, was discreet soliciting because others in the same pattern
of behaviour would, one would judge, be tending to make contacts too. There was
no suggestion whatsoever of any violence at any time; that he was most
co-operative throughout the interview, restrained in manner, courteous,
coherent, relevant and frank.

* *
*

Q. What are your conclusions from those
observations?

A. Well in the first place my opinion is
that Mr. Klippert is not inhibited, let us put it this way, his sexual
drive is not inhibited and it is my opinion based on my experience with others
with similar patterns of conduct that he would have difficulty in inhibiting
them in the future.

* *
*

DR. McKERRACHER: Yes. My conclusion was in
terms of this pattern of sexual behaviour that he would have the same drive—a
drive toward homosexual relations in the future that he had had in the past. I
also concluded that in my opinion there was no danger, this is strictly my
opinion, of him doing physical violence or injury to anyone. He did not fit
that pattern. If I might put it the same way, if I might make an analogy with
the heterosexual activity of a man with heterosexual drives he will continue to
seek heterosexual outlets for those drives, some men would do it violently,
some would not. I did not feel the accused showed any evidence that he would
behave in a violent fashion.

* *
*

Q. On the question of his sexual conduct in
the past what are you able to conclude from that?

A. I conclude—it is based on a homosexual
pattern and has been since he was sexually active.

Q. Has he been able to control this?

A. No—I would put it inhibit. He has not
inhibited these drives.

Q. Now as to…

THE COURT: Just to make it clear what do
you mean by “not inhibited”? A. The drive is a desire, to inhibit it is to
refuse to follow the desire. It is like a heterosexual drive—most people do not
inhibit their heterosexual drives, they follow their drives, the impulse is a
drive to seek heterosexual relief.

Dr. Ian McLaren McDonald testified:

Q. And what information did you receive on
those points? A. He informed me that he had pleaded guilty to four charges of

[Page 828]

having engaged in homosexual activity; that
he was sentenced in August of 1965. He told me that this was the second
sentence for similar behaviour. He told me that he had engaged in homosexual
activity since the age of 14 or 15. He told me that the people with whom he
engaged in these activities ranged in age from 15 to the mid or late 30’s. The
15 year old, he said, took part in an incident when he was 17 or 18. He had
little or no heterosexual experience, certainly no complete heterosexual
experience never having completed a sexual act with a female. He said that he
had no desire to partake in heterosexual activity. He said this filled him with
revulsion, as I believe his words were “some people are revolted at the idea of
having homosexual relations while I am revolted at the idea of having
heterosexual relations”. He stated that he had engaged in homosexual activity
actively when he started work in the dairy in Calgary which would be about the
age of 16 or 17; that he had continued this up until his being confined to the
penitentiary I believe in 1960. Having been discharged from the penitentiary he
was aware of the need to refrain from engaging in this behaviour again. He
stated that some attempt, some contacts had been made with him by ex-friends
and for this reason, as well as the feeling of his continued presence bringing
shame on his family, he decided to leave Calgary and head North.

He acknowledged that he had been warned, or
at least a discussion had taken place between himself and a member of the
Mounted Police Force at Pine Point some time in the summer of 1964, the
implication being that his record was known and that he should more or less
watch his behaviour. He said he was able to do this until these events
transpired of which he was charged and sentenced.

In describing his behaviour, his homosexual
behaviour, he said first of all that he was very careful of the person whom he
approached, he was very careful to ascertain whether or not they preferred
heterosexual outlets and if they did then he didn’t make an overture. If they
were ambivalent, that is they had no strong feelings one way or the other then
he would make some overtures, generally conversationally. He denied ever having
physically assaulted or coerced any of these people he engaged in these
pursuits. He acknowledged that in the past he had a good number of short term
affairs. These were not lasting relationships.

Q. Short term affairs with whom? A. The
men. He also stated that he denied having any preference for young men, his
preference was for people who were responsive, that is people who shared his
enthusiasm about the endeavour. As a result of this information that he told
me, and based on past experience with people who have presented this kind of
sexual behaviour pattern I came to the conclusion that Mr. Klippert was (a)
primarily and essentially a homosexual, that this was the prime outlet for
sexual drives (b) I thought it unlikely that he could refrain from
indulging in this behaviour again without assistance, that is assistance from
other people, trained people. I felt that this man was not the type who would
physically injure or coerce people to take part in these activities.

Q. Dr. McDonald then on the point of
past sexual conduct and the question of control, briefly what can you tell us
about his control from his past conduct? Does he have control, I mean can

[Page 829]

he stop, as indicated from his past
conduct? A. He obviously cannot stop for long periods of time on past
performance, on his own.

I have perhaps quoted at unnecessary length from
the evidence of these witnesses as it is clear from reading their testimony as
a whole that in the opinion of each of them there was no danger of the
appellant using violence of any sort or attempting coercion of anyone. They do
not suggest that he sought out youthful partners for his misconduct. What they
did foresee was the likelihood of the appellant committing further acts of
gross indecency with other consenting adult males.

The question before us is whether on this state
of facts the finding that the appellant is a dangerous sexual offender can be
sustained in law.

In the case of an application under s. 661
of the Criminal Code the onus lies upon the Crown to establish beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused is a dangerous sexual offender. In the case
at bar not only is there no evidence that the accused if at liberty would
constitute a danger to any person but the evidence of the two psychiatrists,
quoted from and summarized above, expressly negatives the existence of any such
danger. This would be an end of the matter if it were not for the definition of
the phrase “dangerous sexual offender” contained in s. 659 which reads as
follows:

659. In this Part,…

(b) “dangerous sexual offender”
means a person who, by his conduct in any sexual matter, has shown a failure to
control his sexual impulses, and who is likely to cause injury, pain or other
evil to any person, through failure in the future to control his sexual
impulses or is likely to commit a further sexual offence.

For the purposes of this appeal I will assume
that the evidence in the record was sufficient to support a finding that the
accused has shown a failure to control his sexual impulses and that, if at
liberty, he is likely to commit a further sexual offence of the same sort as
those to which he pleaded guilty; there is not a tittle of evidence to suggest
that he is likely to commit any other type of sexual offence.

In construing the definition of “dangerous
sexual offender” it must be borne in mind that by the combined effect of
s. 2(2), s. 2(3) and s. 2(1)(a)(i) and (ii) of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 158, s. 659(b) of the

[Page 830]

Criminal Code must
be read as if it concluded with the words “except in so far as this definition
is inconsistent with the intent or object of this Part or would give to the
expression ‘dangerous sexual offender’ an interpretation inconsistent with the
context”.

The intent and object of those sections in
the Criminal Code which deal with dangerous sexual offenders is to
protect persons from becoming the victims of those whose failure to control
their sexual impulses renders them a source of danger. To construe the
definition as compelling the Court to impose a sentence of preventive detention
on a person shown by the evidence led by the Crown not to be a source of danger
would be to give it an effect inconsistent with the intent or object of the
Part.

The words “a further sexual offence” are general
words wide enough to embrace every type of offence containing a sexual element
and in construing them resort may properly be had to the maxim verba
generalia restringuntur ad habilitatem rei vel personae (Bac. Max. reg.
10). The following statement, now found in Maxwell on Interpretation of
Statutes, 11th ed., at pages 58 and 59, is supported by the authorities cited
and has often been quoted with approval:

It is in the interpretation of general
words and phrases that the principle of strictly adapting the meaning to the
particular subject-matter with reference to which the words are used finds its
most frequent application. However wide in the abstract, they are more or less
elastic, and admit of restriction or expansion to suit the subject-matter.
While expressing truly enough all that the legislature intended, they
frequently express more in their literal meaning and natural force; and it is
necessary to give them the meaning which best suits the scope and object of the
statute without extending to ground foreign to the intention. It is, therefore,
a canon of interpretation that all words, if they be general and not express
and precise, are to be restricted to the fitness of the matter. They are to be
construed as particular if the intention be particular; that is, they must be
understood as used with reference to the subject-matter in the mind of the
legislature, and limited to it.

A case often referred to on this point is Cox
v. Hakes[2], in
which it was held by the House of Lords that the following words in s. 19
of the Judicature Act, 36 & 37 Vict., c. 66: “The said Court of
Appeal shall have jurisdiction and power to hear and determine appeals from any
judgment or order of Her Majesty’s High Court of Justice or any Judges or Judge
thereof” did not confer jurisdiction to hear an appeal from an order
discharging a prisoner

[Page 831]

under a habeas corpus although such an
order fell plainly within the literal meaning of the words of the enactment.

Applying this principle to s. 659(b)
it is my opinion that the concluding words “or is likely to commit a further
sexual offence” should be given the meaning “or is likely to commit a further
sexual offence involving an element of danger to another person”.

If this is the right construction of
s. 659(b), as I think it is, it is clear that the finding that the
appellant is a dangerous sexual offender cannot stand; it would be directly
contrary to the evidence.

I am glad to arrive at this result. It would be
with reluctance and regret that I would have found myself compelled by the
words used to impute to Parliament the intention of enacting that the words
“dangerous sexual offender” shall include in their meaning “a sexual offender
who is not dangerous”.

Before parting with the matter I wish to mention
a further consideration which is not, I think, irrelevant in seeking to
ascertain the intention of Parliament. It is not wholesome that the existing
criminal law should not be enforced. A law which ought not to be enforced
should be repealed. If the law on this subject matter is as interpreted by the
Courts below, it means that every man in Canada who indulges in sexual
misconduct of the sort forbidden by s. 149 of the Criminal Code with
another consenting adult male and who appears likely, if at liberty, to
continue such misconduct should be sentenced to preventive detention, that is
to incarceration for life. However loathsome conduct of the sort mentioned may
appear to all normal persons, I think it improbable that Parliament should have
intended such a result. It may be that we cannot take judicial notice of the
probable effect which such an interpretation would have on the numbers of those
confined to penitentiaries; no one, I think, would quarrel with the suggestion
that it would bring about serious overcrowding.

I would allow the appeal and quash the sentence
of preventive detention.

The judgment of Fauteux, Judson and Spence JJ.
was delivered by

FAUTEUX J.:—The circumstances giving rise to
this appeal can be briefly stated. In August 1965, the appellant

[Page 832]

pleaded guilty before Magistrate Parker on four
charges under s. 149 of the Criminal Code, namely gross indecency,
and on August 24, he was sentenced to three years concurrent with respect to
each charge. On an application, subsequently made under s. 661 Cr. C.,
before Sissons J., he was declared a dangerous sexual offender within
the meaning of s. 659(b) of the Criminal Code, Being of the
view that a penitentiary term would be harmful rather than beneficial to the
appellant, the learned judge sentenced him to preventive detention,—a detention
for an indeterminate period—cf. 659(c), in lieu of the sentence of three
years in penitentiary imposed by Magistrate Parker, and recommended to the
Minister of Justice to review the case of the appellant, at the earliest
possible moment, and that he be released on licence on condition that he submit
himself to such treatment which, in the opinion of psychiatrists, could be
helpful to him.

An appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice
Sissons was launched and was, ultimately, unanimously dismissed by the Court of
Appeal for the North West Territories.

Leave to appeal to this Court was thereafter
sought and granted on the two following questions of law:

(i) Whether there was evidence before
Mr. Justice Sissons that Klippert was a person who had shown a failure to
control his sexual impulses.

(ii) Whether the evidence before
Mr. Justice Sissons can support the conclusion that the accused has shown
a failure to control his sexual impulses and is likely to cause injury, pain or
other evil to any person, through failure in the future to control his sexual
impulses or is likely to commit a further sexual offence.

The evidence before Sissons J. consists of the
four convictions before Magistrate Parker, a conviction in 1960 on eighteen
charges for similar offences—for which appellant was sentenced to four years’
imprisonment with respect to each charge, sentences to run concurrently,—and,
as required by s. 661(2), the evidence of two qualified psychiatrists,
namely Dr. Donald Griffith McKerracher and Dr. Ian McLaren McDonald.
The substance of the evidence of these doctors appears in the excerpts from
their testimony, quoted in the reasons for judgment of my brother Cartwright.
Considered as a whole, the evidence reasonably indicates that the appellant is
a person who, by his conduct in sexual matters, has shown a failure to control

[Page 833]

his sexual impulses and that he is likely to
commit further sexual offences of the same kind, though, he never did cause
injury, pain or other evil to any person and is not likely to do so in the
future through his failure to control his sexual impulses.

On this state of facts, the determination of the
questions of law mentioned above, depends on the meaning given by Parliament to
the expression dangerous sexual offender.

Part XXI of the Criminal Code, which
deals with Preventive Detention, contains its own interpretation provisions in
s. 659. Section 659(b) defines dangerous sexual offender as
follows:

659. In this Part,

(a)…

(b) “dangerous sexual offender”
means a person who, (i) by his conduct in any sexual matter, has shown a
failure to control his sexual impulses, and (ii) who (a) is likely
to cause injury, pain or other evil to any person, through failure in the
future to control his sexual impulses or (b) is likely to commit a
further sexual offence, and

(c)…

Underlining, numerals and letters have been
added to point out the necessary or alternative constituent elements in the
definition.

This is a new definition. It was enacted by
Parliament in 1961, by 9-10 Elizabeth II, c. 43, s. 32, of which the
opening words are:

32. Paragraph (b) of
section 659 of the said Act is repealed and the following substituted
therefor:

Prior to this change, s. 659(b)
read:

659. In this Part,

(a)…

(b) “criminal sexual psychopath”
means a person who, (i) by a course of misconduct in sexual matters, has
shown a lack of power to control his sexual impulses and who (ii) as a
result is likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, pain or other evil on
any person.

Underlining and numerals have been added to
point out the necessary constituent elements in this former definition.

Thus, it appears that, under the new definition,
(i) the element of psychological ability to control has been replaced by that
of a straight factual investigation and (ii) the likelihood of the commission
of a further sexual offence, has been added and made an alternative element to
that of the danger of injury to others.

[Page 834]

Applied to this case, the new definition
justifies the concurrent finding of the Courts below, that the appellant who,
on the evidence, (i) has shown a failure to control his sexual impulses and
(ii) is likely to commit further sexual offences of the same kind, is a dangerous
sexual offender within the meaning which Parliament itself ascribed to this
expression.

During the hearing of this appeal, reference was
made to a certain part of the French version of the former and of the new
definition and some reliance appears to have been placed, by counsel for the
appellant, on a lack of difference between the two texts to support the
contention that the psychological ability to control has not been replaced by a
straight factual investigation and is still a constituent element in the
definition. The part of the definition to which we were referred reads as
follows:

in the former definition:

“…qui, d’après son inconduite en matière
sexuelle, a manifesté une impuissance à maîtriser ses impulsions sexuelles…”

and in the new definition:

“…qui, d’après sa conduite en matière
sexuelle, a manifesté une impuissance à maîtriser ses impulsions sexuelles…”

Both texts are obviously identical in substance.
In my opinion, this, in no way, supports the proposition contended for by the
appellant. We are not dealing here with a situation where each of the English
and of the French text is capable of assisting the other, in a matter of
interpretation, but with a situation where one has to elect between either the
English text, which manifests the actual intervention of Parliament to change
the existing law with respect to one of the constituent elements in the
definition, or the French text, which is indicative of no change at all. In Blackford
v. McBain[3],
Taschereau J., as he then was, disposed of a similar question by ignoring the
version which left the law in the state in which it was, prior to the Act
adopted to change it, cf. p. 275. Indeed, to give priority to the French
version would, in this case, render the change made in the English version
meaningless and the actual intervention of Parliament, to make this change,
futile.

With deference, I cannot either agree with the
view that the intent and object of the provisions dealing with dan-

[Page 835]

gerous sexual offenders, is solely to protect persons from becoming the victims of those
whose failure to control their sexual impulses renders them a source of danger
and that to apply the definition to a person, who is not to be a source of
danger, would give the definition an effect inconsistent with the intent or
object of these provisions. Obviously, the intent and object of an Act is to be
found in its provisions and, in the case of this particular legislation, the
provisions which are relevant in this respect are those of s. 659—the
interpretation section—and those of s. 661—the operative section. Section
659(b), as above indicated, clearly added, as an alternative element in
the definition to the danger of injury to others, that of the likelihood of the
commission of a further sexual offence, and a consideration of s. 661
shows that the operative provisions are only consistent with this view of the
matter. Section 661 reads as follows:

661. (1) Where an accused has been
convicted of

(a) an offence under

(i) section 136,

(ii) section 138,

(iii) section 141,

(iv) section 147,

(v) section 148, or

(vi) section 149; or

(b) an attempt to commit an offence
under a provision mentioned in paragraph (a),

the court shall, upon application, hear
evidence as to whether the accused is a dangerous sexual offender.

(2) On the hearing of an application under
subsection (1) the court shall hear any relevant evidence, and shall hear
the evidence of at least two psychiatrists, one of whom shall be nominated by
the Attorney General.

(3) Where the court finds that the accused
is a dangerous sexual offender it shall, notwithstanding anything in this Act
or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, impose upon the accused a
sentence of preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that might be
imposed for the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed for such
offence, or in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such offence if
the sentence has expired.

(4) At the hearing of an application under
subsection (1), the accused is entitled to be present.

In some of the offences referred to in
s. 661(1)(a), such as rape, indecent assault on female, indecent
assault on male, violence is involved to a variable degree as an element of
the offence. In others, such as sexual intercourse with a female under 14,
sexual intercourse with a female between

[Page 836]

14 and 16, buggery and gross indecency, violence is not an element of the
offence. Particularly, the offence of gross indecency, in which appellant has
indulged, is one which necessarily implies consent of the person which must
participate with the accused for its commission and one which excludes danger
of injury to the participants. With respect to the offences of the first
category, it may well be said that the object and intent of Parliament is, as
indicated by my brother Cartwright, to protect persons from becoming the
victims of those whose failure to control their sexual impulses renders them a
source of danger, but, in my respectful view, the same thing cannot be said
with respect to the offences of the second category which also includes the
offence of bestiality. The language of s. 661 is clear; if an
accused is convicted of one of the offences mentioned in the section, be that
one of the first or of the second category, the Court shall, upon application,
hear evidence and decide whether the accused is a person who, (i) by his
conduct, has shown a failure to control his sexual impulses, and (ii) who (a)
is either likely to cause injury, pain or other evil to any person through his
failure in the future to control his sexual impulses or (b) is likely to
commit a further sexual offence. The general words further sexual offence are
clearly embracing the offences mentioned in s. 661(1) of which, as above
indicated, many exclude, as being one of their constituent elements, a source
of danger of injury to other persons.

I would, therefore, affirmatively answer the two
questions of law upon which leave to appeal was granted.

Whether the criminal law, with respect to sexual
misconduct of the sort in which appellant has indulged for nearly twenty-five
years, should be changed to the extent to which it has been recently in
England, by the Sexual Offences Act 1967, c. 60, is obviously not for us
to say; our jurisdiction is to interpret and apply laws validly enacted.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Disorderly houses—Keeper of common bawdy
house—No evidence of prior use of
house as such—Whether accused properly
convicted—Criminal Code, 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, s. 168.

As a result of a sexual
proposition by telephone made by a police agent provocateur, the appellant
arranged to procure another girl who would make arrangements for a suitable
place of assignation where both could entertain the caller and three male
friends, also police officers. The appellant met the police officers at an
agreed location and under her direction they drove to the home of her confederate.
There, they were told that the confederate intended to take them to another
house as soon as a telephone call, which she was expecting, confirmed the
arrangements she had already made. Eventually, a telephone call came and the
confederate was heard to say “leave the front door open”. The men and the two girls then drove
to a private home in a suburban residential area, the owner of which was not
disclosed in the record. Money exchanged hands and after the girls had removed
some of their clothing, they were arrested. There was no evidence in the record
that the home had ever been used for the purpose of prostitution or the
practice of acts of indecency. It had no such reputation nor was there any
evidence of undue traffic to or from the premises. The appellant was convicted
of keeping a common bawdy house, and her conviction was affirmed by a majority
judgment in the Court of Appeal. An appeal was launched to this Court.

Held: The appeal should
be allowed and a verdict of acquittal entered.

To obtain a conviction of
keeping a common bawdy house, the Crown must prove that there had been a
frequent or habitual use of a place for the purpose of prostitution. There was
no such evidence in this case nor was there any evidence upon which the
magistrate could properly base an inference that the place had been habitually
so used.

Droit criminel—Maisons de désordre—Tenancier de maison de
débauche—Aucune preuve que la maison
utilisée antérieurement à ces fins—Verdict
de culpabilité peut-il être soutenu—Code
criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 168.

A la suite d’un appel téléphonique d’un officier de police, un
agent provocateur, aux fins de rapports sexuels illicites, l’appelante a convenu d’embaucher une autre fille
qui ferait des arrangements pour obtenir un local où les deux filles pourraient
recevoir celui qui téléphonait ainsi que trois amis, aussi des officiers de
police. L’appelante a rencontré les
officiers de police à l’endroit convenu et, sous sa
direction, ils se sont tous dirigés en automobile à la maison de l’autre fille. A cet endroit,
on leur a dit que cette fille avait l’intention de les amener à une autre
maison dès qu’elle aurait reçu un appel
téléphonique confirmant les








[Page 158]

arrangements qu’elle avait faits
antérieurement. Éventuellement, l’appel téléphonique a été reçu et on
entendit la fille demander de laisser la porte d’en avant ouverte. Les hommes et les
deux filles se sont alors dirigés en automobile vers une maison privée dans un
quartier résidentiel de banlieue. Le nom du propriétaire de cette maison n’apparaît pas au dossier.
Les officiers ont donné de l’argent aux filles et après que ces dernières eurent
enlevé quelques-uns de leurs vêtements, elles furent mises sous arrêt. Il n’y avait aucune preuve dans
le dossier que la maison avait en aucun temps servi à des fins de prostitution
ou pour la pratique d’actes d’indécence. La maison n’avait pas cette réputation
et il n’y avait aucune preuve d’entrées ou de sorties
inusitées. L’appelante a été trouvée
coupable d’avoir été la tenancière d’une maison de débauche, et
le verdict de culpabilité a été confirmé par un jugement majoritaire en Cour d’Appel. Un appel a été logé
devant cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel doit être maintenu et
une déclaration de non culpabilité doit être enregistrée.

Pour obtenir une
déclaration de culpabilité d’avoir été le tenancier d’une maison de débauche, la Couronne
doit prouver que le local a été employé fréquemment ou habituellement à des
fins de prostitution. Il n’y avait aucune telle preuve dans le dossier et il n’y avait non plus aucune
preuve sur laquelle le juge aurait pu baser à bon droit une inférence que le
local avait été employé habituellement à de telles fins.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’Appel de l’Ontario[1], confirmant une déclaration
de culpabilité. Appel
maintenu.

APPEAL from a
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, affirming the
conviction of the appellant. Appeal allowed.

John F. Hamilton, for the appellant.

C.J. Meinhardt, for the respondent.



The judgment of the Court was
delivered by



SPENCE J.:—This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario1 delivered on January 5, 1967, whereby that Court
dismissed the appeal from the conviction of the accused on February 8, 1966, by
a police magistrate. The accused was charged with unlawfully keeping a common
bawdy house, situate and known as 43 Harding Boulevard.

[Page 159]



In the Court of
Appeal for Ontario, MacKay J.A., with whom Porter C.J.O. concurred, gave
reasons for dismissing the appeal and Schroeder J.A. gave reasons for allowing
the appeal and quashing the conviction. The facts were accurately stated in
considerable detail in the judgment of Schroeder J.A. as follows:










On December 2,
1966 (sic-a, misprint for 1965) a morality squad officer of the
Metropolitan Toronto Police Department, Detective John Leybourne, telephoned
the appellant, using an assumed name, and made an instigative sexual
proposition to her. In the result, it was arranged that she should procure
another girl who would make arrangements for a suitable place of assignation
where both could satisfy the sexual appetites of the agent provocateur and of
three male friends (fellow officers of the morality squad but not so made known
to the appellant).



Subsequently
Detective Leybourne and two fellow detectives, all attired in plain clothes,
met the appellant at an agreed location on Bloor Street, and under her
direction they drove to the home of her confederate, one Beverley Dixon. Upon
their arrival Dixon informed them that she intended to take them to another
house and was awaiting a telephone call to confirm the plans which she had set
afoot. A call eventually came and in responding to it Dixon was heard to say “leave the front door open”.



The three
detectives and the two girls then repaired to a suburban home in a quiet
residential section of Richmond Hill, known and described for municipal
purposes as 43 Harding Boulevard. The record discloses nothing as to the
identity of the owner or occupant of that property.



Detective
Leybourne had given the appellant $75 as compensation for the favours to be
bestowed upon him and his two companions and an additional $10 to pay for the
use of the premises. After their arrival the appellant and her female companion
repaired to another part of the house, and later returned to the presence of
the detectives wearing nothing but their under-garments. At this point the
three police officers disclosed their identity and after Detective Leybourne
had repossessed himself of the $85 previously paid to the appellant he charged
her and her companion with the offence out of which the present appeal arises.

[Page 160]



Beverley Dixon,
who had made the necessary arrangements for the use of the Harding Boulevard
premises, was acquitted by the Magistrate and a conviction was entered against
the appellant only.










There is not the
remotest suggestion in the record that house number 43 Harding Boulevard in
Richmond Hill, a private residence in a quiet and respectable residential
subdivision, had ever been used by the appellant or any other person for the
purpose of prostitution or the practice of acts of indecency. No evidence was
adduced as to any undue traffic to and from the said premises which would
reflect prejudicially upon the reputation of the house or its occupants. The
only evidence offered was that of the three detectives which undoubtedly proved
the intent of the appellant and her co-accused to commit an act of prostitution
with these witnesses at the place in question.



The appellant has
stated the points at issue in this appeal as follows:



1. Did the Court
of Appeal for Ontario err in finding 43 Harding Boulevard was a common bawdy
house?



2. Did the Court
of Appeal for Ontario err in holding that the appellant was the keeper of a
common bawdy house, pursuant to s. 168 of the Criminal Code?



The majority in
the Court of Appeal found that the premises at 43 Harding Boulevard were a
common bawdy house and that the appellant was the keeper thereof. Schroeder
J.A., dissenting, was of the opinion that the premises were not a common bawdy
house and that the appellant was not the keeper thereof. I am of the opinion
that this appeal may be disposed of by considering the first question only and
I have come to the conclusion for the reasons which I shall outline that the
premises were not a common bawdy house within the meaning of those words as
used in s. 168 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, as Roach J.A. said in
giving judgment for the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. King[2]:



Since
this place was not a common bawdy house, it is irrelevant who the keeper was.

[Page 161]



Section
168 of the Criminal Code provides in subs. (1), paras. (b), (h),
and (i):



168.
(1) In this Part,



(b)
“common bawdy house” means a place that is



(i)
kept or occupied, or



(ii)
resorted to by one or more persons for the purpose of prostitution or the
practice of   acts of indecency;

* * *



(h)
“keeper” includes a person who



(i)
is an owner or occupier of a place,










(ii)
assists or acts on behalf of an owner or occupier of a place,



(iii)
appears to be, or to assist or act on behalf of an owner or occupier of a
place,



(iv)
has the care or management of a place,



or



(v)
Uses a place permanently or temporarily, with or without the consent of the
owner or occupier; and



(i)
“place” includes any place,
whether or not



(i)
it is covered or enclosed,



(ii)
it is used permanently or temporarily,



or



(iii)
any person has an exclusive right of user with respect to it.



Schroeder
J.A. was of the opinion that the words “kept or occupied” and the words “resorted to” as used in s. 168(1) (b)
(i) and (ii) connote a frequent or habitual use of the premises for the
purposes of prostitution. I am in accord with that view. I have considered all
the cases cited and I have noted that there has been evidence, in each case
where conviction has resulted, of one of three types,



firstly,
there has
been actual evidence of the continued and habitual use of the premises for
prostitution as in The King v. Cohen[3] and Rex v. Miket[4],



secondly,
there has
been evidence of the reputation in the neighbourhood of the premises as a
common bawdy house, or



thirdly,
there has
been evidence of such circumstances as to make the inference that the premises
were resorted to habitually as a place of prostitution, a proper inference for
the court to draw from such evidence.



Examples
of the latter are, particularly, Rex v. Davidson[5], where Stewart J.A.
giving judgment for the majority of the Court said at p. 54:



It
might very well happen that a clerk in a hotel who had become friendly with a
man, a guest or inmate or a regular customer of the hotel,

[Page 162] 










might,
on receiving a wink, shut his eyes to his friend’s proposed escapade and allow him to
take a woman to his room on one occasion without protest, and yet not be guilty
at all of habitually allowing any casual guest to do so.



And at
p. 55:



The
way in which the whole thing happened was such that the magistrate might quite
properly infer that it was not an isolated instance but rather a matter of
course and of custom or habit. Moreover, I think the decision in Rex v.
James, 25 Can. Cr. Cas. 23, 25 D.L.R. 476, 9 A.L.R. 66, 9 W.W.R.
235, went upon the same principle, viz., that the existence of a habit or
custom of doing a certain thing might be inferred from the circumstances
surrounding the doing and the manner of doing or even of offering to do that
thing on a single occasion.



This
is sufficient to sustain the conviction and the motion should, therefore, be
dismissed with costs.



It
was admitted that though the accused was only a night clerk he came within the
definition of a “keeper” given in sec. 228(2) of
the Code.



Also,
in Rex v. Clay[6], Bissonnette J. said at p.
40:



As
a general rule, proof of an isolated act of prostitution cannot suffice to
establish the offence of keeping a disorderly house. But if, from circumstances
surrounding the evidence of this isolated act, a certainty arises that this
house is habitually used for purposes of prostitution, the magistrate is
thereupon justified in not requiring direct proof of the bad reputation or
delictual character of this house.



It
would therefore appear that the element of habitual or frequent use of the
place will remain the necessary interpretation of proof despite the amendment
of the definition of “common bawdy house” to add the words “resorted to by one or more
persons” and in fact that the word “resorted” itself has been relied
upon to support the view that such habitual or frequent use of a place is
required. (See Rex v. Davidson, supra). So in cases where the Crown has
failed to prove a habitual or frequent use of a place for the purposes of
prostitution, the conviction has not been upheld. In Rex v. King, supra, Roach
J.A. said at p.325:



It
was not a place kept or occupied or resorted to by one or more persons for the
purposes of prostitution or the practice of acts of indecency. The authorities
make it clear that to come within that definition the place must be one that is
habitually so kept or resorted to.



I echo
the words of Hanrahan P.M., in Rex v. Martin[7], when he said:



It
is true convictions have been registered and sustained on appeal on evidence of
a single act of prostitution, but always in such cases the

[Page 163]










surrounding
circumstances established the premises had been habitually used for such a
purpose and in most cases had acquired such a reputation in the community.



As I
have said, there was no evidence in the present case of any reputation in the
community and there was no evidence of the use of the premises for prostitution
on any other occasion than the one which was the subject of this prosecution.
There was moreover no evidence upon which the learned magistrate properly could
base an inference that the place had been habitually so used.



I would
allow the appeal, quash the conviction, and direct a verdict of acquittal.

Appeal allowed,
conviction quashed and verdict of acquittal directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Fraud—Real estate
transaction—Lawyer for vendor acting also for purchaser—Existence of second
mortgage not disclosed to purchaser—Whether case correctly put to jury—Criminal
Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 323(1).

The appellant, a lawyer, was convicted by a
jury of having defrauded O by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means,
contrary to s. 323(1) of the Criminal Code. The appellant, who was
engaged on a monthly fee basis by the vendors, represented also the purchaser O
in a transaction in respect of the sale of a motel. The evidence was that the
appellant had failed to disclose to O the existence of an outstanding second
mortgage on the property. The Crown contended that this failure constituted
fraud within the meaning of s. 323(1) of the Code. The accused admitted
that he knew of this second mortgage but that his failure to inform the
purchaser was due to inadvertence on his part and without any intent to
defraud. It was conceded that the accused did not personally profit from the
alleged fraud. In his charge to the jury, the trial judge said that the
evidence, if believed, was that a false statement had been made by the accused
to the purchaser. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed. The accused
was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and the appellant acquitted.

[Page 23]

The trial judge’s charge amounted to
misdirection. The Crown’s case against the appellant was not that he had given
false information but that he had fraudulently withheld material information
from O, a situation essentially different in character from that put to the
jury by the trial judge. It was not possible to say that no substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice had occurred by reason of this misdirection.

Droit criminel—Fraude—Opération
immobilière—Avocat du vendeur agissant aussi pour l’acheteur—Existence d’une
seconde hypothèque non dévoilée à l’acheteur—La cause a‑t‑elle été
soumise correctement au jury—Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51,
art. 323(1).

L’appelant, un avocat, a été trouvé coupable par
un jury d’avoir frustré O par supercherie, mensonge ou autres moyens dolosifs,
le tout contrairement à l’art. 323(1) du Code criminel. L’appelant, qui
touchait des honoraires mensuels du vendeur, a représenté aussi l’acheteur O
lors d’une opération immobilière concernant la vente d’un motel. La preuve
était à l’effet que l’appelant n’avait pas dévoilé à O l’existence d’une
seconde hypothèque en vigueur sur la propriété. La Couronne prétend que cette
négligence constituait une fraude dans le sens de l’art. 323(1) du Code.
L’appelant a admis qu’il était au courant de la seconde hypothèque mais que son
défaut d’en informer l’acheteur était dû à une inadvertance de sa part et sans
aucune intention de frustrer. Il est admis que l’appelant n’a retiré
personnellement aucun profit de la fraude alléguée. Dans son adresse au jury,
le juge au procès a dit que la preuve, si elle était crue, était à l’effet que
l’accusé avait fait à l’acheteur une fausse déclaration. La Cour d’appel a
rejeté l’appel. L’appelant a obtenu permission d’en appeler devant cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel doit
être maintenu, la condamnation mise de côté et l’appelant acquitté.

Les instructions du juge au procès étaient
erronées. L’accusation portée contre l’appelant n’était pas qu’il avait donné
de faux renseignements mais qu’il avait frauduleusement caché à O des
renseignements pertinents, une situation ayant un caractère essentiellement
différent de celle qui avait été soumise au jury par le juge au procès. Il
était impossible de dire qu’aucun tort important ou qu’aucune erreur judiciaire
grave ne s’était produite en raison des instructions erronées.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

[Page 24]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

HALL J.:—The appellant was tried jointly with
one Arthur Bennett by a judge and jury in the month of January 1963 at
Vancouver in the Province of British Columbia upon three counts as follows:

1. That at the City of Vancouver, in the County
and Province aforesaid, between the 1st day of January, A.D. 1959, and the 30th
day of March, A.D. 1959, they, the said ARTHUR BENNETT and JOHN MacKROW,
together with HYCREST HOLDINGS LIMITED and HYCREST MOTELS LIMITED by deceit,
falsehood, or other fraudulent means, did defraud SAMUEL NORWOLL of property,
money or valuable security, contrary to the form of the statute in such case
made and provided and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her Crown and
Dignity.

2. That at the City of Vancouver, in the County
and Province aforesaid and at the City of New Westminster, in the Province
aforesaid, between the first day of May, A.D. 1959, and the 30th day of June,
A.D. 1959, they, the said ARTHUR BENNETT and JOHN MacKROW, together with
HYCREST INVESTMENTS LIMITED, IDEAL MOTELS LIMITED and HYCREST MOTELS LIMITED by
deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, did defraud JAMES JACK ORAN of
property, money or valuable security, contrary to the form of the statute in
such case made and provided and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her
Crown and Dignity.

3. That at the City of Vancouver, in the County
and Province aforesaid, between the 1st day of May, A.D. 1959, and the 30th day
of June, A.D. 1959, he the said JOHN MacKROW, being a trustee of money for the
use and benefit of JAMES JACK ORAN did convert, with intent to defraud and in
violation of his trust, the said money or a part of it to a use that was not
authorized by the trust, contrary to the form of statute in such case made and
provided and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her Crown and Dignity.

“Amended
15.1.63
A.B.C.”

The jury acquitted MacKrow on Count 1, but
convicted him on Counts 2 and 3. Bennett was convicted on Counts 1 and 2. MacKrow
was sentenced by Mr. Justice Ruttan, the trial judge, to serve a term of
five years in the penitentiary on each of Counts 2 and 3, the sentences to be
served concurrently. He appealed to the Court of Appeal for

[Page 25]

British Columbia which, on October 17, 1963,
dismissed the appeal as to Count 2 but quashed the conviction on Count 3.
Accordingly, Count 2 in respect of MacKrow only is the one issue now before the
Court. The Court of Appeal did not disturb the five years’ sentence when it
dismissed the appeal in respect of Count 2. MacKrow was a prisoner in the
penitentiary until paroled on July 8, 1965. Shortly after his release from the
penitentiary, MacKrow applied to this Court for an order extending the time
within which to make application for leave to appeal and for an order granting
leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal pronounced on the 17th
day of October, 1963. This application was dealt with on December 8, 1965, when
the following order was made:

THIS COURT DID ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the
time for applying for leave to appeal to this Court be and the same was
extended to the 8th day of December, 1965.

AND THIS COURT DID FURTHER ORDER AND
ADJUDGE that leave to appeal from the Judgment of the Court of Appeal for the
Province of British Columbia pronounced on the 17th day of October, 1963 be and
the same was granted on the following questions of law, namely:

“(1) Did the Court of Appeal err in holding
that there was evidence upon which the jury could reasonably convict the appellant
on Count No. 2 of the indictment.

(2) Did the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia err in holding that any defence which was available to the accused was
properly and adequately put by the learned trial judge in view of the
appellant’s contention that:

(a) The learned trial judge
instructed the jury that there was evidence on the part of the witness Oran
that a false statement was made to him at the time specified in the said Count
No. 2 whereas there was no such evidence;

(b) The learned trial judge
instructed the jury that it was not challenged that the appellant had given
false information to Oran whereas it was a part of the appellant’s defence that
he had not done so;

(c) The learned trial judge
instructed the jury that the appellant’s sole defence was that he had been
negligent whereas it was part of his defence that he had given no false
information.”

The substantive question argued on the hearing
of the appeal was whether the learned trial judge had erred in his direction to
the jury in respect of the law and evidence relating to Count 2. MacKrow was
not present on the hearing of the appeal nor was he represented by counsel.
However, he did file a factum and a memorandum in reply to the respondent’s
factum pursuant to leave granted by the Chief Justice of this Court.
Mr. Burke-Robertson, Q.C.,

[Page 26]

appeared for the Crown and developed the
evidence and points in issue with scrupulous fairness to the Crown and to the
appellant.

While the Crown was within its rights in
including Counts 1 and 2 in the one indictment, the fact that the two counts
were proceeded with in the one indictment did make for a very long and
complicated trial (over three weeks) in which it was difficult to keep separate
the evidence relating to Count 1 from that relating to Counts 2 and 3,
particularly as the wheelings and dealings of Bennett and the corporate
manipulations and financial difficulties of his companies, Hycrest Holdings
Limited and Hycrest Motels Limited, named in Count 1, were involved in both
Counts 1 and 2 and the same corporate manipulations and difficulties of these
companies and of a third company, Ideal Motels Limited, named in Count 2, were
also involved in respect of Count 2 as well as those of a fourth company,
Pacific American Motels Limited, not named in the count. The offence charged in
Count 2 was alleged to have taken place, according to the evidence, on or about
the 15th day of May, 1959. The evidence shows that the appellant was arrested
on the charge on January 5, 1962, and that in the interval civil litigation
over the transactions in question had taken place resulting in James Jack Oran,
the man named in Counts 2 and 3 recovering judgment against Bennett and MacKrow
in an amount of approximately $5,000 and costs. I mention this because in the
address of Mr. Mussallem, who was counsel for MacKrow at the trial, he
made reference to this lapse of time. He was interrupted by Ruttan J. and
directed to go no further with that submission as follows:

THE COURT: But you are criticizing the
Crown for not bringing the case earlier which, I think, is in fact criticism,
and I ask you not to go ahead with it.

Considered alone, perhaps nothing substantial
turns on this point although it is related to the question as to whether any
defence which was available to the appellant was properly and adequately put to
the jury by the learned trial judge. The fact that criminal proceedings were
not instituted for some 32 months after the alleged offence is said to have
been committed and then only after civil proceedings had been taken and a
judgment for some $5,000 obtained which was unsatisfied when the charge was

[Page 27]

laid, was in my view, a proper matter for
comment when the issue was, as in this case, one relating to whether or not a
person has been defrauded by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means.
Criminal proceedings brought long after the event complained of and following
civil proceedings that result in an unsatisfied judgment without any
explanation for the delay may well be looked upon with some suspicion by a jury
where the issue is financial loss arising out of a commercial transaction.

The basic facts upon which Counts 2 and 3 are
based are that on or about the 15th day of May, 1959, the person named in
Counts 2 and 3, the said James Jack Oran, had answered an advertisement in a
Saskatchewan paper relating to a motel which was for sale at White Rock,
British Columbia. He called at the Hycrest office in Vancouver on May 12, 1959,
and saw a Mrs. Young and Bennett. Following a discussion with these parties,
he decided to purchase the property. He signed a document (Exhibit 48) which is
headed “Offer for Purchase, Acceptance and Interim Receipt”, the vendor being
Pacific American Motels Limited. The purchase price was stated to be $47,500
payable $18,000 cash and an Agreement for Sale for the balance, $29,500 payable
over 15 years with interest at 6 per cent. He made a deposit of $1,000. He was
told at this time that there was a mortgage in favour of Associated Investors
Limited against the property for $12,000 payable at $225 per month. The offer
was submitted to Pacific American Motels Limited. Two days later he was
communicated with, and following a discussion, agreed to increasing the
interest rate to 7 per cent. He was then brought to MacKrow’s office which was
in the office of Hycrest Investments Limited, a motel on Denman Street in
Vancouver. MacKrow, who had been called to the Bar May 1, 1954, was engaged
principally in doing work for Bennett and his companies on a $1,200 a month fee
basis. This was the first time Oran had met MacKrow. In so far as going to
MacKrow, Oran testified:

A. I did say to Mrs. Young if I decide
to buy this property I will have to get a lawyer to draw up the transactions.

Q. Yes.

A. And she says, “Well, we have a lawyer
working with us, Mr. MacKrow, and that would be the most convenient, to
have him do the work.” And I said, “Well, he works for your company. Probably I
should still get a lawyer, some other lawyer.” And she was

[Page 28]

very emphatic, she said that it will cost
more to get some other lawyer, it will take more time, and besides MacKrow, he
does this work every day, it will be quicker, and the effect of what she said
was that it would be quicker and cheaper and it would be the best to have
MacKrow do the work. As a result of her suggestion I did engage MacKrow.

Then, in connection with the actual Agreement
for Sale which was prepared by MacKrow, Oran said that some two days later he
got a call to come to MacKrow’s office. This is when the Agreement for Sale
(Exhibit 51) was prepared and signed. Respecting the agreement, Mr. Oran
testified:

MR. COLTHURST:

Q. Who produced the agreement for sale,
Mr. Oran?

A. MacKrow did.

Q. And what, if any, discussion took place
about the document?

A. Well, I read over the first page terms.

Q. Yes?

A. And we agreed verbally with the terms,
the full amount $47,500.00, the down payment $18,000.00, of which I had already
paid $1,000.00.

Q. Yes?

A. And the monthly payments $263.51.

Q. Yes?

A. And there was a 15-year basis we agreed
verbally.

Q. Let me see that. Do you recall any
further discussion in connection with that agreement for sale?

A. Yes, I particularly noticed the
Associated Investors mortgage.

Q. And that is the mortgage that is
referred to on the first page of that document, is it?

A. That is right.

Q. Where it says subject to a mortgage in
favour of Associated Investors Limited, registered in the Land Registry office
under No. 238252C, which the vendors herein covenant to pay according to the
terms thereof?

A. Yes.

Q. And save harmless the purchasers
therefrom provided that should the vendors default in the payment of any monies
due under the said mortgage the purchaser may make payment of such monies to
the said mortgagee and the vendors shall allow the purchaser full credit
hereunder to the amount of such payment.

A. That is what I am referring to, yes.

Q. And was there any discussion in that
connection?

A. Well, we discussed the amount of the
mortgage and the standing and he said that is the mortgage that was on the
listing. It is approximately $12,000.00.

Q. And when you say “he”, who was “he”?

A. MacKrow.

Q. Yes. He said that is it. I am sorry, you
have already told us what he said. Yes, and what else?

A. That is the mortgage in good standing,
it is being paid off at $225.00 a month.

[Page 29]

Q. Yes.

A. I think there was another ten years to
go. So I did say, “Well, couldn’t I pay that directly to Associated Investors?”
Well, he said it really didn’t matter. The effect of what he said was that it
didn’t matter, the difference between $12,000.00 and the agreement for sale was
$29,500.00, and this particular mortgage is only $12,000.00 so even if the
vendor did default in the payments that I still had there was still $17,000.00
left. So it really didn’t matter, he said.

Q. And did you look at any other portion of
that agreement for sale?

A. Well, I went over all of it and they
said, I probably didn’t read all of the second page. MacKrow said, “Well, that
is the usual form,” and he emphasized paid in 15 years, I will get a clear
title, and that is all I asked to have the agreement for sale be what it is.

Q. And as far as looking now at the second
page of that agreement you say that you, as I recall the effect of what you
said, was you probably didn’t read it all. Did you read any of it or notice any
of it?

A. Well, I probably didn’t read it all, but
I noticed there were, this blank space.

Q. Yes?

A. And I think we discussed that. MacKrow
mentioned that if there were any changes or alterations it would be here. But
this is the usual blank space, the usual form that is used and I felt that that
was good enough.

Q. And you are referring to what blank
space? Just hold it up and show?

A. This one here.

Q. That is the blank space where again?

A. Right here.

Q. Where there is certain typewritten
words, is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. The typewritten words being what?

A. No exceptions.

After signing the agreement, Oran made out two
cheques totalling $17,060.18 payable to MacKrow. Oran then left and did not see
or speak to MacKrow again until some months later. Meanwhile, MacKrow proceeded
to have the agreement registered and in due course, on June 2, 1959, wrote Oran
at White Rock, British Columbia, as follows:

Dear Sir: Re sale to you of Ideal Motel,
White Rock.

The registration of the above-mentioned
sale has now been completed and I enclose herewith your copy of the agreement
for sale, which was registered in the New Westminster Land Registry Office
under No. 261951C. Also is enclosed a copy of the statement of adjustments for
your records.

As stated previously, Oran was advised of the
mortgage in favour of Associated Investors Limited before he saw MacKrow. The
charge against MacKrow was that in addition to the Associated Investors’
mortgage there was also registered against the title to the property which Oran
was buying a second mortgage given by Ideal Motels Limited to Issie Feldstein
dated September 19, 1958, for the sum of $12,000 payable on or before March 25,
1959. Oran was not advised of the existence of this mortgage when he signed the
offer to purchase (Exhibit 48) and did not learn of it until, in the month of
September 1959, he had a call from Feldstein advising him of the mortgage and
demanding payment and threatening foreclosure as the mortgage was then overdue.
He immediately got in touch with MacKrow who he says assured him the matter
would be taken care of. MacKrow communicated with Bennett who, after some delay
and because neither he nor Hycrest Motels Limited were able to pay off the
Feldstein mortgage, arranged along with solicitors for Oran to have Credit
Foncier Franco‑Canadien take title and pay off the two mortgages. This
left Oran to settle with Credit Foncier but the transaction resulted in an
actual loss of $2,507.80 to Oran. The motel cost him that much more than he had
agreed to pay for it in the first place. This loss was part of the unsatisfied
judgment previously mentioned which he subsequently recovered against MacKrow
and Bennett.

[Page 31]

The Crown alleged that MacKrow had knowledge of
the existence of the Feldstein mortgage on May 15, 1959, both from the fact
that he had prepared the mortgage in the first place in September 1958 and from
the fact that he participated in a meeting on April 8, 1959, at which a
document (Exhibit 35) was prepared by him and which dealt specifically with the
Feldstein mortgage. Exhibit 35 reads as follows:

Vancouver,
B.C.
April 8, 1959.

Hycrest
Motels Ltd.,
1120 Denman St.,
Vancouver, B.C.
Dear Sirs:

Re:
Transfer to us of El Rancho
Columbia, Fairlane, Triway
Motels.

This is to confirm our agreement with you
made this date with reference to the above transfer of motel properties, as
follows:—

1. We are to have full possession and title
to the above motels, together with all shares in companies owning any of the
said properties.

2. All adjustments between us with
reference to the said transfers are to be taken as settled by the transfer to
us of all shares in the company known as Ideal Motels Ltd., and by the transfer
to us of the property known as Buena Vista Motel, White Rock, B.C. You agree to
discharge at your expense “by April 26, 1959” the mortgage now on the Ideal
Motel property in the approximate amount of $13,800.00 held by one Issie Feldstein.

3. A full mutual release is to be executed
by both you and us.

Yours
very truly,

Pacific
American Motel Corp. Ltd.

The Crown says that MacKrow’s failure to bring
to Oran’s attention the fact of the existence on May 15, 1959, of the Feldstein
mortgage was fraud within the meaning of s. 323(1) of the Criminal
Code. There is no evidence that MacKrow said in so many words that the
property was subject only to the Associated Investors’ mortgage or that there
was only one mortgage. Rather he inserted a clause in the Agreement for Sale
(Exhibit 51) to safeguard Oran in respect of the Associated Investors’ mortgage
only of which Oran had knowledge. The Crown’s position is that MacKrow’s
silence and failure to make known the existence

[Page 32]

of the Feldstein mortgage to Oran at that time
was fraud on his part. MacKrow, while admitting that he knew of the Feldstein
mortgage in September 1958 and that it was still unpaid as of April 8, 1959,
said that his failure to inform Oran of it was due to inadvertence on his part,
and while admitting negligence as a solicitor in failing to have a search made
of the title which would have shown the mortgage still on the title, he
insisted that it had been done innocently and in a hurry and without any intent
to defraud. The issue, therefore, which the jury had to decide was whether the
Crown had made out its case of fraud against MacKrow beyond a reasonable doubt.

The burden of proof was on the Crown to
establish the fraud. It relied strongly on Exhibit 35 quoted above, but it must
be noted that this exhibit specifically contained the statement that the
Feldstein mortgage was to be discharged by April 26, 1959. There was no direct
evidence that the appellant knew that this had not been done when he dealt
with. Oran on May 15. The jury was asked to conclude that because this mortgage
was registered against the property to MacKrow’s knowledge in April that it was
necessarily fraud on his part when he failed to communicate that fact to Oran
on May 15 even though the document (Exhibit 35) relied on so strongly by the
Crown itself provided for the mortgage being off the title by April 26. Much
stress was placed by the Crown on a document (Exhibit 56) dated May 22, 1959,
signed by one Ellen M. Rodgers, MacKrow’s secretary, which accompanied the
Agreement for Sale when it was tendered for registration in the Land Registry
Office on May 27, 1959. This document in which Rodgers said she was the
authorized agent of Oran stated that the Agreement for Sale was being
registered subject to both mortgages and listed the registered numbers of the
two mortgages. According to this witness, these numbers may have been typed in
after the document was prepared between May 22 and May 27, 1959. Obviously by
May 27, 1959, some one in MacKrow’s office was or became aware that the
Feldstein mortgage was still on the title because its registered number was
inserted at or prior to the time the Agreement for Sale was being tendered for
registration. MacKrow denied having prepared the document and there was no
evidence of the source from which the witness Rodgers got the number of the
Feldstein mortgage if, in

[Page 33]

fact, she was the one who actually typed in the
number. She did not identify MacKrow as the source from which she got the
number.

This summarizes the evidence relied on by the
Crown to bridge the gap between the time the Feldstein mortgage should have
been discharged according to Exhibit 35 and May 15 and upon which the Crown
argued that the jury must infer that MacKrow knew the mortgage had not been
discharged as of May 15 and that he fraudulently withheld that fact from Oran
in order to get the $17,000 cash for his principal client Bennett. It was
conceded that MacKrow did not personally profit from the alleged fraud.

This was the case which MacKrow had to answer.
The defences open to him on the evidence included (1) the contention that he
had made no false or any statement to Oran respecting the Feldstein mortgage
and (2) that his failure to tell Oran of the Feldstein mortgage was due to
inadvertence and was not deliberate or intended to mislead or defraud Oran.
Ruttan J. put the case to the jury as follows:

Now on the other hand in the second count,
in the Oran count, there is, I suggest to you, no evidence of a promise to do
something in the future. The evidence, if you accept it, on the part of Oran
is that a false statement was made to him at that time. In fact, I do not think
it is challenged that he was given false information. The defence is that it
was by negligence, by inadvertence, but I do not think it is disputed that he
was given false information, the false statement being once again, that there
was only one encumbrance on the property when, in fact, there was a second
encumbrance, once again a mortgage in the name of Issie Feldstein which was
never revealed to Oran until Feldstein himself called him up some months later
to warn him that he was going to foreclose.

(The italics are my own.)

In my view this was misdirection. The case against
the appellant was not that he had given false information but that he
had fraudulently withheld material information from Oran in order to
obtain the money which Oran paid to him on May 15, a situation essentially
different in character from that put to the jury in the quotation set out
above. See Regina v. Charters[1].

I am unable to say that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has occurred by reason of this misdirection. It follows
that the conviction against the appellant on Count 2 cannot stand.

[Page 34]

There remains the question as to whether a new
trial should be ordered. Crown counsel did not ask for a new trial in the event
that the conviction was set aside. The conviction will, accordingly, be quashed
and MacKrow acquitted on Count 2. His previous acquittals on Counts 1 and 3
completely dispose of the charges against him.

Appeal allowed, conviction quashed and appellant
acquitted.

& Toy, Vancouver.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Possession of obscene material
for purpose of publication, distribution or circulation—Retail
bookseller—Charge under s. 150(1)(a) of the Criminal Code—Whether three
offences included in charge—Whether accused should properly be charged under
s. 150(2)(a)—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 150.

The appellant company, the owner of two
retail bookshops and a warehouse for the storage of books, was convicted,
together with the individual appellants, of unlawfully having in their
possession obscene material for the purpose of publication, distribution or
circulation, contrary to s. 150(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The
convictions were affirmed by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal. The
accused were granted leave to appeal to this Court. There was no appeal from
the finding that the material was obscene. The accused submitted that the
information was void for duplicity and multiplicity and further that it had
been laid under the wrong subsection of s. 150 of the Code.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The gravamen of the offences charged in this
case is possession of a quantity of obscene matter. Once possession is
established it only remains for the Crown to lead evidence to prove one of the
various

[Page 39]

purposes for which the possession was had,
namely, publication, distribution or circulation. It is one offence only which
may be committed in different ways. In the circumstances of this case it was
not necessary to make each book or pamphlet the subject of a separate count.
The various titles recited in the different counts constituted nothing more
than particulars of the offences charged.

On the facts of this case, the submission
that the offence defined in s. 150(1) (a) of the Code could have no
application to retail booksellers, such as the appellants, and that the charges
should have been laid, under s. 150(2)(a), could not be
entertained. The evidence fully justified the inference that the distribution
of obscene matter was a part of the business in which the appellants were
engaged.

Droit criminel—Possession de matières
obscènes aux fins de les publier, distribuer ou mettre en
circulation—Libraire—Accusation portée sous l’art. 150(1)(a) du Code
criminel—L’accusation contient-elle trios infractions—L’acte d’accusation
aurait-il dû être porté sous l’art. 150(2)(a)—Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c.
51, art. 150.

La compagnie appelante, propriétaire de deux
librairies et d’un entrepôt servant à l’emmagasinage de livres, a été trouvée
coupable, ainsi que les autres appelants, d’avoir eu illégalement en leur
possession des matières obscènes aux fins de les publier, distribuer ou mettre
en circulation, le tout contrairement à l’art. 150(1) (a) du Code
criminel. Le verdict de culpabilité fut confirmé par un jugement
majoritaire de la Cour d’appel. Les accusés ont obtenu permission d’en appeler
devant cette Cour. Aucun appel ne fut porté à l’encontre du verdict que les
matières étaient obscènes. Les accusés ont soutenu que l’acte d’accusation
était nul parce qu’il était double et multiple et en plus qu’il avait été porté
sous le mauvais alinéa de l’art. 150 du Code.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté.

La matière de l’infraction reprochée dans
cette cause est la possession d’une quantité de matières obscènes. Une fois que
la possession est établie, la Couronne n’a qu’à produire une preuve établissant
une des diverses fins pour lesquelles on en avait la possession, à savoir, la
publication, distribution ou mise en circulation. Il ne s’agit que d’une seule
infraction qui peut être commise de diverses manières. Dans les circonstances,
il n’était pas nécessaire de faire de chaque livre ou pamphlet le sujet d’un
chef d’accusation séparé. Les titres énumérés aux divers chefs d’accusation ne
constituaient autre chose qu’une communication de détails sur les infractions
reprochées.

En se basant sur les faits de cette cause, la
prétention que l’infraction telle que définie à l’art. 150(1)(a) du Code
ne peut s’appliquer à des libraires, tels que les appelants, et que l’acte
d’accusation aurait dû être porté sous l’art. 150(2)(a), ne peut pas
être admise. La preuve justifie amplement l’inférence que la distribution de
matières obscènes faisait partie des entreprises des appelants.

APPELS de trois jugements de la Cour d’appel
de la Colombie-Britannique[1],
confirmant un verdict de culpabilité. Appels rejetés.

[Page 40]

APPEALS from three judgments of the Court of
Appeal for British Columbia[2],
affirming a conviction. Appeals dismissed

Joseph Sedgwick, Q.C., and W.H. Deverell,
for the appellants.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—This is an appeal from three
judgments of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1 rendered in accordance
with a decision of the majority of that Court (Bull J.A. dissenting) which
affirmed the convictions of the various appellants before Magistrate
G.W. Scott on three separate informations each alleging that the various accused
therein named “unlawfully had in their possession… for the purpose of
publication, distribution or circulation a quantity of obscene written matter
and pictures…” and each containing separate counts wherein the titles of a
number of allegedly obscene publications were recited.

The appellant Company, Fraser Book Bin Ltd., is
the owner of two retail book shops and a warehouse for the storage of books at
Vancouver and Ted Fraser, who is a Director and General Manager of that
Company, was at all material times in charge of the Company’s book shop at 1247
Granville Street where he was assisted by the appellant Harris while the
appellant Poirier was in charge of the Company’s other book shop at 6184 Fraser
Street.

The first information relates only to the shop
at 1247 Granville Street, the second to the shop at 6184 Fraser Street and the
third to the warehouse at 1390 Granville Street. Ted Fraser and Fraser Book Bin
Limited are charged in each of the informations but Harris is charged only in
the first and Poirier only in the second.

The learned Magistrate found that all the
publications referred to, except those specified in Count 3 of the first and
second informations and Count 1 of the third information, were obscene within
the meaning of s. 150(8) of the Criminal Code and Fraser, Harris
and Fraser Book Bin

[Page 41]

Ltd. were found guilty on the first and fourth
Counts of the first information on evidence which disclosed that the offending
books referred to in those counts were found on the shelves of the shop at 1247
Granville Street at a time when customers were present. The Magistrate
acquitted the accused on the second Count of this information on the ground
that he had a doubt as to whether they had the motion pictures therein referred
to in their possession “for the purpose of publication, distribution or
circulation”.

When the second and third informations came on
to be heard no evidence was given as counsel in both cases formally admitted
that the accused had the publications and motion pictures therein referred to
in their possession “for the purpose of publication, distribution or
circulation” and it was further admitted that the publications referred to in
Counts 1 and 2 of the second information and Counts 2 and 3 of the third
information were “identical in nature” with publications which the learned
Magistrate had found to be “obscene” at the trial of the first information.

Fraser, Harris and the Company appealed their
conviction on the first information on the ground that the shop at 1247
Granville Street was a retail book store exclusively operated for the purpose
of selling books to individuals and that the charges contained in that
information, alleging as they did that they had the publications “in their
possession… for the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation” were
charges framed in the language of s. 150(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code which section was intended to be reserved for the prosecution of
makers, publishers and wholesale distributors of obscene material and had no
application to the selling of such material by retail which is the subject of
s. 150(2) (a) of the Code.

The two subsections in question read as
follows:

150 (1) Every one commits an offence who

(a) makes, prints, publishes,
distributes, circulates, or has in his possession for the purpose of
publication, distribution or circulation any obscene written matter, picture,
model, phonograph record or other thing whatsoever, or…

150 (2) Every one commits an offence who
knowingly, without lawful justification or excuse,

(a) sells, exposes to public view or
has in his possession for such a purpose any obscene written matter, picture,
model, phonograph record or other thing whatsoever,…

[Page 42]

The essence of the submission in this regard is
that the accused in the first information were charged under the wrong
subsection and the distinction between the two sub-sections is said
to be reinforced by the fact that s. 150(6) provides that ignorance of the
nature or presence of the material by means of or in relation to which the offence
was committed is not a defence to a charge under s. 150(1) (a)
whereas when a charge is laid under s. 150(2) (a) the burden rests
upon the Crown to prove that the accused had knowledge of the nature and
presence of the material in respect of which it was laid.

It was upon this latter ground that Bull J.A.,
in the course of his dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeal found that the
first information should have been quashed. This ground of appeal was, however,
not open to those convicted on the second and third informations because of the
formal admissions hereinbefore referred to.

The second ground of appeal, which applies to
all the informations, was unanimously dismissed by the Court of Appeal for
British Columbia and was the subject of an order granting leave to appeal to
this Court by which it was expressly confined to the issue raised by the
contention:

That each of the counts in each of the said
informations is bad and void for duplicity and multiplicity.

There is no appeal from the finding of the
learned Magistrate with respect to obscenity which was unanimously affirmed by
the Court of Appeal.

The appellants’ submission that all the counts
are void for “duplicity and multiplicity” is twofold. In the first place it is
contended that the charge of having in their “possession… for the purpose of publication,
distribution and circulation, a quantity of obscene written matter…”
involves three separate charges each of which should be the subject of a
separate count; and in the second place it is argued that possession of each
publication constitutes a separate offence which should have been charged
separately and that the counts each charging the accused with having a number
of different publications in their possession are therefore void.

I agree with the members of the Court of Appeal
that the gravamen of the offences charged in these informations

[Page 43]

is “possession” of a “quantity of obscene
matter…” and that the various titles recited in the different Counts constitute
nothing more than particulars of the offences charged of the kind which the
Court would have been justified in ordering to be delivered to the accused
under the provisions of s. 497 of the Code. In this regard I can do no
better than to adopt the language used by Maclean J.A., in the course of his
reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal where he said:

In my view the gravamen of the charge is
‘possession’. Once possession is established it only remains for the Crown to
lead evidence to prove one of the various purposes for which the possession was
had, namely, publication, distribution or circulation. In other words, it is
one offence only which may be committed in different ways.

I am fortified in this view by Couture
v. The Queen, supra, where the charge of ‘having in possession for sale,
distribution or circulation’ was regarded as one offence. Duplicity was found
in that case only because the full charge alleged that the accused ‘made,
printed and had in possession for sale, distribution or circulation’.

Dealing with the second branch of the
appellants on duplicity, it is my view that the enumeration of a number of book
titles is merely a particularization of the expression ‘a quantity of obscene
written matter’. In my view, in the circumstances of this case it was not necessary
to make each book or pamphlet the subject of a separate count.

The submission that the offence defined in
s. 150(1) (a) as charged in the first information could have no
application to retail booksellers such as the appellants named therein, was
advanced with great force by Mr. Sedgewick. In this regard it was argued
that a retail bookseller might well have acquired his stock in bulk and never
have read any of the offensive books or, indeed, that he might be a blind man,
and it was strenuously contended that Parliament could never have intended that
such a person could be exposed to a charge under s. 150(1) (a) and
thus, by virtue of s. 150(6), be deprived of the defence that he was
ignorant of the presence or contents of such books which defence would have
been open to him if he had been charged as a “seller” under s. 150(2) (a).

However persuasive this argument may be thought
to be, it does not appear to me to fit the circumstances of the present case.
Here the appellant company, with the appellant Fraser as its General Manager,
was proved to be operating a warehouse from which books were distributed to its
two retail outlets one of which was referred to in the

[Page 44]

first information and was the place where the
third appellant, Harris, was employed. This was, in my opinion, an organization
for the distribution of books, a substantial number of which were found to be
obscene.

In this regard the following excerpt from the
evidence of the detective who supervised the seizure of the offending books
appears to me to be revealing:

I did go with Detective Matches to 1247
Granville Street, where I met Mr. Fraser and he told us at that time that
he was the General Manager of Fraser Book Bin and that particular store. He
took us to a warehouse at 1390 Granville and he told us he also had another
store at 6184 Fraser, that they did a large volume of business in mail order as
well as counter business, all over the world, both buying and selling.

I agree with the view expressed by Maclean J.A.
on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal that the word “distribution”
as used in s. 150(1) (a) “is obviously a word of wider connotation
than ‘sale’ as sale is only one of a number of means of distribution”. The
appellant submitted that this construction would mean that everyone who “sells”
within the meaning of s. 150(2) (a) would also be guilty of the
offence defined in s. 150(1) (a) and that the provisions of the
former section would thus be “reduced to a futility” to employ the
language used in the factum filed on behalf of the appellants. Like
Mr. Justice Maclean, however, I can envisage cases of individual sales
which would constitute an offence under s. 150(2) (a) and yet would
not be a “distribution” within the meaning of s. 150(1) (a), and I
think also that there may well be cases of a bookseller who has in his shop a
scattered few of these publications amongst a mass of inoffensive books, where
a charge of possession for the purpose of sale contrary to s. 150(2) (a)
would be more appropriate than one relating to “distribution” under
s. 150(1) (a).

There may, indeed, be many cases in which it is
difficult to determine which of these two subsections should be invoked in
a prosecution but, in my opinion, the present circumstances do not present any
such difficulty. I am satisfied that the evidence called in respect of the
first information fully justifies the inference that the distribution of
obscene written matter was a part of the business in which the appellants
Fraser and Fraser Book Bin Ltd. were engaged and that the appellant Harris was
employed as an active participant in that business.

[Page 45]

For these reasons I would dismiss the appeals of
all the appellants and affirm the convictions entered by the learned
Magistrate.

Appeals dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Unlawful and wilful damage to
public property—Defence of having acted under threat—Whether trial judge erred
in ruling evidence of compulsion inadmissible—Whether accused in danger as a
result of threats—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 7, 17, 371, 372.

The respondent was convicted of having
unlawfully and wilfully damaged public property. At trial, he admitted having
damaged the plumbing fixtures in the cell where he was incarcerated but,
through his counsel, he sought to introduce evidence to show that he had
committed this offence under the compulsion of threats and was therefore
entitled to be excused by virtue of s. 17 of the Criminal Code and
that he was also entitled to avail himself of the Common Law defence of
“duress” by virtue of s. 7 of the Code. The nature of this evidence, as
outlined by counsel for the accused, was that the offence had been committed
during a disturbance in the course of which a substantial body of prisoners,
shouting in unison from their separate cells, threatened the respondent, who
was not joining in the disturbance, that if he did not

[Page 115]

break the plumbing fixtures in his cell he
would be kicked in the head, his arms would be broken and he would get a knife
in the back at the first opportunity. The trial judge ruled that the proposed
evidence did not indicate a defence or excuse available at law and ruled the
evidence inadmissible. The Court of Appeal held that the evidence should have
been presented to the jury, quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial. The
Crown appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed, and the conviction restored.

The trial judge was right in deciding that
the proposed evidence did not afford an excuse within the meaning of s. 17
of the Criminal Code. The question of whether immediate threats of
future death or grievous bodily harm constitute an excuse for committing a
crime within the meaning of s. 17 of the Code and the question of whether
a person can be present within the meaning of that section when he is
locked in a separate cell from the place where the offence is committed are
both questions which depend upon the construction to be placed on
section 17 and they are therefore questions of law and not questions of
fact for the jury. Accepting the outline made by defence counsel as being an
accurate account of the evidence which was available, there was nothing in it
to support the defence that the act was not done wilfully within the meaning of
ss. 371(1) and 372(1) of the Code, and there was accordingly no ground to
justify the trial judge in permitting the proposed evidence.

Droit criminel—Dommage à un bien public
causé illégalement et volontairement—Défense de contrainte exercée par des
menaces—Le juge au procès a-t-il erré en décidant que la preuve de contrainte
était inadmissible—L’accusé était-il en danger comme résultat des menaces—Code
Criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 7, 17, 371, 372.

L’intimé a été trouvé coupable d’avoir causé
illégalement et volontairement du dommage à un bien public. Lors du procès, il
a admis avoir endommagé la tuyauterie dans la cellule de la prison où il était
détenu mais, par l’entremise de son avocat, il a tenté d’introduire une preuve
démontrant qu’il avait commis cette offense sous l’effet de la contrainte
exercée par des menaces et qu’il avait droit en conséquence d’être excusé en
vertu de l’art. 17 du Code Criminel et qu’il avait aussi le droit de se
prévaloir de la défense de droit commun de «coercition» en vertu de l’art. 7 du
Code. La nature de cette preuve, telle qu’exposée par son avocat, était à
l’effet que l’offense avait été commise à l’occasion d’un tumulte durant lequel
une partie considérable des prisonniers, criant tous ensemble à tue-tête de
leurs cellules respectives, avaient menacé l’intimé, qui ne s’était pas joint
au tumulte, que s’il ne brisait pas la tuyauterie de sa cellule on le
frapperait à la tête, on lui briserait les bras et on le poignarderait dans le
dos à la première occasion. Le juge au procès décida que la preuve que l’on
voulait offrir ne démontrait pas une défense ou une excuse disponible en droit
et rejeta la preuve comme n’étant pas admissible. La Cour d’appel jugea que la
preuve aurait dû être présentée au jury, cassa le verdict de culpabilité et
ordonna un nouveau procès. La Couronne en appela devant cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être maintenu et le verdict de culpabilité rétabli.

[Page 116]

Le juge au procès a eu raison de décider que
la preuve que l’on voulait offrir n’était pas une excuse selon le sens de
l’art. 17 du Code Criminel. La question de savoir si des menaces
immédiates de mort future ou de lésions corporelles graves constituent une
excuse pour commettre un crime dans le sens de l’art. 17 du Code et la question
de savoir si une personne peut être présente dans le sens de cet article
lorsqu’elle est enfermée sous clef dans une cellule séparée de l’endroit où
l’offense est commise, sont deux questions qui dépendent de l’interprétation de
l’art. 17 et qui sont en conséquence des questions de droit et non pas des
questions de fait pour le jury. Si l’on accepte l’exposé fait par l’avocat de
l’accusé comme étant un récit fidèle de la preuve qui était disponible, il n’y
a rien dans cet exposé pour supporter la défense que l’offense n’avait pas été
commise volontairement dans le sens des arts. 371(1) et 372(1) du Code, et en
conséquence il n’y avait aucune raison justifiant le juge au procès de
permettre la présentation de cette preuve.

APPEL de la Couronne d’un jugement de la Cour
d’appel de la Colombie-Britannique1, ordonnant un nouveau procès. Appel
maintenu.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1],
ordering a new trial. Appeal allowed.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
appellant.

Frank G.P. Lewis, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—This is an appeal by the Attorney
General of British Columbia from a judgment of the Court of Appeal1
of that Province, from which Mr. Justice MacLean dissented, and by which
it was ordered that the respondent’s conviction for unlawfully and wilfully
damaging public property and thereby committing mischief, should be set aside
and that a new trial should be had.

At the trial the respondent admitted having
damaged the plumbing fixtures in the cell where he was incarcerated at Oakalla
Prison Farm in British Columbia but, through his counsel, he sought to
introduce evidence to show that he had committed this offence under the
compulsion of threats and was therefore entitled to be excused for committing
it by virtue of the provisions of s. 17 of the Criminal Code

[Page 117]

and that he was also entitled to avail himself
of the common law defence of “duress” having regard to the provisions of
s. 7 of the Criminal Code.

Under the latter section it is provided
that:

Every rule and principle of the common law
that renders any circumstance a justification or excuse for an act or a defence
to a charge continues in force and applies in respect of proceedings for an
offence under this Act… except in so far as they are altered by or are
inconsistent with this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.

The italics are my own.

I agree with the learned trial judge and with
MacLean J.A. that in respect of proceedings for an offence under the Criminal
Code the common law rules and principles respecting “duress” as an excuse
or defence have been codified and exhaustively defined in s. 17 which
reads as follows:

17. A person who commits an offence under
compulsion by threats of immediate death or grievous bodily harm from a person
who is present when the offence is committed is excused for committing the
offence if he believes that the threats will be carried out and if he is not a
party to a conspiracy or association whereby he is subject to compulsion, but
this section does not apply where the offence that is committed is
treason, murder, piracy, attempted murder, assisting in rape, forcible
abduction, robbery, causing bodily harm or arson.

At the outset of the proceedings at the trial in
the present case and in the absence of the jury, Mr. Greenfield, who acted
on behalf of the accused, informed the Court that he intended to call evidence
of compulsion and duress and he elected to outline the nature of this evidence
which was that the offence had been committed during a disturbance, apparently
organized by way of protest, to damage property at the Prison Farm in the
course of which a substantial body of prisoners, shouting in unison from their
separate cells, threatened the respondent, who was not joining in the
disturbance, that if he did not break the plumbing fixtures in his cell he
would be kicked in the head, his arm would be broken and he would get a knife
in the back at the first opportunity.

The question which the learned trial judge was
required to determine on Mr. Greenfield’s application was whether the
proposed evidence which had been outlined to him indicated a defence or excuse
available at law; he decided

[Page 118]

that it did not and the majority of the Court of
Appeal having taken a different view, the Attorney General now appeals to this
Court.

There can be little doubt that the evidence
outlined by Mr. Greenfield, which was subsequently confirmed by the
evidence given by the ringleaders of the disturbance in mitigation of sentence,
disclosed that the respondent committed the offence under the compulsion of
threats of death and grievous bodily harm, but although these threats were
“immediate” in the sense that they were continuous until the time that the
offence was committed, they were not threats of “immediate death” or “immediate
grievous bodily harm” and none of the persons who delivered them was present in
the cell with the respondent when the offence was committed. I am accordingly
of opinion that the learned trial judge was right in deciding that the proposed
evidence did not afford an excuse within the meaning of s. 17 of the Criminal
Code,

In the course of his most thoughtful judgment in
the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Norris had occasion to say:

The question of whether or not a person
threatening was present goes to the question of the grounds for the fear which
the appellant might have. In my opinion a person could be present making a
throat although separated by the bars of the cell. These are all matters which
should have gone to the jury, as was the question of whether or not the threat
of death or grievous bodily harm was an immediate one—a question of degree.
They might well consider that the threat was immediate as being continuous, as
it was in this case, that it would be all the more frightening because of the
uncertainty as to when it actually might happen, and therefore force him to act
as he did.

With the greatest respect it appears to me that
the question of whether immediate threats of future death or grievous bodily
harm constitute an excuse for committing a crime within the meaning of
s. 17 and the question of whether a person can be “present” within the
meaning of that section when he is locked in a separate cell from the
place where the offence is committed are both questions which depend upon the
construction to be placed on the section and they are therefore questions
of law and not questions of fact for the jury. See Vail v. The Queen[2] and The Queen v. Sikyea[3].

[Page 119]

In support of the suggestion that the threat in
the present case was “immediate and continuous” Mr. Justice Norris relied
on the case of Subramaniam v. Public Prosecutor[4], in which the Privy Council decided that
the trial judge was wrong in excluding evidence of threats to which the
appellant was subjected by Chinese terrorists in Malaya. In that case it was
found that the threats were a continuous menace up to the moment when the
appellant was captured because the terrorists might have come back at any time
and carried them into effect. Section 94 of the Penal Code of the Federated
Malay States, which the appellant sought to invoke in that case provided:

94. Except murder and offences included in
Chapter VI punishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a
person who is compelled to do it by threats, which, at the time of doing it,
reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person will
otherwise be the consequence;…

The distinctions between the Subramaniam case
and the present one lie in the fact that Subramaniam might well have had
reasonable cause for apprehension that instant death would result from his
disobeying the terrorists who might have come back at any moment, whereas it is
virtually inconceivable that “immediate death” or “grievous bodily harm” could
have come to Carker from those who were uttering the threats against him as
they were locked up in separate cells, and it is also to be noted that the
provisions of s. 17 of the Criminal Code are by no means the same
as those of s. 94 of the Penal Code of the Federated Malay States; amongst
other distinctions the latter section contains no provision that the
person who utters the threats must be present when the offence is committed in
order to afford an excuse for committing it.

Both Mr. Justice Norris and
Mr. Justice Branca in delivering their separate reasons for judgment in
the Court of Appeal, expressed the view that the evidence which was tendered
should have been admitted on the issue of whether the respondent acted wilfully
in damaging the prison plumbing or whether he was so affected by the threats
uttered against him as to be incapable of adopting any other course than the
one which he did.

[Page 120]

The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read
as follows:

372(1) Every one commits mischief who
wilfully

(a) destroys or damages property,…

(3) Every one who commits mischief in
relation to public property is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for fourteen years.

On this phase of the matter, Mr. Justice
Norris had this to say:

In making the ruling which he did the
learned trial judge deprived the appellant of what could be a substantial
defence to the charge or an excuse under s. 17 without hearing the
evidence. The jury could not decide whether the act was in fact wilful. This
was not a matter on which the judge might rule. The length to which the
evidence might go to disprove the essentials of the charge or to prove the
requirements of s. 17 could never in the absence of the evidence of witnesses
be apparent either to the learned judge or to the jury.

With the greatest respect, this portion of
Mr. Justice Norris’ reasons for judgment appears to overlook the fact that
“the length to which the evidence might go…” was fully outlined to the learned judge
by counsel for the respondent when he was making the application.

In this regard it is important to bear in mind
the fact that “wilful” as it is used in Part IX of the Criminal Code is
defined in s. 371 (1) which reads, in part, as follows:

371(1) Every one who causes the occurrence
of an event by doing an act or by omitting to do an act that it is his duty to
do, knowing that the act or omission will probably cause the occurrence of the
event and being reckless whether the event occurs or not, shall be deemed, for
the purposes of this Part, wilfully to have caused the occurrence of the event.

The evidence outlined to the learned trial judge
discloses that the criminal act was committed to preserve the respondent from
future harm coming to him, but there is no suggestion in the evidence tendered
for the defence that the accused did not know that what he was doing would
“probably cause” damage. Accepting the outline made by defence counsel as being
an accurate account of the evidence which was available, there was in my view
nothing in it to support the defence that the act was not done “wilfully”
within the meaning of s. 371(1) and 372(1) of the Criminal Code and
there was accordingly no ground to justify the learned trial judge in
permitting the proposed evidence to be called in support of such a defence.

[Page 121]

In view of all the above, I would allow this
appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the
conviction.

Appeal allowed and conviction
restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Common gaming
house—Premises occupied by branch of Canadian Legion—Bingo—Whether bona fide
social club—Criminal law, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 168 (2) (a) (i), (ii),
176.

The respondents, an incorporated branch of the Canadian Legion
and its secretary, were convicted on a charge of keeping a common gaming house,
contrary to s. 176 of the Criminal Code. They operated bingo games
afternoons and evenings, six days per week, at which the daily attendance
averaged 1,800 persons. The games were open to the public. The participants had
to pay an admission fee of 50 cents, and if they wished to share in the prize
money (and everybody did), they had to pay a further 50 cents. The respondents
retained only the 50 cents admission fee; all other moneys received were
returned on the same day as prizes to successful participants. The respondents
were acquitted by the Court of Appeal. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to
this Court on the question as to whether the premises were used by an
incorporated bona fide social club within the meaning of s. 168(2) (a)
of the Code.

Held: The appeal should be allowed and the convictions
restored.

The premises in question were not being used as a bona fide
social club. Their use for bingo on such a wide-spread scale contradicted any
possible inference of their use as a bona fide social club. The whole or
a portion of the bets on or proceeds from the games were directly or indirectly
paid to the keeper. The significant feature of subs. (2)(a)(i) of s. 168
is not the ultimate disposition of the moneys received by the keeper but the
simple fact of payment to the keeper. It was also apparent that the respondents
failed to qualify for the exemption under subs. (2)(a)(ii). It was
impossible to break down what the participants paid into a 50 cents charge for
admission and a further charge for the cards for the purpose of paying lip
service to the requirements of that subsection. The word ""persons"" in
subs. (2)(a)(ii) means persons who play bingo in premises while used by
a social club in a bona fide manner in keeping with the objects for
which it was incorporated.

de jeu—Local occupé par une branche de la Légion canadienne—Bingo—S'agit-il
d'un club social authentique—Code criminel, 1953-1954 (Can.), c. 51, arts.
168(2)(a)(i), (ii), 176.

Les intimés, une branche de la Légion
canadienne constituée en corporation et son secrétaire, ont été trouvés
coupables sur une accusation d'avoir

[Page 4]

tenu une maison de jeu, contrairement à
l'art. 176 du Code criminel. Ils exploitaient des jeux de bingo l'après-midi
et le soir, six jours par semaine, et auxquels 1,800 personnes assistaient en
moyenne chaque jour. Les jeux étaient accessibles au public. Les joueurs
devaient payer une cotisation d'admission de 50 sous, et s'ils désiraient
obtenir des prix, ils devaient payer une autre somme de 50 sous, ce que tous
les joueurs faisaient. Les intimés gardaient seulement le 50 sous de cotisation
d'admission; tous les autres argents reçus étaient remis le même jour comme
prix aux joueurs gagnants. Le verdict de culpabilité fut renversé par la Cour
d'Appel. La Couronne a obtenu la permission d'en appeler devant cette Cour sur
la question de savoir si le local en question était utilisé par un club social
authentique constitué en corporation selon le sens de l'art. 168(2) (a)
du Code.

Arrêt: L'appel doit être maintenu et le verdict
de culpabilité rétabli.

Le local en question
n'était pas utilisé comme club social authentique. Son usage pour des jeux de
bingo sur une échelle aussi étendue contredisait toute inférence possible qu'il
pouvait être utilisé comme club social authentique. La totalité ou une partie
des paris sur les jeux ou des recettes de ces jeux était directement ou
indirectement payée au tenancier. La caractéristique significative du sous-para.
(2) (a) (i) de l'art. 168 n'est pas la disposition finale des argents
reçus par le tenancier mais le simple fait du paiement au tenancier. Il était
évident de plus que les intimés n'avaient pas réussi à se qualifier sous
l'exemption du sous-para. (2)(a)(ii). Il était impossible de répartir ce
que les joueurs avaient payé entre une cotisation pour admission de 50 sous et
une charge additionnelle pour les cartes dans le but de satisfaire seulement
des lèvres les exigences du sous-paragraphe. Le mot « personnes »
dans le sous-para. (2)(a)(ii) signifie les personnes qui jouent le bingo
dans le local alors qu'il est utilisé par un club social d'une manière
authentique selon les objets pour lesquels il avait été incorporé.

APPEL d'un jugement
de la Cour d'Appel de la Colombie-Britannique, renversant un verdict de
culpabilité. Appel maintenu.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia, reversing a conviction. Appeal allowed.

W. G. Burke-Robertson,
Q.C., for the appellant.

W. J. Wallace, for the
respondents.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

JUDSON J.:—The respondents were
charged under s. 176 of the Criminal Code with keeping a common gaming
house. The issue in the appeal is whether the case is covered by the exception
contained in s. 168(2) (a) of the Criminal Code, which reads:

(2) A place is not a common
gaming house within the meaning of subparagraph (i) or clause (B) or (C) of
subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (d) of subsection (1)

[Page 5]

(a) while it is
occupied and used by an incorporated bona fide social club or branch
thereof if

(i) the whole or any portion
of the bets on or proceeds from games played therein is not directly or
indirectly paid to the keeper thereof, and

(ii) no fee in excess of ten
cents an hour or fifty cents a day is charged to persons for the right or
privilege of participating in the games played therein;…

The accused were convicted by the
magistrate but acquitted on appeal. Leave to appeal was granted to this Court
on the following question of law:

Was the place No. 2655 Main
Street, Vancouver, in the circumstances of the charge, used by an incorporated bona
fide social club within the meaning of Section 168, Subsection (2)(a) of
the Criminal Code of Canada?

The facts are not in dispute. The
respondent, Branch 177 of the Royal Canadian Legion, is an incorporated branch
of the Royal Canadian Legion. The respondent Elmer MacDonald is the secretary-manager
of Branch 177. The premises occupied by Branch 177 are at 2655 Main Street, Vancouver, a building
constructed and owned by Mount Pleasant War Memorial Community Co-operative
Association, which was organized by and operated by Legion members. This
building consists of four floors, including the basement. The basement is
leased to persons who run a bowling alley. The other three floors are leased to
Branch 177 for an annual rental of approximately $75,000. The first floor is
used for bingo games afternoons and evenings, six days per week, at which the
daily attendance has averaged 1,800 persons.

Members of the public wishing to
play bingo were admitted upon payment of a fifty cent admission fee. In order
to participate in prize money, a further fifty cents was then paid. Although it
was possible to play bingo without payment of a further fifty cents, and
without, therefore, the right to participate in prize money, no one did so. The
evidence of the respondent MacDonald was that this rule came into effect in
1962 but that no one availed himself of the opportunity although nearly half a
million persons played bingo in this establishment in the year 1963 alone.

The opportunity to share in the
prize money came from the sale of cards at fifty cents and a dollar each.
Branch 177 

[Page 6]

retained only the fifty cent
admission fee; all other moneys received were returned on the same day as
prizes to successful participants.

On these undisputed facts, the
prosecution succeeds on the ground that 2655
 Main Street was not being used as a bona
fide social club. It was a place open to the public without discrimination
and in daily use as a centre of public gambling. Nothing turns in this case
upon s. 168(3), which places the onus on the accused of proving that a place is
not a common gaming house. The undisputed facts speak for themselves. The
public was admitted on payment of a fifty cent admission fee. Then, if they
wished, they could all participate in gambling, and they all did. This is not
occupation and use by a bona fide social club. It is unnecessary to go
into the objects of the Canadian Legion or its incorporated Branch 177. The use
of these premises for bingo on such a widespread scale contradicts any possible
inference of the use as a bona fide social club.

The whole or a portion of the
bets on or proceeds from the games played at 2655 Main Street were directly
or indirectly paid to the keeper. The respondents were required to show under
s. 168(3) that this was not so in order to come within the exception. Again,
nothing turns upon presumptions or onus of proof. The evidence is clear that
the admission fees collected at the door plus all further moneys received from
players were paid to cashiers and persons selling cards and tickets who were
assisting and acting on behalf of Branch 177. These persons and Branch 177 were
keepers within the meaning of the section. All the moneys were paid to the
keeper directly and the keeper then retained all admission fees and disbursed
the other moneys paid by players in the form of prizes for those who won. The
significant feature of subs. (2) (a) (i) is not the ultimate disposition
of the moneys received by the keeper but the simple fact of payment to the
keeper. This alone is sufficient to take the respondents outside the operation
of subs. (2) (a) (i).

On the above facts it is also
apparent that the respondents failed to qualify for the exemption under subs.
(2)(a)(ii). More than fifty cents per day was charged to persons for the
right or privilege of participating in the games. Again, it is clear on the
evidence that all those who went to the premises, went for the purpose of
participating in the game in the hope of winning a prize. All bingo players 

[Page 7]

during the period covered by the
charge and as far back as 1962 paid more than fifty cents per day. It is
impossible to break down what they paid into a fifty cent charge for admission
and a further charge for the cards for the purpose of paying lip service to the
requirements of subs. (2) (a) (ii).

Both the learned magistrate and
the Court of Appeal felt that it was necessary to put an interpretation on the
word ""persons"" in subs. (2)(a)(ii). The magistrate held that
the word meant persons who were members of the club or guests of the members of
the club. The Court of Appeal was of the contrary opinion and held that the
word was completely general in its scope. One must, however, read the section
as a whole. There are only two exceptions to the general definition of
""common gaming house"". These are social clubs and charitable or
religious organizations. We are not concerned with the latter in this case.
They may hold an occasional bingo if the proceeds go to charity. The other
exception is ""use or occupation by an incorporated bona fide social
club"" on certain conditions. In this context the word ""persons""
in subs. (2) (a) (ii) means persons who play bingo in premises while
used by a social club in a bona fide manner in keeping with the objects
for which it was incorporated. It does not mean the public at large who played
bingo in the circumstances of the charge, because the social club, assuming
that it was one, was not being operated in a bona fide manner.

I would answer the question on
which leave was granted in the negative and restore the conviction of both
respondents.

691(2)—Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c.259,s. 41(3).

The appellant was found guilty of breaking and entering, and
his appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. His subsequent application for
a writ of habeas corpus was dismissed, and an appeal from that dismissal

[Page 195]

was rejected by the Court of Appeal. He appealed to this Court
from that judgment and also applied for leave to appeal to this Court. 

Held: Both the appeal and the application for leave to
appeal should be dismissed.

The appellant is confined in a penitentiary in consequence of
his conviction and sentence by a Court of competent jurisdiction. The writ was
therefore properly refused. 

Subsection 3 of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act precludes the
granting of leave to appeal to this Court under that Act.

There was no question of law raised by the appellant which
would warrant the granting of leave to appeal under s. 597(1) (b) of the
Criminal Code.

There was no other remedy which the appellant was entitled to
seek in this Court.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

MARTLAND J.:—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, which dismissed an
appeal by the appellant, based upon s. 691(2) of the Criminal Code, from
the dismissal by Chief Justice Bence of the appellant's application for a writ
of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum.

I have considered all of the
submissions made by the appellant, and in my opinion this appeal fails. The
appellant is confined in a penitentiary in consequence of his conviction and
sentence by a court of competent jurisdiction, and I think the learned Chief
Justice was right in refusing to grant the writ.

The appellant further requests
leave to appeal to this Court under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act.
Subsection (3) of that section precludes the granting of such leave.

There is no question of law
raised by the appellant which would warrant the granting of leave to appeal
under s. 597(1) (b) of the Criminal Code.

Other than the foregoing, there
is no remedy which the appellant is entitled to seek in this Court.

EN APPEL DE LA COUR DU BANC DE LA REINE,
PROVINCE DE QUÉBEC.

Criminal law—Possession of stolen
article—Proof of possession within
meaning of s. 296 of the Criminal Code.

The appellant was found guilty of having in his possession an
automobile radio knowing that it had been stolen. The radio was stolen by one
Corbin and hidden by him somewhere in the lower town of Montreal. A few hours
later, in the evening, Corbin and two other persons were in an automobile
driven by the appellant who was accompanied by one Whitworth. The car was
driven towards the lower town and stopped in the vicinity of the place where
Corbin had hidden the radio. At that time or a few minutes earlier Corbin told
the appellant that he had something to give him. Corbin went to get the radio
and brought it back, hiding it under his coat. After dropping off Corbin and
his two companions, the appellant drove Whitworth to a place where the latter
hid the radio. The appellant testified that during the trip he had declared ""Moi je veux rien avoir avec ça"".

The Court of Appeal, by a majority
judgment, dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge held that it has not been
established that the appellant had had physical possession or control of the
radio. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the question
as to whether there was in the record legal proof justifying the conclusion
that he had had possession within the meaning of s. 296 of the Criminal
Code.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

The evidence reasonably established that the trial judge could
judicially conclude—as he did—that the appellant knew that the article given to
him by Corbin was the radio, that he knew that this was a stolen article and
that he had possession at least for an appreciable time. If the declaration of
the appellant, as testified to by him, justified the

Droit criminel—Possession d'un objet volé—Preuve
de possession au sens de l'art. 296 du Code Criminel.

L'appelant fut trouvé coupable d'avoir eu en sa
possession un radio d'automobile sachant qu'il avait été volé. Ce radio fut
volé par un nommé Corbin qui le cacha dans le bas de la ville de Montréal.
Quelques heures plus tard, dans la soirée, Corbin et deux autres personnes
prirent place dans le nord de la ville dans l'automobile de l'appelant qui
était accompagné d'un nommé Whitworth. Ils descendirent vers le bas de la ville
pour s'arrêter dans le voisinage de l'endroit où Corbin avait caché le radio. A
ce moment ou quelques instants auparavant Corbin informa l'appelant qu'il avait
quelque chose à lui donner. Corbin alla chercher le radio et le rapporta en le
cachant sous son manteau. Après avoir laissé Corbin et ses deux compagnons en
cours de route, l'appelant conduisit Whitworth à un endroit où celui-ci cacha
le radio. L'appelant témoigna qu'au cours de la randonnée il avait déclaré:
«Moi je veux rien avoir avec ça».

La Cour d'Appel, par un jugement majoritaire,
rejeta l'appel. Le juge dissident jugea qu'il n'avait pas été établi que
l'appelant avait eu la possession physique ou le contrôle du radio. L'appelant
a obtenu permission d'appeler devant cette Cour sur la question de savoir s'il
y avait au dossier une preuve légale justifiant la conclusion qu'il y avait eu
possession au sens de l'art. 296 du Code Criminel.

Arrêt: L'appel doit
être rejeté.

L'ensemble de la preuve établit raisonnablement
que le juge au procès pouvait judicieusement conclure—comme il le fit—que
l'appelant savait que l'objet dont Corbin lui fit don était le radio, qu'il
savait qu'il s'agissait d'un objet volé, et qu'il en avait eu, au moins pour un
temps appréciable, la possession. Si la déclaration de l'appelant, rapportée
dans son témoignage, permettait au juge de déduire qu'il savait alors qu'il
s'agissait d'un objet volé, le juge était libre de croire ou de ne pas croire
que l'appelant avait véritablement fait cette déclaration. Au regard des arts. 3(4)
et 300 du Code et du dossier, rien ne permet d'écarter validement
la déclaration de culpabilité.

l'appelant.

pour l'intimée.

Le jugement de la Cour fut rendu par

Le Juge
Fauteux:—Accusé d'avoir à Montréal, le 30 mars 1961, (i)
volé un radio d'automobile, d'une valeur de $135, et (ii) eu en sa possession
ce radio, sachant qu'il était

[Page 142]

volé, l'appelant, à l'issue du procès, fut
acquitté du vol et trouvé coupable de recel.

Il appela de cette condamnation à la Cour du
banc de la reine2
siégeant en appel, où il soutint en somme que les éléments du recel n'avaient
pas été légalement prouvés. Cette prétention fut rejetée comme non fondée par
MM. les Juges Taschereau et Owen, formant
la majorité. M. le Juge Bissonnette, dissident, fut d'avis qu'il n'était pas
établi que l'accusé avait eu la possession physique ou le contrôle du radio.
L'appel fut rejeté.

Dans un pourvoi subséquent à cette Cour,
l'appelant invoqua la dissidence prononcée en Cour d'Appel et soumit
particulièrement, comme grief d'appel, suivant la permission d'appeler par lui
obtenue, qu'il n'y a au dossier aucune preuve légale justifiant la Cour de
conclure que l'appelant a eu la possession de ce radio au sens de l'art. 296 du
Code Criminel sous lequel il avait été accusé.

Les témoins entendus sur les circonstances
précédant et accompagnant le fait reproché à l'appelant sont tous plus ou moins
impliqués en l'affaire. Leurs témoignages, non dépourvus de réticences ou de
contradictions, permettent d'en faire ce résumé.

Dans l'après-midi du 30 mars 1961, Fernand Corbin vola le radio en question alors
qu'il était fixé à une automobile stationnée dans le bas de la ville en arrière
d'un immeuble de la rue St-Denis, près de la rue Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes,
véhicule qu'il avait illégalement déplacé aux fins de ce vol. Il cacha le radio
dans une cour privée attenante à la rue Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes et dont l'accès
était protégé par une clôture. Le même jour, vers les neuf heures du soir,
Corbin, Marcel Plante et Charles Vincent, se trouvant alors dans le nord de la
ville, prirent place dans une automobile conduite par l'appelant, en compagnie
duquel se trouvait déjà Wayne Whitworth. Tous ces occupants de la voiture, à
l'exception de Rotondo qui était âgé de près de quarante ans, étaient des
jeunes gens de quinze à dix-neuf ans. Ils descendirent tous vers le bas de la
ville pour s'arrêter dans le voisinage immédiat de l'endroit où Corbin avait
caché le radio. C'est alors que Corbin, muni d'outils, se rendit dans la cour
privée, prit le radio et le rapporta à l'automobile en le cachant sous son
manteau. Repartis de cet endroit, les occu-

[Page 143]

pants de la voiture, à l'exception de Rotondo
et Wayne Whitworth, se firent laisser à une salle de pool et Rotondo conduisit
Whitworth à un endroit où celui-ci cacha le radio. A un certain moment, avant
ou au moment d'arriver à la cour privée, Corbin informa Rotondo qu'il avait
quelque chose à lui donner. Il ne fait aucun doute, suivant la preuve, que ce
quelque chose était le radio que Corbin avait rapporté à l'automobile avec ses
outils, au vu de certains sinon de tous les occupants de la voiture. Sans
entrer dans le détail et la discussion des témoignages rendus par ces jeunes
gens et l'appelant, l'ensemble de la preuve faite par ces témoins, dont la
tenue en Cour aussi bien que les témoignages ont pu être appréciés par le Juge
au procès, établit raisonnablement que ce dernier pouvait judicieusement
conclure—comme il le fit—que l'appelant savait que l'objet dont Corbin lui fit
don était le radio, qu'il savait qu'il s'agissait d'un objet volé, et enfin
qu'il en avait eu, au moins pour un temps appréciable, la possession. Entendu
comme témoin, pour sa propre défense, Rotondo admit avoir déjà été condamné
pour vol avec effraction et recel. Il témoigna qu'à un moment, au cours de
cette randonnée en automobile, il avait déclaré:—«Moi je veux rien avoir à
faire avec ça». Si cette déclaration, rapportée dans son témoignage, permettait
au Juge de déduire que Rotondo savait alors qu'il s'agissait d'un objet volé,
le Juge était libre de croire ou de ne pas croire que Rotondo avait
véritablement fait cette déclaration au cours de l'affaire. La section 4 de
l'art. 3 du Code Criminel définit ainsi la possession:

Aux fins de la présente loi,

a) Une personne est en possession d'une chose lorsqu'elle l'a en sa
possession personnelle ou que, sciemment,

(i) elle l'a en la
possession ou garde réelle d'une autre personne, ou

(ii) elle l'a en un
lieu qui lui appartient ou non ou qu'elle occupe ou non, pour son propre usage
ou avantage ou celui d'une autre personne; et

b) Lorsqu'une de deux ou plusieurs personnes, au su et avec le
consentement de l'autre ou des autres, a une chose en sa garde ou possession,
cette chose est censée sous la garde et en la possession de toutes ces
personnes et de chacune d'elles.

Et l'article 300 édicté:

Pour l'application de l'article 296 et de
l'alinéa b) du paragraphe (1) de l'article 298, l'infraction
consistant à avoir en sa possession est consommée lorsqu'une personne a, seule
ou conjointement avec une autre, la

[Page 144]

possession ou le contrôle d'une chose mentionnée
dans ces articles ou lorsqu'elle aide à la cacher ou à en disposer, selon le
cas.

Ayant attentivement considéré la preuve et
tous les moyens de droit soulevés de la part de l'appelant, je dirais qu'au
regard de la loi et du dossier, rien ne permet d'écarter validement
la déclaration de culpabilité prononcée contre l'appelant
en première instance et confirmée par le jugement de la Cour du banc de la
reine siégeant en appel.

Je renverrais l'appel.

Appel rejeté.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Indictment—Duplicity—Charge of
selling as food “dead animals” contrary to s. 25(b) of Food and Drugs Act,
1952-53 (Can.), c. 88 and regulations—“Dead animals” defined by regulations as
either improperly killed or affected with disease—Whether indictment void for
duplicity—Whether two different modes of committing single offence—Criminal
Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 703.

Criminal law—Mandamus—County Court judge
erroneously quashing indictment for duplicity on preliminary objection—Whether
order lies to compel judge to proceed with indictment.

The appellant was charged with having sold as
food “dead animals” in violation of s. B.14.010 of the Food and Drug
Regulations, thereby committing an indictable offence contrary to s. 25(b)
of the Food and Drugs Act, 1952-53 (Can.), c. 38. At the trial after the
indictment was read and before a plea was entered, the appellant moved to have the
indictment quashed for duplicity. The County Court judge quashed the indictment
on that ground. The basis for his judgment being that by the definition in s.
14.012 of the regulations, “dead animals” could mean either animals not
properly killed or diseased animals. The Crown then moved for an order of
mandamus directing the County Court judge or some other judge of the County
Court to proceed with the trial on the indictment as framed. The order was
granted and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant
was granted leave to appeal to this Court, and argued that mandamus did

[Page 58]

not lie in this case, and secondly, that the
indictment was void for duplicity.

Held (Cartwright
and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Taschereau
C.J. and Judson and Ritchie JJ.: There was no duplicity on the face of the
indictment. It charged only the one offence of selling dead animals, and
regulation B.14.012 did no more than define two different modes of committing
the same offence. The phrase “dead animals” was not a synonym for meat. A
butcher sells meat, not “dead animals”.

Mandamus was available to the Crown in this
case. The cases of Re McLeod v. Amiro, 27 O.L.R. 232, R. v. Justices
of Middlesex (1877), 2 Q.B.D. 516 and R. v. Hannah and MacLean, 77
C.C.C. 32, did not touch the problem in the present case where the indictment
was quashed before plea and no trial was held. The trial judge can be compelled
to give a decision on the merits and it was no answer to such an application to
say that he had exercised his jurisdiction in quashing the indictment and that
such a decision could not be reviewed. The trial judge had the power to deal
with the form of the indictment and he was acting within his jurisdiction when
he erroneously quashed the indictment. He was there to try the charge. It was
proper, in the circumstances, to issue the writ of mandamus.

Per Cartwright
J., dissenting: The phrase “dead animal” is, for the purpose of the
regulations, given two special meanings to the exclusion of all other meanings.
The indictment must be read as if the extended meanings of that phrase were set
out in it. Regulation B.14.010, read, as it must be to render it intelligible,
with the definition of “dead animal”, creates two distinct offences and not one
offence which could be committed in two modes. The indictment was therefore
void for duplicity.

On the assumption that the trial judge’s
decision that the indictment was void for duplicity was wrong in law, mandamus
did not lie.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: There is no doubt that mandamus is an extraordinary remedy by which
a superior Court may direct any inferior tribunal to do some particular thing
which appertains to its duty and which it has declined to do, and where, as in
the present case, there is no other remedy available. But the argument of the
Crown that mandamus will lie to compel the trial judge to hear this case on the
merits, could not be supported. The trial judge did not decline jurisdiction
but accepted it and, as part of the legal merits of the case, found that the
indictment was void for duplicity. His decision was a decision upon the legal
merits. Consequently, mandamus to compel him to do his duty did not lie despite
the fact that the lower Courts were of the opinion that he was in error in the
performance of his duty.

The indictment, furthermore, was void for
duplicity.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, affirming the
granting of an order of mandamus by Grant J. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright and Spence
JJ. dissenting.

J.R. Maurice Gautreau, for the appellant.

T.D. MacDonald, Q.C., and Arthur C.
Whealy, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Judson and
Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

JUDSON J.:—The appellant Raymond Joseph Kipp was
charged with the offence of selling as food, dead animals or parts thereof in
violation of the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act. He was committed
for trial after a preliminary hearing and he elected to be tried under Part XVI
of the Criminal Code by a judge without a jury.

At the trial after the indictment was read and
before a plea was entered by the appellant, his counsel objected to the form of
the indictment. The County Court Judge quashed the indictment on the sole
ground that it was void for duplicity. The Crown then moved for an order of
mandamus directing the County Court Judge or some other Judge of the County
Court Judges’ Criminal Court for the County of Carleton to proceed with the trial of the
accused on the indictment as framed. Grant J. made this order and also set
aside the quashing of the indictment[1]. The
Court of Appeal affirmed the order of Grant J. Kipp now appeals with leave of
this Court.

I agree with Grant J. that this indictment is
not void for duplicity. It reads as follows:

That he, the said Raymond Joseph Kipp,
between the 9th day of August, A.D. 1961, and the 20th day of October, A.D.
1961, at the then Town of Eastview in the Province of Ontario, did unlawfully
sell as food dead animals or parts thereof in violation of Section B.14.010 of
the Food and Drug Regulations made by Order-in-Council P.C. 1954-1915 of the
8th December, 1954, as amended by Order-in-Council P.C. 1961-1097 of the 31st July,
1961, thereby committing an indictable offence contrary to paragraph (b)
of Section 25 of the Food and Drugs Act, Statutes of Canada 1952-53,
Chapter 38.

Regulation 14.010 simply provides that “No
person shall sell as food a dead animal or any part thereof.”

“Dead animal” is defined in Regulation B.14.012
as follows:

B.14.012 For the purpose of Section
B.14.010 and B.14.011, “dead animal” means a dead animal that

[Page 60]

(a) was not killed for the purpose
of food in accordance with commonly accepted practise of killing animals for
the purpose of food, which shall include exsanguination, or

(b) was affected with disease at the
time it was killed.

To me it is plain that there is no duplicity on
the face of this indictment. It charges only the one offence of selling dead
animals or parts thereof, and Regulation B.14.012 does no more than define two
different modes of committing the same offence. I cannot accept the phrase
“dead animals” as a synonym for meat. A butcher sells meat, not “dead animals”.

It is common ground that the Crown has no right
of appeal from this erroneous quashing of the indictment. The only remaining
question is whether an order of mandamus should issue directing the County
Court Judge to proceed with the trial. Again, for the reasons given by Grant
J., I am of the opinion that it should.

The appellant relies on Re McLeod v. Amiro[2]; The Queen v. Justices of Middlesex[3]; and Rex v. Hanna & McLean[4]. These are cases involving appeals
from summary convictions which in the opinion of the reviewing court were
finally but erroneously decided on the merits. The cases merely hold that such
decisions are not reviewable by way of mandamus. They do not touch the problem
in the present case where an indictment is quashed before plea and no trial is
held. All that the Crown is seeking is an order directing the County Court Judge
to proceed with the trial. If he proceeds with the trial and gives a decision,
that decision is open to appeal and is not reviewable on mandamus. But he can
be compelled to give a decision on the merits and it is no answer to such an
application to say that he has exercised his jurisdiction in quashing the
indictment and that such a decision cannot be reviewed.

The use of the word “jurisdiction” in this
context does not help one towards a solution. There is no dispute that the
judge had the power to deal with the form of the indictment and that he was
acting within his jurisdiction when he quashed the indictment. But he made an
error in quash-

[Page 61]

ing this indictment. He was there to try the
charge. As the matter stands now, unless the order of mandamus issues, the case
as framed cannot be tried and it should be so tried. It is proper, in the
circumstances, to issue the writ of mandamus. I approve of the reasons of Grant
J. on this point in their entirety[5].

I would dismiss the appeal. This being an indictable
offence, there can be no order as to costs either here or in the Court of
Appeal.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—The
proceedings in the courts below out of which this appeal arises are set out in
the reasons of my brother Spence.

Two questions were fully argued before us, (i)
whether in the circumstances mandamus lies, and (ii) whether the learned County
Court Judge erred in holding that the indictment was void for duplicity.

On the first of these questions I agree with the
reasons and conclusion of my brother Spence. As he points out, the decision
that mandamus does not lie renders it unnecessary, for the disposition of this
appeal, to deal with the second question; I think, however, that it is
desirable to express an opinion upon it because if this appeal be allowed the
respondent will be free to prefer a new indictment in the same words as that
which was quashed by Gibson C.C.J. and the Judge before whom it comes for
trial, in the absence of any expression by this Court, would, no doubt, follow
the judgment of Grant J., affirmed by the Court of Appeal, holding that the
indictment as framed was not void for duplicity.

The wording of the indictment is set out in full
in the reasons of my brother Spence. The important words are:

…did unlawfully sell as food dead animals
or parts thereof in violation of section B.14.010 of the Food and Drug
Regulations…

Regulation B.14.010 of the Food and Drug
Regulations reads as follows:

B.14.010—No person shall sell as food a
dead animal or any part thereof.

[Page 62]

The phrase “dead animal” is defined in
Regulation B.14.012 which reads as follows:

B.14.012 For the purpose of sections
B.14.010 and B.14.011, “dead animal” means a dead animal that

(a) was not killed for the purpose
of food in accordance with commonly accepted practice of killing animals for
the purpose of food, which shall include exsanguination, or

(b) was affected with disease at the
time it was killed.

It is obvious that the words of Regulation
B.14.010, standing alone, cannot have been intended to be given their plain and
ordinary meaning. The words are clear and simple English words; they are
unambiguous and if applied literally would bring about the result that every
retail dealer in the country commits an indictable offence whenever he makes a
sale of meat to a customer. Butchers do not sell parts of live animals.

The definition section, quoted above, makes this
plain. The phrase “dead animal” is, for the purpose of the regulation, given
two special meanings to the exclusion of all other meanings. I agree with
Gibson C.C.J. that the indictment must be read as if the extended meanings of
the phrase “dead animal” were set out in it. So read, the words of the charge
to which the appellant was called upon to plead were as follows:

…did unlawfully sell as food dead animals
or parts thereof which were not killed for the purpose of food in accordance
with commonly accepted practice of killing animals for the purpose of food,
which shall include exsanguination, or which were affected with disease at the
time they were killed.

The question is whether these words describe but
one offence which may be committed in two modes or describe two different
offences.

Counsel for the respondent relies on ss. 492 and
500 of the Criminal Code, which, so far as relevant read as follows:

492 (1) Each count in an indictment shall
in general apply to a single transaction and shall contain and is sufficient if
it contains in substance a statement that the accused committed an indictable
offence therein specified.

(2) The statement referred to in subsection
(1) may be…

(b) in the words of the enactment
that describes the offence or declares the matters charged to be an indictable
offence,…

[Page 63]

(6) Nothing in this Part relating to
matters that do not render a count insufficient shall be deemed to restrict or
limit the application of this section.

* * *

500. (1) A count is not objectionable by
reason only that

(a) it charges in the alternative
several different matters, acts or omissions that are stated in the alternative
in an enactment that describes as an indictable offence the matters, acts or
omissions charged in the count…

The effect of the corresponding sections dealing
with offences punishable on summary conviction was fully considered in the
reasons of this Court in Archer v. The Queen[6] and the effect of the sections
quoted above was dealt with as follows in the unanimous judgment of this Court
in Cox and Paton v. The Queen[7].
After quoting the relevant portions of ss. 492 and 500 the reasons
continue:

It is clear since the judgment of this
Court in Archer v. The Queen that these provisions do not render a count
good if the words of the enactment which are adopted in framing the count
describe more than one offence.

There is no difficulty in stating the applicable
principle of law; if the indictment in one count charges more than one offence
it is bad for duplicity. The question as to which there is room for differences
of judicial opinion is whether in a particular case the words of a count
describe one offence which may be committed in different modes or describe more
than one offence.

In the case at bar, in order to support the
submission that only one offence is charged, it is necessary to define the
single offence which is committed (a) when a butcher sells parts of a perfectly
healthy animal killed, for example, by being run into by a motor vehicle and
therefore not “in accordance with commonly accepted practice” and, (b) when a
butcher sells parts of a diseased animal.

Grant J. deals with this point as follows:

Here, as in Gatto v. The King (1938)
S.C.R. 423, there is only one offence charged, namely, that of selling.

The difficulty I have in accepting this is that
selling meat, simpliciter, is not an offence at all.

[Page 64]

To suggest that there is only one offence, “selling
meat for food in contravention of the regulations”, would be to beg the
question which is whether the prohibitions as to the sale of meat for food
contained in the regulations create more than one offence.

The one offence cannot be “selling meat for food
which is unfit for human consumption” because as in case (a) suggested above,
the flesh of an animal might be perfectly fit for human consumption but its
sale nonetheless forbidden because of the manner in which it was killed.

In my opinion, Regulation B.14.010, read, as it
must be to render it intelligible, with the definition of “dead animal”,
creates two distinct offences and I agree with Gibson C.C.J. that the
indictment was void for duplicity. It follows that I would allow the appeal.

I base my judgment on the two grounds, (i) that
Gibson C.C.J. was right in law in holding that the indictment was void for
duplicity and (ii) that, even on the assumption that his decision was wrong in
law, mandamus does not lie.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the orders
of the Court of Appeal and of Grant J. and direct that the application for an
order of mandamus stand dismissed. I would make no order as to costs in any
Court.

SPENCE J. (dissenting):—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario made on October 18, 1963, dismissing an appeal from the order of
Grant J. made on May 27, 1963.
By the latter order, Grant J. had issued a mandamus requiring Gibson C.C.J. to
hear and determine a charge against the appellant.

The appellant had been charged before Gibson
C.C.J. on an indictment which read as follows:

that he did, between the 9th day of August,
A.D. 1961, and the 20th day of October, A.D. 1961, at the then Town of Eastview
in the Province of Ontario, unlawfully sell as food dead animals or parts
thereof in violation of section B.14.010 of the Food and Drug Regulations made
by Order in. Council P.C. 1954-1915 of the 8th December, 1954, as amended by
Order in Council P.C. 1961-1097 of the 31st July, 1961, thereby committing an
indictable offence contrary to paragraph (b) of section 25 of the Food
and Drugs Act, Statutes of Canada 1952-53, Chapter 38,

On the commencement of the trial before Gibson
C.C.J. counsel for the appellant raised two points of law:

(1) whether the indictment is void for
duplicity, and

[Page 65]

(2) whether the pertinent regulations were
in force during the time covered by the alleged offence or offences.

Counsel later withdrew the second objection but
after argument Gibson C.C.J., in written reasons, allowed the first objection
and concluded his judgment with the words “the bill of indictment is,
therefore, quashed”.

Counsel for the appellant in this Court based
his appeal upon two propositions: firstly, that mandamus does not lie when the
trial judge quashes an indictment on the preliminary objection that the charge
is void for duplicity, and secondly, that the charge being void for duplicity,
even had Grant J. jurisdiction, he should not have allowed the mandamus.

It is my purpose in these reasons to deal only
with the first ground as I am of the opinion that is sufficient to dispose of
the appeal to this Court.

Counsel for the Attorney General of Ontario
submits in reply to the first ground the following propositions: firstly, that
mandamus, generally speaking, lies to compel the execution of a public duty
where no other specific remedy for enforcing the performance of that duty
exists. Secondly, that in the present case there is no other remedy available.
Thirdly, that mandamus will lie to compel the trial judge to hear a case on the
merits where he has wrongly declined jurisdiction on a preliminary point of
law, notwithstanding that his decision therein can be judicial in character.

There can be no doubt that mandamus is an
extraordinary remedy by which the superior Court may direct any inferior
tribunal to do some particular thing which appertains to its duty and which it
has declined to do: The Queen et al. v. Leong Ba Chai[8]; Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 2, pp.
84-5.

The writ will not issue when there is other
specific remedy available: The Queen v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue[9], (in Re Nathan 1884). It would
appear that in the present case there is no other remedy available for the
reconsideration of the judgment of Gibson C.C.J. As I have said, he concluded
his judgment by quashing the bill of indictment. The sole right of appeal by
the Attorney-General is found in s. 584(1) (a) of the Code and it is

[Page 66]

“against a judgment or verdict of acquittal of a
trial court…”

In Regina v. Leveille[10], the accused, a married woman,
although only 16 years of age, was charged with having stolen goods in her
possession. When she came before the municipal court her counsel moved that she
should be tried in the Social Welfare Court due to her age despite her marital status. The judge upheld the
motion and declined jurisdiction. Rinfret J. at p. 99, said:

(I quote the translation from page 100):

It is clear from the judgment of the
Municipal Court judge, at p. 10 of the record, that this was not a judgment of
acquittal.

The consequence is unavoidable: in the
circumstances the Crown has no right of appeal.

In Rex v. Hansher and Burgess[11], a County Court judge in general
sessions quashed the indictment. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal.
Masten J.A., at p. 74, said:

The nature and effect of the order in
question appears to be procedural merely and does not acquit the accused of the
charge which stands against him and the Crown is at liberty forthwith to lay a
new indictment: R. v. Bainbridge (1918) 30 C.C.C. 214 at 231.

The Attorney-General’s difficulty is in the
support of his third proposition. In Re McLeod v. Amiro[12], Riddell J. considered an application by
way of mandamus to compel a division court judge to reopen an appeal from a
police magistrate’s conviction and to hear and adjudicate upon the same. When
the appeal before the division court judge commenced, counsel for the appellant
took objection to the information as insufficient in form and substance. No
evidence was taken and the division court judge acceded to the argument of
counsel for the appellant and allowed the appeal on the sole ground that the
information was insufficient. At p. 234, Riddell J. said:

It is, of course, contended in the present
case that if the Court below decides on a preliminary point without going into
the merits, there is no real decision on the case, and mandamus will lie.

No doubt—but we must be sure that the point
upon which the decision rested was preliminary in reality and not on the
merits.

It is in the view that what the learned
judge decided was preliminary, that both the applicant and his solicitor swear
that “there was no argu-

[Page 67]

ment before the said judge of the legal
merits of the case—the only question being argued was the question of the
insufficiency of the information and complaint”. And, it is pointed out that
the Code (sec. 753) expressly provides that no judgment shall be given in
favour of the applicant upon an objection to the information and complaint
which objection was not taken before the magistrate. The learned Judge was, in
my opinion, wrong in the view he took of the appeal (I am of course speaking
only upon the material before me, and the facts may be quite different); but he
has the same power to go wrong that any other Judge has.

That such a decision is not on a matter
preliminary, but on the merits, is, to my mind, quite clear.

In coming to that conclusion, Riddell J. relied
upon the well-known and oft-quoted case of The Queen v. Justices of
Middlesex[13].
There, the appellant had been convicted before a metropolitan police magistrate
under a charge of breach of a statute which made punishable as a rogue and
vagabond “every person…using any subtle craft or device, by palmistry or
otherwise, to deceive and impose on any of His Majesty’s subjects”. The
conviction described the offence omitting the words “by palmistry or
otherwise”. On appeal to the Middlesex Sessions, counsel for the appellant
commenced with an objection that the omission of the above words made the
conviction bad. The justices after hearing the point argued retired and on
their return the assistant judge gave, it was alleged contrary to the view of
the majority, a decision quashing the conviction on the objection taken against
it. An application was made for a mandamus but the court composed of Mellor J.
and Lush J. dismissed 

However, they declined to adopt either
course and I think they are not the application. Mellor J., at p. 520, having
discussed the remedy of mandamus, said: amenable to our control, for they have
exercised their jurisdiction, and it is a cardinal rule when jurisdiction is
vested in magistrates or any body of men, which they may exercise so long as
they act within their authority, that however erroneously they decide, we
cannot supervise their decision.

Lush J. said at p. 521:

They returned, and they found the
conviction bad on the face of it. That is a decision upon the legal merits of
the case. If they decided upon the merits of the appeal, the legal merits, or
the merits of the matters of fact, we cannot order them to rescind that
decision. We are not a Court of Appeal from decisions of the magistrates, and,
however erroneously they may have decided, we have no power to interfere.

[Page 68]

Those two judgments have been followed in a
series of cases in the Courts throughout Canada. The judgment in McLeod v. Amiro has been criticized and
counsel for the Attorney‑General in this Court sought to distinguish it
on the ground that it was an appeal while the decision of the learned county
court judge in this case was at trial, but I can see no valid distinction here
as despite the fact that it was an appeal the appeal took the form of a trial
de novo in the McLeod case. Again, it is submitted, the McLeod case
was the decision of a single judge and against the weight of authority; it was,
however, the decision of Riddell J., a very great judge, and has been quoted
and adopted by many courts of appeal and by this Court: Re Ault[14]; Re Sigurdson[15]; Re R. v. Spiers[16]; R. v. Stacpoole[17]; R. v. Lebrecque et al.[18]

Although it was decided upon consent and without
argument on behalf of the accused, at p. 234 Riddell J. said: “Amiro, through
his counsel, consents: and a consent is also filed signed by the learned
Judge,” in my view, that certainly does not lessen the authority of the
decision. Counsel who applied for the grant of the mandamus was present and
evidently argued it extensively. Finally, it is said that the decision was
overruled by Regina
ex rel. Hickman v. Marshall[19].

In the latter case, the accused was charged
before the magistrate with a breach of s. 400 of the Air Regulations. On the
opening of the accused’s trial, his counsel made an objection that the charge
was barred by s. 693 (2) of the Code as it had been laid more than 6 months
after the time when the subject-matter of the proceedings arose. Counsel for
the informant submitted that the Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 23,
providing for a 12-months’ limitation was the effective provision. After
hearing argument the magistrate reserved his decision, accused pleaded not
guilty, and evidence was taken. The magistrate later delivered reasons that
because of the Code, s. 693(2), he lacked jurisdiction to

[Page 69]

try the accused and he endorsed the information
“no jurisdiction”. The informant appealed to the county court of the County of York and his appeal was dismissed
on the ground that no appeal lay. The Attorney-General for Ontario obtained leave to appeal to the
Court of Appeal of Ontario and
on that appeal Morden J. said at p. 79:

The right of appeal from summary
convictions is one created by statute and is of strict law, and unless such a
right is clearly given, it does not exist.

And at p. 80, speaking of the judgment of
Cartwright J. in this Court in R. v. Karpinski[20]:

In any event in that case the magistrate
did not decline jurisdiction as was done here and I am unable to equate a
denial of jurisdiction with an acquittal.

In view of my opinion that no appeal lay to
the County Court from the Magistrate’s ruling, it is unnecessary, in fact it
would be improper, to decide the second question upon which leave was granted
to appeal to this Court.

And at p. 81:

If the Magistrate persists in his opinion
that he has no jurisdiction, then mandamus would be the proper remedy…

The learned justice in appeal cited a number of
cases, inter alia, McLeod v. Amiro, but did not indicate whether he
disagreed or agreed with those decisions.

In my view, the distinction between the present
case on one hand and Regina ex rel. Hickman v. Marshall and the many
other cases cited by counsel for the Ontario Attorney-General is that in each
of the latter the court declined jurisdiction and did so usually in express
words. In the present case, the court accepted jurisdiction. It was an ordinary
case of a trial of an indictable offence where there had been a proper commitment
for trial on preliminary hearing. The trial judge, Gibson C.C.J., commenced the
trial and as part of the legal merits of the case found that the indictment was
void for duplicity. Therefore, the decision in The Queen v. Justices of
Middlesex was applicable. There the justices allowed the appeal because the
conviction was bad on the fact of it; as Lush J. said, “That is a decision upon
the legal merits of the case”. I am of the opinion that those words are

[Page 70]

exactly applicable to the actions of Gibson
C.C.J. in this case. His decision was a decision upon the legal merits.
Therefore, the learned county court judge having accepted jurisdiction and
acted on it, mandamus to compel him to do his duty does not lie despite the
fact that Grant J. and the Court of Appeal for Ontario were of the opinion that he was in error in the performance of his
duty.

As Riddell J. said in McLeod v. Amiro at
p. 236:

It makes no difference if the learned Judge
misconstrued sec. 753 of the Code—he has the power, untrammelled by me, to make
mistakes: and I can find no reason why a misconception of the meaning of a
statute is any worse than a misconception of a common law principle or
equitable rule.

McDonald J.A. in the British Columbia Court of
Appeal said in Rex v. Hanna & McLean[21]:

When a Court has entered upon a case and
has given a decision, however outrageous, it seems to me impossible to say it
has refused jurisdiction. To take that course is simply to sit in appeal on a
tribunal and to make mandamus another form of appeal. Although, as stated
above, Courts have often taken that course, I think that on the weight of
authority it cannot be justified. In order to justify awarding a mandamus to a
County Court Judge who has given a judgment, however absurd, the Court must say
that his judgment is no judgment, but a complete nullity… In my opinion the
County Court Judge has jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing of this appeal;
he did enter upon it; he was entirely wrong I think, in the course he took, for
the plain intention of the Criminal Code is that he ought to have tried
the case on the merits. Nevertheless, I have concluded that Robertson J., for
the reasons given in his judgment and on the authorities above mentioned, was
right in holding that he was powerless to compel the Judge in those proceedings
to do otherwise than he has done.

In that case, the respondent had been convicted
by a police magistrate on the charge of dangerous driving. He appealed to the
County Court judge pursuant to the provisions of the Code and when the appeal
came on he moved to quash on the ground that the evidence as disclosed by the
magistrate’s notes did not justify the conviction. The County Court judge
looked at the depositions, refused Crown’s counsel the right to call witnesses
and quashed the conviction on that ground.

In Dressler v. Tallman Gravel & Sand
Supply Ltd.[22], the
appellant laid an information against his employer under The Employment
Standards Act, 1957 (Man.), c. 20, charg-

[Page 71]

ing that the respondent had unlawfully failed to
pay him overtime rates. Upon the matter coming on before the magistrate for
trial, he, without hearing any evidence, ordered the charges dismissed on the
ground that the information was in reference to an offence which took place
more than six months before the institution of proceedings and also that the
information was void for duplicity. The employee appealed by way of stated case
and the respondent moved in the Court of Appeal, before any hearing on the
merits, to dismiss the appeal on the ground, inter alia, that no appeal
lay and that the appellant’s proper procedure was to move for mandamus. By
majority decision in the Court of Appeal of Manitoba the respondent’s motion was granted and the stated case quashed. On
appeal to this Court, the court adopted the dissenting judgment of Tritschler
J.A. in the Court of Appeal of Manitoba. Locke J. giving the judgment of the Court quoted from the judgment
of the learned justice in appeal and said at p. 569:

As to the objection that the proper
procedure was not by way of stated case but by mandamus to compel the
magistrate to exercise his jurisdiction, he pointed out that this was not the
case of a magistrate declining to enter upon a hearing because he was of the
opinion that he had no jurisdiction, but one in which, exercising his
jurisdiction, he had dismissed the information on grounds of law which appeared
to him sufficient.

With these conclusions, I agree and, with
the greatest respect for the contrary opinion of the learned Chief Justice of
Manitoba, I consider that the motion of the respondent to dismiss or quash the
stated case, as it was expressed, should have been dismissed and the questions
of law, which appear to me to be clearly raised, determined.

In the present case, I am of the opinion that the
learned County Court judge did not decline his jurisdiction but accepted it and
that therefore no mandamus lies. To the objection that this will result in
there being no way of reviewing the allegedly erroneous decision of the County
Court judge, it must be pointed out that such result need not be fatal. As was
said by Masten J.A. at p. 174, in Rex v. Hansher & Burgess, supra, the
Crown is at liberty forthwith to lay a new indictment. Boyd J. in Re
Ratcliffe v. Crescent Mills & Timber Company[23] said at p. 333:

That the plaintiff has no right of appeal
in this case under the Division Courts Act may be a defect of legislation but
it does not enlarge the remedy by mandamus.

[Page 72]

And in High, on Extra-Ordinary Remedies, 3rd
ed., at p. 186, the learned author states:

So when a court of appellate jurisdiction
has dismissed an appeal, upon the ground that the act allowing appeals in such
cases was unconstitutional and void, the writ will not go to compel the court
to revise its actions and to reinstate the appeal. And this is true, even
though the party aggrieved may have no other remedy to review the action of the
court, since the absence of another adequate or specific remedy is not of
itself ground for relief by mandamus. (The underlining is my own.)

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal.

Since drafting these reasons I have had the
opportunity of perusing the reasons of my brother Cartwright. I agree with his
conclusion that the indictment was void for duplicity and I concur in the
disposition of the appeal which he proposes.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Fraud—Employee
filing false expense accounts as a means of increasing salary—Belief by accused
of employer's sanction—Whether intention to defraud—Conviction quashed by Court
of Appeal—Whether quashing based on grounds of law—Whether quashing should be
upheld—Criminal Code 1953—54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 323(1).

The respondent, the Chief of the Quebec Liquor Police, was
convicted at trial under s. 323(1) of the Criminal Code on a number of
counts charging him with having defrauded the public and the Government of the Province
 of Quebec of various sums of money. In 1952, he applied for an increase in his
salary. He was told by the head of his Department, the Solicitor General who
had referred his application to the Attorney General, that he was entitled to
an increase but due to the fact that a general survey of salaries in the Civil
Service was in progress, an increase could not be granted at the time. However,
he was told that he could draw a certain amount per month by way of expenses. A
large number of the expense accounts which were thereafter submitted by the
respondent were admittedly fictitious. This practice continued until 1960 when
his salary was increased. Thereafter the presentation of expense accounts
ceased. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction. The Crown was granted leave
to appeal to this Court.

Held (Taschereau C.J., and Cartwright and Spence JJ., dissenting):
The appeal should be allowed and the verdict of guilty restored.

[Page 175]

Per Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: On the
uncontradicted evidence of the respondent himself, no other conclusion could be
reached than that he received provincial funds on the basis of the presentation
of expense accounts admittedly false and, that being so, no other conclusion in
law could be reached save that he had defrauded the provincial government and
the public of the amounts which he thus obtained. With the exception of certain
counts in the indictment on which he was acquitted, there was no evidence on
the basis of which any doubt, let alone a reasonable doubt, could arise as to
the respondent having incorporated, to effectuate the agreed scheme, items of
expenses which were fictitious and false. On an appeal from a conviction, if an
Appellate Court allows the appeal on the ground that certain specified evidence
creates a reasonable doubt, when, on a proper view of the law, that evidence is
not capable of creating any doubt, there is an error in law. It is no answer to
a charge of fraud to say that the fraud was suggested by the superior of the
accused nor is the proposition that the province and the public were not
defrauded by paying, out of public funds, false expense accounts, merely
because the respondent's salary was less than what he and his superiors thought
it ought to be. To hold so was an error in law.

The guilt of the respondent in the present appeal depended
upon the legal effect of facts found, or inferred, in the Courts below. This
raised questions of law in respect of which there was error. There was,
therefore, a right of appeal to this Court by the Crown.

Per Taschereau C.J., and Cartwright and Spence JJ., dissenting:
The judgment of the Court of Appeal was founded on grounds of fact or of mixed
fact and law and not solely on any ground of law in the strict sense. It
follows that this Court had no power to review the judgment of the Court of
Appeal, since it is a well-settled proposition that the Crown's right of appeal
to this Court is limited to questions of law in the strict sense and that when
a Court of Appeal has quashed a conviction on two grounds of which one is, and
the other is not, appealable to this Court, the appeal to this Court must be
dismissed.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment
of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec[1]
, quashing the conviction of the respondent. Appeal allowed, Taschereau C.J.,
and Cartwright and Spence J.J., dissenting.

Yvan Mignault, for the
appellant.

René Letarte and Cyrille
Goulet, for the respondent.

LE JUGE EN CHEF
(dissident):—Mon collègue M. le Juge
Cartwright a résumé tous les faits essentiels à la détermination de cette
cause, et il est donc inutile de les relater de nouveau. ll me suffira de dire
simplement que le juge de première instance a acquitté le prévenu sous sept des
chefs d'accusation, qu'il l'a trouvé coupable de tentative 

[Page 176]

de fraude sous trois chefs
distincts et a rendu un jugement de culpabilité sous tous les autres chefs.

La Cour du banc de la reine[2]
a cassé le jugement rendu en première instance, et permission spéciale a été
accordée au prévenu de loger un appel devant cette Cour. (Code Criminel
598).

Cet appel cependant ne peut
porter que sur des questions de droit et nullement sur des questions de faits
ou des questions mixtes de droit et de faits.

Dans le cas qui nous occupe, il
me semble clair que la majorité de la Cour du banc de la reine, en délivrant
son jugement, a fait reposer en partie ses conclusions sur des questions de
faits, ou au moins sur des questions mixtes de droit et de faits qu'il nous est
interdit de reviser.

II faut, pour que la Cour Suprême
du Canada ait juridiction, qu'il s'agisse d'une question de droit stricte dans
le vrai sens du mot. (508 C. Cr) (Rex. v. Décary[3]
).

Comme je crois que cet appel
comporte l'appréciation de questions de faits, je suis d'opinion que cette Cour
n'a pas juridiction et que l'appel doit être rejeté.

The judgment of Cartwright and
Spence JJ. was delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—This
is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, of the
District of Quebec1, dated July 26, 1963, allowing an appeal from the judgment
of His Honour Judge Dumontier dated September 28,1962, and directing that the
respondent be acquitted on all the counts on which he had been convicted.

On July 16, 1962, the
respondent, who had elected to be tried by a Judge without a jury, was
arraigned before His Honour Judge Dumontier on an indictment containing three
counts to which he pleaded ""not guilty"". We are concerned only with
count 3, which reads as follows:

3°. entre le 1er
janvier 1952 et le 1er juillet 1960, dans les cité et district de
Québec, étant Directeur de la Police des Liqueurs, donc Commandant à Québec,
par la supercherie, le mensonge et d'autres moyens dolosifs, soit en faisant ou
en faisant faire par des subalternes, des comptes de dépenses faux et fictifs
pour lui-même, fraudé le public en général et le Gouvernement de la Province de
Québec, pour une somme d'au moins $8,999.10, C.Cr. 323, par. 1 et 21.

[Page 177]

On July 17, 1962, the learned
trial judge ordered that this count be divided into 235 separate counts which
are set out in his judgment and in that of the Court of Queen's Bench. The
first of these reads as follows:—

3.-1. Le ou vers le 31 mai
1952, dans les cité et district de Québec, étant Directeur de la Police des
Liqueurs donc Commandant à Québec, par la supercherie, le mensonge et d'autres
moyens dolosifs, soit en faisant ou en faisant faire par des subalternes, des
comptes de dépenses faux et fictifs pour lui-même, fraudé le public en général
et le Gouvernement de la Province de Québec, pour une somme de $50.00, C.Cr.
323, par. 1 et 21;

The remaining 234 counts were
similarly worded except as to date and amount; the last charged an offence
committed on May 9, 1960.

The learned trial judge acquitted
the respondent on counts 15, 18, 38, 46, 89, 100 and 221; he found him guilty
of attempted fraud on count 128; on counts 23 and 229 he found him guilty for
lesser amounts than those charged; on all the other counts he found him guilty
as charged.

While the printed record consists
of many volumes the relevant facts may be stated comparatively briefly.

In May, 1940, the respondent was
appointed Chief of the Quebec Liquor Police at a yearly salary of $4,000; in
August, 1941, this was increased to $4,500. In 1952 the respondent applied for
an increase in salary to the then Solicitor-General who referred the matter to
Mr. Duplessis who was then both Attorney-General and Prime Minister. Mr.
Duplessis told the Solicitor-General that an enquiry was going on before the
Civil Service Commission into the question of raising the salaries of the
Quebec Liquor Police and of civil servants in general and that if he granted
the respondent an increase he would immediately be pressed with requests by
others and then said words to the following effect:

Vous direz à Lemire, ou vous
lui ferez dire que je l'autorise à retirer cinquante piastres ($50.00) par
mois, à titre de frais de représentation, ou de dépenses,

The evidence of the Solicitor-General
continued:

De retour à mon
bureau, j'ai dit à Lemire — je ne sais pas si c'est à lui personnellement ou si
c'est peut-être à Côté, ma mémoire n'est pas assez fidèle pour vous l'affirmer
que je l'ai dit à lui — mais je sais qu'il l'a su, ou à son adjoint, qui était
Wellie Côté, que le Procureur Général l'autorisait à retirer mensuellement un
montant de cinquante dollars ($50.00) à titre de frais de représentation, et
que dans le fond, était pour tenir lieu d'une augmentation de salaire qui
s'élevait à six cents piastres ($600.00) par année.

[Page 178]

The substance of this
conversation was communicated to the respondent by Wellie Côté who had been
appointed associate director of the Quebec Liquor Police in January, 1951, and
of whom Tremblay C.J. says that unofficially he was the respondent's superior.
At this time Côté handed the respondent a cheque of the Québec Liquor Police
for $50. Some days later Côté presented a document to the respondent for
signature. This was a printed form partially filled in in typewriting. The
following phrase was type-written:

Déplacement et frais de
séjour pour surveillance du travail.

Several blank spaces in the form
intended for the insertion of details were left blank. Above the signature of
the respondent appeared the following certificate:

Je certifie que les dépenses
plus haut mentionnées ont été nécessairement encourues dans l'intérêt de cette
cause et que le tout est conforme aux allocations accordées.

The form did not specify any
""cause"". It was dated ""May"".

Thereafter from time to time Côté
presented the respondent with a cheque and a similar form which the respondent
signed and in this manner the respondent received amounts totalling $50 a month
until the form dated February 17, 1953, was returned to the respondent marked
""annulé"".

On receipt of this the respondent
went to the office of the Provincial Auditor and had an interview with an
employee. The learned trial judge ruled that evidence of their conversation was
inadmissible and we do not know what was said between them. The question
whether this evidence was rightly excluded is not before us, and consequently,
I express no opinion on it.

Following this interview the
forms signed by the respondent were filled up in detail, specifying the place
visited, the hotel at which respondent stayed, the amount paid for railway fare
and the price paid for meals. There appears to be no doubt that a large number
of these forms were entirely false in fact and described trips which the respondent
had not taken.

In the year 1954 Côté advised the
respondent that he was authorized to draw $100 a month in this manner instead
of $50. This practice continued until May, 1960, when the respondent's annual
salary was increased to 

[Page 179]

$7,400 and he ceased to withdraw
any further sums in augmentation of his salary.

The learned trial judge finds as
a fact that the authorization to withdraw the sum of $50 was given orally by
the Attorney-General and communicated to the respondent but concluded as a
matter of law that it was ""nulle, de nullité absolue"". He goes on to
hold that the respondent could not have had an honest belief that he was
entitled to obtain the moneys which he did obtain by rendering expense accounts
which were false in fact. He finds as a fact that the great majority of the
expense accounts signed by the respondent were false and fictitious but does
not specify which particular ones were false and finds that about twice a year
the respondent went on trips of inspection in connection with which he would
have been entitled to receive his expenses. He does not make an express finding
as to whether Côté told the respondent he was authorized to draw $100 monthly
instead of $50. At the time of the trial both the Attorney-General and Côté had
died.

The respondent appealed against
his convictions. On October 1, 1962, the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side,
granted him leave to appeal on questions of fact.

The appeal was heard by a Court
composed of Tremblay C.J.P.Q. and Casey and Taschereau JJ. The appeal was
allowed and it was directed that the respondent be acquitted on all the counts
on which he had been convicted. All the members of the Court reached the same
result but each gave separate reasons.

On October 2, 1963, leave was
granted to the Crown to appeal to this Court on the following three questions:

1. La Cour d'Appel du
district de Québec a-t-elle erré en droit dans l'interprétation et
l'application de l'article 592(1) (a) de Code Criminel du Canada?

2. La Cour d'Appel du
district de Québec a-t-elle erré si elle a ignoré les lois gouvernant la
manipulation et la dépense des deniers publics et a-t-elle mal interprété les
lois applicables dans l'espéce?

3. La Cour d'Appel du
district de Québec a-t-elle erré en droit dans l'interprétation et
l'application de l'article 323(1) du Code Criminel?

This leave was granted pursuant
to s. 598(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. Authority is not required for the
wellsettled proposition that the Crown's right of appeal is limited to
questions of law in the strict sense.

[Page 180]

It is clear from the judgment of
this Court in The Queen v. Warner[4],
that where a Court of Appeal has quashed a conviction on two grounds of which
one is, and the other is not, appealable to this Court, the appeal to this
Court must be dismissed.

I am satisfied that in the case
at bar the judgment of the Court of Appeal was founded on grounds of fact or of
mixed fact and law and not solely on any ground of law in the strict sense.

Tremblay C.J. holds that as to
the first 17 counts, in regard to which the certificates signed by the
respondent named no ""cause"" and gave no details, the money was paid
over to the respondent before he signed the certificates which constituted
rather receipts for money paid than demands for payment and that no one was in
fact deceived or induced to pay over the money by any representation on the
part of the respondent. This is a finding of fact or, at the highest from the
point of view of the appellant, a mixed finding of fact and law.

As to the remainder of the counts
the learned Chief Justice expresses himself as follows:

Quant aux autres
chefs, entre en jeu une considération différente qui me paraît péremptoire.

La preuve révéle hors de
tout doute—l'appelant l'a d'ailleurs admisque certains frais inscrits sur les
formules n'ont pas été encourus par l'appelant. Mais il résulte aussi de la
preuve que la Couronne n'a pas prouvé hors de doute raisonnable qu'aucun de ces
frais n'a été encouru. Le malheur, c'est qu'il est impossible de pointer du
doigt ceux qui ont été réellement encourus et ceux qui ne l'ont pas été. La seule preuve apportée par la Couronne sur
ce point révèle que l'appelant était à son bureau de Québec la plupart du
temps. Les témoins admettent cependant
qu'il s'absentait quelques fois par année. L'appelant a retrouvé deux formules
qui contenaient des frais réellement encourus. Il a juré qu'il y en avait
sûrement d'autres mais que sa mémoire ne lui permettait pas de les retracer
après tant d'années. Il faut dire que l'appelant était âgé de 74 ans lors de
son témoignage. Son assertion, rendue plausible par la preuve de la Couronne,
me paraît nettement suffisante pour engendrer un doute raisonnable. D'ailleurs,
le premier juge a acquitté l'appelant des deux chefs d'accusation qu'il a pu
préciser. De son propre chef, il a retranché du montant allégué dans d'autres
chefs les frais du permis de conduire de l'appelant que celui-ci avait le droit
de recouvrer.

De ce qui précède il
résulte que, même si j'admets l'existence du lien de causalité entre le
paiement et les représentations, je ne puis dire quant à quels chefs
d'accusation en particulier les représentations sont fausses et quant à quels
chefs elles sont vraies, sauf quant au chef numéro 18 qui fait double emploi
avec le chef numéro 17 et sur lequel l'appelant a été acquitté. Le substitut du procureur général a d'ailleurs
franchement admis

[Page 181]

lors de l'audition qu'il est
impossible de prouver quels chefs d'accusation précis sont bien fondés. La
seule conclusion logique, c'est qu'aucun n'a été prouvé hors de tout doute
raisonnable et que l'appelant doit être acquitté sur tous les chefs.

This appears to me to be a
finding of fact. The learned Chief Justice has considered the evidence and
reached the conclusion that it does not establish, beyond a reasonable doubt,
the guilt of the accused upon any of the counts on which he was convicted. I
find it impossible to say that the question whether he was right in reaching
this conclusion is one of law in the strict sense.

TASCHEREAU J. delivered the
following reasons:

Les faits révélés par la
preuve et qu'ont exposés M. le Juge en chef et M. le Juge Casey démontrent que
de graves irrégularités ont été commises par l'appelant. Mais la question vitale est celle de savoir si
Lemire, un homme maintenant âgé de 74 ans qui a été directeur de la police des
liqueurs à Québec, pendant vingt ans, avait l'intention coupable de frauder le
public et le gouvernement de la Province de Québec, lorsqu'il a posé les actes
qu'on lui reproche.

L'étude du dossier m'a convaincu
qu'il fallait répondre négativement â cette question. Aussi, commes mes
collègues, j'accueillerais l'appel et libérerais l'accusé:

The first paragraph accurately
states a question which the Court of Appeal was called upon to answer. It
involves an inquiry into the respondent's state of mind. The state of a man's
mind is, in the often quoted words of Bowen L.J., as much a fact as the state
of his digestion; vide Edgington v. Fitzmaurice[5].
The decision of Taschereau J. to allow the appeal appears to me to be based on
a finding of fact certainly it cannot be said that the sole ground on which he
has proceeded is a question of law in the strict sense.

From this it appears that a
majority of the Court of Appeal, in quashing the convictions, have proceeded on
grounds which this Court has no power to review and it follows that the appeal
must be dismissed.

Having reached this conclusion it
becomes unnecessary for me to consider whether it could be said that the
judgment of Casey J. was based only on grounds which this Court has
jurisdiction to review and I express no opinion on that question.

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 182]

The judgment of Fauteux, Abbott,
Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.:—The material facts
involved in this case are not in dispute. At all relevant times the respondent
Lemire (hereinafter referred to as ""Lemire"") was the Chief of the
Quebec Liquor Police. There was an Associate Chief, one Wellie Côté, who was in
fact, though not in name, the real head of the force. In the year 1952 Lemire
applied to the Solicitor-General of Quebec for an increase in his salary, which was then $4,500
per annum. The Solicitor-General referred the application to the Attorney-General,
Mr. Duplessis, who was then also the Prime Minister of the Province. The
latter, while he approved of an increase for Lemire, was not prepared to grant
it, because it might provoke other similar requests, and the whole salary
structure of the Quebec civil service was then under review. He told the
Solicitor-General to tell Lemire that he would authorize Lemire to draw $50 per
month by way of expenses. This information was communicated to Lemire by Côté.

I agree with Casey J. in the
Court[6] below
when he says that the instructions given by the Attorney-General necessarily
implied the making of fictitious expense accounts.

Lemire commenced, in May, 1952,
to put in expense accounts, initially for $50 per month and then, commencing on
July 15, 1952, for $25 for each half month, represented to be for ""Frais
de déplacement et de séjour pour surveillance du travail."" Each of these
expense accounts contained the following certificate, signed by Lemire:

Je certifie que les dépenses
plus haut mentionnées ont été nécessairement encourues dans l'intérêt de cette
cause et que le tout est conforme aux allocations accordées.

The expense account dated
February 14, 1953, was returned to Lemire, by the Provincial Auditor's
Department, marked ""annulé"". Lemire then saw an employee of that
Department who is unkown. The learned trial judge ruled that evidence by Lemire
as to his interview with the employee was not admissible. In any event Lemire
filed an expense account, dated February
 15, 1953, purporting to contain the
details of his expenditures, totalling $25.

[Page 183]

Thereafter, until the beginning
of the year 1954, he proceeded to file two, and occasionally three, expense
accounts each month, appearing to contain items of expenditure which he had
incurred, each one of which contained the certificate previously quoted. Each
of these was for an odd amount and not for an even $25.

Early in the year 1954 Lemire
says that he was advised by Côté that his monthly expense accounts could be
increased to $100. At the time of the trial Côté was dead. Evidence was given
by the former Solicitor-General that he was unaware of any authority having
been given for any increase beyond the initial, fixed amount of $50 per month.
Commencing in 1954, Lemire's total expense accounts rendered each month became
larger. In most instances two accounts were filed in each month, although on
some occasions there would be three or more.

This practice continued until the
year 1960, when Lemire received a salary increase to $7,400 per annum.
Thereafter the presentation of expense accounts ceased.

The procedure respecting expense
accounts was that two forms were required to be filed, one white and one
yellow, the latter being retained in the office of the Liquor Police. The white
one, signed by the person seeking payment of expenses, had to be verified by
the accountant of the Liquor Police, was then forwarded to the Department of
the Attorney-General and, from there, was transmitted to the office of the
Provincial Auditor for approval. Section 17 of the Provincial Audit Act,
R.S.Q. 1941, c.72, required that such accounts be examined and that it be
ascertained that the payments charged be supported by voucher.

It is clear, from this brief
outline of the facts, the material portions of which are admitted by Lemire,
that, over a period of years, he submitted expense accounts which he knew to be
false and obtained payment out of the public funds of the Province of Quebec of those amounts which were claimed in the expense accounts.

Lemire was charged under s.
323(1) of the Criminal Code, which provides:

323. (1) Every one who, by
deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, whether or not it is a false
pretence within the meaning of this Act, defrauds the public or any person,
whether ascertained or not, of any property, money or valuable security, is
guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten years.

[Page 184]

The learned trial judge required
that the original count, which had charged Lemire with defrauding the public
and, in particular, the Government of the Province of Quebec, of the sum of $8,999.10,
be divided into 235 separate counts, each dealing with one expense account.

Count No. 1 will serve as an
example of the form in which these various charges were made:

1. le ou vers le 31
mai 1952, dans les cité et district de Québec, étant Directeur de la Police des
Liqueurs dont Commandant à Québec, par la supercherie, le mensonge et d'autres
moyens dolosifs, soit en faisant ou en faisant faire par des subalternes, des
comptes de dépenses faux et fictifs pour lui-même, fraudé le public en général
et le Gouvernement de la Province de Québec, pour une somme de $50.00, C.Cr.
323, par. 1 et 21;

The learned trial judge acquitted
the respondent on counts 15, 18, 38, 46, 89, 100 and 221; he found him guilty
of attempted fraud on count 128; on counts 23 and 229 he found him guilty for
lesser amounts than those charged; on all the other counts he found him guilty
as charged.

Lemire's appeal to the Court of
Queen's Bench, Appeal Side[7], was
allowed by unanimous decision. The Court was composed of Tremblay C.J.P.Q. and
Casey and Taschereau JJ., each of whom gave separate reasons.

As to the first 17 counts, which
dealt with those expense accounts rendered by Lemire prior to and including
that dated February 14, 1953, which was annulled by the Auditor-General, Tremblay
C.J. says:

Pour ces 17 premiers
cas, l'appelant témoigne, et il n'est pas contredit, que les chèques lui
étaient remis soit avant, soit au moment même où on lui demandait de signer les
formules. Ce ne sont donc pas les
représentations contenues dans ces formules qui ont amené le consentement au
paiement. C'était un reçu que l'appelant signait plutôt qu'une demande de
paiement.

De plus, il ne me paraît pas
raisonnable de croire que quelqu'un ait pu être trompé par ces formules. Bien
que la partie imprimée de la formule l'exigeât, aucune date de départ ou de
retour, aucun détail des supposés frais ne sont donnés. Le certificat qui réfère à «l'intérêt de cette cause»
n'a pu tromper personne puisqu'aucune cause n'est mentionnée. ll manque donc un
élément de l'offense: le lien de causalité entre le consentement au paiement et
les représentations de l'appelant. ll est possible que ceux qui ont payé
n'avaient pas le pouvoir de disposer ainsi des fonds publics, mais il y aurait
alors recours civil en répétition de l'indû mais non crime de fraude.

L'on dira peut-être
que ce raisonnement est exact quant au «gouvernement de la province de Québec»
mais non quant «au public en général» que l'appelant est aussi accusé d'avoir «fraudé».
Si l'on considère le public indépendamment de son mandataire, le gouvernement
de la province, il faut décider que, si l'appelant est coupable d'un crime, ce
n'est pas de

[Page 185]

celui de fraude,
parce que le public n'a jamais consenti au paiement et que le consentement de
la personne frustrée est un élément essentiel du crime de fraude.

With respect, I think it is an
error in law to construe the forms signed by Lemire as being receipts, rather
than demands for payment, merely because, according to his evidence, after the
first occasion, the signed form was handed him by Côté at the same time that he
received the cheque from Côté. The cheques which were delivered by Côté were
drawn on the account of the Liquor Police. They were signed by Côté, as
director, and also by the accountant of the Liquor Police. They represented
payments from public funds, which, admittedly, could only be validly justified
by proper vouchers, and these Côté had to obtain. Expense moneys were payable
only on the basis of a certified statement of actual expense. Each such
statement had to be verified and thereafter to be approved by the Auditor-General.
It is obvious that Lemire could not have continued to receive the cheques
without having provided the false statements which were the basis for their
issuance. The scheme must be examined as a whole and, when that is done, there
is no question but that false expense accounts were submitted by Lemire as a
basis for his receipt of public funds. This constitutes the ""lien de
causalite"" between the vouchers and the payments which the learned Chief
Justice felt was lacking in this case.

It is suggested that no one was
deceived by these expense accounts because they did not contain a detailed list
of the expenditures as contemplated by the form. To say this is to say either that
the persons required by law to check the forms were themselves also parties to
the fraud, or that they failed to perform their duties properly. However, even
if this be so, and whichever is the case, this does not provide Lemire with an
answer in law to the charges under s. 323(1). Whether or not they deceived the
people who were supposed to check and verify them, the point is that, without
filing of the expense accounts, the payments to Lemire from public funds could
not have been obtained or continued. Section 323(1), in addition to mentioning
deceit and falsehood, also refers to ""other fraudulent means"".
Whether or not they deceived the people who saw them, they were the necessary
means used to obtain the payments and without them the payments would not have

[Page 186]

been made. They were fraudulent.
In my opinion the ground taken in the second paragraph above quoted is wrong in
law.

In the third paragraph of the
passage above quoted it is said that the public was not defrauded because the
public never consented to the payment. There is here an error in law. The
public, through its elected representatives, had consented to the expenditure
of public funds only on the basis of compliance with the requisite statutory
procedures. In my opinion any one who, by fraudulently purporting to fulfill
those requirements, obtained payment of public moneys, to which he was not
lawfully entitled, would thereby have defrauded the public within the meaning
of s. 323(1).

I find it impossible to see how,
on the uncontradicted evidence of Lemire himself, any other conclusion can be
reached than that he received provincial funds on the basis of the presentation
of expense accounts admittedly false and, that being so, I do not see how any
other conclusion in law can be reached save that he had defrauded the
Provincial Government and the public of the amounts which he thus obtained.

In this connection the reasoning
of Cartwright J., who delivered the unanimous decision of this Court in Cox
and Paton v. The Queen[8],
is relevant. In that case the accused were charged with having conspired to
commit an indictable offence; i.e., by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent
means to defraud Brandon Packers Limited. It was contended in argument that
there was no evidence that any official of that company had been deceived,
particularly as the president of the company and its controlling shareholder
was fully aware of all that was being done by the accused. Dealing with this
argument, Cartwright J., at p. 512, said:

In the course of argument on
this branch of the appeal counsel for the appellants submitted that there was
no evidence that the appellants defrauded Brandon Packers Limited or that they
intended to do so because, as it was said, there was no evidence of any false
representation made to the company or of any official of the company have been
deceived into parting with the moneys referred to in the particulars furnished.
Assuming, without deciding, that there was a dissent on this point within the
meaning of s. 597(1) of the Criminal Code,, I would reject this
argument. I will examine it only in connection with the transaction relating to
the $200,000 which is the first item in the particulars. I have already
indicated my agreement with the statement of Freedman J.A.

[Page 187]

that ""implicit in the
entire transaction was the representation of the accused that this was a
legitimate bona fide investment for Brandon Packers Limited to
make"" and with his view that there was ample evidence to warrant a finding
that this representation was false to the knowledge of the accused. If it
deceived Donaldson, who was still nominally at least in control of the company
into paying over the $200,000 to Fropak that would be a fraud on the company.
If, on the other hand, it is suggested that Donaldson was not deceived but paid
the money over knowing that the transaction was not bona fide, that the
Fropak shares were worthless and that their purchase was merely a step in a
scheme to enable the accused to buy the shares of Brandon Packers Limited with
its own money, that would simply be to say that Donaldson was particeps
criminis. If all the directors of a company should join in using its funds
to purchase an asset which they know to be worthless as part of a scheme to
divert those funds to their own use they would, in my opinion, be guilty under
s. 323(1) of defrauding the company of those funds. Even supposing it could be
said that, the directors being ""the mind of the company"" and well
knowing the true facts, the company was not deceived (a proposition which I
should find it difficult to accept), I think it clear that in the supposed case
the directors would have defrauded the company, if not by deceit or falsehood,
by ""other fraudulent means"".

As to the expense accounts
submitted after February 14, 1953, the learned Chief Justice says:

Quant aux autres chefs,
entre en jeu une considération différente qui me paraît péremptoire.

La preuve révèle
hors de tout doute—l'appelant l'a d'ailleurs admis—que certains frais inscrits
sur les formules n'ont pas été encourus par l'appelant. Mais, il résulte aussi
de la preuve que la Couronne n'a pas prouvé hors de doute raisonnable qu'aucun
de ces frais n'a été encouru. Le malheur, c'est qu'il est impossible de pointer
du doigt ceux qui ont été réellement encourus et ceux qui ne l'ont pas été. La seule preuve apportée par la Couronne sur ce point
révèle que l'appelant était à son bureau de Québec la plupart du temps. Les
témoins admettent cependant qu'il s'absentait quelques fois par année. L'appelant a retrouvé deux formules qui
contenaient des frais réellement encourus. ll a juré qu'il y en avait sûrement
d'autres mais que sa mémoire ne lui permettait pas de les retracer après tant
d'années. ll faut dire que l'appelant était âgé de 74 ans lors de son
témoignage. Son assertion, rendue plausible par la preuve de la Couronne, me
paraît nettement suffisante pour engendrer un doute raisonnable. D'ailleurs, le premier juge a acquitté l'appelant des
deux chefs d'accusation qu'il a pu préciser. De son propre chef, il a retranché
du montant allégué dans d'autres chefs les frais du permis de conduire de
l'appelant que celui-ci avait le droit de recouvrer.

De ce qui précède il
résulte que, même si j'admets l'existence du lien de causalité entre le
paiement et les représentations, je ne puis dire quant à quels chefs
d'accusation en particulier les représentations sont fausses et quant à quels
chefs elles sont vraies, sauf quant au chef numéro 18 qui fait double emploi
avec le chef numéro 17 et sur lequel l'appelant a été acquitté. Le substitut du
procureur général a d'ailleurs franchement admis lors de l'audition qu'il est
impossible de prouver quels chefs d'accusation précis sont bien fondés. La
seule conclusion logique, c'est qu'aucun chef n'a été prouvé hors de tout doute
raisonnable et que l'appelant doit être acquitté sur tous les chefs.

[Page 188]

Before this Court, counsel for
the appellant impressed upon us that there must have been a misunderstanding
with respect to the admission referred to in the last paragraph, in the passage
above quoted, as having been made by counsel for the Attorney-General. Counsel
before us advised that he did not think that such an admission had been made.
It certainly had not been intended to make any such admission on behalf of the
Crown, and the record would not support the making of it.

In my opinion the conclusion
reached in this passage is also wrong. Lemire was asked, in his evidence, to
indicate which of the expense accounts in evidence represented expenditures
really incurred by him. He was able to identify only two. The following is the
evidence which he gave in chief in this connection:

PAR Me RENÉ LETARTE,

De la part de l'accusé:

Q. Alors, en somme,
monsieur Lemire, dans cette période, allant de mai, mil neuf cent-cinquante-deux
(1952), à mai, mil neuf cent-soixante (1960), vous dites que vous avez été
autorisé à recevoir cinquante dollars ($50.00) par mois jusqu'en mil neuf cent
cinquante-quatre (1954)?

R. Oui.

Q. C'est-à-dire huit (8)
mois en mil neuf cent cinquante-deux (1952), c'est ça?

R. C'est ça.

Q. Et douze (12) mois, en
mil neuf cent cinquante-trois?

R. Oui.

Q. Ce qui fait vingt (20)
mois à cinquante dollars ($50.00), soit mille dollars ($1,000.00)?

R. C'est ça.

Q. Et ce que vous
dites, c'est qu'à partir de mil neuf cent cinquante-quatre (1954), jusqu'à mil
neuf cent soixante (1960), c'était cent dollars ($100.00) par mois?

R. C'est ça.

Q. Est-ce que vous pourriez
nous dire, effectivement, combien vous avez pris sur ces montants-là, pendant
cette période-là?

R. Bien, je calcule que je dois
avoir pris entre huit mille (8,000) et huit mille six cents piastres
($8,600.00).

Q. Je comprends également
qu'il y a des comptes de dépenses, pour plus ce montant là?

R. Absolument.

Q. Comment expliquez-vous
cette difference-là?

R. Bien ça, je ne peux pas
le dire, parce que j'ai fait des voyages, et dans les comptes, je ne les ai pas
vus.

Q. Alors, est-ce que vous
voulez dire que la différence représenterait vos dépenses réelles?

R. Oui.

[Page 189]

Q. Et, vous avez dit tout à
l'heure que vous êtes même d'opinion qu'il en manque des comptes de dépenses?

R. Je le crois.

PAR LA COUR:

Q. Seriez-vous
capable, en examinant chacun des exhibits, nous dire si vous ne pourriez pas
reconnaître des comptes, pour des dépenses que vous auriez réellement faites
pour des voyages?

R. Bien, j'ai
regardé avec Me Letarte, j'en ai vu une couple.

D'autre part, j'ai des
comptes qui ont été faits pour des voyages, et je ne les ai pas vus.

Q. Alors, est-ce que vous
pourriez m'indiquer ceux-là que vous avez vus?

Si vous avez besoin d'un
ajournement pour examiner les comptes attentivement, je vais vous permettre de
le faire.

R. On les a examinés tous
les deux.

PAR Me RENÉ LETARTE,

De la part de l'accusé:

Moi, je ne peux pas
témoigner.

PAR LA COUR:

Q. Mais, vous m'avez dit, si
j'ai bien compris, que dans les exhibits produits, il y en aurait deux (2) que
vous avez reconnus comme représentant des dépenses que vous auriez réellement
faites à l'occasion de voyages?

R. Oui.

Q. Pour le bénéfice de la
Police des Liqueurs?

R. Oui.

Q. Alors, pourriez-vous les
indiquer à la Cour, dans les exhibits, ces deux-là?

R. Oui, il y a un
voyage en Gaspésie, je pense, au commencement de septembre, mil neuf cent
cinquante-neuf (1959).

Q. Il s'agit de quel
exhibit?

PAR LE GREFFIER:

P.-221.

PAR LE TÉMOIN:

R. Oui, quarante-deux
piastres et trent-cinq ($42.35).

PAR LA COUR:

Q. Ce sont des dépenses
réelles que vous avez assumées pour du travail à la Police des Liqueurs?

R. Oui.

Et il y en a un autre, je me
rappelle pas de la date, c'est un voyage aux environs de La Tuque et Berthier.

PAR Me LETARTE,

De la part de l'accusé:

Q. Maintenant, voici à part
ces deux voyages-là, voulez-vous dire qu'intégralement . . .

PAR LA COUR:

J'aimerais bien qu'on le
retrace avant de clore la Défense; j'aimerais bien qu'on le retrace.

[Page 190]

PAR Me RENÉ
LETARTE,

De la part de l'accusé:

Q. Ce serait en quelle
année, çà, celui-là en particulier?

R. Je me rappelle
pas, je ne sais pas si c'est en cinquante-six (56), ou en cinquante-sept (57),
c'est pas mal loin en arrière.

Q. Est-ce qu'il y
aurait eu une note particulière, sur ce compte-là?

R. Oui, il y aurait eu le
nom de Letarte et de Laforest, dessus.

PAR LE GREFFIER:

Alors, ce serait P.-38.

PAR Me RENÉ LETARTE,

De la part de l'accusé:

Q. C'est ça, P.-38, en
novembre, mil neuf cent cinquante-trois (1953)?

R. Oui, pour un montant de
vingt-neuf et vingt-cinq ($29.25).

Q. Alors, ça, ce sont deux
comptes, dans les comptes auxquels vous venez de référer, pour lesquels vous
vous souvenez positivement qu'il s'agit intégralement de dépenses réelles?

R. Absolument.

Q. Maintenant, dans les
autres cas, dans les autres comptes, qu'est-ce qu'il y a là-dedans?

R. C'est parce qu'on a fait
un voyage à Saint-Hilaire, aussi, dans le temps, c'est près de Beloeil, ça.

PAR LA COUR:

Q. Dans le comté de Rouville?

R. Oui.

Ensuite, j'en ai fait à Chicoutimi.

PAR Me RENÉ LETARTE,

De la part de l'accusé:

Q. Maintenant, est-ce que
des comptes séparés et distincts étaient faits pour ces autres voyages-là, ou
bien non, si vos dépenses étaient dissimulées dans d'autres comptes?

R. Je ne faisais pas de
distinction, des fois je le marquais dans le mois, avec l'autre, là.

Q. Vous mêliez ça ensemble?

R. Oui.

Q. Et ce que nous allons
appeler votre allocation, et les dépenses réelles qui vous étaient occasionnées
dans le mois?

R. Absolument.

Q. C'était fondu ensemble?

R. Oui.

Q. Maintenant, vous dites
que, toutefois, dans cette liste-là, il y a deux cas où ce sont des comptes
réellement distincts pour des voyages en particulier?

R. Oui.

This evidence can be summarized
as follows:

1. Of the expense accounts which
were exhibits, Lemire could identify only two as representing genuine expenses.

2. He thought there were other
expense accounts which

[Page 191]

he had submitted which were not
included among the exhibits at the trial.

3. He thought that some of the
expense accounts which were exhibits, apart from the two which he had
specifically identified, included both real and false expenses mingled
together.

To say that, on this evidence, a
reasonable doubt exists as to Lemire's guilt on each and every charge is, in my
view, wrong in law.

In the first place, Lemire does
not appear to go any further in relation to the expense accounts, other than
the two which he identified, than to say that some of them may have contained a
mixture of real and false expenditures. Even accepting this evidence, it would
be wrong in law to hold that he was entitled to an acquittal in respect of an
expense account which contained some real expenditures as well as false
expenditures merely because the amount charged in the count would then be
larger, by the amount of the real expenditures, than the amount which he
actually obtained by fraud. To hold that, in such a case, Lemire was entitled
to an acquittal is an error in law.

In the second place, the
conclusion of the learned Chief Justice as to the existence of a reasonable
doubt on all counts has no basis on the evidence. Lemire admitted that the
express purpose of filing the expense accounts was. in order to obtain payments
to him equivalent to $50 per month, and later $100 per month. An examination of
the total of the accounts rendered for each month and also for each year
establishes, beyond peradventure, that in practically every month, from 1952 to
1960, inclusive, a part, if not the whole, of each account rendered represented
expenses not actually incurred. An example will illustrate the point which I am
seeking to make. In October, 1954, after Lemire had increased his expense
account payments from $50 to $100 per month, he rendered two expense accounts,
one on October 8 for $48.90, another on October 22 for $53.25, making a total
for the month of $102.15. This total exceeds the $100 which he was seeking to
obtain in lieu of salary increase by only $2.15. Each of the two expense
accounts was for more than that amount. Similarly, in the following month of
November three accounts were 

[Page 192]

rendered, one on November 8 for
$35.90, one on November 20 for $41.90, one on November 25 for $29.10, making a
total of $106.90. In December the monthly total was $76.50, made up of two
accounts, one on December 4 for $33.85, the second on December 16 for $42.65.
In view of Lemire's own admission as to the basic purpose for which the
accounts were rendered, it seems to me to be impossible to conclude that any
one of these seven accounts mentioned related only to expenditures genuinely
incurred. This illustration could be repeated many times.

With the exception of those
counts on which Lemire was acquitted, in my opinion, there was no evidence on
the basis of which, as to each and every expense account submitted by him, any
doubt, let alone a reasonable doubt, could arise as to Lemire's having
incorporated, to effectuate the agreed scheme, items of expense which were
fictitious and false.

In my opinion, on an appeal from
a conviction, if an appellate court allows the appeal on the ground that
certain specified evidence creates a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the
accused, when, on a proper view of the law, that evidence is not capable of
creating any doubt as to his guilt, there is an error in law.

I turn now to the reasons given
by Casey J., who said:

Despite what is said in the
judgment and in respondent's factum, the facts of this case are crystal clear
and surprisingly simple. Appellant wanted an increase and the one who
controlled every aspect of the Government's business and certainly that of
appellant's department, the Attorney General and Prime Minister, felt that his
request was a legitimate one and that it should be granted. But there was a fly
in the ointment. An enquiry into the government's salary structure was under
way and it would have been embarrassing to grant an increase at that moment. In
fact ""that moment"" dragged on and on and the results of the enquiry
were given effect only in November of 1959. So the means above described were
devised.

Without commenting on the
propriety or prevalence of this method of granting disguised salary increases,
and without asking why appellant's situation was not regularized post factum, I
give it as my view that in the circumstances obtaining throughout this whole
period appellant was entitled to believe that for reasons of higher policy he
was given an increase in this fashion and that the procedure, irregular though
it may have been on its face, could and would in the fullness of time be
ratified and validated. After all he was dealing with the person who gave the
orders, and who had—""l'autorité pour augmenter ou diminuer les
salaires"".

Since the instructions given
by the Attorney General necessarily implied the making of fictitious expense
accounts I am unable to find in appellant the intention to defraud contemplated
by the Criminal Code, nor since we are dealing with a salary increase
that his superiors considered 

[Page 193]

warranted, am I able to see
in what respect the public or the Province was defrauded.

The effect of the second
paragraph, above quoted, may be rather bluntly summarized in this way. Because
the augmentation of Lemire's income by the filing of false expense accounts was
suggested and approved by the Attorney-General and Prime Minister of the
Province, Lemire, who deliberately filed false documents and thereby obtained
payments from the provincial public funds, could not be held guilty of fraud,
because he could reasonably anticipate that the fraudulent system would later
be somehow validated. In other words, there is no intent to defraud within the
requirement of s. 323(1) if the accused person, while deliberately committing
an act which is clearly fraudulent, expects that that which he is doing may, at
a later date, be validated. To me the very statement of this proposition
establishes its error in law.

Incidentally, it may be noted
that when, in 1960, Lemire's salary was increased, no attempt was made to
validate his receipt of the moneys paid to him on the basis of the false
expense accounts in the preceding years.

The implication of the third
paragraph is that, because the suggestion for the proposed fraudulent method
emanated from the Attorney-General of the Province, Lemire, who was the one who
deliberately certified the fraudulent expense accounts, could not be found to
have intended to defraud and, further, that because his superiors thought
Lemire was entitled to a salary increase (which they would not grant), a
fraudulent scheme for the obtaining of payment of fictitious expense accounts
did not constitute a fraud on the public.

To me the idea that it is an
answer to a charge of fraud to say that the fraud was suggested by the superior
of the accused is completely erroneous in law, as is also the proposition that
the Province of Quebec and the public of Quebec were not defrauded by paying,
out of public funds, false expense accounts, merely because Lemire's salary was
less than what he and his superiors thought it ought to be.

In conclusion, with respect to
the reasons given by the learned judges to which I have referred, it appears to
me that, while each of them contains findings which, viewed in isolation,
might, at first glance, be regarded as findings of 

[Page 194]

fact, or of mixed fact and law,
each judgment is palpably based on a misconception of the effect of s. 323(1)
of the Criminal Code. We have, in this case, an accused person who
admits to having obtained, out of the public funds of the Province of Quebec, between $8,000 and $8,600 and, for that purpose, to have rendered
certified expense accounts which were fictitious. These facts are not in
dispute. In the reasons given in the Court below, which I have reviewed,
certain inferences have been drawn from the facts in evidence, but the
fundamental error which exists in each, and which is an error in law, is in
holding that, on the basis of those inferences, some element in the offence was
lacking.

In Belyea and Weinraub v. The
King[9],
this Court considered a case in which the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court of Ontario had allowed an appeal by the Crown from an acquittal by the
trial court in proceedings by indictment. The right of appeal to the Appellate
Division was limited, as is the appellant's right to appeal to this Court in
the present case, to questions of law. It was contended by the appellants in
that case that the issues before the Appellate Division did not involve a
question of law alone. Chief Justice Anglin, who delivered the judgment of the
Court, said at p. 296:

The right of appeal by the
Attorney-General, conferred by s. 1013(4), Cr. C., as enacted by c. 11,
s. 28, of the Statutes of Canada, 1930, is, no doubt, confined to
""questions of law"". That implies, if it means anything at all, that
there can be no attack by him in the Appellate
 Divisional Court on the correctness of
any of the findings of fact. But we cannot regard that provision as excluding
the right of the Appellate Divisional Court, where a conclusion of mixed law
and fact, such as is the guilt or innocence of the accused, depends, as it does
here, upon the legal effect of certain findings of fact made by the judge or
the jury, as the case may be, to enquire into the soundness of that conclusion,
since we cannot regard it as anything else but a question of law,—especially
where, as here, it is a clear result of misdirection of himself in law by the
learned trial judge.

In my opinion, the guilt of the
respondent in the present appeal depends upon the legal effect of facts found,
or inferred, in the Court below. This raises questions of law in respect of
which, for the reasons already stated, I think there was error. There is no
ground not involving such questions upon which Lemire's appeal could have been
allowed. There was, therefore, a right of appeal to this Court and the appeal
should succeed. The judgment of the learned trial judge, with respect to the
question of guilt, should be restored.

[Page 195]

Lemire also appealed against
sentence, but, in view of the conclusions there reached, no decision was
rendered on this point by the Court below. The case should therefore, be
returned to the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, to deal with the appeal
from sentence.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Common betting house and
book-making—Trial judge expressing
doubt as to modus operandi—Whether necessary for Crown
to prove precise manner in which offence committed—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 61,
ss. 21, 168, 169, 176(1), 177(1)(e), 592(4)(1), 597(2).

The accused was charged
with keeping a common betting house and engaging in book‑making. The
trial judge found that there was a prima facie case against him on both
charges. However he acquitted him on the

[Page 156]

ground that the first
charge had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The Crown appealed to the
Court of Appeal and contended that the magistrate erred in holding that the
Crown should have proved affirmatively the precise manner in which the offence
was committed. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment at trial and
substituted verdicts of guilty in respect of the two charges. The accused
appealed to this Court.

Held (Cartwright and Spence JJ.
dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux
and Ritchie JJ.: In order to sustain a conviction under s. 176(1) of the Code
it is not necessary that there should be direct evidence of the accused having
either received or recorded a bet, it being enough, under the provision s.
168(1)(c), if it be proved that he kept a disorderly house for
the purpose of “enabling any person to
receive bets”. Once it has been
established that the accused was the keeper of such a house, it is not
necessary for the Crown to prove affirmatively the manner in which bets were
received or recorded therein. The accused would necessarily have been found
guilty by the magistrate but for this error in law. The Court of Appeal was
justified in entering a verdict of guilty with respect to these offences.

Per Cartwright and Spence JJ., dissenting:
The magistrate did not misdirect himself but was merely putting to himself the
well-known rule in Hodge’s case.
The magistrate was putting to himself the basic proposition of criminal
jurisprudence that the Crown must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

RITCHIE
J.:—This is an appeal brought
pursuant to 597(2) of the Criminal Code from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal of Ontario1 setting aside two verdicts acquitting the
appellant of the offences of keeping a common betting house and of book-making
which were entered by Magistrate Howitt of the City of Guelph on August 14,
1963, and substituting therefor verdicts of guilty in respect of the following
charges:



1.
Samuel Silvestro on the 24th day of April and one month previous thereto at the
City of Guelph A.D. 1963 in the County of Wellington did unlawfully keep a
disorderly house to wit: a common bet-

[Page 157]



ting
house at 165 Ferguson Street in the City of Guelph contrary to the Criminal
Code Sec. 176(1).



2.
Samuel Silvestro on the 24th of April and one month prior thereto at the City
of Guelph, A.D. 1963 in the said County of Wellington did unlawfully engage in
bookmaking contrary to the Criminal Code Sec. 177(1)(e).



It
appears to me to be desirable to analyze the nature of these charges before
proceeding to a consideration of the question of law raised by this appeal.



As to
the first charge, the relevant sections of the Criminal Code read
as follows:



176.
(1) Every one who keeps a common gaming house or common betting house is guilty
of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.



168.
(1) In this Part,



(c)
“common betting house” means a place that is
opened, kept or used for the purpose of



(ii)
enabling any person to receive, record, register, transmit or pay bets or to
announce the results of betting.



(h)
“keeper” includes a person who



(i)
is an owner or occupier of a place.



(e)
“disorderly house” means a common
bawdy-house, a common betting house or a common gaming house.










169.
In proceedings under this Part,



(a)
evidence that a peace officer who was authorized to enter a place was wilfully
prevented from entering or was wilfully obstructed or delayed in entering is prima
facie evidence that the place is a disorderly house.



It will
be seen from the above that any keeper of a disorderly house which is opened,
kept or used for the purpose of enabling any person to receive bets is guilty
of keeping a common betting house contrary to 176(1).



As to
the second charge, the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read as
follows:



177.
(1) Every one commits an offence who



(e)
engages… in the business or
occupation of betting, or…



21.
(1) Every one is a party to an offence who



(b)
does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it…



It will
accordingly be seen that anyone who does anything for the purpose of aiding
another to engage in the occupation of betting is guilty of an offence under
this section.



In the
present case the learned Magistrate made the following findings of fact:



1. As
to the premises being a disorderly house:

[Page 158]



I
find as a fact that entry was wilfully delayed by the accused and therefore,
there is a prima facie evidence that the place is a disorderly house.



2. As
to the appellant being the keeper of the premises:



Although
counsel for the accused strenuously argued that there was not sufficient evidence
to establish that the accused Silvestro was the keeper of the premises, I find
as a fact that he was.



3. As
to certain telephone calls made to the premises in question while the telephone
was being monitored by the police:



I
find as a fact that the telephone conversations were accurately recorded and
that such evidence is admissible to prove the nature, character and atmosphere
of the premises but not proof of the matters asserted… The conversations were about placing
bets on horses that were running at various race tracks that day. Such evidence
standing by itself, is not enough to substantiate a conclusion that the
premises were being kept for betting. It is evidence of some value, however,
tending to prove the charge.










In my
opinion, the learned Magistrate’s finding that the
telephone conversations were properly recorded carries with it an acceptance of
the record as to the number of betting messages which were received over the
telephone at the premises while the police were listening in, and this
discloses that between 1:35 and 2:34 p.m. there were eleven such calls, eight
of which took place in the first twenty-eight minutes.



None of
these findings of fact was disturbed by the Court of Appeal and I can see no
basis for interfering with them in this Court. When they are read together, I
am unable to construe these findings as amounting to anything other than a prima
facie case that the appellant was the keeper of a disorderly house which
was used for the purpose of enabling persons to receive telephone messages
about placing bets on horses, and this, in my opinion, constitutes an offence
under s. 176(1) of the Criminal Code. In my view also, a keeper of a
common betting house is one who does something for the purpose of aiding other
persons to engage in the occupation of betting, and I am therefore of opinion
that having regard to the provisions of s. 21, the findings of fact above
referred to also constitute a prima facie case under s. 177(1)(e).
Notwithstanding the above, however, the learned Magistrate, after considering
all the evidence, was left in doubt as to the guilt of the appellant on both
charges, and it is the question of whether or not his doubts

[Page 159]



were
founded solely on an error in law which forms the subject of this appeal.



No
evidence was called for the defence, and the considerations which gave rise to
doubt in the Magistrate’s mind appear to me to be
illustrated by the following excerpts from his reasons for judgment:



1.
I feel that in order to register a conviction not only must I find as fact that
the accused received and recorded bets, but also Î must outline and describe
how he did it. This I find a little difficult to do as I am faced on the one
hand with the suggestion that the accused used a flash board on which to record
bets and on the other hand with the suggestion that he used the arborite table
top for this purpose.



2.
There is no direct evidence that the accused received or recorded a bet.



3.
In the present case I am left wondering just what method the accused used to
carry out his alleged illegal activity. There are no betting slips and scratch
sheets in evidence. Also, I think it is obvious that a book maker must have
some printed or written record of the day’s racing contestants immediately at
hand, as a reference before receiving a bet. In the case before me there is no
sign of any such information. Admittedly there were the newspapers in the
parked automobile but they were not being used at the time of the raid.



4.
I feel the evidence is not strong enough and it does not disclose with
reasonable certainty his method of operation.










The
following question of law was stated in the notice of appeal of the
Attorney-General of Ontario to the Court of Appeal:



The
learned Magistrate erred in law in holding that in order to convict the accused
it was necessary for the Crown to prove affirmatively the precise manner in
which the offence was committed.



It is
true that the question so stated does not embody the exact language used in the
reasons for judgment delivered at trial, but it does appear to me that in
acquitting the appellant the learned Magistrate made it clear that he was
acting in accordance with his opinion that in order to convict it was necessary
for him to have affirmative proof, not only that the accused received bets, but
also that he recorded them and that there must in addition be proof, amounting
to reasonable certainty, of the manner in which these things were done.



In my
view, one of the questions of law raised by the opinion so expressed by the
Magistrate is fairly reflected in the question posed by the notice of appeal.



It will
be noted that a substantial part of the difficulty which led the Magistrate to
hold that the first charge was

[Page 160]



not
proved beyond a reasonable doubt sprang from his being under the impression
that in order to convict he must be satisfied as to how the bets were recorded.
In fact, as Roach J.A. has pointed out in the course of his reasons for
judgment rendered on behalf of the Court of Appeal, the learned Magistrate,
like the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Regina v. Failkaw[2], was wrong in considering
that the recording of bets is an essential ingredient of the offence
under s. 176(1). Indeed, in order to sustain a conviction under that section it
is not necessary that there should be direct evidence of the accused having
either received or recorded a bet, it being enough, under the provisions of s.
167(1)(c), if it be proved that he kept a disorderly house for the
purpose of “enabling any person to
receive bets”. Once it has been
established that the accused was the keeper of such a house, it is not
necessary for the Crown to prove affirmatively the manner in which bets were
received or recorded therein.










As I
consider that the findings of fact above referred to constitute a prima
facie case of guilt as to both charges, and as there was no evidence for
the defence, I am of opinion that the accused would necessarily have been found
guilty by the learned Magistrate but for the errors in law which I have
indicated, and I am of the further opinion that the Court of Appeal, in the
exercise of the jurisdiction conferred upon it by s. 592(1)(i) of the Criminal
Code, was justified in entering a verdict of guilty with respect to these
offences.



I would
accordingly dismiss the appeal.



The
judgment of Cartwright and Spence JJ. was delivered by



SPENCE
J. (dissenting):—This is an appeal by the
accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[3] dated January 31, 1964. By
that judgment, the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed the appeal of the
Attorney General for Ontario from the acquittal of the accused by His Worship
Magistrate Howitt on August 14, 1963. The accused had been charged with two
offences as follows:



(1)
On the 24th day of April and one month previous A.D. 1963, at the City of
Guelph in the said County of Wellington did unlawfully keep a disorderly house,
to wit: a common betting0 house at 165 Ferguson Street, in the City of Guelph,
contrary to the Criminal Code, Section 176, subsection (1).



and

[Page 161]



(2)
On the 24th day of April and one month prior thereto at the City of Guelph A.D.
1963, in the said County of Wellington did unlawfully.engage in bookmaking,
contrary to the Criminal Code, Section 177, subsection (1)(e).



The
trial took place on June 26, 1963, the learned magistrate reserved judgment,
and on August 14, 1963, gave written reasons for the acquittal of the accused
upon both charges.



The
Attorney-General for the Province of Ontario appealed to the Court of Appeal for
Ontario by notice of appeal dated August 23, 1963. I repeat in full the grounds
of appeal set out therein:



The
learned Magistrate erred in law in holding that in order to convict the accused
it was necessary for the Crown to prove affirmatively the precise manner in
which the offence was committed.



The
Court of Appeal for Ontario gave effect to this ground of appeal. In the course
of his judgment, Roach J.A. said:



The
question of law on which the Attorney General founds this appeal is stated in
his notice of appeal, thus:










The
learned Magistrate erred in law in holding that in order to convict the accused
it was necessary for the Crown to prove affirmatively the precise manner in
which the offence was committed.



In
my opinion that objection as applied to these charges is well taken and the
learned Magistrate misdirected himself.



The
appellant urged many grounds of appeal before this Court. In my view, the
appeal may be decided by reference only to the first thereof, i.e., that the
learned magistrate did not misdirect himself and that the statement quoted
inaccurately in the notice of appeal was not an attempt by the magistrate to
direct himself at all. It is probably unnecessary to cite at length the reasons
for the judgment given by the learned magistrate and a short summary thereof
will be sufficient. Firstly, the magistrate found upon evidence that the provisions
of s. 169(a) of the Code applied to the circumstances and that
there was prima facie evidence that the premises were a disorderly
house. Secondly, the learned magistrate found that the accused was the keeper
of that house. Thirdly, the learned magistrate found that the telephone
messages adduced in evidence as having been received at the premises by an
officer in the hour which followed the officer’s entry upon the premises were
accurately recorded in the tape recording produced

[Page 162]



as a
witness. Fourthly, the magistrate recounted the other evidence as to what was
found in the premises and outside the premises in an automobile, and then
continued:



The
evidence which I have outlined is wholly circumstantial There is no direct
testimony that the accused received or recorded a bet. The Crown asks that a
conviction be made, suggesting that evidence indicates that the accused
received bets over the telephone and recorded them in pencil on the arborite
table top or on flash paper, which paper burns instantly on being ignited. It
is argued that the burnt match points to the fact that flash paper was used.
Further, it is submitted that the pencil found on the accused man was used to
record the bets on the table and the smudge mark or marks, barely discernable,
on the table, were made after the face cloth was used in an effort to destroy
all evidence of bets having been so recorded.



I
feel that in order to register a conviction not only must I find as fact that
the accused received and recorded bets, but also I must outline and describe
how he did it. This I find a little difficult to do as I am faced on the one
hand with the suggestion the accused used flash paper on which to record bets
and on the other hand, with the suggestion that he used the arborite table top
for this purpose.










Also
I feel that in cases of this kind, I should look for very tangible evidence.
The circumstantial evidence, although any part of it may be capable of innocent
interpretation, should be closely connected so that the cumulative effect
should almost impel me to find the accused guilty. The evidence should be
inconsistent with any other rational conclusion of innocence.



In
the present case I am left wondering just what method the accused used to carry
out his alleged illegal activity. There are no betting slips and scratch sheets
in evidence. Also, I think it is obvious that a book maker must have some
printed or written record of the day’s
racing contestants immediately at hand, as a reference before receiving a bet.



In
the case before me, there is no sign of any such printed information.
Admittedly there were the newspapers in the parked automobile but they were not
being used at the time of the raid. The gist of the offence is the keeping of
the premises for betting (and I emphasize “keeping”). No doubt, Samuel Silvestro is a
keeper, but there is some evidence, the admissibility of it being doubtful,
that a Frank Silvestro is involved. Did the accused use the name of Frank
Silvestro in answering the telephone or was a Frank Silvestro actually engaged
or about to engage in receiving and recording bets on the 24th day of April
1963? Do Frank and Samuel Silvestro work together in such an illegal
enterprise? These questions are not answered.



It
may be that a man is so enveloped by a web or network of inculpatory evidence,
that it is incumbent upon him to make an explanation or be convicted. This is
not so here. I am left to draw too many inferences in order to reach the
conclusion that the accused is guilty. Although my suspicions are strong that
the accused was carrying on betting operations at 165 Ferguson Street, I feel
the evidence is not strong enough and it does not disclose with reasonable
certainty his method of operation.



It is
the sentence from that portion of the learned magistrate’s reasons reading, “I feel that in order to
register conviction not only must I find it a fact that the accused received
and recorded bets but also I must outline and

[Page 163]










describe
how he did it”, that the Crown took the
proposition set out in its notice of appeal. It should first be noted that the
magistrate is not even purporting to say what the Crown must prove, he says
rather what he must do. He has pointed out the circumstantial nature of the
evidence and, of course, there was no other kind of evidence, and by saying, “the circumstantial evidence
although any part of it may be capable of innocent interpretation, should be
closely connected so that the cumulative effect should almost impel me to find
the accused guilty”, he was putting to himself
the well-recognized rule in Hodge’s case[4]. When he says, “I am left to draw too many
inferences in order to reach the conclusion that the accused is guilty.
Although my suspicions are strong that the accused was carrying on betting
operations at 165 Ferguson Street, I feel the evidence is not strong enough and
it does not disclose with reasonable certainty his method of operation”, the learned magistrate is
putting to himself again the basic proposition of criminal jurisprudence that
the Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and when the magistrate
used the words objected to and which I have quoted above, the magistrate was
simply saying what he felt he should be able to determine in order to come to
his conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. It may well be that neither the members
of the Court of Appeal nor I, had we heard the evidence adduced at trial, would
have any reasonable doubt, but it is not a doubt in our minds which is at
issue, it is a reasonable doubt in the mind of the learned magistrate who tried
the charges.



I
therefore am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed, the judgment of
the Court of Appeal reversed, and that of the magistrate restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Common gaming
house—Slot machine—Conviction quashed by Court of Appeal—Whether player has
control over operation—Whether dissent in Court of Appeal on question of law—Criminal
Code, 1953-54 (Can) c. 51, ss. 170(2) (b)(i), 176.

The respondent's premises contained an automatic machine
whereby a person, on the insertion of a coin in the machine, obtained five
small balls which the person could by activating a device, propel one at a time
on an inclined table. These balls would strike obstructions of all kinds which
would direct them in various directions. When the balls struck these
obstructions, lights would flash on, points would be registered and a player
who reached one thousand points with the five balls would get to play an
additional game free. The respondent was convicted of keeping a common betting
house by having in her premises a slot machine called ""Spot-A-Card"",
contrary to s. 176 of the Criminal Code. Her conviction was set aside by
a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal on the ground that the prosecution
had not discharged the burden of proof that ""the result of one of any
number of operations of the machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the
operator"". The Crown appealed to this Court.

Held (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be
allowed and the conviction restored.

Per Taschereau C.J. and Abbott J.: The machine in
question served for vending services and the result of one of any number of
operations was a question of chance and uncertainty for the player. Even if the
balls could be controlled to an appreciable extent, as found by the Court of
Appeal, there would be an element of mixed skill and chance rendering the
machine illegal. It was not a question of knowing whether the operation of the
machine depended on the skill of the player, it must be determined whether the
operation depended on chance and was therefore a question of uncertainty.

Per Fauteux and Hall JJ.: The machine was ""a slot
machine"" within the meaning of s. 170(2) (b)(i) of the Code. The finding
by the majority that ""the ball could be controlled to an appreciable
extent"" was a finding of fact and was consistent with the finding of fact
made by the dissenting judge that the results were a matter of chance or
uncertainty. The dissent was on the question of law as to whether the
prosecution had discharged its burden of proof. This burden is met even when
the proof establishes some measures of control, but there remain elements of ""chance
or uncertainty"". Once it is accepted that the player has only partial
control over the ball, then all elements of the offence have been met.

[Page 276]

Per Cartwright J., dissenting: The Crown had no
right of appeal in this case under s. 598(1) (a) of the Criminal Code,
because the dissent in the Court below was not on a question of pure law. The
majority judgment reached the conclusion on the evidence that a player could
control the operation to an appreciable extent. Whereby the dissenting judge
would have sustained the conviction on the finding of fact that the evidence
showed that any effective control by the player of the operation of the machine
was impossible. This was a dissent as to the facts.

Droit criminel—Maison
de jeu—Appareil à sous—Verdict de culpabilité renversé par la Cour d'appel—Question
de savoir si le joueur a un contrôle sur l'opération—Question de savoir si la
dissidence en Cour d'appel porte sur une question de droit—Droit criminel, 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, arts. 170(2)(b)(i), 176.

Un local occupé par l'intimée était muni d'un
appareil automatique qui permettait à une personne, moyennant une somme de cinq
sous que la personne plaçait à l'intérieur de la machine, d'obtenir cinq
boules, qu'au moyen d'un éjecteur activé par un ressort elle dirigeait sur une
table ayant un plan incliné. Ces boules frappaient des obstructions de toutes
sortes et étaient projetées dans des directions différentes et variables. Quand
elles frappaient ces obstructions, des lumières s'allumaient, des points s'enregistraient,
et le joueur qui avait compté mille points avec cinq boules avait droit à une
partie additionnelle gratis. L'intimée fut trouvée coupable d'avoir tenu une
maison de jeu en ayant dans son local un appareil à sous appelé « Spot-A-Card »,
contrairement à l'art. 176 du Code criminel. Le verdict de culpabilité
fut cassé par un jugement majoritaire de la Cour d'appel pour le motif que la
Couronne n'avait pas rencontré le fardeau de la preuve que le résultat de l'une
de n'importe quel nombre d'opérations de la machine est une affaire de hasard
ou d'incertitude pour l'opérateur. La Couronne en appela devant cette Cour.

Arrêt (Le juge
Cartwright étant dissident): L'appel doit être maintenu et le verdict de
culpabilité rétabli.

Le juge en chef Taschereau et le juge Abbott:
La machine en question était utilisée pour la vente de services et le résultat
de l'un ou de n'importe lequel nombre d'opérations était une affaire de hasard
et d'incertitude pour l'opérateur. Même si le joueur pouvait avoir un certain
contrôle, comme la Cour d'appel l'a décidé, il y aurait quand même un élément
mixte de science et de hasard qui rendrait la machine illégale. Il ne s'agit
pas de savoir si l'une des opérations de la machine dépend de l'habileté du
joueur, mais bien de déterminer si l'une des opérations dépend du hasard et est
en conséquence une affaire d'incertitude.

Les juges Fauteux et Hall: L'appareil en
question était un « appareil à sous » selon l'expression de l'art.
170(2) (b)(i) du Code. La conclusion de la majorité à l'effet que la boule
pouvait être contrôlée jusqu'à un certain point était une conclusion sur les
faits et était compatible avec la conclusion du juge dissident que le résultat
de l'opération était une affaire de chance ou d'incertitude. La dissidence portait
sur la question de droit de savoir si la Couronne avait rencontré le fardeau de
la preuve. Ce fardeau est rencontré même si la preuve établit une certaine
mesure de contrôle, s'il demeure des éléments de chance ou d'incertitude. Une
fois qu'il est admis que le joueur a seulement un contrôle partiel sur la
boule, tous les éléments de l'offense sont alors présents.

[Page 277]

Le juge Cartwright, dissident: La
Couronne n'avait pas un droit d'appel en vertu de l'art. 598(1) (a) du Code
criminel, parce que la dissidence enregistrée à la Cour d'appel ne portait
pas sur une question de droit pur. Le jugement de la majorité en vint à la
conclusion sur la preuve qu'un joueur pouvait contrôler l'opération jusqu'à un
certain point. Par contre, le juge dissident aurait maintenu le verdict de
culpabilité en concluant sur les faits que la preuve démontrait qu'un contrôle
effectif par le joueur était impossible. Ceci était une dissidence sur les
faits.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], setting aside the respondent's conviction of having
kept a common gaming house. Appeal allowed, Cartwright J. dissenting.

Raymond Julien,
Q.C., and C. Goulet, for the appellant.

Lawrence Diner
and Pierre Bernier, for the respondent.

The judgment of the
Chief Justice and of Abbott J. was delivered by

LE JUGE EN CHEF:—L'intimée
a été accusée d'avoir commis l'offense suivante:

Avoir tenu le
quatorzième jour de décembre 1962 une maison de jeu dans un local situé au
numéro civique 503, rue St-Clément, à Montréal, contrairement à l'article 176,
paragraphe 1, du Code Criminel.

M. le Juge René
Hébert, de la Cour municipale de la Cité de Montréal, a déclaré l'intimée
coupable de l'offense reprochée et l'a condamnée au paiement d'une amende de $200
ou, à défaut de paiement de ladite amende, à trente jours de prison.

La cause a été portée
en appel et la Cour[2], a
cassé et annulé le jugement de culpabilité prononcé par la Cour municipale et a
acquitté Rita Toupin, M. le Juge Rivard ayant enregistré sa dissidence.

L'article du Code
criminel qui nous intéresse pour la détermination de la présente cause est
le suivant:

170. (1) Aux fins
des procédures prévues par la présente Partie, un local que l'on trouve muni
d'un appareil à sous est de façon concluante présumé une maison de jeu.

(2) Au présent
article, l'expression « appareil à sous » signifie toute machine
automatique ou appareil à sous

(a)
employé ou destiné à être employé pour toute fin autre que la vente de
marchandises ou services; ou

[Page 278]

(b)
utilisé ou destiné à être utilisé pour la vente de marchandises ou services

(i) si le
résultat de l'une de n'importe quel nombre d'opérations de la machine est une
affaire de hasard ou d'incertitude pour l'opérateur;

(ii) si, en
conséquence d'un nombre donné d'opérations successives par l'opérateur,
l'appareil produit des résultats différents; ou

(iii) si, lors
d'une opération quelconque de l'appareil, celui-ci émet ou laisse échapper des
piécettes ou jetons.

C'est, dans cet
article 170, le paragraphe 2(b) (i) qui nous intéresse particulièrement.

Le mécanisme de cet
appareil est assez compliqué. Moyennant une somme de cinq sous, que le joueur
place à l'intérieur de la machine, il obtient cinq boules, qu'au moyen d'un
éjecteur activé par un ressort, il dirige sur une table qui est sur un plan
incliné. Ces boules frappent des obstructions de toutes sortes, sont projetées
à gauche ou à droite, dans des directions évidemment différentes et variables.
Quand elles frappent ces obstructions, des lumières s'allument, des points
s'enregistrent, et le joueur qui a compté 1,000 points avec cinq boules a droit
à une partie additionnelle gratis.

Je suis d'opinion que
cette machine est destinée à être utilisée et est en effet utilisée pour la
vente de services et que le résultat de l'un ou de n'importe lequel
nombre d'opérations est une affaire de hasard et d'incertitude pour
l'opérateur. La Reine v. Topechka[3].

Le joueur ne contrôle
pas la partie, et je ne puis m'accorder avec Casey J. qui dit que « the
ball can be controlled to an appreciable extents ». Dans ce cas, il
y aurait un élément mixte de science et de hasard, ce qui rendrait la machine
illégale.

Il y a bien des jeux
où le succès dépend en partie du hasard, comme le hockey, le football, etc.,
mais, quand le résultat, bon ou mauvais, ne dépend pas du joueur, mais du
mécanisme de la machine sur lequel le joueur n'a pas de contrôle, il y a
violation de la loi.

Dans le cas qui nous
occupe, contrairement à ce qui s'est présenté dans d'autres causes déjà
entendues par cette Cour, il ne s'agit pas de savoir si l'une des opérations de
la machine dépend de l'habileté du joueur, mais bien de déter-

[Page 279]

miner si l'une des
opérations dépend du hasard et est en conséquence une affaire d'incertitude.
M. le Juge Owen soutient le premier point de vue, et M. le Juge Badeaux
réaffirme la même chose en référant à la cause de Côté v. La Reine[4]. M. le Juge Rivard est
d'opinion contraire et conformément aux dispositions du Code (art. 170) croit
que la machine est illégale si le résultat d'une seule opération est une
affaire de hasard ou d'incertitude. Je crois devoir accepter les vues de M. le
Juge Rivard et l'appel doit donc être maintenu et le jugement du juge au procès
doit être rétabli.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—The
circumstances out of which this appeal arises, the description of the machine
seized on the premises of the respondent and the course of the proceedings in
the courts below are set out in the reasons of my brother Hall.

I have reached the conclusion
that the Crown has no right of appeal in this case.

Leave to appeal was not sought
and the right of appeal, if it exists, must be found in s. 598(1) (a) of
the Criminal Code. The Attorney General may appeal to this Court
""on any question of law on which a Judge of the Court of Appeal
dissents"". Authority need not be quoted for the well settled rule that the
question raised in the dissenting judgment must be one of law in the strict
sense and not merely one of mixed fact and law.

In the case at bar Casey J.
reached the conclusion on the evidence that a player of the seized machine
could control its operation to an appreciable extent by the manual operation of
""flippers"" and by tilting the machine. Badeaux J. reached the
conclusion that the evidence showed the machine in question to be the same as
that which was the subject matter of the decision in Côté v. Her Majesty the
Queen[5].
In that case the Court of Appeal found on the unanimous evidence of all the
witnesses that an experienced player could and did control the play. Taking
these views of the facts Casey J. and Badeaux J. decided that the appeal should
be allowed.

Rivard J., who dissented, did not
differ from the view of either of the Judges who formed the majority as to the

[Page 280]

applicable law. He disagreed with
them as to the effect of the evidence. He said in part:

La question qui
se pose est donc de savoir si le résultat de quelqu'une des opérations de cet
appareil sous examen est l'affaire de hasard ou d'incertitude.

***

L'on a tenté de
prouver en défense que pendant que la boule est ainsi en mouvement, en secouant
l'appareil, en le « brassant », suivant l'expression des témoins, on
peut exercer un contrôle sur cette bille en l'empêchant de descendre
directement vers le bas où elle se perd, en la projetant contre d'autres
obstacles et en courant ainsi la chance que dans son trajet, elle accumule des
points additionnels.

Je dois dire que
les témoins tant de la Couronne que de la défense ont complètement failli dans
les expériences qu'ils ont tenté d'établir ce contrôle.

***

Il faut
distinguer cette cause de celle de CÔTÉ v. LA REINE rapportée à 1963 B.R. p.
567, où la preuve a certainement été différente de celle qui nous a été
soumise. Dans ses notes, M. le Juge Hyde écrit:

A new feature,
however, has been introduced into the evidence in this case in that all the
witnesses, both for the prosecution and for the defence, state that an
experienced operator can and does exercise considerable control over the course
of the ball by striking the machine with his hand while in play and that the
ability of the player in this way has a distinct effect upon the score which he
will achieve.

Plus loin, il
ajoute:

All the
witnesses, as I have indicated, are unanimous in agreeing that an experienced
player can and does control the play in this way.

Dans la cause
présente, les témoins ne sont pas unanimes pour dire qu'il est possible de
contrôler cette boule, une fois que l'éjecteur l'a mise en mouvement. Au
contraire, il est prouvé hors de tout doute que tout contrôle efficace est
impossible. C'est une machine spécifique que nous avons à juger, non pas un
genre d'appareil.

From these excerpts and from the
reasons of the learned Justice of Appeal read as a whole it is apparent that he
based his decision on the ground that the evidence showed that any effective
control by the player of the operation of the machine was impossible. It was on
this finding of fact that he based his decision to dismiss the appeal and
sustain the conviction. I am unable to find in the reasons of Rivard J. either
an expression or an implication of the view that had he agreed with the
findings of fact made by either Casey J. or Badeaux J. he would have disagreed
with their 

[Page 281]

conclusion as to how the appeal
should be decided. In my view, he disagreed with the majority only as to the
facts and, certainly, did not differ from them on a question of pure law.

For these reasons I would quash
the appeal.

The judgment of Fauteux and Hall
JJ. was delivered by

HALL JJ.:—The respondent was convicted on a charge which
read:

…le 14ième jour de décembre
1962 en ladite cité, tenait illégalement une maison de jeu, située rue St-Clément,
numéro 503, et ses dépendances. En contravention au statut adopté à cet effet.

The prosecution was under s.
176(1) of the Criminal Code, keeping a common gaming house. Section
170(2) (b)(i) was invoked to establish the charge because there was
found on the premises a machine which the Crown alleges was a ""slot
machine"".

The machine and its operation are
described by Rivard J. in his dissenting judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench
as follows:

Il s'agit d'une
machine qui porte le nom de « Spot-A-Card » fabriquée par Gotliet
Manufacturing de Chicago, portant le numéro de série 42,004. C'est de cet
appareil seul dont il peut être question dans cette cause….

L'appareil en
question ne livre pas de marchandise, de jeton, de piécette ou d'argent. Si le
joueur réussit à atteindre un certain nombre de points, à allumer certaines
cartes qui sont disposées dans l'appareil, ou à obtenir un chiffre déterminé,
il a droit à une, deux ou trois parties gratis. La partie consiste à mettre en
mouvement 5 boules. Il s'agit donc d'une machine automatique destinée à être
employée pour l'amusement seulement….

La preuve très
longue versée au dossier nous indique que l'opération de cette machine est
compliquée. Pour la mettre en mouvement, il faut que le joueur y place d'abord
une pièce de $0.05: la machine s'illumine, 5 billes viennent à la surface. En
tirant l'éjecteur, c'est-à-dire une tige mue par un ressort, l'une des boules
vient se placer au bout de la tige et le joueur le met en mouvement en laissant
aller cette tige avec plus ou moins de force, selon qu'il la retient ou la
laisse aller avec toute la puissance du ressort tendu.

Cet appareil qui
est en somme une table à plan incliné vers le joueur, reçoit la bille qui est
lancée vers le sommet de l'appareil. Elle frappe alors des pare-chocs, des
coussinets, des obstacles qui se la renvoient dans des directions inattendues.
C'est en exécutant ces carambolages provoqués par des ressorts ou des
mécanismes électriques cachés derrière les obstacles que la boule frappe, que
des points s'enregistrent. Au bas de l'appareil, de chaque côté du centre,
c'est-à-dire en face du joueur, se trouvent deux 

[Page 282]

ailerons qui sont
également électrifiés et que l'on peut mettre en mouvement en pressant sur un
bouton, de façon à ce que si la bille par hasard vient dans leur direction, on
peut la renvoyer soit au centre, soit au sommet de l'appareil pour qu'elle
recommence ses carambolages et accumule ainsi des points.

Le joueur qui,
avec les 5 billes, a réalisé 1,000 points, a droit à une partie gratis, s'il a
réalisé 1,100 points il a droit à une autre partie, et 1,300 points à une
troisième.

The question to be determined is
whether this machine is a ""slot machine"" within the meaning of s.
170(2) (b) (i) of the Criminal Code which reads as follows:

170. (2) In this section
""slot machine"" means any automatic machine or slot machine

***

(b) that is used or
intended to be used for the purpose of vending merchandise or services if

(i) the result of one of any
number of operations of the machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the
operator….

The word ""services"" in
this section includes amusement:

Isseman v. The Queen[6].

Rivard J. held that the results
here were a matter of chance or uncertainty. Casey J. said:

There is evidence that
discloses that the mechanism of the machine seized was electro-magnetically
operated and that the ball could be controlled to an appreciable extent
by the manual operation of baffles or ""flippers"" and by tilting the
machine itself. This satisfies me that the prosecution has not discharged its
burden of proof. (The italics are mine.)

In my view this finding that
""the ball could be controlled to an appreciable extent"" was a finding
of fact and is consistent with Rivard J.'s finding of fact on the same issue.
The dissent, implicit in the opposite conclusions reached by Casey J. and
Rivard J., is that on this finding the prosecution had not discharged the
burden of proof which rested on it to establish that:

(i) the result of one of any
number of operations of the machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the
operator, …

The section does not require the
prosecution to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the player cannot
control

[Page 283]

the ball at all. The burden is
met even when the proof establishes some measure of control, but there remain
elements of ""chance or uncertainty"".

Under s. 597(1) (a) of the
Criminal Code this Court is incompetent to entertain an appeal if the
ground of appeal raises only a question of mixed law and fact. The ground of
appeal must raise a question of law in the strict sense and in respect to which
there is a disagreement, expressed or implied, between the minority and the
majority in the Court of Appeal: Demenoff v. Her Majesty the Queen[7].

The finding that the ball could
be controlled to an appreciable extent by the player was a finding which Casey
J. erroneously held as negativing proof of the commission of the offence and
resulted in his finding that the prosecution had not discharged its burden of
proof. Once it is accepted that the player has only partial control over the
ball, then all elements of the offence have been met.

I agree with Rivard J. and would allow
the appeal and sustain the conviction.

conviction restored, CARTWRIGHT J. dissenting.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Hall leased for bingo games—Owner’s president on premises
when games played—No participation in games
by president—Refreshment stand and
commissionaire provided by company—Whether
president was “one who keeps a common
gaming house”—Criminal Code, 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, s. 176.

A company, of which the
respondent was president, owned an hotel and was licensed to carry on the
business of a public hall. The company leased its hall on four successive
nights of each week to four different charitable. organizations, which
conducted bingo games, the proceeds of which were used for charitable purposes.
These organizations, in each case, made their own arrangements for the conduct
of the games, supplying their own equipment and personnel for that purpose.
They paid to the company a standard rental per night for the use of the hall,
which was not in any way dependent upon the number of persons who played in the
games. The respondent was on the premises each evening, but did not participate
in any way in the games. The company employed a commissionaire and operated a
refreshment stand. The respondent was convicted on a charge of keeping a common
gaming house contrary to s. 176(1) of the Criminal Code, but this
conviction was quashed by a majority decision of the Court of Appeal. The Crown
appealed to this Court.

Held (Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau
J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Cartwright, Martland and
Ritchie JJ.: In order to constitute the offence of keeping a common gaming
house, there must be something more than the keeping of a place whose use, by
someone other than the accused, makes it a common gaming house. The position of
a “keeper” who does not in any way
participate in the operation of the games played, but who knows that the place
in question is being used for that purpose, and who permits such use, is that
which was contemplated when the lesser offence defined in s. 176(2) (b)
was created. That offence must have been created because it was not
contemplated that such a person was, himself, keeping the common gaming house
within the meaning of s. 176(1).

The offence defined in s.
176(1) involves some act of participation in the wrongful use of the place and
the evidence in the instant case did not establish any such participation on
the part of the respondent.








Per Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau
J., dissenting: By subs. (1)(h)(ii) of s. 168 of the Code,
wherein “keeper” is defined, the respondent
was a person who “assists or acts on behalf
of an owner or occupier of a place”
or at least “appears” to do so. The fact that by
subs. (2) (b) of s. 176 everyone who, as agent, knowingly permits a
place to be let or used for the purposes of a common gaming house or common
betting

[Page 125]

house is guilty of an
offence punishable on summary conviction could not by itself restrict
the broad meaning given by Parliament to the word “keeper” in s. 168. A person who falls within
the definition of a “keeper”, “keeps” a “common gaming house” within s. 176(1).

APPEAL from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from a
conviction for keeping a common gaming house. Appeal dismissed, Kerwin C.J. and
Taschereau J. dissenting.

J.W. Austin, for the
appellant.

P.B.C. Pepper, Q.C., for the
respondent.



The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of
Taschereau J. was delivered by



THE
CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):—This
appeal is concerned with the proper interpretation of portions of s. 168 and s.
176 of the Criminal Code:



168.
(1) In this Part,



* * *



(d)
“common gaming house” means a place that is



(i)
kept for gain to which persons resort for the purpose of playing games; or



(ii)
kept or used for the purpose of playing games



* * *



(C)
in which, directly or indirectly, a fee is charged to or paid by the players
for the privilege of playing or participating in a game or using gaming
equipment, or



* * *



(h)
“keeper” includes a person who



(i)
is an owner or occupier of a place,



(ii)
assists or acts on behalf of an owner or occupier of a place,



(iii)
appears to be, or to assist or act on behalf of an owner or occupier of a
place,



(iv)
has the care or management of a place, or



(v)
uses a place permanently or temporarily, with or without the consent of the
owner or occupier; and



(i)
“place” includes any place,
whether or not



(i)
it is covered or enclosed,



(ii)
it is used permanently or temporarily, or










(iii)
any person has an exclusive right of user with respect to it.



(2)
A place is not a common gaming house within the meaning of subparagraph (i) or
clause (B) or (C) of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (d) of
subsection (1)



* * *

[Page 126]



(b)
while occasionally it is used by charitable or religious organizations for the
purpose of playing games for which a direct fee is charged to persons for the
right or privilege of playing, if the proceeds from the games are to be used
for a charitable or religious object.



(3)
The onus of proving that, by virtue of subsection (2), a place is not a
common gaming house is on the accused.



* * *



176.
(1) Every one who keeps a common gaming house or common betting house is guilty
of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.



(2)
Every one who



(a)
is found, without lawful excuse, in a common gaming house, or common betting
house, or



(b)
as owner, landlord, lessor, tenant, occupier or agent, knowingly permits a
place to be let or used for the purposes of a common gaming house or common
betting house,



is
guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.



The
respondent was convicted by a magistrate, in the Province of Ontario, on a
charge that in 1959 and 1960 he, in the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto,
in the County of York, unlawfully did keep a common gaming house situate and
known as the Club Kingsway, contrary to the Criminal Code. On appeal to
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] the conviction was set
aside, MacKay J.A. dissenting.










Kerim
Brothers Limited was the registered owner of a lot and of a building thereon in
which it carried on business as proprietor of an hotel known as the Kingsway
Hotel. That company was licensed by the Metropolitan Licensing Commission. The
company operated on the premises a club, known as The Kingsway, and the
building was used for a number of purposes including dancing, banquets,
receptions and displays. During the period in question the company leased its
hall on four successive nights of each week to four different religious and
charitable organizations which conducted bingo games, the proceeds of which
were used for charitable purposes. These various organizations supplied their
own equipment and personnel for the bingo games and paid to the company a standard
rental for the use of the hall irrespective of the number of persons who played
the games. The respondent was the president of the company and while he did not
participate in the bingo games, the

[Page 127]



fees
were paid either in cash or by cheque to him or to one Buckingham. The cheques
were not made payable to either of these men.



Undoubtedly
the charge was laid under subs. (1) of s. 176 of the Criminal Code, which
is in Part V of the Code and by subs. (1)(d) of s. 168, which is
in the same Part and which might be repeated:



168.
(1) In this Part,



* * *



(d)
“common gaming house” means a place that is



(i)
kept for gain to which persons resort for the purpose of playing games; or



(ii)
kept or used for the purpose of playing games



* * *



(C)
in which, directly or indirectly, a fee is charged to or paid by the players
for the privilege of playing or participating in a game or using gaming
equipment, or



Subsection (2),
which might also be repeated, reads as follows:



(2)
A place is not a common gaming house within the meaning of subparagraph (i) or
clause (B) or (C) of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (d) of
subsection (1)



* * *



(b)
while occasionally it is used by charitable or religious organizations for
the purpose of playing games for which a direct fee is charged to persons for
the right or privilege of playing, if the proceeds from the games are to be
used for a charitable or religious object.



There
can be no question that the premises were used as a common gaming house as
defined, and no point is made that the organizations which conducted the games
of bingo fell within subs. 2(b). By subs. (1)(h)(ii) of s. 168,
the respondent is a person who “assists or acts on behalf
of an owner or occupier of a place”
or at least “appears” to do so. The fact that by
subs. 2(b) of s. 176 everyone who, as agent, knowingly permits a place
to be let or used for the purposes of a common gaming house or common betting
house is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction cannot by
itself restrict the broad meaning given by Parliament to the word “keeper” in s. 168. There are many
examples where the Crown may proceed summarily or by indictment.










I can
come to no conclusion other than that when Parliament widened the definition of
a “keeper”, a person who falls within
that definition “keeps” a “common gaming

[Page 128]



house” within s. 176(1). If a
tenant of a house operates it as a common gaming house, without the knowledge
of the owner, the latter cannot be said to “knowingly” permit a place to be let or used for
the purposes of a common gaming house or a common betting house.



I would
allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal and restore the
conviction.



The
judgment of Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by



MARTLAND
J.:—The respondent was charged
with keeping a common gaming house, contrary to the provisions of subs. (1) of
s. 176 of the Criminal Code. The facts, which are not in dispute, are as
follows:



Kerim
Brothers Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the company”) for some years has been the
registered owner of the Kingsway Hotel, in Metropolitan Toronto. The company
was licensed to carry on the business of a public hall and to sell refreshments
and cigarettes. The premises have, on occasion, been used for dances, banquets,
receptions, business displays and other purposes. From about February of 1959
to June of 1961 the company leased its hall, on four successive nights of each
week, to four different religious and charitable organizations, which conducted
bingo games, the proceeds of which were used for charitable purposes.



These
organizations, in each case, made their own arrangements for the conduct of the
games, supplying their own equipment and personnel for that purpose. They paid
to the company a standard rental per night for the use of the hall, which was
not in any way dependent upon the number of persons who played in the games.



The
respondent was the president of the company and was on the premises each
evening, but he did not, himself, participate in any way in the bingo games.
The company did employ a commissionaire and it operated a soft drinks
refreshment stand.










The
respondent was convicted of the offence charged, but the conviction was quashed
by a majority decision of the Court of Appeal of Ontario[3]. From that decision the
Crown has now appealed.

[Page 129]



The
relevant sections of the Criminal Code are the following:



168.
(1) In this Part,



* * *



(d)
“common gaming house” means a place that is



(i)
kept for gain to which persons resort for the purpose of playing games; or



(ii)
kept or used for the purpose of playing games



* * *



(C)
in which, directly or indirectly, a fee is charged to or paid by the players
for the privilege of playing or participating in a game or using gaming
equipment, or



* * *



(h)
“keeper” includes a person who



(i)
is an owner or occupier of a place,



(ii)
assists or acts on behalf of an owner or occupier of a place,



(iii)
appears to be, or to assist or act on behalf of an owner or occupier of a
place,



(iv)
has the care or management of a place, or



(v)
uses a place permanently or temporarily, with or without the consent of the
owner or occupier; and



(i)
“place” includes any place,
whether or not



(i)
it is covered or enclosed,



(ii)
it is used permanently or temporarily, or



(iii)
any person has an exclusive right of user with respect to it.



* * *



176.
(1) Every one who keeps a common gaming house or common betting house is guilty
of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.



(2)
Every one who



(a)
is found, without lawful excuse, in a common gaming house or common betting
house, or



(b)
as owner, landlord, lessor, tenant, occupier or agent, knowingly permits a
place to be let or used for the purposes of a common gaming house or common
betting house,










is
guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.



As
previously mentioned, the charge was laid under subs. (1) of s. 176 and the
question in issue is whether, upon these facts, the respondent was “one who keeps a common
gaming house”.



The
submission of the Crown is that the respondent, on these facts, was a “keeper”, within the definition of
that word, that the hall was a “common gaming house”, within the definition of
that term, and that, therefore, the respondent was “one who keeps a common gaming house”, within s. 176(1).

[Page 130]



The
position of the respondent is that a person who is a keeper, within the
definition, is not necessarily one who keeps a common gaming house, within the
meaning of s. 176(1), and this contention is supported on the ground that the
word “keeper” is not used in that
subsection and that specific provision was made in subs. (2)(b) for
a lesser offence, punishable on summary conviction, in respect of classes of
persons a member of which would fall within the definition of a keeper, who “knowingly permits a place
to be let or used for the purposes of a common gaming house”. It is argued that if a
keeper, within the definition, is automatically guilty of an offence under
subs. (1), because the place of which he is a keeper is used by others as a
common gaming house, then there was no need to create the lesser offence,
defined in subs. (2)(b).



On the
facts, it would appear that the respondent fell within the definition of a
keeper. It also appears that persons resorted to the premises in question for
the purpose of playing games and that the premises were used for that purpose,
so as to constitute them a common gaming house within the definition.










The
definition of a keeper in s. 168(1) (h) is a very broad one and it
relates to the keeper of a “place”, which is also broadly
defined. Every householder and, indeed, every landowner is a keeper within that
definition. But this, of course, in itself, constitutes no offence. The offence
defined in s. 176(1) is the keeping of a common gaming house. The question is,
if the “place” is used in a manner which
constitutes it a common gaming house, does everyone who falls within the
definition of a keeper of that place automatically keep the common gaming
house? In my opinion that conclusion does not follow. The offence is the
keeping of the common gaming house, and, in my opinion, in order to constitute
that offence, there must be something more than the keeping of a place whose
use, by someone other than the accused, makes it a common gaming house. I do
not, for example, see how the owner of a house leased to a tenant, who; without
his knowledge, operates it as a common gaming house, could possibly be found
guilty of the offence. What then is the position of a “keeper” who does not in any way participate
in the operation of the games played, but who knows that the place in question
is being used for

[Page 131]



that
purpose, and who permits such use? This, it appears to me, is the sort of
situation which was contemplated when the offence defined in s. 176(2) (b)
was created and, in my opinion, that offence must have been created because it
was not contemplated that such a person was, himself, keeping the common gaming
house within the meaning of s. 176(1).



I agree
with the conclusion reached by Laidlaw J.A., in the Court below, that the
offence defined in s. 176(1) involves some act of participation in the wrongful
use of the place and that the evidence in this case does not establish any such
participation on the part of the respondent.



For
these reasons, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Constitutional law—Sunday closing—Bowling alley—Whether infringement of
religious freedom—Whether conflict with
Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44—Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171.

[Page 652]

The appellants were
convicted on a charge that they unlawfully carried on their ordinary calling,
to wit, the operation of a bowling alley on a Sunday, contrary to the Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171. Their
appeals were dismissed and they were granted leave to appeal to this Court.
Their main attack was that the Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c.
44, had in effect repealed s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act, or, in any event, rendered
it ineffective.

Held (Cartwright J. dissenting):
The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott
and Ritchie JJ.: The Canadian Bill of Rights was not concerned with “human rights and
fundamental freedoms” in any abstract sense, but
rather with such “rights and freedoms” as they existed in Canada
immediately before the statute was enacted. Legislation for the preservation of
the sanctity of Sunday has existed in Canada from the earliest times and has,
at least since 1903, been regarded as part of the criminal law in its widest
sense. Historically such legislation has never been considered as an
interference with the kind of “freedom of religion” guaranteed by the Canadian
Bill of Rights. The effect rather than the purpose of the Lord’s Day Act should be looked to in
order to determine whether its application involved the abrogation, abridgment
or infringement of religious freedom. There was nothing in that statute which
in any way affected the liberty of religious thought and practice. The
practical result of this law on those whose religion required them to observe a
day of rest other than Sunday was purely secular and financial. In some cases
this was no doubt a business inconvenience, but it was neither an abrogation
nor an infringement of religious freedom. The fact that it had been brought
about by reason of the existence of a statute enacted for the purpose of
preserving the sanctity of Sunday could not be construed as attaching some
religious significance to an effect which was purely secular insofar as
non-Christians were concerned.








Per Cartwright J., dissenting:
The purpose and effect of the Lord’s Day Act are to compel the observance of Sunday
as a religious holy day by all the inhabitants of Canada; this is an
infringement of religious freedom. Construed by the ordinary rules of
construction s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act is clear and unambiguous and infringes
the freedom of religion contemplated by the Canadian Bill of Rights. Parliament
could not be taken to have been of the view that the Lord’s Day Act did not infringe freedom of
religion merely because that Act had been in force for more than half a century
when the Canadian Bill of Rights was enacted. To so hold would be to
disregard the plain words of s. 5(2) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. Where
there is irreconcilable conflict between another Act of Parliament and the Canadian
Bill of Rights the latter must prevail. Section 4 of the Lord’s Day Act infringes the
freedom of religion declared and preserved in the Canadian Bill of Rights and
must, therefore, be treated as inoperative.

APPEAL from a judgment of

The
judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by



RITCHIE
J.:—This is an appeal brought
with leave of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario
rendered without formal reasons, which dismissed an appeal from a judgment of
Schatz J. dismissing an appeal by the appellants, by way of stated case for the
opinion of the Court, against their conviction by a provincial magistrate in
and for the County of Hamilton of a charge that they did unlawfully carry on
their ordinary calling, to wit, the operation of a bowling alley, contrary to The
Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171.



By the
stated case the learned Magistrate raised the following questions:



Was I
right:—



(a) In
holding that the appellants were in contravention of The Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C, 1952, Ch.
171, and not solely in breach of By-Law No. 9252 of the Corporation of the City
of Hamilton;



(b) In
assuming that in proper construction and application the Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, Ch.
171, is not in conflict with the Canadian Bill of Rights, S.C. 1960, C. 44  and
more particularly with Section 2  thereof.










Mr. Justice
Schatz having answered both these questions in the affirmative without giving
any formal reasons, the sole ground of appeal argued before the Court of Appeal
for Ontario was that:



...in
proper construction and application the Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C., 1952 Ch. 171 is in
conflict with the Canadian Bill of Rights, S.C. 1960, C. 44  and more
particularly with Section 2  thereof…

[Page 654]



This
Court however granted the appellants leave to appeal “at large” and on their behalf argument was
directed to the following issues:



(a)
That by the legislative imposition of Sunday observance as a religious value
upon the whole Canadian Community, including those whose religious values and
precepts permit them to engage in activities thus prohibited, the Lord’s Day Act is in conflict
with that human right and fundamental freedom set out in the Bill of Rights as “freedom of religion”.



(b)
That the effect of Section 2 of the Bill of Rights is, subject to the
single qualification set out in that section, to repeal any federal enactments
which are in direct conflict with the enumerated “...human rights and fundamental freedoms...” declared and enshrined in
the Act.



(c)
That statute law necessary for the regulation of the mode and method in which
premises on which bowling is carried on are to be enjoyed, including the conditions
as to time and otherwise during which the game and recreation might properly be
carried on, is properly the subject of Provincial legislation.



By
Section 1 of the Canadian Bill of Rights it is “recognized and declared
that in Canada there have existed and shall continue to exist without
discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour, religion or sex the
following human rights and fundamental freedoms, namely,



(a)
The right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and
enjoyment of property; and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due
process of law;



(b)
the right of the individual to equality before the law and the protection
of the law;



(c)
freedom of religion;



(d)
freedom of speech;



(e)
freedom of assembly and association; and



(f)
freedom of the press.”










It is
to be noted at the outset that the Canadian Bill of Rights is not
concerned with “human rights and
fundamental freedoms” in any abstract sense, but
rather with such “rights and freedoms” as they existed in Canada
immediately before the statute was enacted. (See also s. 5(1)). It is therefore
the “religious freedom” then existing in this
country that is safe-guarded by the provisions of s. 2 which read, in part, as
follows:



Every
law of Canada shall, unless it is expressly declared by an Act of the
Parliament of Canada that it shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian Bill
of Rights, be so construed and applied as not to abrogate, abridge or
infringe or to authorize the abrogation, abridgment or in-

[Page 655]



fringement
of any of the rights or freedoms herein recognized and declared,...



It is
accordingly of first importance to understand the concept of religious freedom
which was recognized in this country before the enactment of the Canadian
Bill of Rights and after the enactment of the Lord’s Day Act in its present form, and in
this regard the following observations of Taschereau J., as he then was,
speaking for himself and Kerwin C.J. and Estey J., in Chaput v. Romain[1], appear to me to be
significant:



All
religions are on an equal footing, and Catholics as well as Protestants, Jews,
and other adherents to various religious denominations, enjoy the most complete
liberty of thought. The conscience of each is a personal matter and the concern
of nobody else.



The
position of “religious freedom” in the Canadian legal
system was summarized by Rand J. in Saumur v. The City of Quebec[2], where he said:



From
1760, therefore, to the present moment religious freedom has, in our legal
system, been recognized as a principle of fundamental character; and although
we have nothing in the nature of an established church, that the untrammelled
affirmations of ‘religious belief’ and its propagation,
personal or institutional, remain as of the greatest constitutional
significance throughout the Dominion is unquestionable.



It is
apparent from these judgments that “complete
liberty of religious thought” and “the untrammelled
affirmation of ‘religious belief’ and its propagation,
personal or institutional” were recognized by this
Court as existing in Canada before the Canadian Bill of Rights and
notwithstanding the provisions of the Lord’s Day Act.



It is
to be remembered that the human rights and fundamental freedoms recognized by
the Courts of Canada before the enactment of the Canadian Bill of Rights and
guaranteed by that statute were the rights and freedoms of men living together
in an organized society subject to a rational, developed and civilized system
of law which imposed limitations on the absolute liberty of the individual. In
referring to the “right of public discussion” in Re Alberta Statutes[3],








[Page 656]



Sir
Lyman Duff acknowledged this aspect of the matter when he said:



The
right of public discussion is, of course, subject to legal restrictions; those
based upon considerations of decency and public order and others conceived for
the protection of various private and public interests with which, for example,
the laws of defamation and sedition are concerned. In a word, freedom of
discussion means, to quote the words of Lord Wright in James vs. Commonwealth,
(1936) A.C. 578, at 627, ‘freedom governed by law’.



Although
there are many differences between the constitution of this country and that of
the United States of America, I would adopt the following sentences from the
dissenting judgment of Frankfurter J. in Board of Education v. Barnette[4], as directly applicable to
the “freedom of religion” existing in this country
both before and after the enactment of the Canadian Bill of Rights:



The
constitutional protection of religious freedom terminated disabilities, it did
not create new privileges. It gave religious equality, not civil immunity. Its
essence is freedom from conformity to religious dogma, not freedom from
conformity to law because of religious dogma.



It is
against this background that the effect of the provisions of the Lord’s Day Act on “religious freedom” as guaranteed by the Canadian
Bill of Rights is to be considered. Section 4 of the Lord’s Day Act reads as follows:



It
shall not be lawful for any person on the Lord’s Day, except as provided herein, or
in any provincial Act or law now or hereafter in force, to sell or offer for
sale or purchase any goods, chattels, or other personal property, or any real
estate, or to carry on or transact any business of his ordinary calling, or
in connection with such calling, or for gain to do, or employ any other person
to do, on that day, any work, business, or labour.



The
italics are my own and indicate the offence with which the appellants were
charged.



There
have been statutes in this country since long before Confederation passed for
the express purpose of safeguarding the sanctity of the Sabbath (Sunday), and
since the decision in Attorney General for Ontario vs. Hamilton Street
Railway[5], it has been accepted that
such legislation and the penalties imposed for its breach, constitutes a part
of the criminal law in its widest sense and is thus reserved to the Parliament
of Canada by s. 91(27) of the British

[Page 657]










North
America Act. Different
considerations, of course, apply to the power to legislate for the purely
secular purpose of regulating hours of labour which, except as to the
regulation of the hours of labour of Dominion servants, is primarily vested in
the provincial legislatures. See the reference re Hours of Labour[6] and Attorney General for Canada v.
Attorney General for Ontario Reference re Weekly Rest in Industrial
Undertakings Act, Minimum Wages Act and Limitation of Hours Act[7].



The
immediate question raised in this appeal, however, is whether the prohibition
against any person carrying on or transacting any business of his ordinary
calling on Sunday as contained in the Lord’s Day Act, supra, is such as to “abrogate, abridge or
infringe or to authorize the abrogation, abridgment or infringement of…” the right of the
appellants to freedom of religion.



It is
said on behalf of the appellants that freedom of religion means “freedom to enjoy the
freedom which my own religion allows without being confined by restrictions
imposed by Parliament for the purpose of enforcing the tenets of a faith to
which I do not subscribe.” It is further pointed out
that Orthodox Jews observe Saturday as the Sabbath and as a day of rest from
their labours, whereas Friday is the day so observed by the members of the
Mohammedan faith, and it is said that the Lord’s Day Act imposes an aspect of the
Christian faith, namely, the observance of Sunday on some citizens who do not
subscribe to that faith.



My own
view is that the effect of the Lord’s Day Act rather than its purpose must be
looked to in order to determine whether its application involves the
abrogation, abridgment or infringement of religious freedom, and I can see
nothing in that statute which in any way affects the liberty of religious
thought and practice of any citizen of this country. Nor is the “untrammelled affirmations
of religious belief and its propagation” in any way curtailed.



The
practical result of this law on those whose religion requires them to observe a
day of rest other than Sunday, is a purely secular and financial one in that
they are required

[Page 658]










to
refrain from carrying on or conducting their business on Sunday as well as on
their own day of rest. In some cases this is no doubt a business inconvenience,
but it is neither an abrogation nor an abridgment nor an infringement of
religious freedom, and the fact that it has been brought about by reason of the
existence of a statute enacted for the purpose of preserving the sanctity of
Sunday, cannot, in my view, be construed as attaching some religious
significance to an effect which is purely secular in so far as non-Christians
are concerned.



As has
been indicated, legislation for the preservation of the sanctity of Sunday has
existed in this country from the earliest times and has at least since 1903
been regarded as a part of the criminal law in its widest sense. Historically,
such legislation has never been considered as an interference with the kind of “freedom of religion” guaranteed by the Canadian
Bill of Rights.



I do
not consider that any of the judges in the courts below have so construed and
applied the Lord’s Day Act as to abrogate, abridge, or
infringe or authorize the abrogation, abridgment or infringement of “freedom of religion” as guaranteed by the Canadian
Bill of Rights, nor do I think that the Lord’s Day Act lends itself to such a
construction.



I
dismiss this appeal with costs.



CARTWRIGHT
J. (dissenting):—The appellants were
convicted on February 21, 1962, on the charge that they did, at the city of
Hamilton, unlawfully carry on their ordinary calling, to wit, the operation of
a bowling alley on January 14, 1962 (which was a Sunday) contrary to the Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171.



It is
not questioned (i) that the appellants did in fact carry on their business as
charged or (ii) that their so doing was forbidden by s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act or (iii) that that Act is intra
vires of the Parliament of Canada.



The
conviction is attacked on the ground that the Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960,
8-9 Eliz. II, c. 44, has in effect repealed s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act or, in any event, rendered
it ineffective.



The
relevant words of the Canadian Bill of Rights are set out in the reasons
of my brother Ritchie, which I have

[Page 659]



had the
advantage of reading. As applicable to the circumstances of this case the
provisions of s. 2 may be put as follows:










Every
law of Canada shall, unless it is expressly declared by an Act of the
Parliament of Canada that it shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian Bill
of Rights, be so construed and applied as not to abrogate, abridge or
infringe or to authorize the abrogation, abridgement or infringement of… freedom of religion.



That
the Lord’s Day Act is a law of Canada within the
intendment of this section is made clear by s. 5(2) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights which reads:



(2)
The expression ‘law of Canada’ in Part I means an Act of
the Parliament of Canada enacted before or after the coming into force of this
Act, any order, rule or regulation thereunder, and any law in force in Canada
or in any part of Canada at the commencement of this Act that is subject to be
repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament of Canada.



The
first question to be decided is whether s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act does infringe freedom of
religion, within the meaning of those words as used in the Canadian Bill of
Rights. In approaching this question it must be borne in mind that it has
been decided repeatedly that the constitutional power of Parliament to pass the
Lord’s Day Act is found in the fact that
it is enacted in relation to religion and prescribes what are in essence
religious obligations. It is for this reason that it has been held to fall
within head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America Act, the Criminal
Law. Conversely it has been decided that legislation affecting the conduct of
people on Sunday but enacted solely with a view to promoting some object having
no relation to the religious character of that day is within the powers of the
Provincial Legislatures.



It
cannot be doubted that in 1867 and for many years prior thereto laws forbidding
or compelling specified conduct on Sunday were regarded as forming part of the
criminal law.



In
Blackstone’s Commentaries, vol. IV, p.
63, the learned author says:



Profanation
of the Lord’s day, or sabbath-breaking,
is a ninth offence against God and religion, punished by the municipal laws
of England.

[Page 660]



In Fennell
et al. v. Ridler[8], Bayley J. delivering the
judgment of the Court of King’s Bench and referring to An
Act for the better observation of the Lord’s Day, commonly called Sunday (1676) 29 Charles II, c. 7,
said:



The
spirit of the act is to advance the interests of religion, to turn a man’s thoughts from his wordly
concerns, and to direct them to the duties of piety and religion.










In Henry
Birks & Sons (Montreal) Ltd. v. Montreal and Attorney General for Quebec[9], the Court was considering
the question whether provincial legislation could authorize the enactment of a
by-law requiring shops to be closed on certain religious feast-days. Kellock
J., with whom Locke J. agreed, said at page 823:



Even
if it could be said that legislation of the character here in question is not
properly ‘criminal law’ within the meaning of s.
91(27), it would, in my opinion, still be beyond the jurisdiction of a
provincial legislature as being legislation with respect to freedom of religion
dealt with by the statute of 1852, 14-15 Vict., c. 175, Can.



I can
find no answer to the argument of counsel for the appellant, that the purpose
and the effect of the Lord’s Day Act are to compel, under the penal sanctions of the Criminal
law, the observance of Sunday as a religious holy day by all the inhabitants of
Canada; that this is an infringement of religious freedom I do not doubt.



I agree
with my brother Ritchie that the following words which he quotes from the
judgment of Frankfurter J. in Board of Education v. Barnette, supra, are
appropriate to describe the freedom of religion referred to in the Canadian
Bill of Rights:



Its
essence is freedom from conformity to religious dogma, not freedom from
conformity to law because of religious dogma.



But
this passage presupposes that the word “law” which I have italicized means a law
which has a constitutionally valid purpose and effect other than the forbidding
or commanding of conduct in a solely religious aspect.



In my
opinion a law which compels a course of conduct, whether positive or negative,
for a purely religious purpose infringes the freedom of religion.

[Page 661]



A law
which, on solely religious grounds, forbids the pursuit on Sunday of an
otherwise lawful activity differs in degree, perhaps, but not in kind from a
law which commands a purely religious course of conduct on that day, such as
for example, the attendance at least once at divine service in a specified
church.










It was
argued that, in any event, in the case at bar the appeal must fail because
there is no evidence that the appellants do not hold the religious belief that
they are under no obligation to observe Sunday. In my view such evidence would
be irrelevant. The task of the Court is to determine whether s. 4 of the Act
infringes freedom of religion. This does not depend on the religious
persuasion, if any, of the individual prosecuted but on the nature of the law.
To give an extreme example, a law providing that every person in Canada should,
on pain of fine or imprisonment, attend divine service in an Anglican church on
at least one Sunday in every month would, in my opinion, infringe the religious
freedom of every Anglican as well as that of every other citizen.



I have
reached the conclusion that construed by the ordinary rules of construction s.
4 of the Lord’s Day Act is clear and unambiguous
and does infringe the freedom of religion contemplated by the Canadian Bill
of Rights.



I
cannot accept the argument that because the Lord’s Day Act had been in force for more
than half a century when the Canadian Bill of Rights was enacted,
Parliament must be taken to have been of the view that the provisions of the Lord’s Day Act do not infringe freedom of
religion. To so hold would be to disregard the plain words of s. 5(2) quoted
above.



It
remains to consider the reasons for judgment of Davey J.A. in Regina v.
Gonzales[10]. At page 239 of the C.C.C.
Reports the learned Justice of Appeal says:



In
so far as existing legislation does not offend against any of the matters
specifically mentioned in clauses (a) to (g) of s. 2, but
is said to otherwise infringe upon some of the human rights and fundamental
freedoms declared in s. 1, in my opinion the section does not repeal such
legislation either expressly or by implication. On the contrary, it expressly
recognizes the continued existence of such legislation, but provides that it
shall be construed and applied so as not to derogate from those

[Page 662]



rights
and freedoms. By that it seems merely to provide a canon or rule of
interpretation for such legislation. The very language of s. 2, ‘be so construed and applied
as not to abrogate’ assumes that the prior Act
may be sensibly construed and applied in a way that will avoid derogating from
the rights and freedoms declared in s. 1. If the prior legislation cannot be so
construed and applied sensibly, then the effect of s. 2 is exhausted, and the
prior legislation must prevail according to its plain meaning.










With
the greatest respect I find myself unable to agree with this view. The
imperative words of s. 2 of the Canadian Bill of Rights, quoted above,
appear to me to require the courts to refuse to apply any law, coming within
the legislative authority of Parliament, which infringes freedom of religion
unless it is expressly declared by an Act of Parliament that the law which does
so infringe shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights. As
already pointed out s. 5(2), quoted above, makes it plain that the Canadian
Bill of Rights is to apply to all laws of Canada already in existence at
the time it came into force as well as to those thereafter enacted. In my
opinion where there is irreconcilable conflict between another Act of
Parliament and the Canadian Bill of Rights the latter must prevail.



Whether
the imposition, under penal sanctions, of a certain standard of religious
conduct on the whole population is desirable is, of course, a question for
Parliament to decide. But in enacting the Canadian Bill of Rights Parliament
has thrown upon the courts the responsibility of deciding, in each case in
which the question arises, whether such an imposition infringes the freedom of
religion in Canada. In the case at bar I have reached the conclusion that s. 4
of the Lord’s Day Act does infringe the freedom
of religion declared and preserved in the Canadian Bill of Rights and
must therefore be treated as inoperative.



It
follows that I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction. Since I have
the misfortune to differ from the other members of the Court as to the result
of the appeal it is unnecessary to consider what order I would otherwise have
suggested as to costs.

Appeal dismissed with
costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL
DIVISION.

Criminal law—Constitutional law—Sunday closing—Licensing
by-law—Validity of by-law—Whether encroachment on field of criminal law—Whether
in conflict with Lord's Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171— Whether in conflict with
Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 160, 176—B.N.A. Act, 1867, c. 3.

The accused was charged under a by-law passed by the City of
Saint John in 1908 with operating a bowling alley on Sunday. Section 3 of this
licensing by-law prohibited the operation of a bowling alley between 12
midnight and 6 a.m. on weekdays, ""or on Sunday"". Section 4 prohibited
disorderly conduct and gambling on any licensed premises. Penalties were
provided for contraventions in the final section.

The accused contended that s. 3 of the by-law was invalid as
being an encroachment on the field of criminal law. The charge was dismissed by
a Police Magistrate on the ground that there was a conflict between s. 3 and
the Lord's Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171. On appeal to the County Court,
the accused was convicted. This judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of
New Brunswick, Appeal Division. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

The accused did not question the power of the City of Saint
John to make by-laws for the licensing of bowling alleys within its boundaries.
The matter of closing hours was also within its jurisdiction. Legislation
intended to prevent the profanation of the Sabbath is part of the criminal law
reserved to the Parliament by s. 91(27) of the B.N.A Act. However, the
impugned by-law was not primarily concerned with preserving the sanctity of the
Sabbath, but was directed to the merely local matter of regulating the hours
when certain licensed businesses were to close in the city of Saint John. The
mere addition of the words ""or on Sunday"" at the end of s. 3 did not
afford sufficient evidence to justify the inference that the by-law was
directed towards the prevention of the profanation of the Sabbath and that it
was thus beyond the ambit of provincial authority. Nor could it be said that s.
3 was inoperative as being in conflict with the Lord's Day Act. If the
licensing power vested in the provinces by s. 92(9) of the B.N A. Act was
exercised in respect of a local

[Page 644]

matter and in a manner not repugnant to federal or provincial
law, the provincial authority was entitled to attach such conditions and impose
such penalties as it might see fit. The fact that these conditions were in
conformity with federal legislation in no way invalidated the by-law. For the
same reasons, it could not be said that s. 4 of the by-law was in conflict with
ss. 160 and 176 of the Criminal Code.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New
Brunswick, Appeal Division1, affirming the conviction of the
accused on a charge of operating a bowling alley on Sunday. Appeal dismissed.

John P. Palmer, for the appellant.

G. T. Clark, Q.C., and E. J. Lahey, for
the respondent.

W. C. Bowman, Q.C., and F. W. Callaghan, for
the Attorney-General of Ontario.

J. W. Anderson, Q.C., for the Attorney
General of Alberta.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Ritchie J.:—This
is an appeal brought with leave of this Court from a judgment of the Appeal
Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick2 which affirmed the
conviction of the appellant for keeping a bowling alley open on Sunday contrary
to the provisions of a by-law duly passed by ""the City of Saint John in
common council convened"" on the 13th of July 1908 under the authority of
the Charter of that city and entitled ""A law to regulate and license
public billiard rooms and pool rooms and bowling alleys in the City of Saint
John"".

The first section of the by-law in question provides that
""no person shall carry on business as a keeper of a public billiard or
pool room or bowling alley without first having obtained a licence
therefor"", and the second section empowers the mayor of the city to grant
such licences at specified fees.

The third and fourth sections read as follows:

3. No person shall keep open any public billiard or pool
room or bowling alley on any week day between the hour of twelve o'clock at
night and the hour of six o'clock in the forenoon, or on Sunday.

[Page 645]

4. No person licensed under the provisions of this law to
keep any such public billiard or pool room or bowling alley shall permit any
drunken or disorderly person, or any keeper of a house of ill fame, to resort
to or frequent the premises kept by him, in respect to which such license has
been granted, or keep, suffer or permit to be kept in such premises any faro
bank, rouge et noir, roulette table or any other device for gambling of any
kind to be carried on therein, or suffer or permit any noise, disorderly
conduct, disturbance or breach of the peace to take place therein.

The final section of the by-law provides, inter alia, that
""any person … who fails to comply with any of the provisions of this law
shall forfeit and pay for each and every time such person shall so act in
contravention of this law a penalty of twenty dollars to be sued for,
prosecuted and recovered in the name of the Chamberlain of the said city for
the time being before the police magistrate or sitting magistrate at the police
office as provided by law …"".

It is admitted that the appellant and one Mortimer L.
Bernstein who were licensed keepers of a bowling alley on Union Street in the
city of Saint John, kept the said bowling alley open on Sunday, the 23rd day of
October 1960, as alleged in the Information but it has been contended
throughout on behalf of the appellant that s. 3 of the by-law in question was
invalid as constituting an encroachment on the field of criminal law.

This charge was dismissed by the police magistrate before
whom the Information was laid on the ground that there was a conflict between
s. 3 of the by-law and the Lord's Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171. In the
course of his reasons for judgment, the learned magistrate said:

In other words, the by-law—if it were allowed to remain
operative— would conflict with the federal statute, the Lord's Day Act, in the
penalty to be imposed; and the penalty is always considered as part of the
statute. On that basis, I would rule that section 3 of the by-law before this
Court … is invalid or inoperative with regard to the matter of Sunday.

Keirstead C.C.J. before whom an appeal was taken pursuant to
the provisions of the Summary Conviction Act, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 220,
convicted the appellant, he being of opinion

that the relevant provisions of the Lord's Day Act and the
by-law differ in legislative purposes, legal effect and practical effect. The
by-law imposes a duty, provides a regulation and control for purposes or
objects whose nature and character bona fide fall within the field of
provincial competence or authority.

[Page 646]

In the reasons for judgment dismissing the appellant's
appeal delivered by McNair C.J. on behalf of the Appeal Division of the Supreme
Court of New Brunswick, the matter was put thus:

The restrictions in the by-law relating to Sunday
operations, viewed in their context, appear intended for other purposes than to
compel the observance or prevent the profanation of the Sabbath Day. Like their
companion restrictions against night operations they seem in their true nature
and character designed to promote purely secular purposes involving protection
of the right of people in the community to rest and quiet during the prohibited
periods. As such they are, we feel, within the legislative jurisdiction of the
province and fit subject matter for municipal legislation.

The City of Saint John was incorporated by letters patent
issued by the Governor of the Province of New Brunswick in 1785, and the
Charter of that city has since been amended by over 500 acts of the New
Brunswick Legislature. Under the provisions of that Charter, the common council
of the city is given power to make by-laws for, inter alia,

the good rule and government of the … inhabitants and
residents of the said city and for the further public good, common profit,
trade and better government of the said city … provided that such laws be not …
repugnant to the laws of … England or of our said Province.

Since Confederation the powers so conferred are to be
confined to the sphere of authority allotted to the provinces under the British
North America Act. As was observed by Lord Watson in Attorney General
for Ontario v. Attorney General for Canada3:

Since that date, a provincial legislature cannot delegate
any power which it does not possess and the extent and nature of the functions
created must depend upon the legislative authority which it derives from the
provisions of s. 92 other than no. 8.

It is true that s. 15 of the Lord's Day Act, supra, which
was first enacted in 1906, provides that

nothing herein shall be construed to repeal or in any way
affect any provisions of any act or law relating in any way to the observance
of the Lord's Day Act in force in any province of Canada when this Act comes
into force; and where any person violates any of the provisions of this Act and
such offence is also a violation of any other act or law the offender may be
proceeded against either under the provisions of this Act or under the
provisions of any other act or law applicable to the offence charged.

[Page 647]

In this regard, it is to be noted that although the
""Charter of the City of Saint John"" was enacted before Confederation,
the impugned by-law was passed in 1908 and is therefore not a law which was in
force at the time when the Lord's Day Act came into force. The power of
the City of Saint John to make by-laws for the licensing of public billiard
rooms, pool rooms and bowling alleys within its boundaries is not, however,
questioned by the appellant.

The matter of hours at which shops of a specified class
shall close in particular localities in a province is prima facie within
the jurisdiction of such province under head 16 of s. 92 of the British
North America Act. As was said by Duff J. in City of Montreal v.
Beauvais4, it

is a matter which is substantially of local interest in the
province and which in itself is not of any direct or substantial interest to
the dominion as a whole.

It has, however, been accepted since the decision of the
Privy Council in Attorney General of Canada v. Hamilton Street Railway5,
that legislation intended for the purpose of preventing the profanation of
the Sabbath is a part of the criminal law in its widest sense and is thus
reserved to the Parliament of Canada by s. 91(27) of the British North America
Act and the immediate question raised by this appeal is whether it can be
said that the impugned by-law has for its true object, purpose, nature and
character the preservation of the sanctity of the Sabbath or whether it is
directed to the merely local matter of regulating the hours when certain
licensed businesses are to close in the City of Saint John.

In this regard, the submission for the appellant is
succinctly stated in the first paragraph of the argument outlined in the factum
filed on his behalf as follows:

It is submitted that the by-law in question is invalid on
the ground that it purports by the simple words ""or on Sunday"" to
deal with matters of morals or religious observance which fall within the
exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.

The prohibition against keeping public billiard rooms, pool
rooms and bowling alleys open during the hours specified in s. 3 is not to be
read in isolation from the rest of the

[Page 648]

by-law and when the enactment is read as a whole it will be
seen that the impugned section is but one of a number of regulations which the
common council has imposed upon the operators of such businesses in the city of
Saint John. The nature of the restrictions so imposed by the common council
appears to me to reflect nothing more than the opinion of that body as to the
manner in which such businesses are to be carried on for the better government
of the city.

It is not to be lightly assumed that any part of the by-law
is directed to a purpose beyond the legislative competence of the enacting
authority and I do not think that the inclusion of Sunday in the hours of
closing of these businesses necessarily carries with it any moral or religious
significance.

Counsel for the appellant has called to our attention a
number of cases in this Court deciding that provincial statutes designed to
enforce the observance of days of religious obligation are ultra vires, but
in each of these cases the legislation in question carried within itself clear
evidence that it was directed to this end.

It appears to me to be convenient to indicate the
legislation which was before the Court in each of these cases:

(i) Re Sunday Observance6,
in this case the Court was unable to distinguish the draft bill before them
from the statute entitled ""An Act to prevent the profanation of the Lord's
Day"" which was the subject matter of the decision in Attorney General
for Ontario v. Hamilton Street Railway, supra.

(ii) In Ouimet v. Bazin7,
the very title of the Act ""A Law concerning the observance of
Sunday"" bespoke its purpose.

(iii) In St. Prosper v.
Rodrique8, the legislation in question was
a municipal by-law which forbade the opening of restaurants and the sale of
merchandise therein on Sundays, and which contained the following preamble:

Vu qu'il importe dans l'intérêt de la paix et
des bonnes moeurs de prohiber l'ouverture des restaurants le dimanche, et
le commerce des restaurants;.

[Page 649]

(iv) In Henry Birks &
Sons v. City of Montreal and A.G. Quebec9, the impugned
legislation was directed towards the closing of businesses on certain feasts of
obligation of the Roman Catholic Church other than Sunday, and Kellock J.
observed at page 822:

If Sunday observance legislation was designed to enforce
under penalty the observance of a day by reason of its religious significance,
there is no basis for distinction, in my opinion, historically or otherwise,
with respect to legislation directed to the enforcement of the observance of
other days from the standpoint of their significance in any religious faith.

It seems to me that these decisions, dealing as they do with
statutes the very language of which invites the conclusion that they were
intended for the purpose of enforcing the observance of the religious
significance attaching to the Sabbath and to other religious feasts, can have
no application to the by-law now under consideration, the attack upon which is
limited to the fact that the words ""or on Sunday"" have been added to
a list of other times when certain businesses are to be closed.

The language employed by Fitzpatrick C.J. in Ouimet v.
Bazin, supra, at page 507, appears to me to be significant. He there said
of the statute before him:

It is impossible for me to believe that the legislature
intended, by the enactment in question, to regulate civil rights. On the
contrary, the evident object was to conserve public morality and to provide for
the peace and order of the public on the Lord's Day. I am confirmed in this
belief by the title of the Act which is described as ""A Law concerning the
observance of Sunday""; and, as Sedgewick J., speaking for the majority of
this court, said in O'Connor v. Nova Scotia Telephone Co., 22 S.C.R. 276
at page 293: ""We cannot with propriety shut our eyes to the words of the
title"".

As I have indicated, I have reached the conclusion that the
by-law here in question, entitled as it is ""A Law to regulate and license
public billiard and pool rooms and bowling alleys in the city of Saint
John"" and primarily concerned as it undoubtedly is with secular matters,
has for its true object, purpose, nature or character, the regulation of the
hours at which businesses of special classes shall close in a particular
locality in the Province of New Brunswick which is a matter of a merely private
nature in that province. As I have also indicated, I am of opinion that the
mere

[Page 650]

addition of the words ""or on Sunday"" at the end of
s. 3 does not afford sufficient evidence to justify the inference that this by-law
is directed towards the prevention of the profanation of the Sabbath and that
it is thus beyond the ambit of provincial authority.

Nor do I think that it can be said that s. 3 of the by-law
is inoperative as being in conflict with the Lord's Day Act. The
licensing power vested in the provinces by s. 92(9) is not limited to the shop,
saloon, tavern and auctioneer licenses specified in that section, and if that
power is exercised in respect of a merely local matter and in a manner which is
not repugnant to federal or provincial law the provincial authority is, in my opinion,
entitled to attach such conditions and impose such penalties as it may see fit
in respect to the manner in which the persons so licensed shall conduct the
businesses which are the subject of such licenses. The fact that one or more of
the conditions so imposed is in conformity with legislation validly passed by
the federal government in no way invalidates the by-law.

What was said by Judson J. in O'Grady v. Sparling10,
concerning the alleged conflict between s. 55(1) of the Highway Traffic
Act of Manitoba and s. 221 of the Criminal Code appears to me to
have direct application to the conflict here alleged between the by-law and the
Lord's Day Act. He there said at page 811:

There is no conflict between these provisions in the sense
that they are repugnant. The provisions deal with different subject matters and
are for different purposes.

And later in the same paragraph:

Even though the circumstances of a particular case may be
within the scope of both provisions (and in that sense there may be an overlapping)
that does not mean that there is conflict so that the Court must conclude that
the provincial enactment is suspended or inoperative.

It was argued before the appeal division that the entire by-law
was ultra vires because the provisions of s. 4 were in conflict with ss.
160 and 176 of the Criminal Code. As to this argument, the learned Chief
Justice expressed himself as follows:

Sections 3 and 4 of the by-law seem to us separate and
distinct as to subject matter, being in no way integrated in object or purpose,
and

[Page 651]

we feel the doctrine of severability aptly applies.
Assuming, therefore, without deciding, that section 4 is constitutionally
invalid its illegality does not affect the validity of section 3.

With the greatest respect, I do not share the doubts
expressed by McNair C.J., as I take the view that s. 4 and the penalty which
accompanies its breach constitute nothing more than another condition imposed
by the city in the exercise of its right to control the manner in which these
businesses shall be operated within its boundaries, and the above quoted
reasoning of Judson J. in O'Grady v. Sparling, supra, applies with equal
force to this section.

In all other respects, I am in agreement with the reasons
for judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick and I
would dismiss this appeal but without costs.

By order of this Court, the Attorney General of Canada and
the attorneys general of the provinces were served with notice of this appeal
together with a copy of the factum of the appellant and the respondent and it
was directed that any attorney general who desired to be heard should file a
factum in this Court and serve a copy on each of the parties. The Attorney
General for the Province of Alberta was, however, the only intervenant.

Appeal dismissed without costs.

MOTION FOR A REHEARING.

Criminal law—Conspiracy to effect unlawful
purpose—Obtaining from constable information which it was his duty not to
divulge—Whether indictment disclosed an offence under Criminal Code—Criminal
Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 103, 408(2)—The Ontario Provincial Police Act,
R.S.C. 1960, c. 298—Rule 61 of the Supreme Court of Canada.

Following the dismissal of their appeal to this Court in June
1963, two of the appellants, M and F, applied for a
rehearing of the appeal in December 1963. They argued that the indictment that they
conspired to effect the unlawful purpose of obtaining from a constable of the
Ontario Provincial Police information which it was his duty not to divulge, did
not disclose an offence under the Criminal Code of Canada.

Held: Assuming that this Court had jurisdiction to
entertain the application, it should be dismissed.

The purpose alleged in the charge was an unlawful purpose. The
fact that the purpose or the breach of trust contemplated by the conspirators,
whether as their ultimate aim or only as a means to it, could be, if carried
into effect, punishable either under s. 103 of the Criminal Code or
under s. 60 of the Ontario Provincial Police Act, manifested the
unlawfulness of the purpose within the meaning of the law attending Common Law
conspiracies.

APPLICATION by two of the appellants for a rehearing of
this appeal following the judgment rendered by this Court1. Appeal dismissed.

C. Thomson, for the applicants.

C. Powell, contra.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Fauteux J.:—On
June 24, 1963, this Court dismissed an appeal2
entered by Robert J. Wright, Joseph P. McDermott and Vincent B. Feeley against
their conviction on the following charge:

2. And further that the said Robert J. Wright, Joseph P.
McDermott and Vincent Bernard Feeley between the 1st day of January, 1960 and
the

[Page 193]

1st day of July, 1960 in the Province of Ontario did
unlawfully agree and conspire together to effect an unlawful purpose, to wit:

To obtain from George Scott, a constable of the Ontario
Provincial Police, information which it was his duty not to divulge, contrary
to the Criminal Code of Canada, Section 408(2).

Some six months later, in December 1963, both McDermott and
Feeley, purporting to be so entitled under rule 61 of the Rules of this Court,
applied to this Court for an order granting a rehearing of the appeal on the
ground that the above indictment did not disclose an offence under the Criminal
Code of Canada. Having heard and considered the submissions of counsel for
the applicants, the Court, indicating that reasons would later be delivered,
declared that, assuming it had jurisdiction to entertain the application, the
ground upon which it was made was ill-founded. The application was dismissed.

The charge is laid under s. 408(2) of the Criminal Code providing
that:

408.(2) Every one who conspires with any one

(a) to effect an unlawful
purpose or,

(b) to effect a lawful
purpose by unlawful means,

is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment
for two years.

The argument made in support of the application is centred
upon the meaning to be ascribed to the term ""unlawful purpose"". It
was contended that the unlawful purpose contemplated in the section must be one
which, if carried into effect, would constitute an act declared to be criminal
by the Criminal Code of Canada and that, as the purpose alleged in the
charge was made unlawful under s. 60 of The Police Act, R.S.O. 1960, c.
298, the charge did not disclose an offence under the Criminal Code. The
case of Regina v. Sommervill and Kaylich3 was particularly relied on.

While marginal notes in the body of an Act form no part of
the Act, the marginal note appended to s. 408(2) accurately designates as
""Common Law conspiracy"" the offence described in this section which,
as defined by Lord Denman in Rex v. Jones4,
consists in a combination ""either to do an unlawful act, or a lawful
act by unlawful means"". Common Law conspiracy is one of the few Common Law
offences which, upon the 1954 revision of the Criminal

[Page 194]

Code, Parliament thought advisable to perpetuate by
codification. Martin's Criminal Code 1955 ed., p. 35.
Hence the law pertaining to this offence, its elements and the wide embracing
import of the term ""unlawful purpose"", remains unchanged. While the
term, as shown in Harrison The Law of Conspiracy, encompasses more than
criminal offences, sufficient it is to say, for the purpose of this case, that
the purpose alleged in the charge, to wit, the obtention from
a constable of information which it is his duty not to divulge, is an unlawful
purpose. In the language of Lord Mansfield, in Rex v. Bembridge5:

A man accepting an office of trust concerning the public,
especially if attended by profit, is answerable criminally to the King for
misbehaviour in his office.

The fact that the purpose or the breach of trust
contemplated by the conspirators, whether as their ultimate aim or only as a
means to it, be, if carried into effect, punishable either under s. 103 of the Criminal
Code (vide Rex v. McMorran6)
or under s. 60 of the Ontario Provincial Police Act, adequately
manifests the unlawfulness of the purpose within the meaning of the law
attending Common Law conspiracies.

With deference, I am unable to agree with the decision
rendered in Regina v. Sommervill and Kaylich, supra, and to accept as well founded the ground
alleged in support of this application which, as indicated above, has been
dismissed at the issue of the hearing.

Application dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.

Criminal law—Indians—Game laws—Hunting with night light
contrary to s. 31(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 94—Whether
prohibition applies to Treaty Indians—Whether word ""hunt"" in s. 73(1)
of the Act subject to limitations in s. 81(1)—The Manitoba Natural Resources
Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 180, s. 13.

The appellants were charged with unlawfully hunting big game
by means of night lights, contrary to s. 31(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act,
R.S.M. 1954, c. 94. The appellants were Treaty Indians and were hunting deer
for food for their own use and on lands to which they had the right of access.
They were acquitted by the magistrate, but their acquittal was set aside by the
Court of Appeal. They were granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be allowed and an acquittal
directed.

In regard to Indians, the word ""hunt"" as used in s.
72(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act was not ambiguous nor subject to any
of the limitations which are imposed by s. 31(1) upon non-Indians.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba1, setting aside the appellants'
acquittal by a magistrate on a charge under s. 31(1) of The Game and Fisheries
Act of Manitoba. Appeal allowed.

Duncan J. Jessiman, Q.C., for the appellants.

Benjamin Hewak, for the respondent.

[Page 82]

Gerald LeDain, Q.C., for the Attorney-General
of Quebec, intervenant.

S. Freedman, for the Attorney General of
Alberta, intervenant.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Hall J.:—The
appellants, both of them Treaty Indians, were charged before Magistrate Bruce
McDonald of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba:

That they did on or about the 27th day of October, A.D.
1961, at or near the Rural Municipality of South Cypress, in the Province of
Manitoba, unlawfully hunt big game by means of night lights, contrary to the
Provisions of the Game and Fisheries Act and Regulations, Section 31(1).

Section 31(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act, R.S.M.
1954, c. 94, provides as follows:

31(1) No person shall hunt, trap or take any big game
protected by this Part and the regulations by means of night lights of any
description, traps, nets, snares, baited line, or other similar contrivances,
or set such traps, nets, snares, baited line, or contrivance for such big game
at any time, and, if so set, they may be destroyed by any person without
incurring any liability for so doing.

The learned Magistrate acquitted the appellants because the
term ""night lights""

… as used in the above subsection was not capable of
definition, that the land upon which the hunting was being done was land to
which the Indians had access in that there were no prohibition signs posted,
and that the Indians were entitled, in any event, to hunt in any manner they
saw fit on land to which they had access.

The Crown took an appeal by way of stated case to the Court
of Appeal for Manitoba2. The questions propounded were as
follows:

(a) having found that Rufus
Prince, George Prince, and Robert Myron were hunting big game by means of a
spotlight was I right in holding that such spotlight was not a night light
within the meaning of Section 31(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act, R.S.M. 1954,
Cap. 94;

(b) was I right in interpreting
the term ""night lights"" as contained in Section 31(1) of The Game and
Fisheries Act, R.S.M. 1954, Cap. 94, as a classification or description of an
object rather than a method or means of hunting;

(c) having found that the land
upon which Rufus Prince, George Prince and Robert Myron were hunting was land
that was occupied

[Page 83]

and under cultivation and
privately owned land, was I right in holding that such land was land to which
the said Rufus Prince, George Prince, and, Robert Myron had a ""right of
access"";

(d) having found that the land
upon which Rufus Prince, George Prince and Robert Myron were hunting was land
to which the said Rufus Prince, George Prince and Robert Myron had ""a
right of access"", was I right in dismissing the charge under Section 31(1)
of The Game and Fisheries Act on this ground.

The Court of Appeal answered questions (a) and (b) in the
negative; question (c) in the affirmative and question (d) in the negative,
Schultz and Freedman JJ.A. dissenting as to (d). The Court accordingly directed
that the case be referred back to the learned Magistrate with a direction that
conviction should be entered against the three accused and that appropriate
penalties should be imposed.

Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on January 22,
1963.

It was admitted in this Court that at the time in question
in the charge the appellants were Indians; that they were hunting deer for food
for their own use and that they were hunting on lands to which they had the
right of access. These admissions are fundamental to the determination of this
appeal.

Section 72(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act, R.S.M.
1954, c. 94, reads as follows:

72(1) Notwithstanding this Act, and in so far only as is
necessary to implement The Manitoba Natural Resources Act , any Indian may hunt
and take game for food for his own use at all seasons of the year on all
unoccupied Crown lands and on any other lands to which the Indian may have the
right of access.

The above section refers to The Manitoba Natural
Resources Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 180, of which s. 13 thereof reads as
follows:

13. In order to secure to the Indians of the Province the
continuance of the supply of game and fish for their support and subsistence,
Canada agrees that the law respecting game in force in the Province from time
to time shall apply to the Indians within the boundaries thereof, provided,
however, that the said Indians shall have the right, with which the Province
hereby assures to them, of hunting, trapping and fishing game and fish for food
at all seasons of the year on all unoccupied Crown lands and on any other lands
to which the said Indians may have a right of access.

There was a suggestion that the appeal involved a
constitutional issue as to the validity of The Game and Fisheries Act,
R.S.M. 1954, c. 94, in respect to Indians. The

[Page 84]

Attorney-General for Ontario gave Notice of Intervention and
the Provinces of Quebec and Alberta did likewise. Prior to the appeal being
heard, the Province of Ontario filed a Notice of Withdrawal. The Provinces of
Quebec and Alberta filed factums and were represented by counsel at the
hearing. They were not heard as the Court held that no constitutional issue
arose in the appeal. The agreement dated December 14, 1929, between the
Government of Canada and the Government of the Province of Manitoba containing,
inter alia, said s. 13, pursuant to which The Manitoba Natural Resources Act 
was passed acquired the force of law by virtue of The British North
America Act, (1930), 21 George V, c. 26.

The sole question for determination is whether the word
""hunt"" as used in s. 72(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act,
R.S.M. 1954, c. 94, in regard to Indians is ambiguous in any way or subject to
the limitations contained in s. 31(1) of the said Act.

With respect, I agree with the reasons of Freedman J.A. in
his dissenting judgment and also with the statement by McGillivray J.A. in Rex
v. Wesley3, when he said:

If the effect of the proviso is merely to give to the
Indians the extra privilege of shooting for food ""out of season"" and
they are otherwise subject to the game laws of the province, it follows that in
any year they may be limited in the number of animals of a given kind that they
may kill even though that number is not sufficient for their support and
subsistence and even though no other kind of game is available to them. I
cannot think that the language of the section supports the view that this was
the intention of the law makers. I think the intention was that in hunting for
sport or for commerce the Indian like the white man should be subject to laws
which make for the preservation of game but, in hunting wild animals for the
food necessary to his life, the Indian should be placed in a very different
position from the white man who, generally speaking, does not hunt for food and
was by the proviso to sec. 12 reassured of the continued enjoyment of a right
which he has enjoyed from time immemorial.

The word ""hunt"" as used in the section under
review must be given its plain meaning. ""Hunt"" is defined in the
Oxford English Dictionary as:

The act of chasing wild animals for the purpose of catching
or killing them; to chase for food or sport; to scour a district in pursuit of
game.

Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines
""hunt"" as: ""To follow or search for game for the purpose

[Page 85]

and with the means of capturing or killing."" It is
not ambiguous nor subject to any of the limitations which s. 31(1) imposes upon
the non-Indian.

I would allow the appeal with costs throughout and direct
that the acquittal of the appellants be confirmed. There should be no order as
to costs for or against the Attorneys-General of Quebec and Alberta.

Appeal allowed and acquittal directed, with
costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Appeals—Jurisdiction
of Supreme Court of Canada—Right to appeal limited to questions of law on which
there was a dissent in the Court of Appeal—Confession—Whether voluntary—Dissent
as to admissibility—Whether dissent on a question of law—Criminal Code, 1953-54
(Can), c. 51, ss. 79(1)(a), 597(1)(a).

The appellant, a Sons of Freedom Doukhobor, was convicted on a
charge of having placed an explosive substance with intent to cause an
explosion that was likely to cause serious damage to property, contrary to s.
79(1) (a) of the Criminal Code. A confession was put in evidence
at the trial. His appeal was dismissed by a majority judgment of the Court of
Appeal, the dissent being as to the admissibility of the confession. The
appellant appealed to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

Under s. 597(1) (a) of the Criminal Code, this
Court is incompetent to entertain an appeal if the ground of appeal raises only
a question of mixed law and fact. The ground of appeal must raise a question of
law in the strict sense and in respect to which there is a disagreement,
expressed or implied, between the minority and the majority in the Court of
Appeal. In the case at bar, the difference of opinion was attributable to
different inferences drawn by the dissenting judge and by those of the majority
from the accepted evidence relevant to the voluntariness of the confession.
Consequently, the ground of appeal did not raise a question of law in the
strict sense and this Court had no jurisdiction.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the appellant's conviction for an offence
under s. 79(1) (a) of the Criminal Code. Appeal dismissed.

appellant.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

FAUTEUX J.:—This is an appeal
from a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province of
British Columbia[2]
dismissing the appeal of the appellant from his

[Page 80]

conviction for the offence
described under s. 79(1) (a) of the Criminal Code. 

The appeal is taken under.
579.(1) (a) of the Criminal Code which provides that: 

597. (1) A person who is
convicted of an indictable offence other than an offence punishable by death
and whose conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada

(a) on any question
of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents, or

Under these provisions, this
Court is incompetent to entertain an appeal if the ground alleged in support
thereof raises only a question of mixed law and fact. It is indeed well settled
by the decisions of this Court that the ground of appeal must raise ""a
question of law in the strict sense"", The King v. Decary[3],
and that this question of law, involved in the ratio decidendi, must be
one in respect to which there is a disagreement expressed or implied between
the minority and the majority in the Court of Appeal. Rozon v. The King[4]

In the case at bar, the majority
and the minority disagreed with respect to the admissibility, as a voluntary
statement, of a confession of guilt made by the appellant. It does not appear
from the reasons of Davey J.A., dissenting, and from those of his colleagues
Bird and Wilson JJ.A., of the majority, that this disagreement is based on a
conflicting view of the law governing the admissibility of confessions; a
careful consideration of the reasons for judgment reasonably indicates that the
difference of opinion is attributable to different inferences being drawn by
the dissenting Judge and by those of the majority from the accepted evidence
relevant to the voluntariness of the confession. On this view of the matter,
the ground of appeal alleged by the appellant does not raise a question of law
in the strict sense. The Queen v. Fitton[5].

Hence, this Court has no
jurisdiction and the appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Driving motor vehicle while
ability impaired by drug—Drug administered as
anaesthetic by dentist—Accused warned not to drive
until his head was perfectly clear—Whether
driver guilty—Whether mens rea a
necessary element of the offence—Criminal
Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 222, 223.

[Page 747]

The accused went to his
dentist by appointment to have two teeth extracted. He was injected with a drug
known as sodium pentothal, a quick-acting anaesthetic. Earlier, he had been
required to sign a printed form containing a warning not to drive after the
anaesthetic until his head had cleared. After he regained consciousness, the
nurse in attendance, to whom he appeared to be normal, warned him not to drive
until his head was “perfectly clear”. He replied that he
intended to walk. The accused said that he heard no such warning and did not
remember signing any form containing a warning. He remembered getting into his
car and that while driving he became unconscious. His car ran into the rear of a
parked vehicle. Medical evidence was given that his mental and physical
condition (he was staggering and his co-ordination was poor) was consistent
with the after-effects of the drug in question which may induce a state of
amnesia accompanied by a period during which the subject may feel competent to
drive a car and in the next second be in a condition in which he would not know
what was happening. The accused stated that he did not know anything about this
drug.

He was charged and
convicted of the offence of driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so
was impaired by a drug, contrary to s. 223 of the Criminal Code. After a
trial de novo before a County Court judge under s. 720 of the Code, his
conviction was affirmed. The Court of Appeal granted him leave to appeal and
quashed the conviction. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court on
the question as to whether mens rea relating to both the act of driving
and to the state of being impaired was an essential element of the offence.

Held: The appeal should be
dismissed.








Per Taschereau J.: There can be
no actus reus unless there is a willpower to do an act whether the
person knows or not that it is prohibited by law. In the present case,
intention was not to be confused with mens rea. Intention is an element
of the offence in question only when the offender voluntarily takes liquor or a
drug. There must be an act proceeding from a free will which may bring about
the mental condition necessary to meet the requirements of s. 223. When a
doctor has given an injection of a drug to a patient, who is not aware of the
state of mind it may produce, there is no volitive act done by the patient and
he could not be convicted under s. 223.

Per Locke and Judson JJ.: The
question of law propounded did not arise upon the facts found at the trial de
novo by the County Court judge who found as a fact that the accused knew
that he had had a drug and that he was warned not to drive after the anaesthetic,
but did not find that the accused’s
condition was such that he could not appreciate the warnings given to him. The
Court of Appeal found that the accused believed that the drug did not possess
properties which would impair or were likely to impair his ability to drive or
that he was led to believe and honestly believed that the drug could not have
the effect of impairing such ability. These findings were directly in conflict
with those of the trial judge. However, as the Crown did not ask leave to
appeal on the ground that the Court of Appeal had exceeded its jurisdiction and
that question was not argued, the proper course was to dismiss the appeal.

Per Martland and Ritchie JJ.:
The enactment of s. 223 of the Criminal Code added a new crime to the
general criminal law, and neither the language in which it was enacted nor the
evil which it was intended to

[Page 748]

prevent are such as to give
rise to a necessary implication that Parliament intended to rule out mens
rea as an essential ingredient of the crime therein described. When it has
been proved that a driver was driving while his ability was impaired by alcohol
or a drug, a rebuttable presumption arises that his condition was voluntarily
induced. But if it appears that the impairment was produced as a result of
using a drug in the form of medicine on a doctor’s order or recommendation and that its
effect was unknown to the patient, the presumption is rebutted. Mens rea need
not necessarily be present in relation both to the act of driving and to the
state of being impaired in order to make the offence complete. The defence that
the accused became impaired through no act of his own will and could not
reasonably be expected to have known that his ability was impaired or might
thereafter become impaired when he undertook to drive and drove his motor
vehicle, was a good defence in this case.

APPEAL from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the conviction
of the accused. Appeal dismissed.

W.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the
appellant.

Irving Himel, Q.C., for the
respondent.



TASCHEREAU
J.:—I substantially agree with
the reasons of my brother Ritchie, and I only wish to add a few personal
observations.










In his
judgment the trial judge, His Honour Judge Timmins, came to the conclusion that
s. 223 of the Criminal Code is an express prohibition in respect to
driving a motor car when the driver had a drug impairing his driving, and that the
defence set up by the accused that this was all involuntary, was not a defence
against this section. The Court of Appeal of Ontario1 reached a
different conclusion and held that no moral fault could be imputed to the
accused and that the act committed in the circumstances of this case must be
regarded as involuntary. It held also that the undertaking of the accused to
drive the motor car was not a conscious act of the respondent’s volition.



The
trial judge found the accused guilty, but the Court of Appeal directed a
verdict of acquittal. In this Court, special leave to appeal was granted on the
following question:



Whether
the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that mens rea relating to both the
act of driving and to the state of being impaired by alcohol or drug is
an essential element of the offence of driving while impaired contrary to
section 223 of the Criminal Code.

[Page 749]



This
section 223 Cr. C., under which the respondent was charged, reads as
follows:



223.
DRIVING WHILE ABILITY TO DRIVE IS IMPAIRED.



Every
one who, while his ability to drive a motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or
drug, drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle,
whether it is in motion or not, is guilty of an indictable offence or an
offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable…



The
Crown’s contention is that under
s. 223 Cr. C., the driver of an automobile, whether conscious or not, if he has
imbibed liquor or drugs, is guilty of driving while impaired. The result is, as
found by the trial judge, that although involuntarily impaired, the accused
cannot be absolved.



The
Crown did not appeal to this Court that part of the judgment of the Court of
Appeal dealing with the mental capacity of the respondent. Therefore, the
question of jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to deal with the mental
capacity of the respondent is not before this Court. The real question arises
from the statement of the trial judge (trial de novo) who said in his
judgment: “The defence set by the
accused that this was all involuntary is not a defence as against this section.” The majority of the Court
of Appeal took the opposite view.



I
entirely disagree with the proposition of the Crown that whether the accused
knew he was impaired or not he must be found guilty, and that under s. 223 Cr.
C., no mental element has to be considered, and that the mere fact of
impairment is sufficient to create the offence.



It is my
view that there can be no actus reus unless it is the result of a
willing mind at liberty to make a definite choice or decision, or in other
words, there must be a willpower to do an act whether the accused knew or not
that it was prohibited by law.










These
words mens rea, though they are in common use, are, as Stephen J. said
in The Queen v. Tolson[2], most unfortunate and not
only likely to mislead but actually misleading. In the present case, intention
must not be confused with mens rea. Intention is not an element of the
offence of driving while impaired by liquor or drugs, when the offender
voluntarily takes liquor or drugs, and then drives a motor vehicle or takes the
care or control of it. There must be an

[Page 750]



act
proceeding from a free will that may bring about the mental condition necessary
to meet the requirements of s. 223 Cr. C.



When a
doctor has given an injection of a drug to a patient, who is not aware of the
state of mind it may produce, there is no volitive act done by the driver and
he cannot be convicted.



I would
dismiss the appeal.



The
judgment of Locke and Judson JJ. was delivered by



LOCKE
J.:—The charge laid against the
respondent and which was tried by a magistrate in Toronto was that he did on
October 8, 1959, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, unlawfully:



While
his ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired by a drug, drive a motor
vehicle License No. 94,547 for the year 1959, at about 3.35 p.m. on Indian
Grove near Dundas St. W., contrary to the Criminal Code, section 223.



Section 223
reads in part:



Every
one who, while his ability to drive a motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or a
drug, drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle,
whether it is in motion or not, is guilty of an indictable offence or an
offence punishable on summary conviction…



The
Crown elected to proceed by asking for a summary conviction and the matter was
so dealt with by the police magistrate who found the respondent guilty and
imposed a fine.










The
respondent appealed from this conviction to a County Court judge of the County
of York, under the provisions of s. 720 of the Criminal Code. After a
trial de novo, as required by s. 727, before His Honour Judge
Timmins, the conviction was affirmed and the appeal dismissed. The learned
County Court judge gave reasons for his judgment and made findings of fact upon
which he based his conclusion.



The
appeal to the Court of Appeal was taken under the provisions of s. 743 of the Criminal
Code with leave of that Court. The section, so far as relevant, reads:



An
appeal to the Court of Appeal as defined in section 581 may with leave of
that court be taken on any ground that involves a question of law alone,
against



(a)
a decision of a court in respect of an appeal under section 727.

[Page 751]



The
application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal was made upon various
grounds and, while leave was granted, the question of law in respect of which
the leave was granted is not stated in the judgment of that Court.



The
Crown applied to this Court for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court
of Appeal[3] and that leave was granted
on the following question of law:



Whether
the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that mens rea relating to
both the act of driving and to the state of being impaired by alcohol or drug
is an essential element of the offence of driving while impaired, contrary to
section 223 of the Criminal Code.



At the
outset of this appeal there lies the question as to whether this question of
law arises upon the facts which are to be considered. This is an appeal and not
a reference and, unless the question arises upon the facts as found by the
learned County Court judge, it should not, in my opinion, be answered.



The
judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal, to which I will hereafter
refer, disagreed with the findings made by the learned County Court judge but,
as to this, and with the greatest respect, it is upon the facts as found by the
County Court judge alone that we can deal with this matter.



The
findings of the learned County Court judge were, so far as they need be
considered, expressed as follows:










The
accused King had gone to see an oral surgeon and had made an appointment to
have two teeth extracted on the 8th of October 1959. He attended at the office,
the dentist office around two o’clock in the afternoon and
he was asked to fill out a form to give the dentist certain written
instructions and he says that he filled out the form and then he says that the
dentist gave him a needle. The teeth were then extracted and he was taken into
the recovery room where he remained for, I believe, half an hour and after that
when he came to there was a nurse who had conversation with him, gave him
certain instructions and asked him how he was going home and warned him about
driving a motor vehicle and then she gave him a receipt and then he left. He
walked over to where he had his motor car parked and he proceeded to drive
away. He hadn’t gone very far when he
said he became unconscious and had a slight accident with another car. Now in a
general way that is the evidence.



After referring
to the statement of the accused that he did not know anything about sodium
pentothal or what its effect would be and that he remembered signing a form but
did not admit that there was any warning on the form in respect

[Page 752]



of the
drug and that he did not deny the conversation with the nurse, merely saying
that he did not remember it, the learned judge said:



He
says at the time that he was leaving the office he was not asked if his head
was clear although he says that his head was clear. Now the serious defence of
the accused is that he had no knowledge of the drug, he did not know anything
about the effect of the drug on him and that there was nothing voluntary on his
part in respect to driving of the motor car because he was unconscious at the
time of the accident and that he cannot be responsible for something that he
did involuntarily. The next thing is that he did not know what effect the drug
would have therefore he did not know that when he got into his motor car that
he might not he subject to further effects of the drug. In other words he says
I had no knowledge that it was this drug that was administered to me, I had not
knowledge of what the effect would be on me and I have no recollection of this
warning that was said to have been given to me and if I did anything that was
wrong it was involuntary.



After
referring to s. 223 of the Code, the reasons proceed:



Now
having regard to the evidence of the accused, he knew that he had a drug and he
was given a warning, with respect to not driving a motor car. The
section is an express prohibition in respect to driving a motor car when
you have had a drug which will impair your driving and that the defence set up
by the accused that this was all involuntary is not a defence as against this
section. There were certain warnings that we have heard in evidence here today
and I have got to pay some attention to. First is that he was expected to sign
a form, and that form contained a warning,—”Patient is cautioned not to drive
after anaesthetic until head clears.”
I would have thought that that warning in itself was sufficient and the accused
does not admit that he signed this form, he admits he signed some form.



* * *










Now
the other warning was that Nurse Childs saw him when he regained consciousness
in the recovery room and that she talked with him, she gave him some
instructions, his account was paid and she asked him how he was going home and
he said that he was walking, she told him you can’t drive until your head is perfectly
clear, he said that he was walking and he left.



* * *



This
young man apparently had his motor car in the district to drive home. He knew
that he was going to get some treatment, some injection or he was going to be
given something in the doctor’s office in order to have
his teeth extracted. He was given a drug intravenously and a certain state of
amnesia was produced. He was given a warning I find by the dental nurse. I find
as a fact that he was given that warning but whether he deliberately lied to
the nurse or whether he unconsciously lied to her the fact of the matter is
that he did misinform the nurse that he was walking. He took the responsibility
of going to the car, he took the responsibility of driving his car knowing that
he had had a drug, he was driving his car and the charge is that he was in
charge of a motor vehicle when his ability was impaired. There is no doubt that
on all the evidence that he was impaired. In argument by counsel for the
accused there were reflections cast upon the dental profession that they should
never allow persons who have had this drug in respect to extractions of teeth
to leave their office unless he

[Page 753]



is
accompanied by some other adult person so that he cannot get into trouble. In
this case there were warnings and the accused paid no attention to them.



The
judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal was given by Schroeder J.A. and
it is upon the facts as found by him that the case for the respondent has been
argued before us. In the reasons delivered by that learned judge the following
appears:



The
learned County Court judge reached the conclusion upon the evidence that the
appellant was or should have been aware that his ability to drive a motor car
might be impaired by the use of this drug and accordingly he held that he was
bound to uphold the conviction. In my respectful opinion the evidence falls far
short of supporting that conclusion. On the contrary, the evidence indicates at
most that the accused was advised by the nurse and at a time when his mind was
probably in a muddled or confused state (undetected mental impairment as
described by Dr. Lucas) that he should not drive “until his head was perfectly clear.” It is highly probable
that, as he stated, he did not observe the caution on the printed form
mentioned by Dr. Richards. The evidence of Dr. Lucas suggests rather forcibly
that the appellant would not have been fully restored to normalcy for at least
eight hours, yet he was told that he should not drive until “his head was perfectly
clear.” This was left to the
judgment of a man who, at that time, was probably in a state of “undetected mental
impairment.” In that condition, he
would unwittingly delude both the nurse and himself. The evidence
overwhelmingly supports the view that when the appellant undertook to drive his
motor car he did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known
that his ability to drive was then or might thereafter become impaired, and in
a criminal case any contrary view would, in my opinion, be untenable.



The
question to be determined is whether the absence of such knowledge on the part
of the appellant in the particular circumstances is sufficient to exculpate
him.



Later
the reasons continue:










The
problem thus presented is this: If A attends at the office of a duly qualified
surgeon where a drug is administered to him, and he honestly believes that such
drug does not possess properties which will impair or are likely to impair his
ability to drive a motor car; or to fit the case at bar more precisely—if he is led to believe and
honestly believes that when his head is perfectly clear the drug cannot then
have the effect of impairing his ability to drive and he, in good faith,
believes that advice and acts upon it, would A, in the supposed circumstances,
be guilty of the crime of driving a motor car while his ability to drive was
impaired if that condition should develop unexpectedly after he had entered his
motor car and had commenced to operate it?



And
again:



Where,
therefore, a person is given a drug by his physician who does not warn him that
it is likely to affect his ability to drive, and the patient not being
negligent in failing to realize that fact, the drug takes sudden effect while
he is driving he would not, in my view, be guilty of an offence against
section 223. The facts must be viewed as a whole commencing at

[Page 754]



the
point when the drug was first administered by the doctor. The conclusion cannot
be avoided that in that case the patient was not even negligent.



* * *



Here
the appellant had no reason to anticipate that the drug administered to him
would impair his ability to drive a motor car “after his head had cleared.” His undertaking to drive
or his driving of the motor car was not, in the circumstances, a conscious act
of the appellant’s volition.



* * *



Unless
the appellant knew or ought to have known that when he undertook to drive, the
effect of the drug would incapacitate him within the meaning of
section 223, he could not have entertained the will to drive while his
ability to do so was impaired or was likely to become impaired.



McKay
J.A., who dissented and would have dismissed the appeal, agreed with the
findings of fact made by the learned trial judge but pointed out that the form
signed by the respondent which contained the warning against driving was signed
on Tuesday October 6th, two days in advance of the extraction of his teeth, at
which time there is no suggestion that he was under the influence of any drug,
and the further fact that when he was apprehended by the police officer he told
him that he had been to the dentist and been given sodium pentothal, which is
at variance with the respondent’s evidence that he did not
know what drug had been given to him, and that this fact was stated by him as
his explanation for the accident.










It will
be seen from the foregoing that the trial judge found as a fact that the
respondent knew that he had had a drug and that he was warned not to drive
after the anaesthetic. In referring to the warning on the form, the learned
judge said that he would have thought that warning was sufficient and found
further as a fact that the respondent had been warned by the nurse and that he
had made the statement to her that he was walking after leaving the dentist’s office, which was untrue,
and that his action in driving the car in these circumstances was deliberate.
The learned judge did not find that the condition of the respondent was such
that he could not appreciate the warnings given to him.



Schroeder
J.A. did not proceed upon the footing that there was no evidence to support
these findings but, upon his own view of the evidence, he considered that at
the time the warning was given by the nurse the respondent was in a muddled or
confused state and that it was highly probable

[Page 755]



that he
did not observe the caution on the printed form and that, in the condition he
was, “he would unwittingly delude
both the nurse and himself.” It was said further that
the evidence overwhelmingly supported the view that he “did not know and could not reasonably
be expected to have known that his ability to drive was then or might
thereafter become impaired.” The statement thereafter
made as to the question to be determined is based upon the premise that the
respondent honestly believed that the drug did not possess properties which
would impair or were likely to impair his ability to drive or that he was led
to believe and honestly believed that the drug could not have the effect of
impairing such ability. These findings directly conflict with those of the
judge at the trial.



In my
view, the question of law upon which leave to appeal was granted upon the
application of the Crown does not arise upon the facts found by the learned
County Court judge and these are the facts upon which the appeal must be
determined. Upon those findings of fact, in agreement with McKay J.A. I
consider that the accused was properly found guilty and the judgment should not
have been set aside.



While
the findings of fact made in the majority judgment in the Court of Appeal do
raise the question propounded, since this is not a reference I do not consider
that we should answer the question since it is unnecessary for the disposition
of the appeal. Had the respondent been successful in obtaining a finding of
fact from the learned County Court judge that he was unaware of the probable
effect of the drug and had not been warned as to this, issues which were
matters of defence, the situation would be otherwise, but there are no such
findings.










The
Crown, however, did not ask leave to appeal on the ground that the Court of
Appeal had exceeded its jurisdiction and the question was not argued before us.
In these circumstances, the proper course to be pursued, in my opinion, is to
dismiss this appeal.



The
judgment of Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by



RITCHIE
J.:—This is an appeal by the Crown
at the instance of the Attorney-General for Ontario from a judgment rendered by
the majority of the Court of Appeal of

[Page 756]



that
province[4] (MacKay J.A. dissenting)
which allowed the respondent’s appeal from a conviction
entered against him after a trial de novo held before Judge Timmins of
the County Court of the County of York for the offence of driving a motor
vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by a drug contrary to s. 223 of
the Criminal Code.










The
circumstances giving rise to this appeal are that on October 8, 1959, the
respondent went to his dentist’s office, by appointment,
for the purpose of having two teeth extracted, and that he was there injected
with a drug known as sodium pentothal, a quick-acting anaesthetic which
produces unconsciousness, removes pain and gives a certain amount of relaxation
during the period of an operation, and before using which the dentist stated
that it was the practice of his office to have patients sign a printed form
containing the following warning: “Patients
are cautioned not to drive after anaesthetic until head clears.” After he had regained
consciousness, the respondent paid his bill by cheque to a nurse who was in
attendance and who states that at this time he appeared “perfectly normal” and that she warned him
not to drive his car until his head was “perfectly clear” to which he replied that
he intended to walk. The respondent says that he heard no such warning and remembers
signing no form containing any warning, but he does remember getting into his
car which he had parked about a block away and proceeding across an
intersection, after which he became unconscious, and his car ran into the left
rear portion of a parked vehicle, whereafter the police appeared to find that
he was staggering and that his physical co-ordination was poor. This was later
verified by a sergeant at the police station where the respondent was submitted
to certain tests. Medical evidence was given to the effect that this mental and
physical condition was consistent with the after-effects of being injected with
sodium pentothal and that this drug may induce a state of amnesia accompanied
by a period during which the subject may feel perfectly competent to get in a
car and drive and in the next second or so be in a condition in which he would
not know what was happening. The respondent stated that he did not know
anything about the drug which was administered to him.

[Page 757]



The
learned County Court judge convicted the respondent on the ground that “he knew that he had a drug
and he was given a warning with respect to driving a motor car” and also that “he took the responsibility
of going to the car, he took the responsibility of driving his car knowing that
he had had a drug”.



The
respondent’s sole defence was that he
had no knowledge of the effect of the drug which resulted in his being unaware
of any warning and unaware of the fact that he was impaired when he took the
responsibility to drive and did drive his car.



The
County Court judge expressed the following view of the evidence as to the
effect of the drug:



Evidence
seems to point out that this would produce amnesia and that the patient would
go unconscious and that this may last for some considerable time or it might
last just for a short time.



If the
County Court judge had found that the respondent knew of the possible effects
of the drug before he took it or that he was capable of being aware of the fact
that he was impaired when he started to drive and drove his car, then the
question now before this Court would not have arisen in this case, but the
judge made no such finding but disposed of the respondent’s only defence in
accordance with his view of the legal effect of s. 223 of the Criminal Code which
he expressed as follows:



The
section is an express prohibition in respect to driving a motor car when
you have had a drug which would impair your driving and that the defence set
up by the accused that this was all involuntary is not a defence against this
section. (The italics are mine.)



Expressing
the same opinion in slightly different language, he later said: “There is nothing in
Section 223 of the Code about an involuntary act. The section is
specific.”










The
question of law so determined was made a ground of appeal and for leave to
appeal to the Court of Appeal of Ontario, and Mr. Justice MacKay, in the
course of his dissenting opinion, stated the issue before that Court in the
clearest terms, saying: “I think all these grounds
of appeal raise only one issue, that is, to what extent, if at all, does the
doctrine of mens rea apply to this offence.”



Just as
the learned County Court judge dealt with this issue in the concluding
paragraph of his reasons by saying: “In
this case the accused was impaired by reason of a drug.

[Page 758]



I
cannot hold anything else, and, therefore, the conviction will be affirmed…”, so Mr. Justice
MacKay expressed the same conclusion rather more fully by saying:



For
these reasons I have come to the conclusion that the offence here charged is
one of strict liability in which proof of actus reus alone is required,
that is, proof that the defendant drove his car and was in fact impaired. In
this particular case the defendant knew he had been given a drug and he
intentionally drove his car. Even if it was a fact that he did not know or did
not believe that he was impaired such knowledge or belief is not material and
is not a defence.



On the
other hand, Mr. Justice Schroeder, speaking for the majority of the Court,
stated the exactly opposite view in these words:



Even
in the case of statutory crimes, therefore, the offender should not be
condemned if his conduct was not voluntary, save in cases where such exception
is expressly or by necessary implication excluded in the Act creating the
offence…



Unless
the appellant knew or ought to have known that when he undertook to drive, the
effect of the drug would incapacitate him within the meaning of
section 223, he could not have entertained the will to drive while his ability
to do so was impaired or was likely to become impaired. This is a true case of ignorantia
facti which should have been held to have excused the actus reus prohibited
by the statute.



These
quotations are sufficient to indicate the sharp difference of opinion which
existed in the Courts below as to a decisive question of law, and although it
may be said, with all respect, that the judges in the Court of Appeal strayed
into the making of some unnecessary observations on the facts, it is nonetheless
the question of law which gave rise to this difference which has been made the
subject of the sole ground upon which leave to appeal to this Court has been
granted under the provisions of s, 41(3) of the Supreme Court Act. That
question is expressed in the order by which leave to appeal was granted as
follows:



Whether
the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that mens rea relating to both the
act of driving and to the state of being impaired by alcohol or drug is an
essential element of the offence of driving while impaired contrary to
Section 223 of the Criminal Code.



The
provisions of s. 223 of the Code are as follows:










223.
Every one who, while his ability to drive a motor vehicle is impaired by
alcohol or a drug, drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor
vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, is guilty of an indictable offence or
an offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable

[Page 759]



(a)
for a first offence, to a fine of not more than five hundred dollars and not
less than fifty dollars or to imprisonment for three months or to both,



(b)
for a second offence, to imprisonment for not more than three months and
not less than fourteen days, and



(c)
for each subsequent offence, to imprisonment for not more than one year and not
less than three months.



The
cases in England and Australia which have been so fully reviewed by the Court
of Appeal indicate that there have been differences in approach in determining
the extent to which “knowledge of the
wrongfulness of the act” is to be regarded as a
constituent in statutory offences.



In the
decision of Wright J. in Sherras v. De Rutzen[5], that learned judge stated:



There
is a presumption that mens rea, an evil intention, or a knowledge of the
wrongfulness of the act, is an essential ingredient in every offence; but that
presumption is liable to be displaced either by the words of the statute
creating the offence or by the subject-matter with which it deals and both must
be considered.



On the
other hand, in the case of Hobbs v. Winchester Corporation[6], which involved the sale of
tainted meat contrary to the Public Health Act, Kennedy L.J. concluded
that “there is a clear balance of
authority that in construing a modern statute this presumption as to mens
rea does not exist”.



The
weight of opinion, however, clearly favours the view expressed by Wright J. and
the rule has been forcefully stated on more than one occasion by Lord Goddard
C.J. who expressed himself in the following language in Harding v. Price[7]:



The
general rule applicable to criminal cases is actus non facit reum nisi mens sit
rea, and I venture to repeat what I said in Brend v. Wood, (1946) 62
T.L.R. 462, 463: “It is of the utmost
importance for the protection of the liberty of the subject that a court should
always bear in mind that unless a statute either clearly or by necessary
implication rules out mens rea as a constituent part of a crime, the court
should not find a man guilty of an offence against the criminal law unless he
has a guilty mind”.










(See
also Younghusband v. Luftig[8], and the decision of the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in Regina v. Jollimore[9] per Mr. Justice V.C. MacDonald at
p. 306 et seq.)

[Page 760]



This
view has been adopted by this Court in unmistakable terms in Beaver v. The
Queen[10], where Cartwright J.,
speaking for the majority of the Court at p. 538, adopted the following
statement made by Estey J. in Watts and Gaunt v. The Queen[11]:



While
an offence of which mens rea is not an essential ingredient may be
created by legislation, in view of the general rule a section creating an
offence ought not to be so construed unless Parliament has, by express language
or necessary implication, disclosed such an intention.



As
there is no express language in s. 223 of the Criminal Code disclosing
the intention of Parliament to rule out mens rea as an essential
ingredient of the crime therein described, it becomes necessary to determine
whether it can be said that such an intention is disclosed by necessary
implication.



In classifying
the types of statute in which such an intention has been implied, the learned
authors, writing under the title “Criminal
Law and Procedure” in vol. 10 of Halsbury’s Laws of England, 3rd ed.,
at p. 275, adopt the three exceptions to the general rule which are suggested
by Wright J. in Sherras v. De Rutzen, supra, at p. 921 and state:



Most
statutes creating a strict liability fall under three heads. First, where the
acts are not criminal in any real sense, but are prohibited under a penalty in
the public interest. Secondly, where the acts are public nuisances; thus, an
employer has been held liable on indictment for a nuisance caused by workmen
without his knowledge and contrary to his orders. Thirdly, where, although the
proceeding is criminal in form, it is really only a summary mode of enforcing a
civil right.



Mr. Justice
MacKay concluded that s. 223 of the Criminal Code comes within the first
exception to the general rule in that it is “an act perhaps not criminal in any
real sense but which is in the public interest prohibited”. He finds that:



A
person whose ability to drive is impaired by alcohol or drugs, driving on the
highway, is a danger to the general public and in my view the offence falls
within the first classification referred to by Wright J. in the Sherras case.
It is an act perhaps not criminal in any real sense but which is in the public
interest prohibited.










I am,
with respect, unable to agree that the offence created by s. 223 is “perhaps not criminal in any
real sense”. On the contrary, it
appears to me that if a person takes charge of a motor vehicle on the highways
of this country knowing that his ability to do so is impaired by alcohol or

[Page 761]



a drug,
he is doing an act which is not only criminal in the sense of being punishable
by the Criminal Code but which is also criminal in the “real sense” as those words were used
by Wright J. because such a driver must be taken to be aware that his impaired
condition constitutes a danger to the life, limb and safety of other users of
the highway, and the question of whether he acted knowingly or not, therefore,
seems to me to be all the more important.



It is
to be observed also that when Wright J. was referring to acts “which…are not criminal in any
real sense,…” he was referring to such
things as the possession of liquorice by a beer retailer, the possession of
adulterated tobacco, the possession of game by a carrier and such like matters,
all of which are far removed from the offence of driving a potentially highly
dangerous machine when your ability to do so is impaired.



In my
view the seriousness of the offence created by s. 223 removes it entirely from
the categories referred to by Wright J. and this will be seen to be recognized
by the mandatory provisions in s. 223(b) and (c) which provide
for imprisonment for a second or subsequent offence.



In the
course of his decision in Beaver v. The Queen, supra, at p. 542,
Cartwright J. had occasion to observe that in that case:



Counsel
informed us that they have found no other statutory provision which has been
held to create a crime of strict responsibility, that is to say, one in which
the necessity for mens rea is excluded, on conviction for which a
sentence of imprisonment is mandatory.



No such
statute has been referred to us in the present case, and it appears to me that the
nature of the penalty imposed by s. 223(b) and (c) affords
an indication that Parliament did not intend to exclude mens rea as an
essential ingredient of the offence which it created.










It is,
however, submitted on behalf of the appellant that s. 223 ought to be construed
to create an offence of absolute liability on the ground that “the object of the
legislation is patently to protect the public from danger”, but I am unable to agree
that the legislative intention to protect the public from harm or danger can,
of itself, provide an exception to the general rule as to the existence of mens
rea. If

[Page 762]



this
were so, it would indeed encompass a wide variety of criminal acts, for as Rand
J. said in Lord’s Day Alliance v.
Attorney-General for British Columbia[12]:



Undoubtedly
criminal acts are those forbidden by law, ordinarily at least if not
necessarily accompanied by penal sanctions, enacted to serve what is
considered a public interest or to interdict what is deemed a public harm or
evil. (The italics are mine.)



In the
course of his most interesting dissenting opinion, MacKay J.A. refers to the
decision of Dixon J. of the High Court of Australia in Proudman v. Dayman[13]. The learned judge in that
case was dealing with an offence against the Road Traffic Act of South
Australia which is a jurisdiction where no code of criminal law exists, and he
had occasion to say of the presumption as to the existence of mens rea as
an essential ingredient of crime:



The
strength of the presumption that the rule applies to a statutory offence newly
created varies with the nature of the offence and the scope of the statute. If
the purpose of the statute is to add a new crime to the general criminal law,
it is natural to suppose that it is to be read subject to the general
principles according to which that law is administered. But other
considerations arise where in matters of police, of health, of safety or the
like the legislature adopts penal measures in order to cast on the individual
the responsibility of so conducting his affairs that the general welfare will
not be prejudiced.



In my
view the enactment of s. 223 of the Criminal Code added a new crime to
the general criminal law, and neither the language in which it was enacted nor
the evil which it was intended to prevent are such as to give rise to a
necessary implication that Parliament intended to impose absolute liability
unless the impaired condition which the section prohibits was brought
about by some conscious act of the will or intention.



Consideration
of this phase of the question should not be concluded without noting the
decision in Armstrong v. Clark[14], in which the Queen’s Bench Division had to
consider the question of










…whether the taking of
insulin by the respondent was, in the circumstances which occurred, to be
regarded as taking a drug which would make him liable to be found guilty of an
offence under s. 15(1)…



of the Road
Traffic Act, and in which Lord Goddard said:



This
case must go back with a direction that the justices may take into account a
great many things, but they must remember, and everyone must remember, that
this section was designed for the protection of the

[Page 763]



public,
and if people happen to be in a condition of health that renders them subject
to going into a coma, or forces them to take remedies which may send them into
a coma, the answer is that they must not drive because they are a danger to the
rest of Her Majesty’s subjects.



I do
not think that anything that was said by Lord Goddard in that case can be taken
as changing the law with respect to mens rea in statutory offences as it
was stated by the same learned judge and adopted by this Court in the cases
hereinbefore referred to. It is noteworthy, however, that in the course of this
decision, Lord Goddard does make the observation with respect to the statutory
offence with which he was dealing: “The
penalty, I need hardly say, is entirely at the discretion of the bench.”



The
existence of mens rea as an essential ingredient of an offence and the
method of proving the existence of that ingredient are two different things,
and I am of opinion that when it has been proved that a driver was driving a
motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug,
then a rebuttable presumption arises that his condition was voluntarily induced
and that he is guilty of the offence created by s. 223 and must be convicted
unless other evidence is adduced which raises a reasonable doubt as to whether
he was, through no fault of his own, disabled when he undertook to drive and
drove, from being able to appreciate and know that he was or might become
impaired.



If the
driver’s lack of appreciation when
he undertook to drive was induced by voluntary consumption of alcohol or of a
drug which he knew or had any reasonable ground for believing might cause him
to be impaired, then he cannot, of course, avoid the consequences of the
impairment which results by saying that he did not intend to get into such a
condition, but if the impairment has been brought about without any act of his
own will, then, in my view, the offence created by s. 223 cannot be said to
have been committed.










The
existence of a rebuttable presumption that a man intends the natural
consequences of his own conduct is a part of our law, but its application to
any particular situation involves a consideration of what consequences a man
might be reasonably expected to foresee under the circumstances.

[Page 764]



In the
course of the lecture on “The Criminal Law” which is contained in the
well-known work by O.W. Holmes Jr. on the “Common Law”, that learned author says:



As
the purpose is to compel men to abstain from dangerous conduct, and not merely
to restrain them from evil inclinations, the law requires them at their peril
to know the teachings of common experience, just as it requires them to know
the law.



It
seems to me that it can be taken as a matter of “common experience” that the consumption of
alcohol may produce intoxication and, therefore, “impairment” in the sense in which that word is
used in s. 223, and I think it is also to be similarly taken to be known that
the use of narcotics may have the same effect, but if it appears that the
impairment was produced as a result of using a drug in the form of medicine on
a doctor’s order or recommendation
and that its effect was unknown to the patient, then the presumption is, in my
view, rebutted.



For all
the above reasons, I do not think that the Court of Appeal erred in holding
that mens rea was an essential element of the offence of driving while
impaired contrary to s. 223 of the Criminal Code, but I am of opinion
that that element need not necessarily be present in relation both to the act
of driving and to the state of being impaired in order to make the offence
complete. That is to say, that a man who becomes impaired as the result of
taking a drug on medical advice without knowing its effect cannot escape
liability if he became aware of his impaired condition before he started to
drive his car just as a man who did not appreciate his impaired condition when
he started to drive cannot escape liability on the ground that his lack of
appreciation was brought about by voluntary consumption of liquor or drug. The
defence in the present case was that the respondent became impaired through no
act of his own will and could not reasonably be expected to have known that his
ability was impaired or might thereafter become impaired when he undertook to
drive and drove his motor vehicle.



I would
dismiss this appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.

Criminal law—Appeal by way of stated case—Whether
questions of law raised—Whether necessary facts before the Court—Whether proper
procedure.

The appellant, who had been an employee of the respondent,
laid an information under The Employment Standards Act, 1957 (Man.), c.
20, charging that the respondent had unlawfully failed to pay him overtime
rates. When the matter came before the magistrate, he, without hearing any
evidence, ordered the charges dismissed on the grounds that the information was
for an offence which took place more than six months before the time when the
proceedings were commenced and that the information was void for duplicity and
could not be amended. On appeal by way of a stated case, the respondent moved
in the Court of Appeal, before any hearing on the merits, to dismiss the appeal
upon grounds that the stated case did not raise a question of law; that the

[Page 565]

stated case was defective in form in that it did not contain a
statement of facts sufficient to enable the Court to come to a decision of the
question of law; and that the appellant's proper procedure was not to appeal by
way of stated case but to move for a mandamus to compel the magistrate
to exercise his jurisdiction. By a majority decision the motion was allowed and
the stated case quashed. Pursuant to special leave, the appellant appealed to
this Court.

Held: The appeal should be allowed and the order of the
Court of Appeal set aside.

The rules of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba which prescribed
what was to be contained in a case stated under the Code were made by the
Judges of the Court of Appeal under the powers vested in them by the Code on
May 13, 1930. The case in the present matter complied with these requirements.

The points referred to in the stated case were matters of law
which had in fact been dealt with by way of written submissions to the
magistrate. Every fact necessary to decide the questions of law was before the
Court and the points of law were arguable upon the face of the information
itself. As to the objection that the proper procedure was not by way of stated
case but by mandamus to compel the magistrate to exercise his
jurisdiction, this was not the case of a magistrate declining to enter upon a
hearing because he was of the opinion that he had no jurisdiction, but one in
which, exercising his jurisdiction, he had dismissed the information on grounds
of law which appeared to him sufficient.

The motion to dismiss or quash the stated case, as it was
expressed, should have been dismissed and the questions of law, which were
clearly raised, determined.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba1, which dismissed an appeal from a
decision of Police Magistrate Kyle dismissing an information laid under The
Employment Standards Act, 1957 (Man.), c. 20. Appeal allowed.

D. Gibson, for the complainant, appellant.

G. A. Higenbottam, and R. B. Goodwin, for
the defendant, respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Locke J.:—This
is an appeal brought by special leave of this Court from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Manitoba2 which dismissed the appeal of the
present appellant from a decision of Police Magistrate Kyle of the Provincial
Police Court, dismissing an information laid against the respondent under the
provisions of The Employment Standards Act, 1957 (Man.), c. 20.

[Page 566]

At the request of the present appellant, the magistrate
stated a case under the provisions of s. 734 of the Criminal Code. The
respondent moved before the Court of Appeal to ""quash or dismiss the
appeal"" and it was upon this motion that the appeal to that Court was
dismissed and, accordingly, the questions of law propounded were not
considered.

Section 27 of The Employment Standards Act provides
that no employer shall require or permit an employee to work or be on duty for
more than 8 hours in a day and, if a male employee, for more than 48 hours in
any week unless in place of the rate of wages ordinarily paid the employer pays
him overtime rates for each hour in excess of these limits the employee is
required or permitted to work.

Section 14 declares, inter alia, that every person
who contravenes any provision of the Act is guilty of an offence and, if no
other penalty is by the Act provided, is liable on summary conviction to a
fine, in the case of an employer, of $500, and to imprisonment or to both. By
subs. (2), where the contravention continues for more than one day, the person
is guilty of a separate offence for each day that it continues.

Section 16(2) provides that in default of payment by an
employer of wages found to be due by him, the magistrate may issue his warrant
to levy the amount of the wages and costs by seizure and sale of the goods and
chattels of the employer.

Prosecutions for offences under this statute are subject to
the provisions of The Summary Convictions Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 254. By
s. 7 of that Act, Part XV of the Criminal Code applies and, inter
alia, the present s. 693(2). This provides that no proceedings may be
instituted more than six months after the time when the subject-matter of the
proceedings arose.

The information charges the respondent with having permitted
Dressier

to be on duty for more than eight hours on various days between
the 9th day of February, AD. 1959 and the 28th day of November, A.D. 1959; and
between the 6th day of April, A.D. 1960 and the 18th day of May, AX). 1960, did
(sic), on the 18th day of May AX). 1960, unlawfully fail to pay to the said
Walter Dressier, overtime rates for each hour or part of an hour in excess of
the said eight hours worked on the said days in place of the rate of wages
ordinarily paid to the said Walter Dressier, contrary to the provisions of the
Employment Standards' Act R.S.M. 1957, Chap. 20.

[Page 567]

The matter came before the magistrate on November 21, 1960,
and, without hearing any evidence, he ordered that the charges be dismissed on
the following grounds, namely that:

(1) The Information was defective in that it disclosed the occurrence
of an offence the subject matter of which took place in part more than six
months before the time that the proceedings were instituted

(2) The Information was void for duplicity and not capable
of being amended.

The respondent moved in the Court of Appeal, before any
hearing on the merits, to dismiss the appeal upon grounds only three of which
require consideration, namely, that the stated case did not raise a question of
law: that the stated case was defective in form in that it did not contain a
statement of facts sufficient to enable the Court to come to a decision of the
question of law: and that the appellant's proper procedure was not to appeal by
way of stated case but to move for a mandamus to compel the magistrate
to exercise his jurisdiction.

The learned Chief Justice of Manitoba, with whom Schultz and
Guy JJ.A. agreed, considered that the stated case was defective in not
disclosing that the dismissal was made on preliminary objections without
hearing evidence: that the facts upon which the magistrate based his ruling
that the information was void for duplicity and not capable of being amended
were not set out in the case as stated: that while reference was made to the
information the case did not state what evidence was offered by way of admission
of facts or otherwise to contradict or support the charges made and that there
was not a sufficient disclosure of the grounds upon which the magistrate based
his decision. Accordingly, he considered that the stated case should be
quashed. The learned Chief Justice, while mentioning an objection raised that
the stated case should not have been entitled ""In the Court of
Appeal"", considered that it was unnecessary to deal with it.

In the dissenting judgment of Tritschler J.A. (now
C.J.Q.B.), with whom Freedman J.A. agreed, there is a résumé of the contents of
certain affidavits filed before the Court of Appeal by the parties which
described what had taken place before the magistrate and the manner in which
the stated case had been approved before being signed by him and its terms are
stated in extenso.

[Page 568]

The rules of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba which
prescribe what is to be contained in a case stated under the Code were made by
the Judges of the Court of Appeal under the powers vested in them by the Code
on May 13, 1930 (see the Canada Gazette, June 7, 1930, vol. 63, p. 4464). The
case in the present matter, in my opinion, complies with these requirements.

Dealing with the objections advanced in the respondent's
motion to the Court, Tritschler J.A. said in part:

As to ground 1, that the stated case does not raise a
question of law: Defendant's counsel submits that what the magistrate decided
were questions of fact; it was a matter of knowing the calendar and applying
simple mathematics; he had only to count back from August 15, 1960. the date of
the information, to certain dates mentioned in the information or to count
forward from those dates to August 15 and see if the period exceeded 6 months;
if there was an error it was an error of calculation; as to the alleged
duplicity of the information, it was simply a question of counting the charges
and if there was an error it was a mistake of counting. I found it difficult to
believe, and still do, that these submissions could be seriously put forward.
The points involved were matters of law which had in fact been dealt with by
way of written submissions to the magistrate by solicitors for both sides. The
complainant's position as outlined in his factum to us is: that the six months'
limitation period is not applicable because the Legislature has ""otherwise
specially provided"" (The Summary Convictions Act, R.S.M. 1954, Cap. 254,
Sec. 7); that employment at overtime is not an offence but the offence is
failure to pay for overtime; the offence takes place at termination of
employment if overtime wages are left outstanding; sec. 14(2) of The Employment
Standards Act makes the non-payment for overtime a continuing offence; if the
six months' limitation was applicable and part of the offence took place six
months prior to the date of the information, the magistrate should not have
dismissed the information but should have allowed recovery in respect of that
part of the wages claimed which were earned and not paid within a period of six
months before the date of the information; there was one offence and not two
and it occurred on May 18, 1960; in any event the magistrate had the right
under sec. 704 of the Code to permit amendment.

And again:

Every fact necessary to decide the questions of law is
before the Court. As appears from what has been said under the head of ground
1, the points of law are arguable upon the face of the information itself. The
learned Magistrate's question (i) raises the issue whether ""the
Information was defective in that it disclosed"", etc. The only fact
necessary here is the Information itself, which is fully set out in the case.
Question (ii) raises the issue whether the Information was void for duplicity.
Here again the Information is the only fact required. Obviously what the learned
Magistrate said is that, looking at the Information alone, he could see
duplicity in it; that it showed duplicity on its face. No amount of facts other
that the Information could be relevant here. Whether the Information was
capable of amendment is pure law.

[Page 569]

As to the objection that the proper procedure was not by way
of stated case but by mandamus to compel the magistrate to exercise his
jurisdiction, he pointed out that this was not the case of a magistrate
declining to enter upon a hearing because he was of the opinion that he had no
jurisdiction, but one in which, exercising his jurisdiction, he had dismissed
the information on grounds of law which appeared to him sufficient.

With these conclusions I agree and, with the greatest
respect for the contrary opinion of the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba, I
consider that the motion of the respondent to dismiss or quash the stated case,
as it was expressed, should have been dismissed and the questions of law, which
appear to me to be clearly raised, determined.

If it were the opinion of the Court that any clearer
statement of the questions of law to be determined was required, the proper
course, in my opinion, was to send the case back to the magistrate for
amendment and to deliver judgment after it had been amended under the powers
contained in s. 740 of the Criminal Code.

I would allow this appeal and set aside the order of the
Court of Appeal with costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal, to be paid
by the respondent to the appellant in any event of the appeal forthwith after
taxation.

Appeal allowed, the order of the Court of
Appeal set aside and the matter returned to that Court to be dealt with on the
merits. Respondent to pay in any event costs in this Court and costs in the
Court of Appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Conviction for
counterfeiting—Monies in possession of accused at time of arrest filed as
exhibits—Disappearance of monies from registry—Application for return of
exhibits or equivalent sum—Alternative claim a claim to recover monies from
Crown—Proceedings to be initiated by petition of right—Crown's liability to be
first determined by Supreme Court of the province.

The respondent was convicted on charges of counterfeiting. At
the time of his arrest he had in his possession two envelopes, each of which
was said to contain a specified amount of American currency, and the envelopes
said to contain these monies were filed as exhibits at the trial. After his
conviction they remained in the custody of the registrar of the Court, but
later they disappeared from the registry. An application for an order that the
money exhibits be returned to the respondent or alternatively that a sum of
money equivalent in value to the said money exhibits be paid to the respondent
in lieu of the return of the money exhibits was dismissed. On appeal, the Court
of Appeal held that the appeal should be allowed and an order made that the
money exhibits be returned to the respondent. By leave of this Court the Crown
appealed from that judgment.

Held: The appeal should be allowed.

The alternative claim advanced was a claim to recover monies
from the Crown. The Court of Appeal dealt with the matter on the footing that
the monies were then in the custody of the registrar, whereas there were no
such monies. Since this was made known to the Court in a report made by the County
Court judge and was common ground between the parties, the proper construction
to be placed upon the judgment was that it constituted an award against the
Crown in favour of the respondent in the amount stated. The respondent's
remedy, if any, was by proceedings initiated by petition of right under the
provisions of the Crown Procedure Act. The question of the Crown's
liability must first have been determined by the Supreme Court of the province
before the Court of Appeal acquired jurisdiction to deal with the matter. The
order dismissing the application should therefore be restored upon the ground
that the County Court was without jurisdiction to deal with the money claim
made against the Crown.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], setting aside an order of Remnant C.C.J. Appeal
allowed.

[Page 4]

W. G. Burke-Robertson,
Q.C., for the appellant.

H. Rankin, for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

LOCKE J.:—This is an appeal
brought by leave granted by this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[2] setting
aside an order made by His Honour Judge Remnant in the County Court of
Vancouver and directing that a sum of $3,275 in American funds, or the
equivalent thereof in Canadian funds, be paid to the respondent.

The respondent Doig was on April 25, 1957,
found guilty in the County Court Judge's Criminal Court of Vancouver of four
charges of counterfeiting and conspiracy to counterfeit and sentenced to four
years' imprisonment. At the time of his arrest he had in his possession two
envelopes, one of which was said to contain $2,200 in American currency and the
second $1,075 of such currency, and the envelopes said to contain these monies
were filed as exhibits at his trial. After his conviction they remained in the
custody of the registrar of the Court.

Following the release of Doig
from the penitentiary, his solicitor served a notice on counsel for the Crown
which was entitled ""In the County Court Judge's Criminal Court In the
Matter of Regina vs. William Thomas Alexander Doig"" and which stated that
an application would be made before the judge in chambers on September 19,
1960, for an order

that the money exhibits in
the criminal case of Regina vs. Doig, number 31/57 be returned to the Defendant.

This application was supported by
an affidavit of Mr. Lawrence E. Hill, the solicitor for Doig, which stated, inter
alia, that he had been advised by the registrar that:

the original money exhibit
is no longer within the custody of the said Registrar, the said original
exhibit having disappeared from the said Registry and that whatever disposition
is made of the monies hereinbefore referred to it will be necessary that the
Province of British Columbia replace the said monies with an equivalent amount.

Thereafter, a notice dated
October 3, 1960, was served by the solicitor for Doig informing the Crown that:

the application will be for
an Order directing that the money exhibits in the criminal case of Regina vs.
Doig be returned to the Defendant or alternatively that a sum of money
equivalent in value to the said money exhibits be paid to the Defendant in lieu
of the return of the said money exhibits.

[Page 5]

While the amended notice did not
say in terms that what was proposed was an order against the Crown to pay the
missing monies, it is common ground that this was the relief sought.

The learned County Court judge
dismissed the application and while no written reasons were given at the time,
when the appeal was taken by Doig from the order the learned judge made a
report to the Court of Appeal, stated to be made pursuant to s. 588(1) of the Criminal
Code, in which it was said that all the monies were proved to be the
proceeds of the criminal activities of Doig and that they should remain in
custody of the Court. The report concluded by stating that the fact that the
money had disappeared from the registry was beside the point.

The formal order dismissing the
application was entitled ""In the County Court Judge's Criminal Court""
and the style of cause was ""Regina vs. William Thomas Alexander Doig.""

The judgment delivered by the
learned Chief Justice of British Columbia did not mention the fact that the
monies were missing. After saying that it had been agreed by counsel on the
hearing of the appeal that it had not been established that the money had been
obtained by the commission of the offence for which the appellant had been
convicted, he said:

It is clear as a result of
the foregoing that the question here and the order appealed from affect a right
to property in the custody of the County Court in respect of which there is no
applicable provisions of the Criminal Code. The order sought by the appellant
is not one to be made or refused under the criminal jurisdiction of the County
Court. This Court, in my opinion, has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal and
the motion of the Crown to quash should be denied.

After referring to authorities
indicating that monies taken from an accused person, unless they are shown to
have been obtained by the commission of an offence, should be returned to him,
the learned Chief Justice said:

This Court has jurisdiction
to make the order that should have been made in the Court below, the appeal
should be allowed and an order made that the money be paid out to the
appellant.

The style of cause in the formal
judgment entered in the Court of Appeal was ""Regina,
Respondent, William Thomas Alexander Doig, Appellant."" After stating that
the appeal was allowed, the judgment reads:

and the said money exhibits
amounting to Three Thousand Two Hundred and Seventy-five dollars in American
funds or the equivalent thereof in Canadian funds are hereby ordered returned
to the appellant.

[Page 6]

It will be seen from the
foregoing that the matter has been treated in both Courts as if the monies in
question were in the hands of the proper official of the Court, the registrar,
presumably as a servant of the Crown. While, as I have pointed out, it was
known to the parties before the matter came before the learned County Court
judge that the monies were missing, the solicitor for the present respondent,
while appreciating that he could not obtain the form of relief sought in the
original notice of motion, failed to appreciate that the alternative claim
advanced was a claim to recover monies from the Crown.

If there was any basis for such a
claim, presumably it would be for damages for conversion or for negligence of
some servant of the Crown. In whatever form the claim might have been advanced,
the matter would be governed by the provisions of the Crown Procedure Act,
R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 89, and the Court having jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of
British Columbia, if a fiat were obtained from the Lieutenant-Governor in
Council, and the proceedings would be by petition of right.

This aspect of the matter does
not appear to have been drawn to the attention of the learned County Court
judge who treated the application as if it were made in the criminal
proceedings against the respondent which had been terminated years before. The
appeal to the Court of Appeal which was brought by leave was not one under Part
18 of the Criminal Code and s. 588(1), requiring a report by the judge
in appeals and applications for leave to appeal taken under that part, was
inapplicable.

In the judgment of the Court of
Appeal it was pointed out that the order sought was not one to be made or
refused in the exercise of the criminal jurisdiction of the County Court.
However, that judgment, with great respect, dealt with the matter on the
footing that the monies were then in the custody of the registrar, whereas
there were no such monies.

Since this was made known to the
Court in the report made by the County Court judge and was common ground
between the parties, the proper construction to be placed upon the judgment is,
in my opinion, that it constitutes an award against the Crown in favour of the
respondent in the amount stated.

[Page 7]

Claims of this nature against the
Crown may not be established in proceedings initiated by notice of motion in
the County Court. As I have pointed out, the respondent's remedy, if any, was
by proceedings initiated by petition of right under the provisions of the Crown
Procedure Act. The question of the Crown's liability must first have been
determined by the Supreme Court of the province before the Court of Appeal
acquired jurisdiction to deal with the matter.

The appeal should be allowed with
costs and the order dismissing the application be restored upon the ground that
the County Court was without jurisdiction to deal with the money claim made
against the Crown. The dismissal should be without prejudice to any claims the
respondent may be advised to make in the matter in proceedings properly
constituted.

Appeal allowed and the
order dismissing the application restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Evidence—Gross
indecency—Similar facts—Criminal Code, s. 157.

Appellant was convicted by a judge without a
jury of three counts of gross indecency with three adolescents. The offences
were committed in the office of appellant, who is a specialist in education and
counselling. The Crown introduced similar fact evidence involving two other
adolescents and this evidence was admitted by the trial judge. The majority of
the Court of Appeal confirmed the conviction: Rinfret J.A. was of opinion that
there had been no error in law, while Crête J.A. held that even though the
similar fact evidence had been improperly admitted, appellant had not thereby
suffered any serious prejudice. Dubé J.A., however, expressed his dissent:
hence the appeal as of right to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The trial judge showed that he was fully
aware of the danger of convicting without corroboration in cases of gross
indecency. There is thus no reason for substituting a different assessment of
the facts for his, since the question is essentially one of credibility, and he
had the inestimable advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses.

On the admissibility of similar fact
evidence, it is in the discernment of the trial judge. In exercising this
discretion, he must have regard to the general principles established by the
cases. There is no closed list of the sort of cases where such evidence is
admissible. It is, however, well established that it may be admitted to rebut a
defence of legitimate association for honest purposes, as well as to rebut
evidence of good character. Since the defence in the case at bar was precisely,
besides character evidence, that the visits of the young witnesses had been
made for perfectly legitimate purposes, the similar fact evidence was certainly
admissible in rebuttal. Nevertheless, since the accused could not possibly have
asked for an acquittal without this defence, he suffered no prejudice from
similar fact evidence having been admitted in chief.

[Page 19]

Secondly, where similar fact evidence is thus
admissible, the evidence on each similar count may also be used to corroborate
the evidence in each of the other cases. The evidence on each count therefore
becomes admissible to rebut the defence on each of the other counts, with no
necessity of having it repeated.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal of Quebec[1]
affirming a conviction by a judge of the Court of the Sessions. Appeal
dismissed.

Claude Filion and Gérard Beaudry, for the
appellant.

Jean Montplaisir, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

PIGEON J.—This appeal is from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal of the Province
of Quebec, [1976] C.A. 67,
affirming a conviction by Dollard Dansereau J. of the Court of the Sessions.
The three counts against appellant are of having committed acts of gross
indecency on August 23, 1972,
with Yvan…, on August 1, 1972, with Jean-Yves… and on July 24, 1972, with Perri… The appeal brought as
of right is based on the dissent of Dubé J., who would have acquitted the
appellant. The formal judgment does not specify the grounds in law upon which
the dissent is based, as is required under s. 606 of the Criminal Code.
I shall first summarize the facts which led to the prosecution.

Appellant, an unmarried man in his forties, has
been a teacher, a school principal and a school inspector. Since 1967 he is a
specialist in education

[Page 20]

with the Department of Education. He holds, inter
alia, a B.A. in philosophy, a master’s degree in education and a master’s
degree in academic and professional counselling. After receiving the last
mentioned degree, he opened a counselling office at his residence in an
apartment building, while still retaining his position with the Department of
Education.

Perri, an eleven-and-a-half-year-old boy who had
already seen the accused in his counselling office, some ten times starting in
the summer of 1970, had an appointment with him on August 21, 1972. To justify
his refusal to go, he told his mother he had had enough indecent manipulation.
His mother then phoned to postpone the interview and called the police. On
August 23, between five and six p.m., two police officers went to the accused’s
apartment with a search warrant issued by the Social Welfare Court. While one
spoke to the accused in the living room, the other went into the counselling
office. There he found fifteen-year-old Yvan, sitting on a chair in front of a
desk on which lay a mental aptitude test form. This test is made up of
seventy-five questions which must be answered quickly, since the test is timed.
The time-clock was running on the desk, but Yvan was sitting with his head
down, “bent over himself in an unusual manner… with his hands crossed below the
belt”. The police officer noted that the boy’s fly was down and commented on
this. The boy answered that he had just been to the washroom. Both officers
questioned him, but obtained no information. After giving them his name and
address, the boy was allowed to leave. The two officers arranged to meet with
him at his parents’ home in Longueuil a week later. They saw him alone first
and obtained an incriminating statement from him, confirming what he had told
his mother, a school teacher, when returning home “white as a sheet”, she says,
on August 23. It should be noted that Yvan too had gone to accused’s office
some ten times in 1972, and had at times shown great reluctance to return, although
never giving any indication of the reason for his reluctance.

[Page 21]

During their search, the officers found a large
brown envelope in a filing cabinet. The return address on it was that of a
presbytery on the outskirts of Quebec City, the address of the accused was
written in ink as the destination. It was marked “Personnel” and, in red
ink, there was written [TRANSLATION] “TO be destroyed after examination”. It
contained a half-dozen obscene publications dealing with the male sex. One in
particular was not only obscene, but perversive: “HUSTLER”, “a story in photo
of a young man’s search for himself”. This fifty-page story in photographs
(many in full colour) is that of a homosexual liaison, depicted in all its
manifestations—even the most disgusting—in the most explicit manner possible,
and presented as the happy development of a young man’s personality. Fully
conscious of the perversive character of this pornography, the publisher has
printed in bold yellow type at the top of the cover page: “For the private
contemplation of ADULTS ONLY”. At the trial Jean‑Yves, who was
fifteen-and-a-half years old in August 1972, and who had also seen the accused
at his office some ten times, testified that in addition to having committed
the alleged acts, the accused had shown him this magazine. The accused denied
it, like the rest, but the evidence presented for the defence by Richard and
Robert, two young men, brothers, living with the accused and sharing his
bedroom, seriously weakened his denial. In fact, although testifying for the
accused, they both admitted that he had shown them this filth which he had
received at the beginning of the year and kept in his possession instead of
destroying it. While these two young men were adults, in 1972 they were twenty-one
and twenty-two respectively, the priest who sent him this progaganda for
homosexuality, this incitement to debauchery, surely did not intend it for such
use.

The trial was held in camera without a jury. I
find it necessary to quote five pages from the judgment stating in the main the
judge’s reasons for the conviction:

[TRANSLATION] The evidence submitted by the
prosecution and the defence on the whole has shown that the

[Page 22]

main purpose of the accused’s meetings with
the five alleged victims (including two cases of similar acts) was to try to
solve psychological or guidance problems. According to his alleged victims,
however, this was not the accused’s only purpose: he took advantage of these
meetings to commit acts of gross indecency on or with them. The scenario was
almost always the same: from the first meetings, the accused made the victim
sit on his knees, felt his penis, sometimes masturbated him and even had the
victim masturbate him on one or two occasions. The accused advised each of the boys
to keep silent about this sexual activity during the interviews. In view of the
circumstances, the Court considers that it had good reason to admit as it did
the similar fact evidence which, in any case, merely supplemented that
presented on the indictment.

In his testimony, the accused absolutely
denied the acts of gross indecency with which his five alleged victims charged
him, although he did admit meeting with each of them in his office. The
interviews, he said, were spent studying psychological or academic problems
submitted to him. He admitted that he did show interest in these adolescents’
sexual behaviour, but stated that he never took part in criminal acts such as
those with which he is charged. Richard and Robert…, called by the defence,
have been living with the accused for some months and share his bedroom. Both
these young men were originally counselled by the accused as adolescents, with
the consent of their parents, and especially of their father,… These two
witnesses for the defence stated that they never saw or heard anything from the
office of the accused which suggested that acts of gross indecency were being
committed. It is true, however, that neither was ever present at these
interviews of the accused with young boys or girls.

Yvan… told the Court with obvious sincerity
of the immoral and illegal acts the accused committed with him. He explained
why at first he lied to the police officer. This explanation is adequate when
one takes into account the age and education of the boy at the time of these
incriminating incidents and lies.

The same observations apply mutatis
mutandis to Jean-Yves… He would not admit to his mother that he and the
accused were committing immoral acts. He did, however, reveal these acts when
questioned by the police. In Court, during the examination‑in‑chief
and the cross-examination, he answered the questions without hesitation and
with a ring of truth. This Court believes his testimony.

[Page 23]

Lastly, there is Perri…, who triggered the
original police investigation which led to the charges in the case at bar. His
impatience and ill humour when his mother insisted that he go to the accused’s
office, when he wanted to enjoy a school holiday and play, exploded and
resulted in the serious charge against the accused. His mother corroborated
this part of her son’s testimony. The facts described by the boy to the Court
were similar to those described in Court by Yvan… and Jean-Yves…—indecent
manipulation and advice to say nothing. This Court does not find any reason or
reasons in Perri …’s testimony sufficient to justify rejecting it.

In their testimony, Michel… and Jean
(brother of Richard and Robert) showed that the accused took advantage of the
parents’ trust and the private consultations which the latter had their children
attend, to commit acts of gross indecency on and with them. The accused also
advised them to remain silent. The Court feels that these two youths, who
appeared before the Court to relate facts which are humiliating for them at
their present age, told the truth.

The credibility of the witnesses for the
defence, Richard and Robert…, is vitiated by the fact that in Court they showed
an excessive admiration for and attachment to the accused. These feelings make
them still prefer a suspicious cohabitation in the apartment of the accused to
life in their family’s home. In any case, their testimony is hardly positive
with respect to what may have gone on in the counselling office between the
accused and the three young men named in the indictment, as visual witnesses
they knew nothing.

The accused’s interest in denying the facts
upon which the charges rest is only natural, considering the effect a
conviction may have on his career. The accused placed great emphasis on the
tests administered to his three alleged victims. In defence, he could do no
more than deny the accusatory facts advanced by the three alleged victims.
Further, the five youths have nothing to gain from harassing the
accused. This Court must also keep in mind that the trial was held in camera. In
this way, the witnesses for the prosecution were heard separately from each
other. Further, they did not know each other, at least not well, before the
case at bar began. It cannot be seriously argued that officers Brault and
Clermont prevailed upon the witnesses for the prosecution to commit perjury for
having the accused convicted. The absence of spontaneous admissions on their
part is a neutral fact on which the defence cannot really rely.

[Page 24]

The statute and case law require the
presiding judge to be on guard against the danger of error in convicting the
accused in the case at bar unless the testimony of the three alleged victims is
corroborated on facts implicating the accused in the crimes with which he is
charged. However, the absence of corroboration does not necessarily imply the
acquittal of a person charged with gross indecency.

There is no doubt that the accused’s
private interviews with the three young boys afforded him perfect opportunities
to carry out his perverted intentions. The occasion or opportunity to commit a
criminal offence however, should not be confused with corroboration as defined
in the case law. Nevertheless, both can guide us in assessing the credibility
of the witnesses in the case at bar. Had the occasion or opportunity never
existed, the acts with which the accused is charged would probably never have
been committed. This opportunity is also shown in the similar fact evidence
concerning Michel… and Jean…

The discovery of obscene publications in
the accused’s counselling office can be considered a factor which tends to
lessen the credibility of the accused with respect to a charge of gross
indecency, even though such publications cannot be accepted as corroboration of
the testimony of the three alleged victims. The accused had easy access to
these publications, and young Jean-Yves… claims to have been shown those
magazines. The fact that the accused received the publications from Rev. Marcel
Fournier, of Quebec City, is of little importance—what matters is that he kept
them.

Lastly, the visits by the accused and
Richard, Robert, Jean and their brother Pierre to a transvestite show in Quebec
City, and to an establishment frequented by transvestites, denote questionable
tendencies on the part of the accused when the charges against him are read and
the approximate ages of the youths at that time are calculated.

Above all, the accumulation of similar fact
evidence through the testimony of not only Michel… and Jean…, but also of each
of the three young boys involved in the indictment, cannot be regarded as
corroboration, but it cannot fail to make an impression on a jury called up on
to decide on the veracity of the accused’s denials. The CAMPBELL case,
mentioned above, invites them to do so.

Basing his opinion, as the trial judge did,
mainly on what Lord Goddard stated in Campbell[2], Rinfret J.A. (now Chief Justice)
held that the trial judge had not erred in law:

[Page 25]

[TRANSLATION] I feel that the trial judge
was right in admitting evidence of a first similar fact as evidence in chief
since, as he explained, due to questions in cross-examination, “the presiding
judge anticipated a defence based on the completely honourable nature of the
relations between the accused and the young men mentioned in the indictment”.

The defence was in fact a denial of the
alleged acts, and evidence of excellent reputation.

In addition to the persons previously
mentioned, who could have no knowledge of accused’s private life, the defence
called two witnesses, the brothers Richard and Robert…, who both live with
appellant.

This resulted in throwing the book of the…
family’s troubles wide open, which compelled the Crown to call in rebuttal the
father, …, and one of his sons, Jean (the brother of Richard and Robert) who
had also been under the care of appellant at one time.

Jean contradicted the testimony of his own
brothers. He was led to describe appellant’s undue influence on his family,
appellant’s behaviour toward him, and his personal experience. In this witness’
testimony several similar acts were revealed; this evidence contradicted that
of the two brothers, and was admissible as such.

Crête J.A., relying on Harris[3], felt that the similar fact evidence
had been improperly admitted, but concluded that the conviction should stand,
saying:

[TRANSLATION] Excluding this evidence, I
still feel that the only finding which the evidence at the trial as a whole can
lead to, is that appellant is guilty and that he suffered no substantial wrong,
and there was no miscarriage of justice (s. 613(1)(b)(iii) Cr. C).

It is extremely difficult to ascertain to what
extent dissent of Dubé J.A. involved questions of law rather than fact. After
pointing out that in Leblanc v. The Queen[4],
this Court had held similar fact evidence admissible, not to prove the
criminal act, but to establish guilty intent, he stressed that

[Page 26]

in the case at bar the act itself was what had
to be proved. He then stated that the trial judge had based his decision to
allow the similar fact evidence on the judgment in Harris from which he
quotes, and goes on to say:

[TRANSLATION] It would seem that the trial
judge did not take into account the fact that it that case it is explained that
similar fact evidence can only be admitted in very definite cases:

“to prove intention or mens rea, as
well as to rebut a possible defence of accident.”

Although it is true that the trial judge
referred to Harris, he nevertheless relied mostly on Campbell, as
appears from the last sentence I have quoted from his judgment. Dubé J.A. later
stated:

[TRANSLATION] On the other hand, some
cases, especially R. ex rel. Taggart v. Forage, reported in C.R.N.S.,
Vol. 3 (1968), pp. 117 et seq, allow similar fact evidence to show
homosexual tendencies of the accused, but the judge does insist on the need for
extreme caution in admitting such evidence and stresses this should only be
done in very definite cases.

In the case at bar, appellant saw thousands
of adolescents at interviews, yet only five of these youngsters accused
appellant of having committed homosexual acts. In the circumstances, I feel it
cannot be said that in allowing similar fact evidence, homosexual tendencies in
appellant, or a system to commit homosexual acts, were proven.

It should also be noted that in R. ex
rel. Taggart v. Forage, where similar fact evidence was admitted, the
accused was acquitted because it was found that, on the whole, the evidence
would not support a verdict of guilty with a sufficient degree of certainty.

Apart from the danger of admitting similar
fact evidence, there is in the case at bar an even greater danger resulting
from the fact that the similar facts in question are as uncorroborated as the
charges themselves. In fact, not one of those facts is corroborated by
anything; in each case, the testimony of a young adolescent is denied by the
accused and in no way proven by corroborating evidence.

[Page 27]

It is true that the charges against
appellant are not such as to require corroboration, but the courts have
consistently warned of the danger of convicting a person accused of this type
of crime solely on the word of the victim. It is even more dangerous to accept
such evidence when it is given by a child or adolescent.

The trial judge seems to have considered
that in the case at bar each count was a link added to the chain, as was each
similar fact admitted as evidence. But, in my view, since each of the links is
as weak as the next in terms of evidence, it adds no strength to the chain:
however it must be presumed that the repetition of charges of this nature can
have an enormous influence on the person who has to pass judgment. In the case
at bar, for example, I have great doubt that the trial judge would have found
appellant guilty if only one of the adolescents had testified against him. I
therefore conclude that the verdict of guilt was the result of letting himself
be influenced by the addition of other charges and similar facts.

I fail to see how the decision of Hartt J. in Forage[5] can be urged against the verdict of
Dansereau J. The latter does not appear to disagree of any question of law with
his colleague from Ontario. He came to a different conclusion on the facts, but
I see no reason to suspect that he did it without the required care and
caution.

With respect, I must say that I do not find
judicious at all Dubé J.A.’s comment on the small number of cases found amongst
the thousands of adolescents the accused saw in interviews. If such misconduct
were generalized, it could not go on without being immediately denounced.
Furthermore, there is evidence showing that the number of cases possible is not
in the thousands or hundreds, not even in scores. In fact, after searching and
examining all of the accused’s files, where complete information on interviews
with each adolescent was found, the officers interrogated six or seven boys
only, and of these, two or three were witnesses for the prosecution.

The judgment of Dansereau J. shows that he was
fully aware of the danger of convicting in

[Page 28]

cases of this kind. I see absolutely no reason
for substituting a different assessment of the facts for his, since the
question is essentially one of credibility, and he had the inestimable
advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses. I cannot understand that a judge
of the Court of Appeal would seem to give greater weight to the opinion of a
nun who believed in the innocence of the accused without having heard the
evidence, even if she was Jean-Yves’ and Perri’s grade school teacher at a
boarding school.

Everyone knows that the rule of caution so much
relied by Dubé J.A. was specially stressed by this Court in Horsburgh[6]. What is perhaps not as well-known,
because as far as I know it is unfortunately not reported, is the final outcome
of the case: an acquittal at the retrial, on a finding that there had been a
conspiracy by children who, as an excuse for their immorality, charged the
accused with being their accomplice. In my opinion, the circumstances in the
case at bar, which I considered necessary to state at some length after having
read, reread and analysed the evidence and exhibits, exclude any possibility of
a conspiracy against the accused by the witnesses for the prosecution.

I come now to what may be considered as
questions of law on which the dissenting judge expressed an opinion contrary to
the judgment of the majority. Although far from certain that they are really
the grounds of dissent, I shall, in order to consider the appeal on the most
favourable basis possible, assume that the dissent raises these two questions:

1. Is similar fact evidence inadmissible if it
tends to prove another criminal act;

2. Where there are several counts in an
indictment, may the evidence on one be used to decide on the others.

In Campbell[7], the headnote of which was quoted by
the trial judge, Lord Goddard ended his

[Page 29]

opinion with the following remarks, at pp.
102-103:

As we are endeavouring in this judgment to
deal comprehensively with the evidence of children, we may perhaps endeavour to
give some guidance to courts who have from time to time to deal with cases of
sexual assaults on children where the evidence of each child deals only with
the assault on him or herself. In such cases, it is right to tell a jury that
because A says that the accused assaulted him, it is no corroboration of his
evidence that B says that he also was the victim of a similar assault, though
both say it on oath. At the same time we think a jury may be told that a
succession of these cases may help them to determine the truth of the matter,
provided they are satisfied that there is no collaboration between the children
to put up a false story. And if the defence is one of innocent association by
the accused with the children, the case of Sims, 31 Cr. App. R. 158;
[1946] K.B. 531, subsequently approved on this point by the House of Lords in Harris
v. The Director of Public Prosecutions, 36 Cr. App. R. 39; [1952] A.C. 694,
shows that such evidence can be given to rebut the defence.

Concerning the Harris case, which was
mentioned by every judge on appeal, as well as by the trial judge, Viscount
Simon said, at p. 705:

It is, I think, an error to attempt to draw
up a closed list of the sort of cases in which the principle operates: such a
list only provides instances of its general application, whereas what really
matters is the principle itself and its proper application to the particular
circumstances of the charge that is being tried…

In Kilbourne[8], a case which bears great similarity
to the case at bar, since it deals with homosexual acts committed with six
young boys less than fifteen years old, the House of Lords has reversed the
judgment of the Court of Appeal[9] in
which Lord Denning did not take part and the rule in the Campbell case
was not applied in the same way as both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal
applied it in the case at bar. Lord Hailsham, expressing views endorsed by Lord
Morris and not contradicted by the others, said at p. 741:

I also agree with the Court of Appeal in
saying that the evidence of each child went to contradict any possibility of
innocent association. As such it was admissible as

[Page 30]

part of the prosecution case, and since, by
the time the judge came to sum up, innocent association was the foundation of
the defence put forward by the accused, the admissibility, relevance, and,
indeed cogency of the evidence was beyond question…

In the case at bar, the defence was precisely,
besides character evidence, that the visits of the young witnesses were made
for perfectly legitimate purposes. This defence made the similar fact evidence
admissible in rebuttal. Since, even without such similar fact evidence, the
accused could not possibly have asked for an acquittal without this defence, he
suffered no prejudice from similar fact evidence having been admitted in chief
even assuming the trial judge had erred in this respect. In Kilbourne, as
mentioned by Lord Hailsham, the Court of Appeal held the similar fact evidence
inadmissible and quashed the verdict because the trial judge has told the jury
that the evidence on each count could be considered as corroboration on the
other counts. But Lord Hailsham said at pp. 748-749:

Whatever else it is, the rule about fellow
accomplices is not authority for the proposition that no witness who may
himself require corroboration may afford corroboration for another to whom the
same consideration applies, and this alone is what would help the respondent.
When a small boy relates a sexual incident implicating a given man he may be
indulging in fantasy. If another small boy relates such an incident it may be a
coincidence if the detail is insufficient. If a large number of small boys
relate similar incidents in enough detail about the same person, if it is not
conspiracy it may well be that the stories are true. Once there is a sufficient
nexus it must be for the jury to say what weight is given to the combined testimony
of a number of witnesses.

In Boardman[10], a charge of homosexuality was
again in issue. The accused was the principal of a boarding school for boys.
The three counts involved three students aged sixteen, seventeen and eighteen.
The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction on the third count and let the other
two

[Page 31]

convictions stand. It must be noted that the
trial judge had told the jury that it had to decide on the third count without
considering the evidence presented on the other two, but that the evidence on
each of the first two counts could serve to support the other as similar fact
evidence. In view of the small number of similar acts, the House of Lords
admitted that this case was “right on the borderline” (at p. 445). The
headnote reads:

Held, dismissing
the appeal, that there were circumstances in which, contrary to the general
rule, evidence of criminal acts on the part of an accused other than those with
which he was charged became admissible because of their striking similarity to
other acts being investigated and because of their resulting probative force;
that it was for the judge to decide whether the prejudice to the accused was
outweighed by the probative force of the evidence and to rule accordingly; and
that, on the facts of the present case, the judge had been entitled to direct
the jury as he had done.

Finally, in the recent case of Alward and
Mooney v. The Queen[11], this
Court unanimously affirmed a conviction for a murder when, because it was
committed in the course of a robbery with violence, evidence of two other
robberies with violence had been admitted as similar fact evidence. Expressing
the unanimous opinion of the Court on the question of the admissibility of such
evidence as proof of the alleged criminal act, Spence J. stated at pp. 564-565:

…I find of considerable interest and
relevance the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R. v. Straffen, (1952),
36 Cr. App. R. 132, which dealt with the question of the accused’s admission
that he had strangled two other little girls in circumstances remarkably like
those proved to exist in the strangling of a third with which he was charged.
There Slade J. said:

Mr. Elam said: How far, then, does the
admissibility of such evidence go; does it go to a burglar, housebreaker, thief
and so on? Lord Sumner, in THOMPSON’S CASE (supra), pointed out
that they were merely examples of persons who fell within the genus of
dishonest persons; but, speaking for myself, I think that if the question of
identity arose in a case of housebreaking and it were possible to adduce
evidence that there was some peculiarity in relation to earlier housebreakings,
which was apparent also in the case

[Page 32]

of the housebreaking charged, so as to
stamp the accused man not only with the housebreaking charged but with the
earlier housebreakings, and there was evidence that he had committed the
earlier housebreakings, that would fall within the same principle of
admissibility, not to prove his propensity for housebreaking, but to prove that
he was the person who committed the housebreaking charged.

So that Court was of the opinion that
similar fact evidence was admissible to prove the very fact of identity.

On the admissibility of similar fact evidence, I
think it should be said that it is essentially in the discretion of the trial
judge. In exercising this discretion, he must have regard to the general
principles established by the cases. There is no closed list of the sort of
cases where such evidence is admissible. It is, however, well established that
it may be admitted to rebut a defence of legitimate association for honest
purposes, as well as to rebut evidence of good character. Where the evidence is
admissible on the first mentioned basis, it may be admitted as part of the case
for the prosecution.

Secondly, where similar fact evidence is thus
admissible, the evidence on each similar count may also be used to corroborate
the evidence for the prosecution on each of the other counts. Seeing that
similar fact evidence may be used to rebut the kind of defence above mentioned,
the evidence on each count becomes admissible to rebut the defence on each of
the other counts. It cannot obviously be necessary to have it repeated for this
purpose; it is enough to say that it may be taken into account.

Since I wrote the above, another judgment of the
English Court of Appeal has been reported in which the law on these questions,
in cases involving homosexual acts, has again been reviewed (R. v. Scarroti[12]). The conviction was affirmed on
grounds which imply approval of the principles on which Dansereau J. relied in
first instance to admit similar fact evidence and to judge all counts

[Page 33]

on the overall evidence.

I therefore conclude that the dissenting judge
on appeal erred in holding that each count in the indictment should have been
judged without taking into account the evidence on the others.

I wish to point out that no analogy should be
sought between the questions examined in the instant case and those which may
arise in respect of the use of evidence presented on what is commonly called a voir
dire. The importance of the distinction between this kind of “trial within
a trial” and the trial itself is due to the special rules governing it, see The
Queen v. Gauthier[13]. These
rules can in no way be likened to those governing rebuttal evidence.

I am of the opinion that the appeal should be
dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Breathalyser test—Approved
instrument—Instrument’s margin of error—Evidence to the contrary—Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 236, 237.

Appeal—Summary conviction offence—Question
of law—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 771(1)(a)—Supreme Court
Act, R.S.C 1970, c. S-19 (as amended by 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 18, s. 5),
s. 41(3).

Respondent was found guilty, on summary
conviction, of driving a motor vehicle having consumed a quantity of alcohol
exceeding 80 milligrams in 100 millilitres of blood. The certificate of a
qualified technician, who had used a Borkenstein Breathalyser, an approved
instrument under s. 237(6) Cr.C., showed that respondent had 90
milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, and the latter was found
guilty by a municipal judge. On appeal to the Superior Court by way of trial de
novo an expert witness testified that Borkenstein Breathalysers were
subject to a possible margin of error of 10 milligrams, more or less, and the
judge was of the view that this uncontradicted testimony was “evidence to the
contrary” within the meaning of s. 237(1)(c) Cr.C. and
sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt justifying acquittal. The majority of
the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court on the sole
ground that no question of law was involved and that consequently the Crown had
no right of appeal. This Court, having granted the Crown leave to appeal that
decision under s. 41(3) of the Supreme Court Act, must decide
whether the evidence of the expert witness is evidence to the contrary within
the meaning of the Code and whether a question of law is raised.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
allowed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and Pratte JJ.: In order to comply with the wording of
s. 237(1)(c)

[Page 262]

Cr.C., evidence
to the contrary has to be evidence which tends to establish that the proportion
of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the time when the offence was alleged
to have been committed was not the same as that indicated by the result of the
chemical analysis. The evidence adduced through the expert witness’s testimony
in the case at bar is not aimed at rebutting the presumption provided for in
the Code but at denying its very existence. Such evidence is not evidence to
the contrary when its only effect is to demonstrate in general terms the
possible uncertainty of the scheme or the inherent fallibility of instruments
which are approved under statutory authority. Instruments approved under
statutory authority cannot be assimilated to ordinary instruments. Parliament
must be taken to have made allowance for these limitations inherent in all
instruments when it provided for the analysis of breath samples by way of
approved instruments and to have wanted its precise prohibition to be exactly
enforceable.

Secondly, since the main issue hinges upon
the interpretation of a provision of the Criminal Code: what is capable
of being evidence to the contrary, it raises a question of law.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ., dissenting: None of the Crown’s
submissions raises a question of law once it is accepted that the expert
evidence of the defence was admissible and relevant. The weight of evidence and
its sufficiency to raise a doubt are common instances of matters which do not
give rise to any question of law. On the other hand, the accused is not to be
condemned by an unchallengeable certificate based on the use of a fallible machine.
It must not be assumed in the absence of Crown evidence to this effect that the
qualified technician had taken into account the possible margin of error of the
instrument. It would require much more express words than are found in
s. 237(1)(c) Cr.C. to conclude that the accused cannot
challenge the results of the chemical analysis by challenging the accuracy of
the approved instrument which produced them.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec[1] affirming a
judgment of the Superior Court, Criminal side, allowing an appeal

[Page 263]

from a conviction by a municipal judge.
Appeal allowed, Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ. dissenting.

Rémi Bouchard, for the appellant.

Gilles Garneau and Wildy Fontain, for the
respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson
and Estey JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—This is a
Crown appeal, by leave, from a judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal (Tremblay
C.J.Q. and Kaufman J.A., Bernier J.A. dissenting) which affirmed a judgment of
Fournier J. of the Quebec Superior Court setting aside, on a trial de novo, the
conviction of the respondent on a charge under s. 236(1) of the Criminel
Code. The respondent was charged, in terms of the section, with being in
control of a motor vehicle, having consumed alcohol of such a quantity that the
proportion thereof in his blood exceed 80 milligrams in 100 millilitres of
blood.

The Crown could not appeal as of right on the
basis of any dissent on a question of law by Bernier J.A., as is provided by
s. 621(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, because this provision
applies only to proceedings by indictment, and here the accused was charged
with a summary conviction offence. Moreover, the Crown’s appeal by leave under
s. 621 (1)(b) is also restricted to questions of law
and also relates back to proceedings by indictment, as is clear from
s. 605(1)(a) giving the Crown the right to appeal on
questions of law alone to the provincial Court of Appeal from a verdict of
acquittal. The present case, therefore, could only come here through an
invocation of s. 41(3) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
S-19, as amended by 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 18, s. 5, to hear the appeal on
a question of law from a judgment of the provincial Court of Appeal acting
under s. 771(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.

[Page 264]

Counsel for the Crown urged three errors of law
by the majority of the Court of Appeal. Kaufman J.A., speaking for the
majority, did not think that any question of law was presented, as
s. 771(1)(a) required, and would have dismissed the appeal on that
ground alone. However, he went on to dismiss the appeal on the merits as well,
assuming that it presented a question of law.

The issues raised by the Crown arise on the
following facts. The Crown sought to prove the charge against the accused by
the certificate of a qualified technician who, using a Borkenstein breath
analyzer, indentified as No. 4799, and being an “approved instrument” under
s. 237(6), found that the accused had 90 milligrams of alcohol in 100
millilitres of blood.

Section 237(1)(c) of the Criminal
Code provides that evidence of the results of the analysis is, “in the
absence of any evidence to the contrary” proof of the proportion of alcohol in
the blood at the material time. It is not disputed in this case that the certificate
of analysis was admissible in conformity with s. 237(1)(f). The
accused, on his trial de novo before Fournier J., had adduced evidence
of an expert witness, whose qualification to testify as to the Borkenstein type
breath analyzer was not questioned, and who testified that there was a marging
of error of 10 milligrams, more or less, in the use of the type of approved
instrument in the present case. Fournier J., disagreeing on this point with the
judge at first instance, held that this being admissible evidence, and being
sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt, was “evidence to the contrary” under
s. 237(1)(c), and left the Crown in a position where the charge
against the accused was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In short, he held
that the accused did not have any larger burden than that of raising a
reasonable doubt by evidence tendered on his behalf.

In this Court, the admissibility of the expert’s
evidence as to the margin of error of the particular type of approved
instrument was not contested, but it was contended by the Crown that (1) the
Court of Appeal erred in law in deciding that the issue of

[Page 265]

the weight given by the judge on the trial de
novo to the defence evidence raised a question of fact; (2) the Court of
Appeal erred in law in deciding that the general evidence offered as to the
accuracy of the approved instrument was evidence to the contrary within
s. 237(1)(c); and (3) the Court of Appeal erred in law in deciding
that the aforesaid expert evidence was alone sufficient to give the accused the
benefit of a reasonable doubt. Put in the stark way in which I have enumerated
the Crown’s submissions as made in its factum and in argument, none raises a
question of law once it is accepted, as it has been, that the expert evidence
of the defence was admissible and hence relevant, relevant that is to the only
issue that was in contention, namely, whether there was proof beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused had exceeded the permitted limit of the
proportion of alcohol in the blood Certainly, there is no error of law in point
1 nor in point 3 of the Crown’s submissions. The weight of evidence and its
sufficiency to raise a doubt are common instances of matters which do not give
rise to any question law: see Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Ltd. v. The Queen[2].

Point 2 seems to me to raise only a question of
the relevance of the expert evidence, and of this I have no doubt. The approval
of an instrument for breath analysis under s. 237(6) is approval not of a
particular instrument but of a particular type. The Crown is given the
advantage under s. 237 of using a special form of proof of a fact
essential to conviction, and this proof involves use of a breath analysis
instrument of a type approved by the Attorney‑General of Canada. It must
surely be open to an accused to adduce evidence which, if accepted as was the
evidence tendered here, would go to show such a margin of error as to cast
doubt on the reading made by the qualified technician.

It follows that if there is here a question of
law it must rest on the contention that “evidence to the contrary” must mean
evidence that goes beyond the raising of a doubt and is sufficient to overcome
the certificate of analysis on a balance of

[Page 266]

probabilities. Yet this position was not taken
either by counsel for the Crown or by the dissenting judge, and I think they
were right in not taking it. It is enough to contrast the present provisions of
s. 237(1)(c), which speaks of “the absence of any evidence to the
contrary”, with s. 237(1)(a), which contains a deeming provision,
followed by the words “unless he establishes”, to illustrate in the latter case
a different and more onerous evidentiary burden on the accused: See R. v.
Appleby[3]. What
was said by Ritchie J. for this Court in R. v. Noble[4], at p. 638, with reference to
the “burden” on the accused under s. 237(1)(c), should not
be taken as obliging an accused to do more than raise a reasonable doubt. This
Court was concerned in that case with the question whether more than one breath
sample must be taken to enable the Crown to rely on a qualified technician’s
certificate, and Ritchie J. emphasized the necessity of strict construction of
statutory provisions which “restrict the normal rights of the accused”.

What Bernier J.A. fastens on (and so too Crown
counsel in supporting his view) is that the expert evidence offered by the
accused cannot be “evidence to the contrary”, for the purpose of raising a
doubt, because it is the results of the chemical analyses that are given
probative force “in the absence of any evidence to the contrary”, and the
justness or correctness of the results cannot be impeached by expert evidence
showing the margin of error that may exist in the use of the particular type of
approved instrument. In short, Bernier J.A. would have it that this margin of
error is subsumed in the qualified technician’s understanding and
qualifications in the use of the approved instrument. I am not prepared to
assume this in the absence of Crown evidence that this was taken into account in
arriving at the 90 milligram proportion.

The accused is not to be condemned by an
unchallengeable certificate based on the use of a

[Page 267]

fallible machine. I would require much more
express words than are found in s. 237(1)(c) to give so strong an
effect to a chemical analysis made through use of an approved instrument. The
accused is entitled, as I read the provisions of s. 237(1)(c), to
challenge the results by challenging the accuracy of the instrument which
produced them. The learned dissenting judge, in truth, takes his position on
the want of any relevance of the expert evidence of the defence to the issue
raised by the proof offered by the Crown. I read his reasons to say that the
advantage of proof available to the Crown under s. 237(1)(c) (in being
able to rely on a subsequent test to prove blood alcohol content at the prior
time of the alleged offence) can only be countered by evidence directed to the
temporal presumption. In my opinion, this is too narrow a view, and the
approach taken by Kaufman J.A. is the proper one in his adoption of what was
said on the matter by McFarlane J.A. in R. v. Davis[5], a decision of the British Columbia
Court of Appeal, and by McDermid J.A. in R. v. Ryckman[6], at p. 296, a decision of the
Alberta Appellate Division.

I would dismiss the appeal. In accordance with
the term imposed by this Court as a condition of granting leave, the Crown will
pay the costs of the respondent on a solicitor-client basis.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and Pratte JJ. was delivered by

BEETZ J.—Respondent was charged with an offence
punishable on summary conviction under s. 236 of the Criminal Code in
that he drove a motor vehicle having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the
proportion thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams in 100 millilitres of
blood. He was tried by judge Cossette, a municipal judge. Apart from admissions
made by the defence with respect to the time and place respondent had driven
the

[Page 268]

motor vehicle, the only evidence consisted in
the certificates of an analyst and of a qualified technician pursuant to
s. 237(1). The technician, using a Borkenstein Breathalyser of certain
model, an “approved instrument” under s. 237(6), found that respondent had
90 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. Neither the analyst nor
the technician were required to be in attendance for the purpose of
cross-examination, under s. 237(4). The defence tendered no evidence.
Judge Cossette found respondent guilty and condemned him to pay a fine of $50
with costs or to fifteen days in gaol in default of payment.

Respondent appealed to the Superior Court by way
of trial de novo. The trial was held on the record of the evidence which
had been heard by judge Cossette. In addition however, an expert witness whom
the Superior Court found highly competent and objective was called by the
accused and, without being contradicted, testified in short as follows:

1) Borkenstein Breathalysers of the type or
model used in this case (Model 900 or 900A) were all subject to a possible
margin of error of 10 milligrams, more or less;

2) This possible margin of error was inherent in
these instruments, due to their design;

3) While this possible margin of error was
common knowledge, qualified technicians were not instructed to make allowance
for it; they were trained to consider their instrument as accurate for the
purpose of s. 237 provided that, in the chemical control test which they
were required to carry out in each case with a known quantity of alcohol, the
margin did not exceed 10 milligrams, more or less;

4) The particular Borkenstein Breathalyser used
in this case, serial number 4799, had not been examined or otherwise tested by
the expert witness who could not recall whether he had ever seen it.

It was further admitted in the course of the
trial de novo that the qualified technician had stated

[Page 269]

the exact reading of the breath analyser,
without taking into account the possible margin of error.

Fournier J. held that the testimony of the
expert witness was “evidence to the contrary” within the meaning of
s. 237(1)(c) and sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt. He
accordingly set aside the conviction and found respondent not guilty.

The Crown appealed to the Quebec Court of Appeal
with leave of that Court. Under s. 771(1)A), it could only do so on
grounds involving questions of law.

The Court of Appeal, (Tremblay C.J.Q. and
Kaufman J.A., Bernier J.A. dissenting) affirmed the judgment of Fournier J.
Tremblay C.J.Q. and Kaufman J.A. took the view that no question of law was
involved and would have dismissed the appeal on that sole ground. Kaufman J.A.
would also have dismissed the appeal on the merits, assuming that it involved a
question of law. His main reason was that an accused ought not to be
“restricted in his defence to evidence which would tend to show that he was not
impaired by non-consumption (or consumption of a small amount) of alcohol”.

The Crown now appeals by leave of this Court its
appeal being limited to a question of law or jurisdiction: s. 41(3) of the
Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. S-19, as amended by 1974‑75-76
(Can.),c. 18, s. 5.

At the relevant time, s. 237 of the Criminal
Code read in part as follows:

237. (1) In
any proceedings under section 234 or 236,

…

(c) where a sample of the breath of
the accused has been taken pursuant to a demand made under
subsection 235(1) if

(i) (not proclaimed in force)

(ii) the sample was taken as soon as
practicable after the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed
and in any event not later than two hours after that time,

[Page 270]

(iii) the sample was received from the
accused directly into an approved container or into an approved instrument
operated by a qualified technician, and

(iv) a chemical analysis of the sample was
made by means of an approved instrument operated by a qualified technician,
evidence of the result of the chemical analysis so made is, in the absence of
any evidence to the contrary, proof of the proportion of alcohol in the blood
of the accused at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed;

(6) In this section

“analyst” means a person designated by the
Attorney General as an analyst for the purposes of this section;

“approved container” means a container of a
kind designed to receive a sample of the breath of a person for chemical
analysis and that is approved as suitable for the purposes of this
section by order of the Attorney General of Canada;

“approved instrument” means an instrument
of a kind that is designed to receive and make a chemical analysis of a sample
of the breath of a person in order to measure the proportion of alcohol in the
blood of that person and that is approved as suitable for the purposes of this
section by order of the Attorney General of Canada;

“qualified technician” means a person designated
by the Attorney General as being qualified to operate an approved instrument.

The main issue is whether the evidence of the
expert witness is “evidence to the contrary” within the meaning of
s. 237(1)(c). There is another issue namely whether the main issue
raises a question of law. I propose to deal first with the main issue.

In the course of argument, counsel for the Crown
said that the evidence of the expert witness was admissible. However, I did not
understand this concession to have been unqualified: according to counsel, the
evidence of the expert witness was admissible as a general introduction which
should have been completed by specific evidence related to the particular facts
of this case, but it had not been so completed and had remained purely
theoretical or general in nature; Fournier J. had erred in law in taking it
into consideration.

[Page 271]

What is “evidence to the contrary” within the
meaning of this section has been the subject of some discussion in various
courts. I agree with what was said on the subject by McFarlane J.A. speaking
for the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Davis[7] at p. 516:

While not expressed too clearly, I think
the intention of Parliament becomes manifest when it is remembered that the
fact to be proved is the proportion of alcohol to blood at the time of the
offence. The result of the chemical analysis is one method of proving that
fact: and the certificates are evidence, inter alia, of that result. It
follows, in my opinion, that the concluding part of the subsection means
that the result of the chemical analysis is proof of the proportion of alcohol
to blood at the time of the offence in the absence of evidence that the
proportion at that time did not exceed 80 to 100. Any evidence, therefore,
tending to show that at the time of the offence the proportion was within
the permitted limits is “evidence to the contrary” within the meaning of
the subsection. (Underlining is mine)

In order to comply with the wording of the Code,
“evidence to the contrary” has to be evidence which tends to establish that the
proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the time when the offence
was alleged to have been committed was not the same as that indicated by the
result of the chemical analysis. There is no such evidence in the case at bar.
Apart from the certificates, there is no evidence of any kind directed at
showing what was the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the
time when the offence was alleged to have been committed. What evidence there
is, tendered on behalf of the accused, is expert evidence from which Courts are
asked to conclude, contrary to what the Code explicitly prescribes, that the
result of the chemical analysis is not or ought not to be proof of the
proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the time when the offence
was alleged to have been committed. This, in my opinion, is not evidence aimed
at rebutting the presumption provided for in the section but at denying
its very existence. “Evidence to the contrary” cannot be evidence solely
directed at defeating the scheme established by Parliament under ss. 236 and
237.

[Page 272]

This elaborate legislative scheme contemplates
and provides for elements of positive certainty such as the official approval
of certain kinds of instruments, the designation of analysts and qualified
technicians, a maximum time period between the commission of the alleged
offence and the taking of a breath sample, and the reading by a qualified
technician on an approved instrument of a proportion of alcohol in the blood in
excess of a specified proportion. Once the conditions prescribed or
contemplated by this scheme are fulfilled, a presumption arises against the
alleged offender which he can rebut by tendering “evidence to the contrary”. But
in my opinion, no evidence is “evidence to the contrary” when its only effect
is to demonstrate in general terms the possible uncertainty of the elements of
the scheme or the inherent fallibility of instruments which are approved under
statutory authority. Thus, the proof by expert evidence that, for physiological
reasons of a general nature, the maximum time period of two hours between the
commission of an offence and the taking of a breath sample is too long would
not be “evidence to the contrary”. (See also R. v. Gaetz[8]).

In the case at bar, the evidence of the expert
witness was to the effect that Borkenstein Breathalysers of the kind used to
analyse respondent’s breath sample were all inherently subject to a possible
margin of error of 10 milligrams, more or less: the trial judge was asked to
infer that unless this approved type of instrument indicated a reading in
excess of 90 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, an accused
ought to be given the benefit of the doubt. Such an inference might perhaps be
drawn in other kinds of cases with respect to instruments other than
instruments which are approved under statutory authority. For instance, expert
evidence could probably be tendered to show that radars of a certain type used
by the police to measure the speed of motor vehicles are subject to an inherent
margin of error which would make their reading unreliable as evidence against
an accused unless the margin of error was taken into account. But radars are
not approved instruments under a statutory scheme. To admit

[Page 273]

the evidence of the expert witness in this case
is to concede that evidence gathered through the use of certain types of
approved instruments may be treated in the same manner as that obtained by
ordinary instruments. The same would be true, up to a point, of approved
instruments of any type since all instruments used for measurement or analysis
are necessarily subject to built-in limitations which affect their precision. I
think the assimilation of instruments approved under statutory authority to
ordinary instruments amounts to an error in law. It seems to me that when
Parliament provided for the analysis of breath samples by way of approved
instruments, it was aware of the limitations inherent in all instruments. Parliament
must be taken to have made allowance for these limitations in the provisions
relating to the approval of certain kinds of instruments as well as in those
setting the highest permissible level of alcohol in the blood at 80 milligrams
in 100 millilitres of blood.

If the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal
were right, no one could in effect be charged under s. 236 unless the
reading indicated a quantity of alcohol in excess of 90 milligrams in 100
millilitres of blood whenever the qualified technician used an approved
Borkenstein Breathalyser Model 900 or 900A. Similar practical results would
inevitably occur if other approved models of breath analysers were used, with
slight variations upwards or downwards; but whatever approved instrument be
used, the prohibition enacted in s. 236 would never be fully enforceable
in any given case by the means expressly provided for in the Code nor, for that
matter, by any other means. Yet, one of the reasons if not the only reason why
Parliament prescribed the use of approved instruments must have been that it
wanted its precise prohibition to be exactly enforceable. This intent would be
frustrated if approved instruments were treated as ordinary instruments.

The approval of instruments under s. 237(6)
is approval of types of instruments, not of particular instruments. A
particular instrument may conceivably be subject to certain faults other than
those which are inherent in the type. The question

[Page 274]

whether such a particular instrument continues
to be within an approved class of instruments and whether the proof of such
faults is admissible does not arise in this case and does not call for comment.

I now briefly turn to the other issue, that is
whether the main issue raises a question of law. I think it does. It hinges
upon the interpretation of a provision of the Criminal Code: what is
capable of being “evidence to the contrary” within the meaning of
s. 237(1)(c)? The Courts of Appeal of Nova Scotia, British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan
have indicated that they consider the issue as a question of law: Shafer v. Regina[9]; R. v. Gaetz, (supra); R. v. Westman[10]; R. v. Davis (supra); R. v. Falkenham[11]. I agree with their approach on this point.

For the reasons stated above, I believe the
evidence tendered on behalf of respondent was not “evidence to the contrary”
within the meaning of s. 237(1)(c) of the Criminal Code. It
was the only evidence tendered on behalf of respondent and the sole possible
basis for his acquittal. His conviction must accordingly be restored.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal and of the Superior Court and restore respondent’s
conviction. Further to the terms imposed by this Court as a condition of
granting leave, the Crown will pay respondent’s costs in this Court on a
solicitor-client basis. Respondent should pay the costs in the Municipal Court
and the Superior Court. The Court of Appeal made no order as to costs; I would
not make any either as to costs in that Court.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Obstructing peace
officer—Cyclist seen committing traffic infraction—Police officer asking
cyclist for identification with intention of giving traffic ticket—Cyclist
refusing to give name—Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 253, ss. 2, 58, 63,
127, 128, amended 1975 (B.C.), c. 46, ss. 121, 173(1)—Police Act, 1974 (B.C.),
c. 64, ss. 17(1), 22, 30—Summary Convictions Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 373,
s. 101—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 450(2).

The accused went through an intersection, in
the City of Victoria, against a
red light on his bicycle. A peace officer employed with the Victoria City
Police, who was on duty and observed the infraction, stopped the accused and,
with the intention of giving him a traffic ticket, asked for identification.
The accused refused to give his name and address. As a result, he was charged
with unlawfully and wilfully obstructing a peace officer in the execution of
his duty, contrary to s. 118 of the Criminal Code. At trial, the
trial judge directed the jury that there was no evidence of obstruction of the
police officer and the jury, accordingly, returned a verdict of acquittal. On
appeal by the Crown, this verdict was reversed and a new trial directed. From
that decision the accused appealed to this Court.

Held (Dickson
and Estey JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per curiam: The
appellant was not in breach of s. 58 of the British
 Columbia Motor‑vehicle Act when he
refused to give his name and address to the constable. The argument that
although a bicycle is neither a “motor-vehicle” nor a “vehicle” under the
definitions in s. 2, nevertheless s. 58 of the Act applied thereto
because of other sections was rejected.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon and Beetz JJ.: A bicylce is a “cycle” within the
definition in s. 121 of the Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c.
253, as amended by 1975 (B.C.), c. 46, and, therefore, by the provisions of
s. 173(1) the appellant was under the same

[Page 196]

duties as the driver of a vehicle. The driver
of a vehicle, in reference to traffic signals, is governed by the provisions of
ss. 127 and 128 of the Motor-vehicle Act. Therefore, under the
provisions of ss. 127 and 128, the appellant was prohibited from proceeding
against the red light.

It being the duty of a municipality, under
s. 17(1) of the Police Act, 1974 (B.C.), c. 64, to provide policing
“for the purpose of adequately enforcing municipal by-laws, the criminal law,
and the laws of the Province, and of generally maintaining law and order,
within the municipality”, the constable was carrying out those duties on this
occasion, as directed by s. 30 of the said statute.

The actions of the appellant were not within
any of the four classes of actions set out in s. 63 of the Motor-vehicle
Act so that section gave no power to the constable to arrest the
appellant without a warrant. The provisions of the Criminal Code as to
summary convictions are applicable in British Columbia by virtue of s. 101 of the Summary Convictions Act, R.S.B.C.
1960, c. 373. The said provisions of the Criminal Code as to summary
convictions of relevance here are those contained in s. 450(2) of the Criminal
Code.

In accordance with those provisions, the
constable could only have arrested the appellant for the summary conviction
offence of proceeding against a red light if it were necessary to establish his
identity. The constable, therefore, in requesting the appellant to identify
himself, was carrying out the duty of enforcing the law of the Province in this
summary conviction matter by attempting to identify the accused person so that
he might proceed to lay an information or take the more modern form permitted
under the said Summary Convictions Act of issuing a ticket.

Accordingly, the officer was under a duty to
attempt to identify this wrong-doer and the failure to identify himself by the
wrong-doer did constitute an obstruction of the police officer in the
performance of his duty.

Neither the provisions of the Bill of
Rights nor the topic of individual freedom generally were applicable in
this case. There is not even minimal interference with any freedom of a citizen
who is seen committing an infraction by a police constable in the police
constable simply requesting his name and address without any attempt to obtain
from that person any admission of fault or any comment whatsoever.

Rice v. Connolly, [1966] 2 All E.R. 649, distinguished.

Per Dickson
and Estey JJ., dissenting: Any duty to identify oneself must be found in
either common law or

[Page 197]

statute, quite apart from the duties of the
police. A person is not guilty of the offence of obstructing a police officer
merely by doing nothing, unless there is a legal duty to act. Omission to act
in a particular way will give rise to criminal liability only where a duty to
act arises at common law or is imposed by statute.

There was no statutory duty on a cyclist
caught committing a traffic infraction to divulge his name and address. While,
as held by the majority, the constable, under the relevant statutory
provisions, could have arrested the accused for the offence of proceeding
against a red light if it were necessary to establish his identity, it was not
accepted that as a consequence the accused was guilty of the further, and much
more serious, offence of obstructing the constable in the performance of his
duties by refusing to divulge his name and address.

There is no duty at common law to identify
oneself to police, and the refusal to so identify oneself cannot constitute
obstruction of the police. A person cannot “obstruct” by refusing to answer a
question unless he is under a legal duty to answer. The argument that because a
duty rested upon constables to investigate crime and enforce provincial laws,
an “implied” or “reciprocal” duty rested upon a person, suspected of an
infraction, to give his name and address, and refusal to do so amounted to such
frustration as to constitute the offence of obstructing the police in the
execution of their duty was rejected. Only if the police have a lawful claim to
demand that a person identify himself, does the person have a corresponding
duty to do so.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[1], allowing an appeal
by the Crown from the accused’s acquittal on a charge of obstructing police
contrary to s. 118 of the Criminal Code. Appeal dismissed, Dickson
and Estey JJ. dissenting.

[Page 198]

B.A. Crane, Q.C., for the appellant.

R.M. Lang, for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon
and Beetz JJ. was delivered by

SPENCE J.—This is an appeal from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia pronounced on June 7, 1977.

The appellant had been acquitted after his trial
before His Honour Judge Millward and a jury upon an indictment charging him:

THAT at the City of Victoria, County of
Victoria, Province of British Coumbia, on the 19th day of April, 1976, he did
unlawfully and wilfully obstruct a Peace Officer, to wit, Constable Sutherland,
in the execution of his duty as such Peace Officer, contrary to the Criminal
Code of Canada.

The appellant was acquitted by a verdict
directed by the learned trial judge at the close of the Crown’s case. The facts
are outlined in an admission by counsel for Moore which I quote:

If it please, your Honour, I have certain
admission of facts to make to expedite matters. Firstly, I am instructed to
admit that on or about the 19th of April 1976, at or about 9:10 a.m., the Accused, Richard Harvey Moore, was
southbound on Government Street
at Pandora and at that intersection proceeded through a light which had
not yet turned green and was, in fact red when he proceeded through on his
ten-speed bicycle. That is the extent of my admission of fact.

and are further dealt with by Carrothers J.A. in
his reasons for judgment as follows:

Constable Sutherland, a peace officer with
the Victoria City Police, in uniform and on a motorcycle, observed this
infraction on the part of Moore
and set about to “ticket” Moore.
The constable and Moore proceeded side by side on their respective cycles, with
Moore sometime taking elusive
action by riding his bicycle on the sidewalk, with the constable repeatedly
requesting Moore to “pull over and stop” and Moore lewdly rebuffing each such
request with an obscene demand to leave him alone as he was in a hurry. I
attach no importance to the particular salacious vulgarity used by Moore in
rejecting the policeman’s request to stop as it has been used by the
unimaginative so excessively and indiscriminately as to have lost its literal
quality, but

[Page 199]

there is no doubt that it constituted flat
refusals on the part of Moore to stop as requested by the policeman.

As a result of this occurrence, Moore was
charged upon an indictment, as I have said above, but he was not charged with
failing to stop at a stop light only with obstructing a peace officer in the
performance of his duty. The obstruction which the Crown put forward as
constituting the offence was the failure of the appellant to give his name when
requested to do so by the police constable.

The relevant sections of the provincial
statutes with which I shall deal hereafter are as follows: Firstly, the Motor-vehicle
Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 253. Section 2 contains definitions of “motor‑vehicle”
and “vehicle”, as follows:

“motor-vehicle” means a vehicle, not run
upon rails, that is designed to be self-propelled or propelled by electric
power obtained from overhead trolley-wires;

…

“vehicle” means a device in, upon, or by
which a person or thing is or may be transported or drawn upon a highway,
except a device designed to be moved by human power or used exclusively upon
stationary rails or tracks.

Section 58 of the said Motor-vehicle Act provides:

58. Every person driving or operating or in
charge of a motor-vehicle on any highway who refuses or fails

(a) to stop his motor-vehicle
when signalled or requested to stop by any police officer or constable who is
in uniform or who displays his police badge conspicuously on the outside of his
outer coat; or

(b) to state correctly his name
and address and the name and address of the owner of the motor-vehicle when
requested by any peace officer or constable to state the same

is guilty of an offence.

It will be seen plainly that a bicycle is
neither a “motor-vehicle” nor a “vehicle” of any kind under the provisions of
the aforesaid definition. A bicycle is plainly not self-propelled and,
therefore, cannot be a “motor-vehicle” and it is a device designed to be moved
by human power and, therefore, it cannot be a “vehicle” at all. Much argument
was

[Page 200]

spent in the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia and in this Court in an attempt to say that although a bicycle was
neither a “motor-vehicle” nor a “vehicle” s. 58 of the Motor-vehicle
Act applied thereto because of other sections with which I shall deal
hereafter. As the Courts below, I am quite unable to accept any such submission
and I have come to the conclusion, with respect, that the Court of Appeal for
British Columbia was quite correct in holding that the appellant was not in breach
of s. 58 of the Motor-vehicle Act when he refused to give his name
to the constable.

I turn next to the question of whether the
appellant was guilty of an offence when he proceeded into the
intersection of Government Street and Pandora when facing a red traffic
light. Section 121 of the Motor-vehicle Act, as amended by 1975 (B.C.),
c. 46, provides as follows:

“cycle” means a device having any number of
wheels that is propelled by human power and on which a person may ride

and s. 173(1) of the Motor-vehicle Act provides:

In addition to the duties imposed by this
section, a person operating a cycle upon a highway has the same rights and
duties as a driver of a vehicle.

The appellant Moore was riding a bicycle. A
bicycle is a device having any number of wheels, to wit, two, and
self-propelled by human power and a person may ride on it, as Moore was riding.
Therefore, it is a “cycle” within the definition and, therefore, by the
provisions of s. 173(1) Moore was under the same duties as the driver of a
vehicle. The driver of a vehicle, in reference to traffic signals, is governed
by the provisions of ss. 127 and 128 of the Motor‑vehicle Act, which
provide, in part:

127. Except where otherwise directed by a
peace officer, every driver of a vehicle and every pedestrian shall obey the
instructions of an applicable traffic-control device.

128. (6) When a red light alone is
exhibited at an intersection by a traffic-control signal,

(a) the driver of a vehicle
approaching the intersection and facing the red light shall cause the
vehicle to stop before entering the marked crosswalk on the near

[Page 201]

side of the intersection, or if there is no
such marked crosswalk, then before entering the intersection, and, subject to
the provisions of clause (b), shall not cause the vehicle to proceed
until a traffic-control signal instructs him that he is permitted to do so;

Therefore, the appellant Moore was, by the
provisions of the Motor-vehicle Act, prohibited from proceeding against
this red light.

Constable James Lawrence Sutherland was a peace
officer employed with the Victoria City Police. Sections 17(1), 22 and 30 of
the Police Act, 1974 (B.C.), c. 64, provide:

17. (1) Subject to subsection (3), it
is the duty of every municipality having a population of more than five thousand
persons to provide, in accordance with this Act and the regulations, policing
for the purposes of adequately enforcing municipal by-laws, the criminal law,
and the laws of the Province, and of generally maintaining law and order,
within the municipality.

…

22. (1) A board may establish a municipal
police force consisting of a chief constable and such other constables and
employees as the board considers necessary for the purpose of providing
policing within the municipality.

(2) The duties and functions of a municipal
force are, under the direction of the board,

(a) to enforce, within the
municipality, municipal by-laws, the criminal law, and the laws of the
Province; and

(b) to generally maintain law
and order within the municipality.

30. (1) Subject to subsection (2) and
section 24(2), a municipal constable and a special municipal constable
has, subject to the direction of the board, jurisdiction within the
municipality of the board that appointed him to exercise and carry out the
powers, duties, privileges, and responsibilities that a police constable or
peace officer is entitled or required to exercise or carry out at law or
under any Act.

It being the duty of a municipality to provide
policing “for the purpose of adequately enforcing municipal by-laws, the
criminal law, and the laws of the Province, and of generally maintaining law
and order, within the municipality”, the constable

[Page 202]

was carrying out those duties on this occasion,
as directed by s. 30 of the said statute.

Section 63 of the Motor-vehicle Act provides:

63. Every officer or constable of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, or of the police force of any municipality, may arrest
without warrant

(a) any person driving a
motor-vehicle upon which no number-plate issued by the Superintendent under
this Act is displayed whom the officer or constable finds committing any act in
violation of any of the provisions of this Act or of the regulations;

(b) any person whom the
officer or constable finds committing any act in violation of section 138;

(c) any person whose driver’s
licence is under suspension or has been cancelled, or whose right to obtain a
licence is suspended under the provisions of this Act, and whom the officer or
constable finds driving a motor-vehicle on any highway;

(d) any person driving a
motor-vehicle who is not insured as required by this Act or who does not hold a
valid and subsisting motor-vehicle liability insurance card or financial
responsibility card,

and may detain the person arrested until he
can be brought before a Justice to be dealt with according to law.

The actions of Moore were not within any of
those four classes of actions so that s. 63 of the Motor-vehicle Act gave
no power to Constable Sutherland to arrest Moore without a warrant. The
provisions of the Criminal Code as to summary convictions are applicable
in the Province of British Columbia by virtue of s. 101 of the Summary
Convictions Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 373, which provides:

101. Where, in any proceeding, matter, or
thing to which this Act applies, express provisions has not been made in this
Act or only partial provision has been made, the provisions of the Criminal
Code relating to offences punishable upon summary conviction apply, mutatis
mutandis, as if the provisions thereof were enacted in and formed part of this
Act.

The said provisions of the Criminal Code as
to summary convictions of relevance here are those contained in s. 450(2)
of the Criminal Code which provides:

[Page 203]

450. (2) A peace officer shall not arrest a
person without warrant for

(a) an indictable offence
mentioned in section 483,

(b) an offence for which the
person may be prosecuted by indictment or for which he is punishable on summary
conviction, or

(c) an offence punishable on
summary conviction,

in any case where

(d) he has reasonable and
probable grounds to believe that the public interest, having regard to all the
circumstances including the need to

(i) establish the identity of the person,
(ii) secure or preserve evidence of or relating to the offence, or

(iii) prevent the continuation or
repetition of the offence or the commission of another offence, may be
satisfied without so arresting the person, and

(e) he has no reasonable
grounds to believe that, if he does not so arrest the person, the person will
fail to attend in court in order to be dealt with according to law.

In accordance with those provisions, Constable
Sutherland could only have arrested Moore for the summary conviction offence of
proceeding against a red light if it were necessary to establish his identity.
The constable, therefore, in requesting the appellant Moore to identify
himself, was carrying out the duty of enforcing the law of the Province in this
summary conviction matter by attempting to identify the accused person so that
he might proceed to lay an information or take the more modern form permitted
under the said Summary Convictions Act of British Columbia of issuing a
ticket.

I am of the opinion that the Court of Appeal of
British Columbia was correct in finding that when the appellant Moore refused
to accede to the constable’s request for his identification he was obstructing
that constable in the performance of his duties. As did the members of the
Court of Appeal, I am confining my consideration of this matter to the actual
circumstances which occurred, that is, that a constable on duty observed the
appellant in the act of committing an infrac-

[Page 204]

tion of the statute and that that constable had
no power to arrest the accused for such offence unless and until he had
attempted to identify the accused so that he might be the subject of summary
conviction proceedings.

I also agree, with respect, with the learned
members of the Court of Appeal that this conclusion in no way opposes or
ignores the judgment of the Queen’s Bench in Rice v. Connolly[2]. In that case, the appellant was
seen by police officers behaving suspiciously. On being questioned, he refused
to say where he was going or where he had come from. He refused to give his
full name and address, although he did give a name and the name of a road which
were not untrue. He refused to accompany the police to a police box for
identification purposes saying, “if you want me, you will have to arrest me”.
He was acquitted by the Court of Appeal upon a charge of obstructing the
police. It is paramount to note that the appellant there had not committed any
offence in the presence or view of a police officer. He had simply been acting
in what the constable regarded as a suspicious manner. I view the situation
very differently when a person is actually seen by the constable committing an
offence.

Therefore, for the reasons which I have outlined
above, I am of the opinion that the officer was under a duty to attempt to
identify the wrong-doer and the failure to identify himself by the wrongdoer
did constitute an obstruction of the police officer in the performance of his
duties.

I add that in coming to this conclusion I have
not forgotten the provisions of the Bill of Rights nor the topic of
individual freedom generally but I am of the opinion that there is not even
minimal interference with any freedom of a citizen who is seen committing an
infraction by a police constable in the police constable simply requesting his
name and address without any attempt to obtain from that person any admission
of fault or any comment whatsoever. On the other hand, the refusal of a citizen
to identify himself under such circumstances causes a major inconvenience and
obstruction to the police in carrying out their proper duties. So that if
anyone were engaged in

[Page 205]

any balancing of interest, there could be no
doubt that the conclusion to which I have come would be that supported by the
overwhelming public interest.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Dickson and Estey JJ. was
delivered by

DICKSON J. (dissenting)—These proceedings
originated in a minor traffic infraction in the City of Victoria, British
Columbia. The issue raised, however, is an important one having to do with
police power of interrogation and the right of citizens to remain silent. That
right has always been regarded as absolute and as being firmly anchored to two
fundamental common law principles: the presumption of innocence and the
privilege against self-incrimination. Explicit statutory provisions may impose
a duty upon a person to identify himself to police officers in certain
situations, but in this appeal the Court is being asked to impose such a duty
in the absence of any statutory underpinning whatever. In more stark terms, the
question is whether a person committing a petty traffic offence exposes himself
to a criminal charge of “obstructing” and a maximum penalty of two years’
imprisonment, if he refuses to give his name and address to a police officer.

The appellant went through an
intersection against a red light on his bicycle. A motorcycle policeman,
observing the infraction, stopped the appellant and, with the intention of
giving him a traffic ticket, asked for identification. The appellant refused to
give his name and address. As a result, he was charged with unlawfully and wilfully
obstructing a peace officer in the execution of his duty. The point is whether
the failure of the accused to identify himself when requested to do so by the
constable was evidence to go to the jury of the offence of wilfully obstructing
a police officer in the execution of his duty, contrary to s. 118 of the Criminal
Code.

The General Principle

Any duty to identify oneself must be found in
either common law or statute, quite apart from the

[Page 206]

duties of the police. A person is not guilty of
the offence of obstructing a police officer merely by doing nothing, unless
there is a legal duty to act. Omission to act in a particular way will give
rise to criminal liability only where a duty to act arises at common law or is
imposed by statute: 11 Hals. (4th ed.) p. 15. This idea was
expressed by Mr. Justice Schroeder in Regina v. Patrick[3], at p. 343:

Counsel for the appellant submitted that to
sustain a charge of obstructing a peace officer in the execution of his duty,
it was necessary for the Crown to prove either a positive act of interference,
or a refusal to perform some act required to be done by a statute. …It not
having been shown that the appellant was under any duty or obligation to
communicate to the peace officer the information required of him under the
provisions of either s. 221(2) of the Criminal Code, or
s. 110(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, the Crown has failed to bring
home to the appellant the commission of a criminal offence. This is sufficient
to dispose of the appeal.

The point under discussion is dealt with at some
length by Dr. Glanville Williams in an article entitled “Demanding Name
and Address” appearing in (1950), 66 Law Quarterly Review, at p. 465. The
general principle of the common law is stated:

…neither a private person nor a constable
has any effective power to demand the name and address of a person on the
ground that he has committed an offence or is under a civil liability.

Dr. Williams refers to the case of Hatton
v. Treeby[4] as
an illustration of this principle. The head-note reads:

A constable who sees a person riding a
bicycle at night without a proper light, contrary to the provisions of
s. 85 of the Local Government Act, has no power to stop him for the
purpose of ascertaining his name and address.

The constable in that case called on the rider
to stop, in order to ascertain his name and address. On the rider failing to do
so, the constable caught hold of the handlebar of the bicycle, whereby the

[Page 207]

rider was thrown to the ground. The rider
summoned the constable for assault. The justices found that the constable did
not know the name or address of the rider, and could not have ascertained his
name or address in any other way than by stopping him, and that in so stopping
him he used no more force than was necessary. They were of opinion that, as the
rider was committing an offence punishable on summary conviction within view of
the constable, the latter was justified in stopping him as he did in order to
prevent a continuance of the offence and to ascertain his name and address.
They accordingly dismissed the complaint, subject to a case for the opinion of
the Court. The appellate Court held that the constable had no power to stop the
bicycle rider at common law and the only question was whether he had statutory
authority to do so. It was found that there was no statutory authority for the
constable acting as he did. In the result the constable was convicted of
assault.

No Statutory Duty

It appears to me impossible to extract from the
statutory provisions of the British Columbia Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C.
1960, c. 253, a duty on a cyclist, caught riding through a red light, to
identify himself. Section 58 of the Act specifically places a duty on a person
driving a “motor-vehicle” to state correctly his name and address when
requested to do so by a peace officer. This in itself appears to recognize the
absence of any such duty where there is no statutory requirement. Section 58
does not apply to persons operating either “vehicles” (as defined in s. 2)
or bicycles, and there is no other provision in the Motor-vehicle Act, or
any other relevant statute, placing such a duty on a cyclist caught committing
a summary conviction offence under the Motor-vehicle Act.

I have had the advantage of reading the reasons
of Mr. Justice Spence and I am in full agreement, for the reasons stated
by him and by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, that the accused was not
in breach of s. 58 of the Motor-vehicle Act, when he refused to
give his name and address to the constable.

[Page 208]

At trial, the Crown took the position that the
obligation on the part of the accused to respond to the police officer’s
questions lay within the confines of the Motor-vehicle Act. That
argument was pursued unsuccessfully in the British Columbia Court of Appeal and
in this Court. There is simply no statutory duty on a cyclist committing a
traffic infraction to divulge his name and address.

Power of Arrest

But law enforcement, for that reason, does not
grind to a halt. There is no possibility of frustrating the enforcement of
provincial law by refusing to identify oneself since the police have the clear
power of arrest in these circumstances for the primary offence, to establish
the identity of the accused or to assure his attendance in court. It is beyond
dispute that the accused was prohibited by the provisions of the Motor-vehicle
Act from proceeding against the red light, an act which he has admitted.
Constable Sutherland was carrying out his duties under the Police Act, 1974
(B.C.), c. 64, when he stopped the accused and asked his name and address.
Although Constable Sutherland had no power under s. 63 of the Motor-vehicle
Act to arrest the accused without a warrant, additional powers of arrest
contained in s. 450(2) of the Criminal Code were available. These
provisions of the Code are made applicable by virtue of s. 101 of
the Summary Convictions Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 373. The most important
result follows, as Mr. Justice Spence concludes, that Constable Sutherland
could have arrested the accused for the offence of proceeding against a red
light if it were necessary to establish his identity. However, with great
respect, I cannot agree that, as a consequence, the accused was guilty of the
further, and much more serious, offence of obstructing the constable in the
performance of his duties by refusing to divulge his name and address.

No Common Law Duty

There is no duty at common law to identify
oneself to police. As was stated by Lord Parker in Rice v. Connolly[5], at p. 652:

[Page 209]

It seems to me quite clear that though
every citizen has a moral duty or, if you like, a social duty to assist the
police, there is no legal duty to that effect, and indeed the whole basis of
the common law is the right of the individual to refuse to answer questions put
to him by persons in authority, and to refuse to accompany those in authority
to any particular place, short, of course, of arrest.

The case stands for the proposition that refusal
to identify oneself to the police could not constitute obstruction of the police.
The Court distinguished a refusal to answer, which is legal, from a “cock and
bull” story to the police, which might constitute obstruction. No other
distinction was made. Lord Parker said, p. 652:

In my judgment there is all the difference
in the world between deliberately telling a false story, something which on no
view a citizen has a right to do, and silence or refusing to answer, something
which he has every right to do.

In Ingleton v. Dibble[6], a distinction was drawn between a
refusal to act, on the one hand, and the doing of some positive act, on the
other. Bridge J. (with whom Lord Widgery C.J. and Ashworth J. concurred) said,
at p. 279:

In a case, as in Rice v. Connolly, where
the obstruction alleged consists of a refusal by the defendant to do the act
which the police constable has asked him to do—to give information, it might
be, or to give assistance to the police constable—one can see readily the
soundness of the principle, if I may say so with respect, applied in Rice v.
Connolly, that such a refusal to act cannot amount to a wilful obstruction
under s. 51 unless the law imposes on the person concerned some obligation
in the circumstances to act in the manner requested by the police officer.

The legal position in England and Wales has been
described in these terms in Police Powers in England and Wales (1975),
by Leigh, at p. 195:

And in general it still remains the rule
that a citizen has a right to be as unco-operative as he pleases, provided that
he does not impede the course of justice by knowingly giving false information
to the police.

[Page 210]

In the Ontario case of Regina v. Carroll[7], the facts, as disclosed in the
headnote, were these. The accused was charged with unlawfully and wilfully
obstructing a police constable while engaged in his duties as a peace officer,
contrary to s. 100(a) of the Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.),
c. 51. The accused, in company with three other men, was proceeding along a
highway at an early hour in the morning. The constable heard them whistling and
yelling and he advised them to be quiet and go home. Three of the party
followed his advice. The accused remained. The constable asked him to produce
his identification but the accused refused to do so and proceeded on his way.
The constable caught up to him and again asked accused to identify himself. An
argument and struggle followed and the accused was arrested. He was later
charged with obstructing a police officer and was convicted. He appealed. The
conviction was quashed. It was held that under the circumstances, the accused
was not under any duty to identify himself as requested.

The Crown conceded in this Court that no such
obligation was to be found in the common law. From whence then comes such a
duty? Where does one find the legal compulsion to answer? A person cannot
“obstruct” by refusing to answer a question unless he is under a legal duty to
answer.

An “Implied” or “Reciprocal” Duty?

It was strongly urged in argument before us that
because a duty rested upon constables to investigate crime and enforce
provincial laws, an “implied” or “reciprocal” duty rested upon a person,
suspected of an infraction, to give his name and address, and refusal to do so
amounted to such frustration as to constitute the offence of obstructing the
police in the execution of their duty.

The Crown perforce had to fall back upon the
proposition that because there was duty upon the police officer to inquire
before exercising the power to arrest under s.450 of the Code, there was
a reciprocal duty upon the alleged culprit to respond. The alleged duty, as I
understand the

[Page 211]

argument, is to be limited to divulging name and
address, when caught in the commission of an offence and prior to arrest.

The notion of “found committing” or “within his
view” is not unknown. The concept has been resorted to on occasion to give a
power of arrest where the offence is committed in the presence of the arrester.
But even here the application of the concept is not without problems. In an
article “Arrest: a General View”, [1966] Crim. L.R. 639, at p. 645, the
following appears:

The difficulty with this formula is two
fold—first, there has been no consistency in the judicial approach to the
interpretation of the section, courts holding variously that reasonable
suspicion that an offence has been committed is sufficient, or that in fact the
arrested person must be guilty to justify the arrest. The second problem is
that to confine the power in this way deprives the officer of a power in many
situations where it is necessary to arrest, for no apparent reason. Thus a
person who, having caused an accident by his dangerous driving, refuses to
stop, cannot be arrested unless the accident has actually been witnessed by the
officer. It seems equally absurd that a person who throws a brick through a shop
window can be arrested if the officer sees him do it, but not if the officer is
around the corner and hearing the crash of the glass, sees the offender,
perhaps the only possible culprit, or if the offence is witnessed by a private
person who calls the police.

Although the idea of “within his view” has been
applied to arrests, its application is relation to a duty to disclose identity
is novel and bizarre. It runs counter to all authority. The right to remain
silent, enunciated in Rice v. Connolly, does not admit of such erosion.
There is nothing in the language nor in the facts of that case to suggest that
the broad principle ceased to have application in the event of a police officer
witnessing an infraction.

A limited obligation to respond, effective only
when the policeman is an eyewitness, introduces into the criminal law, which
should rest upon

[Page 212]

“broad, plain, intelligible” principles a
qualification unsound in principle and unworkable in practice.

The fact that a police officer has a duty to
identify a person suspected of, or seen committing, an offence says nothing
about whether the person has the duty to identify himself on being asked. Each
duty is entirely independent. Only if the police have a lawful claim to demand
that a person identify himself, does the person have a corresponding duty to do
so. As McFarlane J.A. said in R. v. Bonnycastle[8], at p. 201, the duty of a peace
officer to make inquiries must not be confused with the right of a person to
refuse to answer questions in circumstances where the law does not require him
to answer.

The Legislature deliberately imposed a duty to
identify upon the drivers of motor vehicles—perhaps because of their more
lethal nature—but chose not to impose such duty on the drivers of other
vehicles such as bicycles. The Legislature must be taken to have intended to
relieve bicycle riders of the duty. To require the riders of bicycles to give
their names and addresses would be tantamount to amending the Motor-vehicle
Act. It would also appear that Parliament, in providing in ss. 450(2) and
452(1)(f)(i) of the Criminal Code for arrest and detention for
the purpose of establishing identity, did not recognize a duty to identify
oneself existing apart from statute, breach of which would expose the offender
to a charge of “obstructing”. Examples from English legislation of statutory
obligation to disclose identity to police constables, unnecessary if the
obligation existed otherwise, are to be found in the Protection of Birds
Act, 1954, 2 & 3 Eliz. 2, c. 30, s. 12(1)(a); Dangerous
Drugs Act, 1965, 13 & 14 Eliz. 2, c. 15, s. 15; Representation
of the People Act, 1949, 12 & 13 Geo. 6, c. 68, s. 84(3); Road
Traffic Act, 1960, 8 & 9 Eliz. 2, c. 16, s. 228; Prevention of
Crime Act, 1953, 1 & 2 Eliz. 2, c. 14, s. 1(3).

[Page 213]

The criminal law is no place within which to
introduce implied duties, unknown to statute and common law, breach of which
subjects a person to arrest and imprisonment.

The “reciprocal duty” argument advanced by the
Crown in this case was considered by Dr. Glanville Williams in the article
to which I have referred. Dr. Williams effectively disposed of the
argument in words which I should like to adopt, p. 473:

The question may be asked whether the power
of the police to demand name and address is in effect generalized by the
statutes creating the offence of obstructing the police in the execution of
their duty—so that refusal to comply with the demand amounts to an obstruction.
At first sight it would seem that a good case could be made out for an
affirmative answer. Although it is not the duty of the police to prosecute
every crime, it can be said to be their duty to make inquiries into crimes with
a view to prosecution. The courts have held that interference with the police
when they are collecting evidence of an offence constitutes an obstruction.
Moreover, it has been decided that an obstruction may take place merely by a
nonfeasance, where there is a refusal to comply with the lawful orders of the
police. Notwithstanding these authorities, it is submitted that the refusal by
an offender to give his name and address does not constitute an obstruction,
for at least two reasons. First, if it were an obstruction, all the statutes
making it an offence to refuse to give name and address in specific situations
would have been unnecessary. When, for example, Parliament passed the Public
Order Act in 1936, it must have been thought that the police had no general
power to demand name and address. Secondly, it is a fundamental principle of
English law that an accused person cannot be interrogated or at least cannot be
forced to answer questions under a legal penalty if he refuses; this principle
is absolute, and does not admit of exception even for a demand of name and
address, unless a statute has expressly created an exception. To say that the
police have a duty to gather evidence, and therefore that a criminal’s refusal
to give his name and address is an obstruction, is far too wide, because the
same premise would yield the conclusion that a criminal’s refusal to confess to
the crime is an obstruction.

The views expressed by Dr. Williams were
adopted in the New Zealand case of Elder v. Evans[9].

[Page 214]

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment at trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Theft of a telecommunication
service—Definition of “telecommunication”—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, s. 287.

During a labour dispute, appellants took over
a radio station to air their grievances. They were charged with mischief and
with theft of a telecommunication service. At trial, they were convicted of
mischief but acquitted of the theft charges. The Court of Appeal unanimously
upheld the guilty verdicts on the mischief charges and, by majority decision,
entered convictions on the charges of theft of a telecommunication service. The
appeals to the Supreme Court concerned the definition of the word
“telecommunication”.

Broadcasts by the radio station were carried
by wire from the station to a transmitting tower and thence by Hertzian waves
to the receiving sets of listeners. The majority on the Court of Appeal held
that transmission partly by wire or cable was enough to make s. 287 of the
Criminal Code applicable.

Held: The
appeals should be allowed.

Section 287 of the Criminal Code (as
it was worded at the time of the alleged offences) extends only to transmission
by wire or cable (such as telephone, telegraph or cablevision transmissions),
but not to transmission by Hertzian waves, as in radio. The accused are
consequently acquitted of the charge of theft of a telecommunication service.

APPEALS from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal of Quebec[1] in which the
accused were convicted of theft of a telecommunication service. Appeals
allowed: acquittal.

[Page 442]

Guy Bertrand, for appellants.

Rémi Bouchard, for respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The accused were charged with
fraudulently, maliciously or without colour of right illegally obtaining a
telecommunication service on May 15, 1972, committing thereby a theft of the
value of $400, contrary to s. 287 of the Criminal Code. The narrow
legal question before the courts of Quebec and before this Court is whether the accused could be said to have
obtained a “telecommunication service”, as defined in s. 287(1)(b)
at the material time. Section 287(1)(b) then read:

(1) Every one commits theft who
fraudulently, maliciously, or without colour of right,

(b) uses any
telecommunication wire or cable or obtains any telecommunication service.

The word “telecommunication” was then defined in
s. 287(2) in these words:

(2) In this section, “telecommunication”
means any transmission, emission or reception of signs, signals, writing,
images or sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire or cable.

The point taken on behalf of the accused, which
found favour in the court of first instance and in the dissenting judgment in
the Court of Appeal, is that transmission of signals by a radio station is not
transmission “by wire or cable.”

The facts are bizarre. In May, 1972, during the
strike of the Common Front, the accused, all of whom are teachers, were minded
to take over a radio station and, literally, to air their grievances. To that
end they, and others like-minded, assembled outside radio station C.F.L.S. at
Lévis at four o’clock one
afternoon. At that hour the station was closed to the public. At about
five o’clock a door at the rear of the premises was opened to admit two station
employees; seven or eight persons took advantage of this opportunity to enter;
about thirty other persons followed shortly thereafter. Some of the entrants
surrounded the manager of the station. They told him they wanted to take over
the air waves. They then spread throughout the building to the reception area,
to the studio, to the news

[Page 443]

room and to the discothèque. At the time of
entry the station was functioning in a regular manner. An announcer was on duty
at the microphone in the studio. The intruders, however, relieved him of the
microphone. One of their number seated himself at the microphone and regaled
the listening audience with propaganda in support of the strike and with
criticism of sundry politicians. The proceedings were enlivened by musical
selections. At the end of two hours the arrival of police brought an end to the
extempore programme and put to flight most of the mischief-makers. A number
were apprehended, including the appellants.

Radio station C.F.L.S. is a commercial
enterprise, operating under licence from the Canadian Radio-Television and
Telecommunications Commission. Broadcasts are carried by wire from the station
to a transmitting tower, a mile distant, and thence by Hertzian waves to the
radio receiving sets of listeners in homes, automobiles and elsewhere. None of
these receiving sets is connected by wire or cable to the radio station.

The accused were charged not only with theft but
also with creating a mischief. At trial the theft charges were dismissed and a
guilty verdict entered on the mischief counts. On appeal the latter verdicts
were upheld but a majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal (Casey and Mayrand
JJ.A., Bernier J.A. dissenting) reversed the “not guilty” verdicts on the theft
counts and entered convictions. Mayrand J.A. held that a wire or cable between
the station and the transmitting tower was sufficient to support conviction. He said: “A mon avis, il y a eu émission et transmission de sons par
fil sur une certaine distance et cela suffit.” With
respect, I have come to a different conclusion.

The word “telecommunication” can be widely
defined. In Robert, Dictionnaire de la langue
française, 1964, T.VI, at p. 675, it is defined as “l’ensemble des
procédés de transmission d’informations à distance”. The
word “tele” in Greek means “far”. Telecommunications systems, in a

[Page 444]

general sense, are devices and techniques
employed for the transmission of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds or
data of any nature by wire, radio or other electromagnetic equipment.
Parliament in s. 287(2) of the Criminal Code has defined the word
“telecommunication” more narrowly.

The forerunner to s. 287(1)(b) was
s. 273(b) of the 1959 Criminal Code which read:

Every one commits theft who fraudulently or
maliciously

(b) uses a telephone or telegraph
line or obtains telephone or telegraph service.

The obvious intent of that section was to
stigmatize as criminal any act whereby a person through tapping a line or like
means was enabled to obtain telephone or telegraphic service without payment.
The growth of community television services using coaxial cable would appear to
have occasioned a 1960-61 amendment of the Criminal Code (1960-61 (Can.), c. 43, s. 6) which adopted
the present wording quoted earlier in these reasons. The effect of the amendment
was to extend the section not only to telephone and telegraph service but
to any telecommunication service transmitting or emitting by wire or cable. The
effect was also to exclude any transmission by air waves. “Telecommunication
service” as defined, in my opinion, extends to telephone, telegraph or
cablevision transmission, but not to radio transmission.

Radio is the radiation and detection of signals
propagated through space as electromagnetic waves. The definition
contained in s. 287 implicitly makes a distinction between two means of
transmission (i) wire or cable and (ii) Hertzian waves. The same distinction
appears in the definition of “telecommunication” found in the Canadian
Overseas Telecommunication Corporation Act, R.S.C. 1970,c.C-11,s. 2:

…“telecommunication” means any
transmission, emission or reception of signs, signals, writing, images or
sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, visual or other
electromagnetic system.

[Page 445]

and in almost the same language in the Radio
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. R-1, s. 2. It might be observed in passing
that ss. 287(1)(b) and 287(2) of the Criminal Code were
further modified and enlarged in 1975 to read as follows:

(1) Every one commits theft who
fraudulently, maliciously, or without colour of right,

(b) uses any
telecommunication facility or obtains any telecommunication service.

(2) In this section and in
section 287.1, “telecommunication” means any transmission, emission or
reception of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds or intelligence of any
nature by radio, visual, electronic or other electromagnetic system.

It is helpful also, I think, to refer to the Broadcasting
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. B-11 in conformity with which radio station
C.F.L.S. operates. In that Act at s. 2 “radiocommunication” is defined as:

…“radiocommunication” means any
transmission, emission or reception of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds
or intelligence of any nature by means of electromagnetic waves of frequencies
lower than 3,000 Gigacycles per second propagated in space without artificial
guide;

In defining “telecommunication” for the purposes
of s. 287 of the Criminal Code in a manner limiting transmission to
wire and cable, Parliament, I think, must be taken to have excluded
transmission by electromagnetic waves through space without artificial guide,
that is to say, to have excluded radio transmission.

Contrary to the majority view in the Quebec
Court of Appeal, s. 287 of the Code in my opinion does not sustain
a distinction between transmissions which are partly by wire or cable and those
which are entirely by wire or cable, a subtlety too recondite for recognition
by the criminal law. The section is concerned with a more fundamental
distinction between transmission or emission of signals utilizing wire and cable
and transmission or emission of signals by means other than wire or cable, that
is to say, by the Hertzian waves of radio. The transmission service of radio
station

[Page 446]

C.F.L.S., being by Hertzian waves, was not a
telecommunication service as defined in s. 287(2) of the Criminal Code.

I would allow the appeals, set aside the
convictions on the theft charges and direct verdicts of acquittal on those
charges.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Theft—Embezzlement—Funds held
pursuant to a direction—Securities business—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, s. 292.

Respondent, a securities broker and president
and general manager of, inter alia, the L… firm, was convicted at trial
and subsequently acquitted in the Court of Appeal on a charge of theft by
embezzlement of funds held pursuant to a direction.

The facts that led to this charge are as
follows: the accused concluded a contract to purchase an issue of bonds from
the A… Seminary and a contract of sale of some of these bonds to the B…
Sisters. A written agreement between the Sisters and the L. firm was reached,
according to which the firm undertook to deliver the said securities on the day
on which they were issued. The accused immediately cashed the cheques received
from the Sisters for this purpose, and used the funds in a manner that made it
impossible for the L. firm to fulfill its obligations and deliver the
securities, pledged to the bank. The civil debt was extinguished by means of a
settlement between the Sisters and the L… firm, resulting in cancellation of
the contract.

The trial judge held that the accused was the
Sisters’ mandatary and that, as such, the money received from them could only
be applied to the purchase of bonds from the Seminary. The accused was
therefore convicted.

The Court of Appeal unanimously acquitted the
accused. It held that the contract between the L… firm and the Sisters was a
simple sale, not a mandate. Once the money had been received for the purchase
of securities to be delivered at a later date, and not for the purchase of
securities to be acquired as mandatary of the Sisters, the L… firm became
merely a debtor and s. 292 of the Criminal Code did not apply.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Martland and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

[Page 276]

Per Judson,
Ritchie, Pigeon and Beetz JJ.: There is no need to analyse the operation from
the point of view of civil law in order to decide the criminal law in question.
The extinguishing of the civil debt and the nature of the contract are not
important. Section 292 of the Criminal Code is aimed at the substance of
the operation rather than at the legal form that it may have been given. The
expression “direction” is used—an expression that is not specifically related
to any particular kind of contract. All that may serve to specify the nature of
the legal relations contemplated by the provision is in subs. 2, which excludes
cases involving only a current account, if there was no direction in writing.
This is irreconcilable with the nature of the operation in question and with
the written agreement stipulating that these were funds advanced, not to be
applied to the credit of the Sisters’ account, but to be used for a particular
purpose.

It cannot nowadays be maintained that the
obligation to keep a sum of money received for a particular purpose means that
the actual specie received must be kept. Not only is money a fungible thing
(except in numismatics), but the ordinary way of keeping it is to deposit it in
a bank or similar institution, such deposit really being a loan. There is no
need to consider whether by thus keeping the funds received in order to be able
to apply them to the payment of the bonds on the day of issue the L… firm would
be able to earn an amount of interest equivalent to that it was allowing to the
Sisters, any more than there is any need to consider whether the difference
between the price paid to the Seminary and the one agreed upon with the Sisters
represented a reasonable commission. Profit or loss on the market has nothing
to do with the nature of the L… firm’s obligations.

The Court of Appeal erred in failing to see
that the payment to the L… firm was not a payment of an advance or a sum to be
credited to the account of the Sisters, but rather an amount that was to be
used for a particular purpose, namely to pay for the bonds of the Seminary on
the day they were issued, if they were in fact issued, which implied that if
they were not issued the sum was to be returned immediately. Although the trial
judge was in error in saying that the relationship was one of mandate, he did
not err in considering that the receipt of the funds in the circumstances in
which it took place implied, by the very terms of the written confirmation, a
direction to apply the sum to a particular purpose. There is no need to
determine how the receipt of the purchase price of a thing to be delivered at a
later date should be viewed in the case of dealings

[Page 277]

other than in securities. Since our criminal
law is codified, it is the letter of the Code that must be applied.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Martland and Spence JJ., dissenting: The Court of Appeal
was correct in holding that the case involved the sale of securities rather
than a mandate. The circumstances of the transaction and the subsequent
settlement leave at least a reasonable doubt on the issue of fraudulent intent.
Essentially factual questions are involved in this appeal.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec[1] setting aside a
conviction of embezzlement of funds held pursuant to a direction. Appeal
allowed and conviction restored, Laskin C.J. and Martland and Spence JJ.
dissenting.

Q.C., for the appellant.

Jacques Bouchard and André Cartier, for
the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Martland and
Spence JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—This is a
Crown appeal from an acquittal of the accused, by a unanimous judgment of the
Quebec Court of Appeal, of an offence under s. 292 of the Criminal
Code, of which he had been convicted by Sessions Court Judge Potvin. Leave
to appeal, limited of course to questions of law, was given by this Court in
general terms. Two issues lie at the base of this case. First, in the words of
s. 292, did the accused receive money from La Communauté des Sœurs de
Notre-Dame-du-Bon-Conseil de Chicoutimi to be applied to a particular purpose and, second, if so, was it
fraudulently applied to another purpose?

[Page 278]

I am satisfied that the Quebec Court of Appeal
correctly assessed the transaction between the Company, of which the accused
was president, and La Communauté as one of sale of securities by the Company on
its own account to La Communauté, and that neither the Company nor the accused
was an agent of La Communauté, receiving money in that character. There was an
outright sale and purchase and nothing more. Again, the circumstances of the purchase
and the subsequent agreement of the Company, through the accused, to cancel the
sale as requested by La Communauté raise at least a reasonable doubt on the
issue of fraudulent intent. It cannot be that, upon the rescission of a
contract of sale by mutual consent, the failure of the vendor to return
immediately the purchase money received from the purchaser (it was in this case
repaid by a promissory note which was honoured by the company of which the
accused was president) results in an attribution of prior fraudulent intent in
the consummation of the contract of sale. Indeed, essentially factual questions
are involved in this appeal and I am not persuaded that any question of law is
raised by the Crown in respect of the crucial issue of fraudulent intent.

For the reasons given by the three judges of the
Quebec Court of Appeal I would dismiss the Crown’s appeal.

The judgment of Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon and
Beetz JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—This is an appeal by the Crown,
brought by leave of this Court, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Quebec setting aside the conviction of
appellant by Cyrille Potvin J. sitting without a jury, the accused having
elected to be so tried.

The essential facts of the case are as follows.
The accused is a broker and is president and general manager of Jacques Légaré
& Cie Limitée, the Société de Prêts et Placements de Québec and over twenty
other financial concerns.

On July 1, 1966, in his capacity as manager of a
syndicate of securities dealers, or brokers, he concluded a contract to
purchase an issue of bonds

[Page 279]

from the St-Augustin Seminary in the amount of
$2,600,000. These bonds were to bear interest at six per cent from July 1 and
were purchased for 93.50 per cent of their face value plus accrued interest to
the date of delivery.

Some of these bonds were immediately offered by
the accused to the Sœurs de Notre‑Dame‑du-Bon-Conseil de
Chicoutimi, whom he had previously contacted in this connection. On July 25 a
written confirmation of the sale to the Sisters of $250,000 St‑Augustin
Seminary bonds at $97 plus accrued interest, was sent to the Sisters. On July
28 the latter delivered to a representative of the firm three cheques payable
to the order of Jacques Légaré & Cie Limitée, and the following day, July
29, 1966, a second confirmation was sent in the following terms:

[TRANSLATION] We have the honour to confirm
our SALE to you of the
following securities:

$250,000 ST-AUGUSTIN SEMINARY


 
  
  6% Bonds
  Maturity: July 1, 1976
  
  
   
  
 
 
  
  Price: 97.00
  
  
  $242,500.00
  
 
 
  
  Interest from
  July 1 to
  July 28 (28 days)
  
  
  1,150.00
  
 
 
  
  250 x 1,000.-
  
  
  
   
  
  
 
 
  
  Total
  
  
  $243,650.00
  
 


Delivery—Subject to the usual conditions
for a new issue, on or about August 8 next.

The cheques were cashed immediately; the issue
of the bonds, which was to take place on or about August 8, was effected on
August 15, but on that day the bonds in the amount of $250,000 destined for the
Sisters remained at the bank because Jacques Légaré & Cie Limitée did not
have the necessary funds to redeem them. On or about August 24, the accused
offered to deliver bonds in the amount of $100,000 immediately, and the balance
on or about September 3. The Sisters refused this offer, cancelled the purchase
of the bonds and received from Jacques Légaré & Cie Limitée a promissory
note in the amount of $243,650 dated July 28, 1966 payable in a year with
interest at seven per cent. As to this point, Mayrand J.A. observed:

[Page 280]

[TRANSLATION] The fact that the contract
between the Sisters and the company was thus cancelled by consent of the
parties, that a settlement was reached following the charge laid against
Jacques Légaré, and that the debt contracted by promissory note to the Sisters
has been extinguished, as was pointed out at the hearing, in no way alters the
problem submitted to this Court. The issue is whether Jacques Légaré had
previously committed the theft of which he is accused.

It should be added that the charge laid by the
Crown is based on what was then s. 278 of the Criminal Code, now
s. 292. It is as follows:

[TRANSLATION] JACQUES LÉGARÉ is charged
with having, during the period between May 1, 1966 and December 1, 1966, at
Quebec City, district of Quebec, and elsewhere in the province of Quebec, while
he was president of Jacques Légaré & Cie Limitée, after receiving from the
Congrégation des Sœurs de Notre-Dame-du-Bon-Conseil de Chicoutimi a sum of
$243,650.00, with instructions to apply this sum to the purchase of bonds from
the St-Augustin Seminary in the amount of $250,000.00, unlawfully, fraudulently
and in contravention of the instructions received, applied this money to other
purposes, thereby committing the theft of a sum of $243,650.00, the property of
the Congrégation des Sœurs de Notre-Dame-du-Bon-Conseil de Chicoutimi, the
whole contrary to ss. 278, 269, 280 and 21 of the Criminal Code.

The former s. 278, now s. 292, reads
as follows:

292. (1)
Every one commits theft who having received, either solely or jointly with
another person, money or valuable security or a power of attorney for the sale
of real or personal property, with a direction that the money or a part of it,
or the proceeds or a part of the proceeds of the security or the property shall
be applied to a purpose or paid to a person specified in the direction,
fraudulently and contrary to the direction applies to any other purpose or pays
to any other person the money or proceeds or any part of it.

(2) This section does not apply where
a person who receives anything mentioned in subsection (1) and the person
from whom he receives it deal with each other on such terms that all money paid
to the former would, in the absence of any such direction, be properly treated
as an item in a debtor and creditor account between them, unless the direction
is in writing.

[Page 281]

After a very lengthy trial at which the movement
of the funds in the numerous companies controlled by the accused was analysed,
the trial judge said:

[TRANSLATION]… Jacques Légaré & Cie
Limitée received from the Sisters a sum of $243,650.00, which was to be applied
specifically to the purchase of bonds from the St‑Augustin Seminary
through the accused, who was first and foremost the Sisters’ mandatary.

This sum of $243,650.00 was converted from
its intended purpose, since it was used, with the accused’s approval, to pay
other liabilities of the company, including a sum of $98,000.00 applied to
another bank account. Furthermore, the bonds that were to be delivered on August 15, 1966 at the latest were not in fact
delivered until the day of the cancellation of the sale, at the end of August,
and of the agreement to treat the $243,650.00 as a loan to Jacques Légaré &
Cie Limitée,…

The Court of Appeal correctly pointed out that
the Sisters had not dealt with Jacques Légaré & Cie Limitée as a mandatary,
but as a vendor. There is no doubt that it was on its own account that the
syndicate had bought the issue, and that it was on its own account that the
Légaré firm had sold a portion to the Sisters. This does not dispose of the
matter, however, since neither the indictment nor the section of the Criminal
Code on which it is based presupposes the existence of a mandate.

In my opinion there is no need in the case at
bar to analyse the operation from the point of view of civil law in order to
decide the criminal law question. Moreover, the situation at civil law is not in
doubt. It is clear that Jacques Légaré & Cie Limitée failed to fulfil its
obligation. Having received the full price with accrued interest for $250,000
in bonds of the St-Augustin Seminary subject to the usual conditions for a new
issue, the company’s obligation was to deliver these securities on the day on
which they were actually issued, namely August 15. Since this was a commercial
transaction, the company was put in default by the very fact of not having
delivered on that day (art. 1069 C.C.). Having received payment
in advance, it seriously contravened its obligation toward the Sisters by
pledging the securities to the bank, so

[Page 282]

that it could pay the St-Augustin Seminary for
them, whereas its obligation was to deliver them completely unencumbered.

This situation was entirely due to the fault of
the accused who had used the funds received from the Sisters for the purposes
of his commerical companies, instead of keeping those funds available for the
purpose for which he had received them. It was not as a result of unforeseen
events occurring without its fault that the accused’s firm found itself unable
to meet its obligations toward the Sisters on the day the bonds were issued. It
has been clearly established that this failure was due to the fact that, under
the direction of the accused, the funds received from the Sisters were used in
a manner that made it impossible for the firm to fulfil its obligations.

From the civil point of view there was thus a
conscious failure to meet an obligation. As we have seen, this was subsequently
settled, but this settlement leaves unsolved the question whether or not there
was a criminal act. The contention of the accused, which was accepted by the
Court of Appeal, is essentially that once the money had been received for the
purchase of securities to be delivered at a later date, and not for the
purchase of securities to be acquired as mandatory of the Sisters, the Légaré
firm became merely a debtor and s. 292 of the Criminal Code did not
apply.

It is important to note that s. 292 does
not tie the definition of the offence to the kind of contract concluded between
the accused and the person from whom he has received money or valuable
securities. It is further on, under the heading “Offences Resembling Theft”,
that one finds in s. 296 (formerly 282) a provision concerning a
person who, “being a trustee of anything… converts, with intent to defraud and
in violation of his trust, that thing or any part of it to a use that is not
authorized by the trust”. “Trustee” is defined in s. 2, by reference inter
alia to the law of the province. In section 292, as in s. 290,
however, there is nothing specifying the nature of the agreement under which
the money may have been received. The section speaks of a “direction”, an
expression that is not specifically related to any particular kind of contract.
The only words that

[Page 283]

may serve to specify the nature of the legal
relations contemplated are in subs. 2, which excludes cases involving only a
current account, if there was no direction in writing. Here the direction was
shown by the confirmation, which was issued at the very moment the cheques were
received.

The accused is maintaining in essence that
although the funds had been given to pay the price of the bonds in question on
the day of their eventual issue, the Légaré firm was merely indebted for them
and could use them in its discretion. He points out in this connection that
interest had ceased to accrue on July 28, whereas the Légaré firm was obliged
to pay interest to the Seminary until the day of delivery, which was scheduled
for August 8, but in fact took place on August 15. This implies, it is said,
that the firm could use the funds in the interval.

In my opinion this objection is no more valid
than the one based on the fact that the Légaré firm was obliged to deliver the
bonds at a fixed price, and not on a commission basis. The days are long time
past when it was held that a person to whom money was entrusted for a
particular purpose was guilty of conversion only if he was required to return
or use the actual specie he had received. This ancient rule was set aside by
s. 355 of the old Criminal Code (corresponding to s. 290 of
the present Code), the first paragraph of which read as follows:

355. Every
one commits theft who, having received money or valuable security or other
thing whatsoever, on terms requiring him to account for or pay the same, or the
proceeds thereof, or any part of such proceeds, to any other person, though
not requiring him to deliver over in specie the identical money, valuable
security or other thing received, fraudulently omits to account for or pay the
same or any part thereof, or to account for or pay such proceeds or any part
thereof, which he was required to account for or pay as aforesaid.

(Emphasis added.)

In my opinion it cannot nowadays be maintained
that the obligation to keep a sum of money

[Page 284]

received for a particular purpose until the time
it is to be used for that purpose means that the actual specie received must be
kept. Not only is money a fungible thing (except in numismatics), but the
ordinary way of keeping it is to deposit it in a bank or similar institution,
such deposit really being a loan. There is no need to consider whether by thus
keeping the funds received in order to be able to apply them to the payment of
the bonds on the day of issue the Légaré firm would be able to earn an amount
of interest equivalent to that it was allowing to the Sisters, any more than
there is any need to consider whether the difference between the price paid to
St-Augustin Seminary and the one agreed upon with the Sisters represented a
reasonable commission. Profit or loss on the market has nothing to do with the
nature of the Légaré firm’s obligations.

One of the most interesting of the few cases on
this point is the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v.
Manley[2]. A
broker had been charged with theft without the indictment specifying how the
theft was committed. In effect he was charged with having, without authority,
pledged the securities of a client. Sloan J.A. stated the question as follows
(at pp. 491-492):

The appellant admitted at the trial that he
had, without authority, hypothecated Dawson’s shares. He set up, as a defence,
that Dawson’s account with him was a cash account in which from time to time
there would be debit and credit balance and that when he received the Dawson
shares from the vendor broker on the Stock Exchange these shares were credited
in his books as items in the debtor and creditor account between himself and
Dawson; that Dawson relied upon his personal liability in respect thereto and
in consequence, because of the provisions of s-ss. (2) and (3) of s. 355
of the Criminal Code, there had been no fraudulent conversion of the
shares. The learned trial Judge refused to charge the jury on s. 355
holding that it had no application. It is not for us to say whether or not such
a defence has any merit. That is a question of fact for the jury. The question
for determination by us, as I see it, is whether or not s. 355 can have
application to the facts of this case.

[Page 285]

After a review of the authorities, he concluded
(at p. 495):

In my opinion it is clear from the
foregoing authorities that the absence of any direction to the appellant from
the person from whom he received the shares of Dawson is immaterial. His
obligation to account to Dawson arose from his relationship to him, i.e.,
as brokers to customer. I would say therefore that he falls within s. 355.

In my opinion there are only inconsequential
differences between the former s. 355 (now s. 290) and s. 292,
on which the charge in the case at bar is based. In effect the offence charged
is essentially the same. The Légaré firm obtained from the St-Augustin Seminary
the bonds it had undertaken to deliver to the Sisters. If it did not deliver
them to the latter, this was because instead of paying for them with the funds
received from the Sisters for this purpose, it paid with money obtained from
the bank to which the securities were pledged.

Mayrand J.A. cited the decision of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Tepoorten[3]. The principle of the earlier decision in Manley
was not questioned. All that was decided is stated in the following
sentence (at p. 303):

Here, there is no evidence of any terms on
which Tepoorten received Meester’s cheque, and no evidence of any relationship
between Tepoorten and Meester that would impose any duty on Tepoorten to
account to Meester for the money.

After citing this decision, Mayrand J.A. said:

[TRANSLATION] The Sisters did not give the
company “a direction that the money or a part of it… shall be applied to a
purpose or paid to a person specified in the direction”, in accordance with the
terms of s. 278 (now 292) of the Criminal Code. The sum of $243,650
was given and received in payment for the bonds purchased from the company. The
purchaser did not restrict the freedom the vendor had to dispose of the sum
collected as it wished.

In my opinion the error in this reasoning
consists in failing to see that the payment to the Légaré firm was not a
payment of an advance or a

[Page 286]

sum to be credited to the account to the Sisters
generally, but rather an amount that was to be used for a particular purpose,
namely to pay for $250,000 in bonds of the St-Augustin Seminary on the day they
were issued, if they were in fact issued, which implied that if they were not
issued the sum was to be returned immediately. Although the trial judge was in
error in saying that the relationship was one of mandate, he did not err in
considering that the receipt of the funds in the circumstances in which it took
place implied, by the very terms of the confirmation, a direction to apply the
sum to a particular purpose. It appears quite clear to me that the Sisters did
not intend to allow the Légaré firm to invest the funds in other enterprises so
as to be unable to use them to pay for the bonds from the St-Augustin Seminary
when they were issued.

There is no need to determine how the receipt of
the purchase price of a thing to be delivered at a later date should be viewed
in the case of dealings other than in securities. This is why I shall make no
comment on R. v. Brown[4], cited
by Mayrand J.A., a case involving a travel agent who was said not to be a
mandatary.

Subsection 2 of s. 292, like subs. 2
of s. 290, provides a helpful indication and serves to interpret the main
provision, of which it is the corollary. Can the money received be looked upon
merely as a current account item? In this case, this appears to me to be
completely irreconcilable with the nature of the operation and with the
agreement stipulating that these were funds advanced not to be applied to the
credit of the Sisters’ account, but to be used for a particular purpose.

If this section of the Criminal Code had
been intended to apply only to the case of funds entrusted to a mandatary, it
would have said so. The use of words that do not refer to any particular civil
contract shows that the substance of the operation, not its particular legal
form, was aimed at. This is made even more evident by comparison with related
sections where expressions specifying

[Page 287]

a particular kind of contract are used. I have
already mentioned the word “trustee” in s. 296. It seems proper to note
that mandataries are contemplated in s. 286, where the words “factor or
agent” are used as follows:

286. A
factor or agent does not commit theft by pledging or giving a lien on goods or
documents of title to goods that are entrusted to him for the purpose of sale
or for any other purpose, if the pledge or lien is for an amount that does not
exceed the sum of

(a) the amount due to him from his
principal at the time the goods or documents are pledged or the lien is given,
and

(b) the amount of any bill of
exchange that he has accepted for or on account of his principal.

As for R. v. Wolfe[5]. I fail to see how it can be relied
on in defence of this accused. It was a case where the accused obviously was
under an obligation to render an account. He had been instructed to sell a car
and had collected the purchase money, but he had not given it to his client
because he had deposited it in an overdrawn bank account. He was acquitted on
the ground that this was negligence, not dishonesty. It seems to me that scant
consideration was given to the duty of the person who receives money for the
account of a third party: s. 285 exonerates the bailee only if his failure
to produce and deliver the thing “is not the result of a wilful act or omission
by him”; why should it be otherwise when it is a question of returning the
purchase money rather than the thing itself? Anyway, there is nothing of the
kind in the case at bar. The accused is an experienced businessman, and it was
with full knowledge of the situation that he disposed of the funds as he did.

At the end of his reasons, Gagnon J.A. cited
three decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal. The most recent of these
appears to me to be the only one requiring consideration: It is R. v. Hughes[6] fully summarized as follows:

[Page 288]

The facts proved at the trial were that H.
was a builder who was asked by one C. to put in a shop front and to do some
repairs to a small property. H. asked C. to advance him £50 to buy materials,
and C. did advance that sum together with a further £100 for the same purpose.
H. did not use the money for the purpose of buying materials but he paid off
his own debts and spent some of the money on repairs to his motor-car. H.
appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal against his conviction on the ground
that the jury were misdirected, and against his sentence.

Held, dismissing
the appeal, that this court could find no fault in the summing-up. It was
clearly laid down in R. v. Bryce (1956) Crim. L.R. 122 that the three
necessary ingredients in the offence of fraudulent conversion were (i) that the
money was entrusted to the accused for a particular purpose; (ii) that the
accused used the money for some other purpose; and (iii) that the accused was
acting fraudulently. In the present case the money was paid over for a
particular purpose and not generally on account, and the summing-up put the
three ingredients of the offence with great clarity.

Applying these principles to the case at bar, I
cannot see how the conclusion can be anything but that the accused is guilty. I
wish to point out, however, that although I do not see any major difference in
this respect between the Larceny Act and our present Criminal Code, it
should not be forgotten that our criminal law is codified. The provisions of
the Code must be applied as they are, irrespective of former niceties
that have been set aside for good: The Queen v. Hemingway[7], The Queen v. Maroney[8].

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal, restore the conviction and remit the case to the Quebec
Court of Appeal for fixing the sentence.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Illegal search—Certiorari—Order
for return with the exception of documents required as evidence—Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 443.

Appellants applied for a writ of certiorari
to quash a search warrant that did not comply with s. 443 Cr. C because
it was too general. The warrant was quashed in the Superior Court and the
correctness of that decision was not challenged. It was also admitted that the
power to order the return of documents illegally seized inhered in the courts
as incidental to their jurisdiction to quash a search warrant on certiorari.
The appeal to this Court is based very specifically on the order made by
the Superior Court judge and affirmed by the Court of Appeal, giving an
opportunity to the Crown to indicate, within five days, documents required by
it as evidence to be exempted from the order for return.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

Appellants’ objection to leaving it to the
police to decide which documents should be retained as evidence when there is
an order for return of documents illegally seized is sound. In the case at bar
the Court is not called on, however, to pass on whether a judge who quashes a
search warrant on certiorari and who must make an order for return may
himself choose to exclude certain documents from his order for return on the
grounds that they are required as evidence.

[Page 244]

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec[1] affirming a
judgment of the Superior Court, criminal side, recognizing the validity of an
order for return of documents illegally seized with the exception of certain
documents. Appeal allowed and return of all the documents directed.

Bruno Pateras, Q.C., for the appellants.

Guy Lafrance and Serge Authier, for the
respondents.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The issue in this appeal is a
narrow one. Certiorari was brought to quash a search warrant for
non-compliance with s. 443 of the Criminal Code. The warrant,
issued by a justice of the peace, was directed to the seizure, at named
premises, of various documents, described only by class (e.g. invoices,
correspondence, books of account, cheques, handwritten notes and a list of
names) and connected with the financial affairs of the Quebec Association for
the Deaf. Although fraud was alleged, neither the perpetrator nor the victim
nor the object of the fraud was identified. There was no indication whether the
premises to be searched were those of the Association or of the perpetrator or
of the victim of the alleged fraud which itself was left completely vague.

Rothman J. quashed the search warrant, and the
correctness of that decision was not challenged on appeal, nor is it challenged
here. However, the search warrant had been executed, and certain documents
claimed by the appellants were seized thereunder, before proceedings were taken
to quash it. Although a question was raised as to the power of the Court to
order the return of documents thus illegally seized, it was common ground in
the Courts below that this power inhered in the Courts as incidental to their
jurisdiction to quash a search warrant on certiorari.

What has brought this case here is the order
made by Rothman J. and affirmed by the Court of

[Page 245]

Appeal, giving an opportunity to the Crown to
indicate, within five days, which of the documents were required by it as
evidence and specifying them precisely. In making this order, the judge of
first instance founded himself on the judgment of Berger J. of the British
Columbia Supreme Court in Black v. The Queen[2]. Without passing on the correctness
of that decision, it is clear that it can have no application here. The reason
why the search warrant was quashed in the Black case was because the person
signing it did not indicate beneath his signature that he was a justice of the
peace or indicate in any other way that he was authorized to issue the warrant.
None of the fatal frailties in the body of the search warrant in the present
case were evident in the Black case. In the circumstances of that case,
Berger J. gave a qualified order for the return of the articles illegally
seized, permitting the Crown to file a letter stating, if that was the case,
that they were required as evidence on a prosecution.

In the present case, it cannot be said that
there is any chargeable offence to which the seized documents could be
relevant. On what basis, therefore, can the trial judge have left it to the
police to determine which of the documents they wish to retain as evidence? It
is true that in his prayer for relief and in his argument before this Court
counsel for the appellants indicated that he had no objection to the trial
judge himself exercising the power to order the return of the illegally seized
documents to the extent that it not be established before him that they were
required as evidence of a criminal offence. His objection was that Roth-man J.
had left it to the police to decide what should be retained. I think this
objection is a sound one.

In the present case, I need not pass on the
question whether, in circumstances such as those present here, a judge may
direct that notwithstanding a fatal defect of substance in a search warrant
which has been executed, the documents seized should be retained subject to his
order and that they may be turned over to the police as he

[Page 246]

may direct. The order in appeal here is not of
that kind.

Ghani v. Jones[3] is of no assistance to the Crown in this case. Apart from the fact
that there is no general statutory authority in England as there is here to
issue search warrants, and that, accordingly, common law rules determine in
most cases whether documents seized by the police in the course of their
investigation of a criminal offence may be retained as evidence, it is apparent
from the reasons of Lord Denning that it is the Courts and not the police who
determine whether adequate grounds exist for retaining seized documents. Those
grounds as set out by Lord Denning are largely involved in the regularity and
validity of a search warrant under s. 443. Since they have not been met in
this case, as indeed they were not met in Ghani v. Jones, there is no
reason to involve the Court in any sorting of the seized materials.

I would, accordingly, allow the appeal, set aside
the order in appeal and direct that all the documents seized under the illegal
warrant and all extracts and copies be returned to the appellants.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR QUEBEC

Constitutional law — Provincial statute providing for a public
inquiry into organized crime — Witnesses refusing to testify sentenced for
contempt of court — Distribution of powers — Administration of justice and
criminal procedure — Police Act, 1968 (Que.), c. 17, s. 19 — Public Inquiry
Commission Act, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 11, s. 1 — British North America Act, ss. 91,
92, 96 and 101 — Code of Civil Procedure, art. 51.

Criminal law — Evidence — Witnesses before a provincial
inquiry commission — Protection against self-incrimination — Habeas corpus jurisdiction,
civil or criminal — Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, s. 5 - Code of
Civil Procedure, arts. 309 and 851.

Appellants were found guilty of contempt for having
refused to testify at an inquiry before the Quebec Police Commission and
sentenced to one year in jail, this being the maximum provided under art. 51 of
the Code of Civil Procedure. The inquiry was requested by the Lieu­tenant-Governor
in Council pursuant to s. 19 of the Police Act, which authorizes the
holding of an inquiry into organized crime. Appellants appealed from their
sentence by petitions for writs of habeas corpus with certiorari in
aid. These petitions were dismissed by the

[Page 153]

Court of Queen's Bench, Crown side, and by the Court
of Appeal of the province of Quebec, and appellants appealed to this Court. They
challenged the validity of the Order in Council and of s. 19 of the Police
Act on constitutional grounds. Consequently, this Court con­sidered the
constitutional question, namely, whether the Order in Council and s. 19 (and
other provisions which were really attacked only as related to s. 19) were ultra
vires the provincial legislature. Appellants, supported by the Attorney
General for Canada, contended that this is criminal law legislation, which
under s. 91(27) of the B.N.A. Act is within the exclusive legislative
authority of the Parliament of Canada. The respondent and the mis en cause,
supported by the Attorneys General for the intervening provinces, claimed that
under s. 92(14) the provinces have jurisdiction to legislate in relation to the
administration of justice in the province, including the administration of
justice in criminal proceedings.

Held (Laskin C.J. and de Grandpré J.
dissenting): The constitutional question should be answered in the negative and
the appeal dismissed.

Per Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.:
The scope of ""Criminal Law"" and ""Procedure in Criminal
Matters"" in s. 91(27) B.N.A. Act is narrowed by the allocation to
the provinces of jurisdiction over the ""Administration of Justice"" in
all matters civil and criminal, which has consistently been held to include the
detection of criminal activities.

In an examination of the procedure at a coroner's
inquiry, this Court recently held in Faber v. The Queen, [1976] 2 S.C.R.
9, that when a person is not charged, the provincial statute requiring him to
testify and making him liable to punishment for contempt of court in the event
of refusal was valid. The conclusion affirmed by the majority in this Court was
that this procedure was not ""a procedure in a criminal matter"". This
was said in a case where, after an open verdict of death due to a crime by a
person or persons unknown, the coroner resumed the inquest for the sole purpose
of ascertaining who might be charged with such crime. If an inquest carried out
with a view to such a consequence can be said not to be a ""procedure in a
criminal matter"", it appears to me that the same must a fortiori
be said of an inquiry in conclusion of which no more can be done than the
making of a report to the provincial Attorney General. There is no reason to
take a different view where the object of the inquiry, instead of being the
gathering of information sufficient to lay a charge for criminally causing the
death of another person, is the gathering of information identifying persons
engaged in organized crime and describing their activities.

[Page 154]

If appellants testify, they will have the benefit of
the protection contemplated in the Canada Evidence Act, s. 5(2) of which
states that this protection is granted to a witness forced to reply under an
Act of any provincial legislature.

The fact that appellants were sentenced to one year
in jail does not support appellants' submission that the matter was
""criminal"". Provincial legislatures are empowered to inflict
punishment by fine or imprisonment for violation of provincial laws. In the
present case, the sentence was handed down under art. 51 of the Code of
Civil Procedure and was coercive not punitive.

Finally, appellants would not be without redress if
the legislation was unconstitutional as they contend. Because they were
committed under provincial legisla­tion, they should apply to the courts of
civil jurisdiction, that is, the Superior Court, by habeas corpus under
art. 851 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

Per Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Spence and
Dick-son JJ.: Section 92(14) of the B.N.A. Act, which gives the
provinces power over ""Administration of Justice within the Province"",
cannot be interpreted as meaning the administration of civil justice alone.
Canadian legis­lative history, as well as the development of legal institu­tions
within the provinces since Confederation, do not support such a restrictive
interpretation. Implicit in the grant to the provinces of exclusive legislative
authority in respect of administration of justice and in the grant to the
federal government of exclusive legislative authority in respect of criminal
law and procedure is an accept-ance of a certain degree of overlapping.
However, in the case at bar the Inquiry does not act as a criminal court or
exercise criminal jurisdiction: its function is merely to investigate and
report. The legislation under attack is based solely on the province's
jurisdiction in the ""Administration of Justice"". This is an
independent source of provincial power which does not need to rely on some
other head of power.

The exact scope of s. 92(14) of the B.N.A. Act has
never been dealt with by this Court. The constitutional question raised by the
case at bar touched upon directly only in In re Public Inquiries Act.' In re
Clement [1919] 3 W.W.R. 115, where it was held that a province could make
investigations into breaches of Dominion laws since the ferreting out of crime
and the identification of criminals was one of the functions under the
administra­tion of justice, and during such an inquiry could compel a witness
to give evidence which might tend to incrimi­nate him. As is the case with a
coroner's inquest, which

[Page 155]

in Faber v. The Queen, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 9, was
held not to be a matter of criminal law, the Quebec Crime Inquiry deals with
broad social interests and there is no lis or accused; the concern is
the gathering of informa­tion, not adjudication.

In light of the provisions of the Canada Evidence
Act, s. 5(2) and the Code of Civil Procedure, art. 309, it cannot be
maintained that the Crime Commission's powers of subpoena and imprisonment for
contempt interfered with a citizen's right to protection against
self-incrimination. This right, which originated in common law, has been
abolished in Canada. However, a person who appears before a provincial inquiry
commis­sion is a ""witness"" within the meaning of s. 5 and benefits
from the protection given by subs. (2). Whether or not one agrees with a result
which may force a person to assist in an investigation of his criminal
activity, Canadian laws, both federal and provincial, compel such a result.
Quebec's Crime Inquiry introduces no new and insidious form of investigation
into our judicial system and there is no evidence before the Court that it is a
colourable attempt to evade the procedural provisions of the Criminal Code.

Per Beetz J.: Before Confederation, the
provinces were in charge of the administration of justice, including criminal
justice. Section 91(27) of the B.N.A. Act gave exclusive
legislative authority in criminal law, substan­tive and procedural, to the
Parliament of Canada. But subject to this provision and to the paramountcy of
federal law enacted under primary or ancillary federal jurisdiction, the
provinces were to remain responsible in principle for the enforcement of
criminal law and to retain such power as they had before with respect to the
administration of criminal justice. Section 92(14) of the B.N.A. Act does
not distinguish between civil and crimi­nal justice: the natural meaning of the
expression ""the administration of justice"" is broad enough to
encompass both. As for the power given to Parliament under subs. (27), it was
described by this Court in A.G. Que. v. A.G. Can., [1945] S.C.R. 600,
as the power to determine what shall or what shall not be
""criminal"", and to determine the steps to be taken in prosecutions
and other criminal proceedings before the courts. Section 19 of the Police
Act does not correspond to this description, and must therefore be
construed as being a provision

[Page 156]

bearing on the administration of criminal justice.

The penalties imposed under the impugned legislation
in cases where witnesses refuse to testify are of a coercive nature. Even if
they are punitive, s. 92(15) would suffice to insure their constitutionality
unless they be used as a colourable device to create new crimes, or to punish
old ones otherwise than under the Criminal Code.

Per Laskin C.J. and de Grandpré J., dissenting:
If one accepts the argument that it is open to a province to authorize a
provincially-established tribunal to conduct an inquiry, with supporting
sanctions to compel appearance and testimony, into crime and into crime in all
its ramifications, the provinces would then have this power in respect of any
matter which falls with exclusive federal competence, such as bankruptcy,
insolvency and so on. In support of the constitutionality of s. 19 of the Police
Act, the provinces purport to find in the legisla­tive power in relation to
""the administration of justice in the Province"" ample competence to
authorize inquiries which do not involve accusations or charges and do not
involve prosecutions for offences. This argument rests on a distinction, which
does not seem proper, between a coercive inquiry into criminality and a
coercive inquiry into other fields where there is exclusive federal legisla­ture
power.

Although it is recognized that s. 92(14) of the B.N.A.
Act gives the provinces a source of authority that enables them to blend
with exercises of federal power when the latter is used to invest provincially-established
Courts with jurisdiction in matters within exclusive fed­eral competence,
federal overriding authority is always in reserve. Thus, although the
Parliament of Canada has designated the provincial courts to administer
criminal law, they have to do so according to procedures which under s. 91(27)
of the B.N.A. Act, are within exclusive federal competence.

None of the cases cited really decided the constitu­tional
question raised in the case at bar. The ancillary questions which they dealt
with have no influence on the validity of the challenged provision, namely, s.
19 of the Police Act. Although a province may establish provin­cial or
local police forces, it cannot invest its police

[Page 157]

officers with some fresh power if no such power was
conferred by the existing federal criminal law. To the extent to which
enforcement of the criminal law is left with these police forces, it is there
by virtue of federal law or by the continuation of pre-confederation powers. A
province may not establish an inquiry commission which, by stopping at
investigation and detection and avoiding entry or possible entry into
prosecution, would take over this large area of the criminal law, save for the
minimal restraint of s. 5 of the Canada Evidence Act. Such an inquiry
into crime has nothing to do with the administration of justice and is a direct
invasion of exclusive federal competence. It is not possible, by pre-scribing a
different procedure for enforcing the criminal law than what Parliament
ordains, for example, by doing ""wholesale"" what is done under the Criminal
Code by ""retail"", to change the distribution of exclusive
legislative authority in the field of criminal law and criminal procedure.

Since Parliament could authorize an inquiry into the
same subjects as those covered by the challenged legisla­tion, the B.N.A.
Act should be construed as far as possible to preclude both levels of
governmental author­ity from being entitled to converge on an individual for
the same purpose and possibly even at the same time.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—I have had the advantage of seeing
the reasons in this appeal prepared by my brother Pigeon before embarking on my
own. A constitutional issue of far-reaching significance is raised here which
does not appear to have been faced as directly in any previous decision

[Page 159]

as it must be faced here. The issue, in short, is this. Since the
Parliament of Canada has exclusive legislative authority in relation to the
criminal law including procedure in criminal matters (and I shall refer later
to the judicially recognized scope of this power), is it open to a province to
authorize a provincially-established tribunal to conduct an inquiry, with
supporting sanctions to compel appearance and testimony, into crime and into
crime in all its ramifications, including the organi­zations and persons
involved? And if a province has this power in respect of crime, would it not
have it also in respect of bankruptcy and insolven­cy, indeed in respect of any
matter which falls with exclusive federal competence, as do the matters just
enumerated, and this simply because an aspect of the question might be said to
be within s. 92? To take another example, akin in legislative sub­ject matter
to that covered by the inquiry in the present case, would it not also be open
to the province to authorize a full-scale inquiry into monopoly and other
anti-competitive practices which have been dealt with by the Parliament of
Canada, with judicial approval, under its criminal law power?

The need, the desirability of an inquiry such as that put on foot
by Order-in-Council No. 2821-72 issued by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of
Quebec under s. 19 of the Police Act, 1968 (Que.), c. 17, as amended, is
beside the point. We are not concerned here with some private inquiry, with a
piece of research by a scholar, with a journalistic investigation, but with a
state-sanctioned inquiry by a public tribunal with compulsory and punitive
powers against those refusing to cooperate in its proceedings.

The provincial case, supported by four other provinces and
opposed by the Government of Canada, is founded on the legislative power con­ferred
on the provincial Legislatures by s. 92(14) of the British North America
Act, assisted by the provisions for sanctions found in s. 92(15). I need
not dwell on s. 92(15) in this case. If the Province of Quebec has validly
established the inquiry I would not question the grant of authority to the
tribunal conducting it to punish for contempt

[Page 160]

recalcitrant witnesses or persons properly subpoe­naed who refuse
to be sworn.

Section 92(14) of the British North America Act confers
the following legislative power upon provincial Legislatures:

92....

14. The Administration of Justice in the Province, including
the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of
Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction and including Proce­dure in Civil Matters in
those Courts.

A number of issues raised by the relation of this power to other
prescriptions of the British North America Act, such as ss. 96 and 101,
and of course, the prescriptions respecting federal legisla­tive power under s.
91, may be quickly laid to rest. A province may establish Courts or tribunals
to administer matters falling within its legislative power, provided that the
limitations as to the character and stature of the courts or tribunals arising
under s. 96 are observed: see Labour Rela­tions Board of Saskatchewan v.
John East Iron Works Ltd.[2]; Tomko
v. Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia[3]'; and
see also Dupont v. Inglis[4]. A province
may establish Courts and endow them with a jurisdictional capacity to administer
even federal legislation, subject to the power of the Parliament of Canada to
repose exclusive jurisdic­tion in such matters in a Court of its own creation
under s. 101: see Board v. Board[5]; cf.
Hellens v. Densmore[6]; and
see Reference re Divorce Court

Act (P.E.I.)[7];
Pringle v. Fraser[8]. Where
a province

establishes such a Court, the substantive law administered
therein, being in relation to matters falling within exclusive federal
competence, would have to come from federal enactments; cf Attorney

[Page 161]

General of British Columbia v. McKenzie[9].
The Parliament of Canada could and has, in some cases, fortified this
exercise of federal jurisdiction by provincial courts by designating them to be
the judicial enforcement agencies. The commonest illustration of this is, of
course, in the federal provisions for enforcement of the criminal law.

A provincial Court which administers federal law, be it a
superior court or not, may do so through its own procedures unless the federal
legislation prescribes the procedure to be followed. An example of this is
found in the field of bank­ruptcy. There is one important qualification to
provincial court resort to its own procedure and that is where the procedure is
in a criminal matter. This, under s. 91(27) of the British North America
Act, is within exclusive federal competence: see In re Storgoff[10]
and cf Minister of National Reve­nue v. Lafleur[11].

The submissions on behalf of the Attorney Gen­eral of Quebec and
of the supporting provincial Attorneys General do not, as I appreciate their
force, deny the foregoing propositions but rather distinguish them by
purporting to find in the legis­lative power in relation to ""the
administration of justice in the Province"" ample competence to authorize
inquiries which do not involve accusa­tions or charges and do not involve
prosecutions for offences. The fact that, consequentially, charges may result,
or that remedial legislation may be called for which only the Parliament of
Canada may enact, is not, according to the provin­cial contentions, sufficient
to deny provincial au­thority to establish the inquiry. We are thus brought to
consider not what s. 92(14) does not cover but rather what it embraces.

[Page 162]

The argument before this Court, as advanced by the proponents of
the validity of this inquiry, appeared to me to rest, to some degree at least,
on a distinction between a coercive inquiry into crimi­nality and a coercive
inquiry into other fields where there is exclusive federal legislative power.
The one is said to relate to the administration of justice in the Province; the
others, apparently, not so. I fail to see the distinction. A coercive inquiry,
say into the operation of bankruptcy laws, or practices relating to bankruptcy
and insolvency is as much an inquiry into the administration of justice, civil
justice in fact, as an inquiry into crime and criminality; and if the latter is
validly open to a Province, so must be the former; and so must be any coercive
inquiry which a Province may wish to mount into fields where exclusive
legislative power rests with the Parliament of Canada. Why not, to take another
example, an inquiry into penitentiary operations which are within exclusive
federal power under s. 91(28) of the British North America Act, on the
ground that under s. 92(6) public and reformatory prisons are within provincial
jurisdiction? No doubt, the Prov­ince would not claim power to authorize its
tri­bunal to require the presence of penitentiary inmates at the inquiry, any
more than it could require their attendance in the present case but, apart from
that, former inmates and anyone else whom the inquiry tribunal wished to hear
could be compelled, if the provincial contention is correct.

It seems to be quite plain that if ""administration of
justice in the Province"", within s. 92(14), extends to civil and criminal
justice without limita­tion (and this is the contention here of the Prov­inces),
it must extend to any area of civil law or public law or criminal law,
regardless of where the legislative power resides substantively in those
various fields. True enough, areas other than the criminal law area are not
before us, but they can hardly be ignored when an assertion as commanding

[Page 163]

as the one made by the Provinces is presented.

""Administration of justice in the Province"" within s.
92(14) is not a head of power which has hitherto been closely examined in the
case law. It has been regarded, and properly so, as supporting provincial
appointment of judicial officers and Judges other than those covered by s. 96: see,
for example, Regina v. Bush[12].
It certainly envisages the provision of facilities through which Courts
and like tribunals can carry out their functions, and also, I would say, the
appointment of support staff and enforcement officials necessary to assist in
the judicial process. In Valin v. Langlois[13], the
Supreme Court of Canada took s. 92(14) to relate to the organization of courts
of justice for the Province and Henry J. expanded on this to say (at p. 67)
that ""administration of justice in the Prov­ince"" means ""the
power of legislating for the administration of justice in the Province in
regard to the subjects given by the [British North Ameri­ca] Act and, to
that extent only, to provide for the constitution, maintenance and organization
of pro­vincial Courts, including the procedure necessary for the administration
of justice in reference to those and kindred subjects"". I do not put Valin
v. Langlois forward as a case that has any direct affinity with the present
one, especially when it was concerned with the validity of a federal statute
imposing duties on provincial Superior Courts and not, as here, with a
provincial statute and Order­in-Council whose validity has to be considered in
the absence of competing federal legislation. It is, however, indicative of a
view of s. 92(14) which, in my opinion, pays due regard to the scheme of
distribution of legislative power and to the limita­tions on provincial
competence that arise out of the catalogue of exclusive federal powers.

Although, like other heads of provincial power, s. 92(14) cannot
be used to invade exclusive feder­al powers, it does nonetheless give the
Province a

[Page 164]

source of authority that enables it to blend with exercises of
federal power when the latter is used to invest provincially-established Courts
with jurisdiction in matters within exclusive federal compe­tence. Federal
overriding authority is in reserve, however, in respect of those matters.

It is unnecessary for a Province to rely on s. 92(14) if it would
authorize an inquiry into an industry or an activity that is within provincial
competence. The Province can rely for this on other heads of power in s. 92
which embrace the industry or the activity within their scope. It would, of
course, rely on s. 92(14) if the inquiry was directed to the operation of
provincial Courts or of other tribunals that determine rights and liabilities.
What is involved here, however, is not of that order.

I do not think that what was said by Duff C.J. in Reference re
the Adoption Act[14], at
p. 403, as quoted by my brother Pigeon assists the provincial contentions in
this case. The learned Chief Justice was speaking principally of the
administrative enforcement of the substantive criminal law enacted by
Parliament, enforcement by municipal or provincial police forces; and if the
generality of his words as to ""the suppression of crime and disor­der""
and as to ""social conditions having a tenden­cy to encourage vice and
crime"" might suggest a so-called preventive scope for provincial
legislation in the field of crime or its incipient conditions, they must be
read today as qualified by later decisions of this Court, such as those in Johnson
v. Attorney General of Alberta[15],
and Switzman v. Elbling and the Attorney General of Quebec[16].
I may refer also in this connection to the statement of the Privy
Council in Attorney General of Ontario v. Canada Temperance Federation[17],
at p. 207, that ""to legislate for prevention appears to be

[Page 165]

on the same basis as legislation for cure"".

Bédard v. Dawson and Attorney General of Quebec[18],
which is the authority usually relied on to support provincial power to
pass legislation (in the words of Duff J., as he then was, in that case)
""aimed at suppressing conditions calculated to favour the development of
crime rather than at the punishment of crime"" (at p. 684), is a case where
the Province could claim constitutional support because it was dealing with the
use and occupation of property, albeit for purposes prohibited by the Criminal
Code. That was the view of this Court in its cautious treatment of the Bédard
case in the Switzman case, supra. I know of no case,
certainly none in the Privy Council or in this Court, which has recognized an untrammelled
right of the Prov­ince to legislate, as it has done here in relation to the
criminal law, without even any pretence of some constitutional anchor in
substantive provin­cial legislative authority, such as was evident in the
recent inquiry by the Cliche Commission, in Quebec, into violence in the
construction industry, and in the recent Waisberg Inquiry in Ontario into
practices, including unlawful activities, in the building industry.

It is, I think, important to remember in assess­ing the scope of
provincial competence under s. 92(14) that this is not a ""non obstante""
power. Rather, it is federal competence, both in respect of the matters
enumerated in s. 91 and in respect of the powers conferred by s. 101, that is
conferred ""notwithstanding anything in this Act"".

Had the Parliament of Canada established an inquiry such as the
one in question here, and with

[Page 166]

the same scope, there would be no doubt of its power to do so,
nor of its power to designate a provincial tribunal to carry it out: see In
re Vancini[19];
Prince Edward Island Marketing Board v. H. B. Willis Inc.[20];
cf Coughlin v. Ontario Highway Transport Board[21];
Registrar of Motor Vehicles v. Canadian American Transfer Ltd.[22]
It would certainly be entitled to assert its pre-emi­nence in relation to
criminal law and procedure in criminal matters. I understood counsel for the
Attorney General of Ontario to deny that the Parliament of Canada may exercise
such author­ity, and if I am right in that understanding, I am unable to agree
with this submission. It appears to be founded on the history of
pre-confederation and post-confederation legislation respecting public in­quiries
(see 1844-46 (Can.), c. 38; C.S.C. 1859, c. 13, s. 1; 1868 (Can.), c. 38, ss. 1
and 2), and the exclusion from post-confederation federal legisla­tion of the
words ""the administration of justice therein"", which were included in
the pre-confeder­ation inquiries legislation. This, in my opinion, begs the
question because it does not give an answer to the scope of the power in
relation to ""the administration of justice in the Province"" in the
context of the British North America Act.

Admittedly, prosecution of crime, be it through
provincially-organized courts or not, must be based on substantive law and
procedure enacted and prescribed by the Parliament of Canada. The pro­vincial
contention is that this limitation does not apply if for prosecution of
particular charges in particular cases there is substituted a general com­mission
of inquiry, an administrative or quasi-judi­cial investigation into crime,
though surrounded by sanctions against witnesses and potential witnesses of a
kind similar to those available in prosecutions.

Section 19 of the Quebec Police Act, as enacted in 1968,
and amended by 1971 (Que.), c. 16, s. 4 and 1972 (Que.), c. 16, s. 1 is a new
provision introduced into a new embracing Act respecting

[Page 167]

police forces in Quebec, and I regard it as of some significance
that s. 19 exists side by side with s. 1 of the Public Inquiry Commission
Act, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 11, as amended. I set out these two provisions in
parallel paragraphs, as follows:

19. The Commission shall make an inquiry, whenever requested
to do so by the Lieutenant-Gov­ernor in Council, respect­ing any aspect of
crime which he indicates.

The Commission shall also make an inquiry into the
activities of an organi­zation or system, its ramifications and the per-sons
involved, to the extent prescribed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council
whenever he has reason to believe that in the fight against organ­ized crime or
terrorism and subversion, it is in the public interest to order such an inquiry
to be held.

1. Whenever the Lieu-tenant Governor in Coun­cil deems it
expedient to cause inquiry to be made into and concerning any matter connected
with the good government of the Province, the conduct of any part of the public
business, the administra­tion of justice or any matter of importance relating
to public health, or to the welfare of the population, he may, by a commission
issued to that effect, appoint one or more commissioners by whom such inquiry
shall be conducted.

Section 1 of the Public Inquiry Commission Act goes back,
in substance, to s. 1 of 1869 (Que.), c. 8. I notice that both the original and
the present s. 1 authorize inquiries to be directed into any matter connected
with the good government of the prov­ince and the administration of justice. It
is emi­nently arguable that if the contentions of the provincial Attorneys
General as to the scope of the authority conferred by the words
""administration of justice"" is as broad as they allege, it would have
been unnecessary to introduce the particular provi­sion as to crime
investigations found in s. 19 of the Police Act. As I read s. 1 of the Public
Inquiry Commission Act, it is broad enough to authorize the designation of
the Quebec Police Commission as an inquiry tribunal under s. 1 and, certainly,
its members could be so designated and appointed. The enactment of s. 19, in
short, suggests that

[Page 168]

something more than what ""the administration of justice in
the Province"" connotes was introduced, unless it is simply a case of
special reference to underline the serious view taken by the Legislature of the
matters covered by s. 19.

The competing contentions of counsel brought to the fore a number
of cases which call for examination on the constitutional issue in this case. They
are, respectively, Regina v. Coote[23];
In re Public Inquiries Act: In re Clement[24];
Batary v. Attorney-General of Saskatchewan[25];
and Faber v. The Queen[26].

Regina v. Coote is relied upon for the proposi­tion that a
provincial Legislature may provide for an inquiry by a provincially constituted
and appointed tribunal into matter that involve or relate to the criminal law,
and which therefore are, substantively within exclusive federal legislative
jurisdiction. I do not think that the Privy Council's decision says this. The
case came to the Privy Council on the question of the admissibility, on a trial
for arson, of depositions of the accused taken at a fire marshal's inquiry
authorized by provincial legislation. Under this legislation, the fire marshal
was required, whenever any building or property was damaged by fire, to
institute an inquiry into the cause or origin of the fire, and, in that connec­tion,
to ascertain whether it was kindled by design or was the result of negligence
or accident. Power to summon witnesses to give information or evi­dence was
conferred upon the fire marshal who also was empowered to commit for contempt
for refusal to testify. The Privy Council held, on the main point before it,
that the depositions were admissible against the accused, save as to answers to
question to which he objected as tending to criminate him but which he was
improperly com­pelled to answer. On the issue allegedly germane

[Page 169]

to the present case the Privy Council said only this (at p. 605):

... It was held by the whole Court [the Quebec Court of
Queen's Bench, Appeal Side] (in their Lordships' opinion rightly) that the
constitution of the Court of the ""Fire Marshal"", with the powers
given to it, was within the competency of the Provincial legislature; …

This observation has been regarded as going to a s. 96 question,
namely, whether the fire marshal as a provincial appointee was given powers
exercis­able only by a superior or county Court Judge or powers analogous
thereto: see Reference re the Adoption Act[27]. Moreover,
having had the advan­tage of seeing the reasons for judgment of the various
members of the Quebec Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, which heard Coote's
appeal from a judgment on a reserved question as to the admissibility of the
depositions (by a majority of three to two it held them inadmissible), I find
that they do not support the unanimous conclusion attributed to the Quebec
Court by the Privy Council.

It is true that in his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice
Drummond, one of the five Quebec judges who sat on the appeal, referred to the
objection that the legislation respecting inquiries by fire marshals was
invalid as encroaching on federal legislative power in respect of criminal
matters, and then asserted that ""as to this objection all the Judges here
agreed that the local Act in question gave to the fire marshals power of
investigation or inquiry only and did not interfere with the author­ity of the
Federal Legislature in criminal matters"". However, Chief Justice Duval
concluded his reasons by saying that ""I make no remarks on the
constitutionality of the Act . . . limited as it is in its provisions, as no
doubt was expressed on the sub­ject"". Mr. Justice Caron said that it was
unneces­sary to decide the constitutional question and he did not propose to
deal with it. Mr. Justice Badgley,

[Page 170]

who had reserved the question of the admissi­bility of the
depositions for the opinion of the Court, concluded that the fire marshal
inquiry legislation was valid provincial legislation which did not encroach on
the federal criminal law power in giving authority to inquire into the cause
and origin of fires. Mr. Justice Monk concerned him-self with the propriety of
reserving the evidence question and did not touch the constitutional point.

Apart altogether from any issue as to whether the Privy Council
correctly appreciated the views of the members of the Quebec Court of Queen's
Bench on the validity of the fire marshal inquiry legislation, there is a vast
difference between the enactment under discussion in the Coote case and
s. 19 of the Quebec Police Act. The Coote legisla­tion had only
an incidental connection with the criminal law; it was rather concerned with
the introduction of a procedure for determining the cause and origin of fires,
which would go to ques­tions of safety and prevention of accidents, arising
through negligence or otherwise, and in that con­nection embracing also inquiry
into whether a fire was deliberately set. In contradistinction to the Coote legislation,
s. 19 of the Police Act has a direct and unqualified thrust into the
substantive criminal law. The Commission has no other man-date than to inquire
into the existence of crime, in all its ramifications, and it is not expressly
limited to what is defined in the federal Criminal Code. Yet it cannot
be doubted that only the federal Parliament can prescribe what is criminal in
Canada for all of Canada.

Re Public Inquiries Act: re Clement arose out of a
reference to the British Columbia Court of Appeal as to the validity of the
provincial Public Inquiries Act and as to whether it was within the
powers of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council under that Act to establish an
inquiry to determine

[Page 171]

(1) whether intoxicating liquor had been unlawful­ly imported
into the province since the passing of a federal Order-in-Council prohibiting
any such importation and (2) whether sales of intoxicating liquor had been made
in the province contrary to a provincial prohibition statute.

The British Columbia Court of Appeal deter-mined, easily enough,
that the Public Inquiries Act was valid provincial legislation. On its
face it provided (and it was common provincial legisla­tion) for inquiries
into, inter alia, the good government of the province, the conduct of
public busi­ness and the administration of justice. Again, there was no doubt
of the power of the provincial Gov­ernment under this legislation to inquire
into breaches of provincial law. What troubled the Court was whether the
provincial inquiry could lawfully reach into breaches of the criminal law. That
law was involved, in the view of the Court, because of the federal
Order-in-Council, which was passed on December 22, 1917, at the instance of the
War Committee of the Privy Council, pro­hibiting the importation of liquor into
Canada until one year after the end of the war: see 51 Can. Gaz., at p.
2182. I may note here that this policy was put on a more permanent basis on a
provin­cial-support level by an amendment to the Canada Temperance Act by
1919 (Can. 2nd sess.), c. 8 which provided that upon provincial instigation a
vote could be taken to prohibit the importation of liquor into any province in
which its sale for beverage purposes was prohibited: see Gold Seal Ltd. v.
Dominion Express Co. and Attorney-Gen­eral of Alberta[28].
British Columbia, like other provinces at that time, had a prohibition
statute and thus it was that the federal legislation and the earlier federal
Order-in-Council were (in the words of one of the judges in this British
Columbia reference) ""merely supplementary to the local law and the effect
has not been to displace the local law"" (at p. 124 of 33 C.C.C.). This was
of a piece with other instances where the federal temperance statute was
construed to make allowance for valid provincial legislation: see Attorney-General
of

[Page 172]

Ontario v. Attorney General of Canada[29].

The characterization of the federal Order-in-Council as involving
criminal law may be suspect in view of the judicial history of federal
temperance legislation: see Russell v. The Queen[30];
Attorney-General of Ontario v. Canada Temperance Federation[31].
However, I am prepared to assume that the British Columbia Court's decision
would have been the same, that it would have sustained the reach of the inquiry
whatever might have been the characterization of the federal prohibitory
provisions. The basis of the judgment was reliance on the words
""administration of jus­tice in the Province"" in s. 92(14)
of the British North America Act and in the provincial Public
Inquiries Act. The matter was dealt with by Mac­donald C.J.A. in a passage
that has been heavily relied on by the Provinces in the present case. He said
this (at pp. 121-2 of 33 C.C.C.):

Under its powers in respect of administration of jus­tice
when crime has been committed, the Province puts the machinery of the criminal
law in motion. This undoubtedly is one branch of the administration of justice,
but the discovery of crime when it is merely suspected may, I think, also fall
into that category. Provincial peace officers are charged with that duty
amongst others. A provincial detective force might, I think, be organized under
provincial laws for the very purpose for which the commissioner was appointed.
Now, if I am right in thinking that investigations, extra-judicially, into the
commission of crime for the purpose of discovering if and by whom committed are
within the subject matters assigned to the Province under the words
""administration of justice,"" is there anything to prevent the
Province from making the inves­tigation effective by imposing on individuals an
obliga­tion to give evidence under penalty for refusal. I think not. Such a
power is not inconsistent, but consistent, with the jurisdiction of the
Province to legislate concern­ing property and civil rights.

[Page 173]

No doubt to concede the power to the Province to make
investigations into breaches of Dominion laws would appear at first blush to be
an anomaly, and it might well be argued that the powers conferred upon the
Province in respect of the administration of justice ought to be interpreted as
conferring merely the duty or obligation to put the machinery of the Courts in
motion, and to take the requisite steps to prosecute persons accused of crime.
That narrow construction would, I think, preclude what has been generally recognised
as one of the functions of government in the administration of justice, namely,
the ferreting out of crime and iden­tification of criminals. There is nothing
novel in com­pelling a witness to give evidence which may tend to incriminate
him. That is done in the civil Courts and is the practice in one of the oldest
criminal Courts of the Realm, the Coroner's Inquest. With the justice or
expediency of inquiries into crime by an extra-judicial provincial commission I
have not to concern myself. The power to appoint such rests somewhere. It is
either with the Dominion or the Province, or with each, and hence it is idle to
urge as a reason against the validity of the order-in-council that it is
inimical to the rights of the subject.

I am of the opinion that the foregoing passage goes much beyond
the necessity of the occasion. The fact that a Superior Court judge was
appointed to conduct the inquiry did not appear to be a material consideration
for the British Columbia Court of Appeal and, in my opinion, rightly so. What
appears to me however to have been the focus of the inquiry was the concern
with the effectiveness of the provincial prohibition statute and, hence, as in
the Coote case, I would regard the concern with the unlawful importation
of liquor into the province as merely incidental to the issue of effective
enforcement within the province of its temperance law.

I do not think that either Batary v. Attorney-General of
Saskatchewan, supra, or Faber v. The Queen, supra, go to the point
which I have been considering. Both were concerned with certain pro­ceedings
before coroners under provincial coroners' legislation in Saskatchewan and
Quebec. In neither case was the validity of the Coroners Act per se called
into question. In Batary, a section of the Coroners Act, making a
person charged with a criminal offence arising out of a death a compellable

[Page 174]

witness at an inquest directed into the cause of the death, was
held to be ultra vires the provin­cial legislature notwithstanding that
the chal­lenged provision gave the person the protection of s. 5 of the Canada
Evidence Act if it was invoked in respect of any question put to him which
might tend to criminate him. In Faber, the question for decision was
whether the Court of Queen's Bench (Crown side) had jurisdiction to issue
prohibition to a coroner in respect of an inquest at which Faber had refused to
testify with the result that there were a number of committals for contempt.
The question of jurisdiction, whether it resided in the Superior Court or in
the Court of Queen's Bench (Crown side), turned on whether the prohi­bition
proceedings were in a criminal matter, within federal jurisdiction, or were
subject to pro­vincial procedures. This Court held, by a majority of five to
four, that jurisdiction lay with the Quebec Superior Court.

In my opinion, the fact that contempt issues arising out of
statutory compellability to give evi­dence (and thus raising questions touching
the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10 and especially s. 5
thereof) may call for decision is peripheral to the larger question in this
case, namely, whether s. 19 of the Police Act is invalid as a whole. As
both Batary and Faber show, such peripheral issues may be decided
without touching the larger question. I am prepared to consider all the
supporting provisions in this case as to compellability and contempt, and
enforcement thereof by imprisonment, as neutral provisions which could be found
in valid provincial legislation as well as in valid federal legislation. The
matter then is s. 19 itself and not any ancillary provisions.

In the course of argument it was contended on behalf of the
Provinces that even a police officer could be invested by the Province with
authority to carry on an inquiry under s. 19. Although such an officer would
then be acting in other than his

[Page 175]

traditional capacity, the submission underlines the close
relation between the ordinary functions of the police in the investigation and
detection of crime and in assistance in the prosecution of crime, and the
function assumed by the Police Commis­sion under the Order-in-Council herein
made in pursuance of s. 19. Indeed, it appeared that it was in the functions of
police officers and police forces, constituted under provincial legislation,
that the Provinces found support for their contention that s. 92(14) embraced
coercive investigation into crime and hence, by analogy, an investigation with
coer­cive power such as that provided for under s. 19 of the Quebec Police
Act. In my view, this is the critical submission in support of s. 19, and I
wish to examine it in depth.

The power of a Province, or of a municipality by delegation from
a Province, to establish provincial or local police forces is unquestioned,
just as is the power of Provinces to establish provincial Courts (subject to
the appointing power conferred by s. 96). The mere establishment of a police
force, and even the endowment of the police officers with statutory powers
under provincial legislation, does not, ipso facto, give them authority
to exercise those powers if such exercise would take them into the field of
criminal law enforcement as contrasted with the enforcement of municipal
by-laws or pro­vincial penal laws. A similar situation prevails where a
Province endows its Courts with authority to administer criminal law or
bankruptcy law. I have already pointed out that this is simply to give them a
capacity which must be fed by federal legislation. In fact, it is open to the
federal Parlia­ment to invest provincial functionaries or courts with federal
functions under federal legislation, regardless of whether they are endowed
with capacity by provincial legislation: see In re Van­cini, supra.

What I have said as to police officers and police forces must be
placed in historical context, and must take account of pre-confederation common
law powers and pre-confederation legislation which survived Confederation.
Section 129 of the British North America Act provided for the con­tinuation,
except as otherwise provided, of all laws in force in the federating Provinces,
all Courts and

[Page 176]

all legal commissions, powers and authorities and all officers,
judicial, administrative and ministeri­al, subject however to be repealed,
abolished or altered by Parliament or a provincial Legislature according to the
distribution of power under the Act. It is plain, therefore, that police forces
and police officers continued to exercise their pre-confederation authority,
even in relation to what after Confederation were criminal law matters within
exclusive federal competence, subject to those powers being taken away or
altered by Parliament.

It is simply not arguable that a Province could invest one of its
police officers with, for example, some fresh power to arrest for a criminal
offence if no such power was conferred by the federal crimi­nal law. The Criminal
Code defines a ""peace officer"" very broadly, and municipal or
provincial police officers now exercise powers of arrest or of search, in
connection with the enforcement of the criminal law, under federal legislation
and, espe­cially, under the Criminal Code. If there are still some
vestigial common law or pre-confederation statute law powers extant, which have
not been overtaken or supplanted by federal legislation, they do not affect
what I have stated; rather do they support the propositions herein.

In my opinion, the suggestion that there is some independent
authority in provincial or municipal police forces, independent that is of
federal legisla­tion, to enforce the criminal law, and that this independent
authority is fed by s. 92(14) is simply untenable, and there is no basis for
finding in the existence of provincial or municipal police forces any
analogical support for the validity of the inqui­ry established under s. 19 of
the Quebec Police Act. To the extent to which enforcement of the
criminal law is left with provincial or municipal police forces, it is there by
virtue of federal law or by the continuation of pre-confederation powers left
untouched by federal law.

[Page 177]

We are asked to agree that a Province could authorize provincial
or local police to engage in an inquiry into the criminal law and, for example,
in connection therewith to require any citizen under investigation to answer
inquiries on pain of liabili­ty to incarceration for contempt. Assuming that,
whatever be the nature of the inquiry, a citizen may invoke s. 5 of the Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10 and thus protect himself in respect of
criminating questions (assuming also he is a witness within s. 5), nonetheless
he would be disentitled to refuse to answer questions incriminating others. The
scope of the inquiry can be heedless of rules of evidence that operate under
federal law applicable to criminal matters. On the submissions made by the
Provinces, it is only necessary to say that the inquiry is not directed to
possible prosecution for a criminal offence; and what the federal Parliament,
endowed with exclu­sive power in relation to criminal law and proce­dure in
criminal matters, has not done the Prov­ince may do, riding roughshod over
citizens in the process. I am not in the least concerned that only those of
allegedly unsavoury character have been or will be interrogated. They are as
much entitled to rely on the distribution of legislative power under the British
North America Act, and on the safeguards prescribed by the Parliament of
Canada when crime is being investigated, as are the most unblemished of our
citizens.

If the inquiry or investigation were put on foot by the Province
with a view to possible prosecu­tion, is there any doubt but that it would
amount to an invasion of the federal criminal law power? What we have here is
an inquisitorial process, more draconian than what Parliament has pre-scribed
in relation to the investigation, detection and prosecution of crime; and yet
it is contended that by stopping at investigation and detection (under the
inquiry) and avoiding entry or possible entry into prosecution, the Province
may constitu­tionally take over this large area of the criminal law, save for
the minimal restraint of s. 5 of the Canada Evidence Act. This, to me,
is not only a colourable invasion but a direct invasion of exclu­sive federal
competence. An administrative, quasi-judicial

[Page 178]

coercive investigation at large into crime has nothing to do with
the ""administration of justice in the Province"".

Those words have never been interpreted to reach into ends which
are beyond provincial au­thority, unless we are to say that an inquiry, however
coercive, is an end in itself, and is in relation to ""administration of
justice"", though no charges are involved against particular persons, no
courts are involved and no consequences are involved, save as to those who
refuse to cooperate in the enterprise.

It has been said time and again, both by the Privy Council when
it was Canada's highest Court and by this Court, that the federal criminal law
power endowed the Parliament of Canada with that authority in its widest sense.
The proposition began with Attorney General of Ontario v. Hamil­ton Street
Railway[32], at
p. 529. In my opinion, this view of the power embraces not only the substan­tive
criminal law but also ""procedure in criminal matters"" which is part
of s. 91(27). In Reference re Validity of the Combines Investigation Act and
of s. 498 of the Criminal Code[33], Duff
J., as he then was, speaking for himself and for Rinfret and Smith JJ. said (at
p. 418) that ""the authority in relation to the criminal law and criminal
proce­dure given by s. 91(27) would appear to confer upon the Dominion, not
as an incidental power merely, but as an essential part of it, the
power to provide for investigation into crime, actual and potential"".
(The emphasis is mine.) The learned judge, as Chief Justice, touched this theme
again in Provincial Secretary of P.E.I. v. Egan[34],
at p. 401, where he said that ""the subject of criminal law entrusted
to the Parliament of Canada is necessarily an expanding field by reason of the
authority of the Parliament to create crimes, impose punishment for such
crimes, and to deal with criminal procedure"". I point out also that
whereas in the grant of authority to the Provinces under s. 92(14) of the British
North America Act

[Page 179]

""procedure in civil matters"" is associated with the
phrase ""in those Courts"", there is no such qualifi­cation in the
reference to ""procedure in criminal matters"" in s. 91(27).

What is urged upon this Court by the Provinces represented in
this case is that it should construe the federal power in relation to criminal
procedure in the same way as ""procedure"" is dealt with in s. 92(14),
that is that it should be limited only to what goes into procedure in the
prosecution of offences in the courts. The corollary of this sub-mission is
that any other mode of inquiry into the operation of the criminal law belongs
to the Prov­inces as falling within the ""administration of jus­tice in the
Province"" under s. 92(14). I do not think that it could be argued
successfully that a Province could prescribe a different procedure (or indeed
any procedure) for enforcing the criminal law than what Parliament ordains.
Merely to change the tribunal of inquiry and to do ""whole-sale"" what,
so to speak, is done under the federal Criminal Code by
""retail"" cannot, in my view, change the distribution of exclusive
legislative au­thority in the field of criminal law and criminal procedure. We
would be as unjustified in freezing our understanding of what is ""criminal
procedure"" as of 1867 as we have held it to be unjustified to freeze the
meaning of ""criminal law"" according to what was criminal in 1867, and
this whether we refer to the substantive criminal law, to investiga­tive
procedures, that may or may not be followed by prosecution, or to penalties or
sanctions that may be imposed upon a conviction: see Goodyear Tire and
Rubber Co. of Canada Ltd. v. The Queen[35], at
p. 308. The comprehensive scope of the criminal law power under s. 91(27) is
also shown by Attorney-General of British Columbia v. Smith[36].

[Page 180]

What is presented here under s. 19 of the Police Act is a
provincial adoption of a new form of procedure for inquiring into crime, a
procedure in a criminal matter, within s. 91(27), and although there is no
direct attempt under s. 19 and under the implementing Order-in-Council to
change the existing criminal law, a different method of exam­ining its
operation is prescribed from the method laid out in the Criminal Code and
in allied federal legislation. As I have already noted, Parliament could
authorize a wholesale inquiry of that kind in addition to the individualized
enforcement that has been traditional with us. For the Province to do it,
however, is for it to provide a type of supplemen­tary administration which, in
my opinion, is beyond its powers. I borrow and adapt the words of Rand J. in Johnson
v. Attorney-General of Alberta[37], at
p. 138 where, speaking it is true in another context, he said that ""any
local legislation of a supplementary nature that would tend to weaken or
confuse [the] enforcement [of the criminal law] would be an interference with
the exclusive power of Parliament"".

It is evident from the submissions of the Prov­inces that they
would read s. 92(14) as if the words in it were ""administration of
criminal justice as well as of civil justice"". I am satisfied on such
authorities as there are, as well as on the scheme of the British North
America Act, that adminis­tration of criminal justice, whatever be the form
that it takes, is for Parliament alone to prescribe. The sweeping nature of the
inquiry power into crime and criminality, conferred by s. 19, is under-lined
not only by its terms, already quoted, but as well by the terms of
Order-in-Council No. 2821-72. I set them out here because they emphasize why,
in my view, the federal power in relation to criminal law and procedure in
criminal matters is usurped by what has been prescribed under provin­cial
authority.

The relevant provisions of the Order-in-Council are as follows:

[Page 181]

 [TRANSLATION] Upon the recommendation of the Minister of
Justice and Attorney General, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:

THAT in the fight against organized crime, the Quebec Police
Commission shall make an inquiry into the activities of any organizations or
systems, including their ramifications and the persons involved, where such
organizations or systems operate in illegal gaming and betting, usurious loans
practices (shylocking), extorsion, illegal trafficking in drugs and narcotics,
counterfeiting, commercial fraud, fraudulent bankruptcies, arson, fraudulent
stock manipulation or promotion, fraudulent dealings of corporations, illegal
pressure on businessmen or officers or members of associations or corporations
to control them or to extort from them money or property, theft of bonds, theft
of stamps and precious metals, theft and dismantling of automobiles, sale of
stolen goods, prostitution, illegal stills and distribution of adulterated
liquor, illegal consumers exploitation, blackmail, intimi­dation and
corruption, and illegal or fraudulent obten­tion of any permits issued by or
decisions made by any public body.

THAT the Quebec Police Commission shall submit to the
Attorney General, on or before December 31, 1975, ""the written report
setting forth the findings"" which it will have made, and that the
Commission shall be authorized to submit, in its discretion, to the Attorney
General, written reports whenever the Commission deems it appropriate.

The foregoing terms point to another consider­ation that to me is
decidedly relevant. Public com­missions of inquiry, launched by a particular
level of Government, are normally designed to bring to light facts and issues
upon which the particular Government can propose curative or protective
legislation to the Legislature to which it is accountable, if the report of the
inquiry justifies the introduction of such legislation. That would not be
possible here when it is conceded that only Parliament can enact criminal law
and prescribe criminal procedure, and when it is clear from the terms of the
Order-in-Council that they point to , issues that are, substantively, beyond
provincial competence. Moreover, if governmental powers are to be exercised
coercively against individuals, the latter are entitled to have at least such
protection

[Page 182]

as is provided by the distribution of legislative power under the
British North America Act, in the sense that the Act should be
construed as far as possible to preclude both levels of governmental authority
from being entitled to converge on an individual for the same purpose and
possibly even at the same time.

The convenience of having a local inquiry, if there is a serious
problem of crime, whether organ­ized or not, in the Province can easily be met
by federal intervention to direct it. And if there are extra-provincial
ramifications or, indeed, other Provinces or areas therein where there are such
problems, it is not difficult to enlarge the terms of reference or to prescribe
similar inquiries to be undertaken by other tribunals.

For the reasons I have given, I would allow the appeal and
declare that s. 19 of the Police Act is ultra vires the
Legislature of Quebec, that Order-in-Council No. 2821-72 falls with it and that
the appellants are entitled to the relief sought by them. Since the issue of
constitutional validity was posed directly to this Court under a question
formulated by Beetz J., there is no need to remit the case to a provincial
court to make the declaration of invalid­ity and to give the consequential
relief sought by the appellants.

Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. concurred with reasons delivered
by

PIGEON J.—Di Iorio and Fontaine appeal from the judgments of the
Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec affirming the judgments of the Court
of Queen's Bench, Crown side, dismissing their petitions for writs of habeas
corpus with certiorari in aid. The appellants had been called as
witnesses to testify before the Quebec Police Com­mission at an enquiry into
organized criminal activities. This enquiry was requested by the Lieu­tenant-Governor
in Council pursuant to s. 19 of the Police Act (S.Q. 1968, c. 17 as
amended). The

[Page 183]

appellants having refused to testify were found guilty of
contempt by the commissioners holding the enquiry namely, the mis en cause Rhéal
Brunet, Marc Cordeau and Roméo Courtemanche. They were both sentenced to one
year in jail, this being the maximum provided under art. 51 of the Code of
Civil Procedure. The principal ground on which they attack the validity of
their committal is a challenge of the Order-in-Council and of s. 19 of the Police
Act on. constitutional grounds. In fact, notice of such challenge was at
the outset given to the Attorney general of Canada and to the Attor­ney general
of Quebec.

In this Court, notice of the constitutional ques­tion was given
to all attorneys general. The Attor­ney general of Canada has intervened to
support the challenge against s. 19. The attorneys general of Ontario, New
Brunswick, British Columbia and Alberta have intervened to support the
submissions of the Attorney general of Quebec in favour of the validity of the
impugned enactment. Although several provisions other than s. 19 were attacked
by the appellants, these are only accessory enact­ments which are really
attacked only as related to s. 19. Consequently, it seems unnecessary to con­sider
those subordinate provisions. Section 19 as amended reads:

19. The Commission shall make an inquiry, whenever requested
to do so by the Lieutenant-Governor in Coun­cil, respecting any aspect of crime
which he indicates.

The Commission shall also make an inquiry into the
activities of an organization or system, its ramifications and the persons
involved, to the extent prescribed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council,
whenever he has reason to believe that in the fight against organized crime or
terrorism and subversion, it is in the public interest to order such an inquiry
to be held.

The conclusions of the Order-in-Council requesting the Commission
to make the enquiry are in the following terms:

[TRANSLATION] Upon the recommendation of the Minister of
Justice and Attorney General, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:

THAT in the fight against organized crime, the Quebec Police
Commission shall make an inquiry into the activities of any organisations or
systems, including

[Page 184]

their ramifications and the persons involved, where such organisations
or systems operate in illegal gaming and betting, usurious loans practices (shylocking),
extorsion, illegal trafficking in drugs and narcotics, counterfeiting,
commercial fraud, fraudulent bankruptcies, arson, fraudulent stock manipulation
or promotion, fraudulent dealings of corporations, illegal pressure on
businessmen or officers or members of associations or corporations to control
them or to extort from them money or property, theft of bonds, theft of stamps
and precious metals, theft and dismantling of automobiles, sale of stolen
goods, prostitution, illegal stills and distribution of adulterated liquor,
illegal consumers exploitation, blackmail, intimi­dation and corruption, and
illegal or fraudulent obten­tion of any permits issued by or decisions made by
any public body.

THAT the Quebec Police Commission shall submit to the
Attorney General, on or before December 31, 1975, ""the written report
setting forth the findings"" which it will have made, and that the
Commission shall be authorized to submit, in its discretion, to the Attorney
General, written reports whenever the Commission deems it appropriate.

The constitutional basis of appellants' conten­tions is that, by
s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act it is declared ""that notwithstanding
anything in this Act, the exclusive legislative authority of the Par­liament
of Canada extends to ...""

27. The Criminal Law, except the Constitution of Courts of
Criminal Jurisdiction, but including the Procedure in Criminal Matters.

The constitutional provisions relied on by the Attorney general
for Quebec and for the interven­ing provinces are heads 14 and 15 of s. 92:

14. The Administration of Justice in the Province, including
the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organiza­tion of Provincial Courts, both of
Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in
those Courts.

15. The Imposition of Punishment by Fine, Penalty, or
Imprisonment for enforcing any Law of the Province made in relation to any
Matter coming within any of the Classes of Subjects enumerated in this Section.

[Page 185]

It is noteworthy that the first Canadian consti­tutional case (Reg.
v. Coote[38]) heard
by the Privy Council after the enactment of the B.N.A. Act (this was
before the establishment of this Court), had reference to a Quebec statute
concerning public enquiries, The Fire Marshal's Act of 1868 (31 Vict.,
c. 32). Coote had been convicted of arson. Depositions taken of him at an
enquiry before a fire marshal had been admitted in evi­dence at his trial
although objected to. On appeal, a new trial had been ordered on the basis that
although The Fire Marshal's Act was constitution-ally valid, the
deposition had been improperly admitted in evidence because the accused had not
been cautioned that whatever he said might be given in evidence against him.
The Privy Council restored the conviction holding that depositions so taken are
admissible evidence on a subsequent trial of the witness except those to which
objection has been made by the witness as tending to criminate him. The Privy
Council explicitly approved (at p. 605) the opinion expressed by the Court of
Appeal ""that the constitution of the Court of the ""Fire Marshal""
with the powers given to it was within the competency of the provincial
legislature"". Sec­tions 3 and 4 of the statute under consideration in that
case were in the following terms:

3. Whenever any fire has occurred in such cities, whereby
any house or other building, or any property whatever therein, has been or is
exposed to be wholly or in part consumed or injured by such fire, it shall be
the duty of the fire marshal to institute an enquiry into the cause or origin
of such fire, and whether it was kindled by design or was the result of
negligence or accident, and in so far as the same is practicable, either in
person or by some competent person employed by him for that purpose.

4. The fire marshal shall ex officio possess all the
power, authority and jurisdiction of any judge of ses­sions, recorder or
coroner for all purposes connected with the said enquiry, and shall have power
to summon before him all persons whom he deems capable of giving information or
evidence touching or concerning such fire.

[Page 186]

In 1919, the British Columbia Court of Appeal had to consider the
validity of a provincial Order-in-Council passed under The Public Inquiries
Act (R.S.B.C. 1911, c. 110) directing the enquiry into the importation of
liquor prohibited by an order of the Governor general in council.
The Court was unanimous in holding the Act and the Order-in-Council valid (In
Re Public Inquiries Act: In re Clement[39].
Macdonald C.J.A. said (at pp. 238-240):

... The inquiry in this respect is not I think one connected
with good government, or the conduct of public business, and must be supported,
if at all, as being connected with the administration of justice in the
Province, as that phrase is used in No. 14 of s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act. The
making of the criminal laws of Canada is assigned exclusively to the Dominion,
so is the regula­tion of procedure in criminal matters. ""Criminal mat­ters""
are, in my opinion, proceedings in the criminal Courts, and ""procedure""
means the steps to be taken in prosecutions or other criminal proceedings in
such Courts. The commission in question here is extra-judi­cial. The
commissioner is not a Court, and his proceedings are not proceedings in a
criminal matter, or in any matter in the legal sense of the term. Provincial
legisla­tion authorizing his appointment is therefore not in conflict with the
exclusive legislative authority assigned to the Dominion Parliament by s. 91,
No. 27 of the B.N.A. Act... .

No doubt to concede the power to the Province to make
investigations into breaches of Dominion laws would appear at first blush to be
an anomaly, and it might well be argued that the powers conferred upon the
Province in respect of the administration of justice ought to be interpreted as
conferring merely the duty or obligation to put the machinery of the Courts in
motion, and to take the requisite steps to prosecute persons accused of crime.
That narrow construction would, I think, preclude what has been generally recognised
as one of the functions of government in the administration of justice, namely,
the ferreting out of crime and iden­tification of criminals. There is nothing
novel in com­pelling a witness to give evidence which may tend to incriminate
him.

[Page 187]

In 1938, in Reference re the Adoption Act[40],
Duff C.J. stating the reasons for the answers given by all the judges
who participated in the decision, said (at p. 403):

The responsibility of the state for the care of people in
distress (including neglected children and deserted wives) and for the proper
education and training of youth, rests upon the province; .. .

Moreover, while, as subject matter of legislation, the
criminal law is entrusted to the Dominion Parliament, responsibility for the
administration of justice and, broadly speaking, for the policing of the
country, the execution of the criminal law, the suppression of crime and
disorder, has from the beginning of Confederation been recognized as the
responsibility of the provinces and has been discharged at great cost to the
people; so also, the provinces, sometimes acting directly, sometimes through
the municipalities, have assumed responsibility for controlling social
conditions having a tendency to encourage vice and crime.

Ten years ago, in Batary v. Attorney General for Saskatchewan[41]
this Court had to consider the constitutional validity of a provision in
the Coro­ners’ Act of Saskatchewan purporting to compel a person charged
with murder to testify at an enqui­ry over the death of his alleged victim.
Although the statute provided that such person would, if he objected to answer,
be entitled to the protection afforded by s. 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, this
Court held with a single dissent that the legislation was ineffective in such
situation. The conclusions expressed by Cartwright J. (as he then was) are as
follows (at p. 478):

I think the conclusion inescapable that by enacting s. 15 in
its present form the legislature intended to change the law and to render a
person charged with murder compellable to give evidence at the inquest on the
body of his alleged victim. Such legislation trenches upon the rule expressed
in the maxim nemo tenetur seipsum accusare which has been described (by
Coleridge J. in R. v. Scott, 169 E.R. 909) as ""a maxim of our law
as settled, as important and as wise as almost any other in it."" This rule
has long formed part of the criminal law of England and of this country. With
great respect for the contrary view expressed in the Court of Appeal, I am of

[Page 188]

opinion that any legislation, purporting to make the change
in the law referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph or to abrogate
or alter the existing rules which protect a person charged with crime from
being compelled to testify against himself, is legislation in relation to the
Criminal Law including the Procedure in Criminal Matters and so within the
exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada under head 27 of s.
91 of the British North America Act.

In 1968, the courts of British Columbia were called upon to
decide whether the principle estab­lished in Batary is applicable to a
person who may be, but has not been, charged with an offence under the Criminal
Code. The reluctant witness was the driver of an automobile which collided
with pedestrians. A child was killed in the mishap. At the coroner's inquest,
it was contended that the unfortunate driver was not compellable because he was
a person who might be charged with the commission of an offence related to the
child's death. A writ of prohibition was granted by Munroe J. (R. v. Coroner
of Langley[42]). On
appeal, the writ was quashed it being held that a coroner’s court is not a
criminal court in the sense of a court administering ""the Criminal
Law"" or dealing with ""Criminal Matters"" within the mean­ing of
s. 91 (27) of the B.N.A. Act (Reg. v. McDonald[43]
)

Very recently, a similar question came before this Court in a
case where the person who refused to testify at a coroner’s inquest held under
the Coroners’ Act of Quebec was not a person charged with murder of the
deceased (Faber v. The Queen[44]). The
appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal[45]
affirming the refusal of a writ of prohibition was dismissed. In the Court of
Appeal in the present case, Montgomery J.A. noted that it is only after our
judgment in Faber was rendered that the judgments herein were pro­nounced,
saying:

[Page 189]

At the hearing before this court, it was pointed out that
our court had recently, in the case of Faber v. R., 1969 Q.B. 1017,
confirmed a decision of a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench (Crown Side)
holding that only the Superior Court had jurisdiction to restrain by writ of
prohibition proceedings before a coroner. This decision had been appealed to
the Supreme Court and was then pending. It was decided that it would be
desirable to await the decision of the Supreme Court, which was rendered on
26th March 1975. By a majority of 5 to 4, the Supreme Court confirmed the
decision of this court.

While the question is obviously not free from difficul­ty,
in view of the dissents in the Supreme Court, the fact remains that the
unanimous decision of five judges of this court, holding that only the Superior
Court has a right of supervision and control over a coroner conduct­ing an
inquest under the Coroners Act (115-16 Eliz. II c. 19), has been confirmed by
the Supreme Court. The remaining question is therefore whether there is a dis­tinction
to be made between an inquest under the Coroners Act and an inquiry under the
Police Act. It has not been suggested to us that, for the present purposes,
there is any such distinction, and I see no reason to make one.

I can see no reason for disagreeing with this conclusion. It is
clear that in Faber, as in Coote, the enquiry was essentially
directed to the purpose of finding who was the author of a crime that had been
committed. Before resuming the inquest in Faber, the coroner had earlier
stated the death to be, in his opinion, due to a crime. His open verdict dated
January 8, 1969, read:

[TRANSLATION] That, in my opinion, a crime was com­mitted,
that the facts of that crime are those described above and that an unknown
person or unknown persons should be held responsible. Recommendation to the
Police to investigate further and to file a report at the proper time.

It is at the resumption of the inquest, some two months later,
that Faber was for the last time, committed for contempt in refusing to
testify. Thereupon he applied for a writ of prohibition to the Court of Queen's
Bench, Crown side. In the reasons for the majority of this Court upholding the
denial of the writ, the following pronouncement by Bull J.A. in McDonald (at
p. 305) was quoted and adopted:

[Page 190]

I therefore conclude that the very nature of the inquiry held by
the Coroner in Canada, which is not a trial and at which there is no party or
person accused and the function of which is to investigate many other matters
than to find that murder or manslaughter has been committed, is such that this
Court cannot fairly be said to be a 'Court of Criminal Jurisdiction' whose
proce­dures before such a verdict, if any, are with respect to 'Criminal
Matters' or 'criminal law' in order to come under the exclusive authority of
Parliament.

Similarly, the following opinion expressed by McFarlane J.A. (at
p. 308) following a quotation from Wolfe v. Robinson[46]
was also quoted and endorsed:

To this apt description I would add that that at a Coroner's
inquest, under the Act, there is no lis, no accused and no charge. The
statute does not purport to confer jurisdiction to try any person accused of
any wrongful act, to acquit, convict or punish. Where the jury's verdict is
that the deceased came to his death by murder or manslaughter their inquisition
shall certify the persons (if any) guilty of the murder or man-slaughter or of
being accessories before the fact of such murder (s. 15). This is an incidental
or ancillary func­tion and does not of itself set the criminal law in motion.
Coroners are also required to hold inquests in many cases where there is no
suggestion or suspicion of wrong-doing. It may be said fairly that one of the
salutary results of inquests is to allay suspicions and remove doubts.

In my opinion the legislation in its pith and substance is
enacted in relation to the administration of justice in the Province, thus
being within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Province under head
14 of s. 92.

It must be observed that in Faber, the only question
considered in the Court of Appeal and in this Court was the jurisdiction of the
Court of Queen’s Bench, Crown side. The conclusion affirmed by the majority in
this Court was that the coroner’s inquest is not ""a procedure in a
criminal matter"". This was said in a case where, after an open verdict of
death due to a crime by a person or persons unknown, the coroner resumed
the inquest for the sole purpose of ascertaining who might be

[Page 191]

charged with such crime. This could not be con­sidered incidental
only, the only reason for the continuation of the enquiry was the gathering of
evidence which would make it possible for the coroner to render a further
verdict alleging that a named person had committed murder or man-slaughter,
whereupon it would become the coron­er's duty, under s. 462 of the Criminal
Code, to direct that such person be taken into custody or enter into a
recognizance to appear before a jus­tice. If an inquest carried out with a view
to such a consequence can be said not to be a ""procedure in a criminal
matter"", it appears to me that the same must a fortiori be said of
an enquiry in conclusion of which no more can be done than the making of a
report to the provincial attorney general who may then, either have charges
laid or take the exceptional step of laying a preferred indictment.

That in many cases a coroner's inquest is not concerned with any
criminal aspect may be of some importance in considering the general character
of the office of coroner and of the procedure at inquests. It cannot, however,
be a material consideration in appreciating the nature of the conclusion
reached in Faber. What was there sub­mitted by the appellant, as by the
present appel­lants, was essentially that the matter was one coming within the
description of ""procedure in a criminal matter"" because it was an
enquiry into allegedly criminal activities. If it must be said that such an
enquiry prior to any charge being laid under the Criminal Code comes
within the description of ""Administration of Justice in the
Province"", not of ""Procedure in a Criminal Mat-ter"", I cannot
appreciate how one may take a different view where the object of the enquiry,
instead of being the gathering of information suffi­cient to lay a charge for
criminally causing the death of a person, is the gathering of information
identifying persons engaged in organized crime and describing their activities.

Thus, although the constitutional question was not raised in Faber,
the decision rendered on

[Page 192]

forensic jurisdiction is equally conclusive on the constitutional
issue because the division of jurisdiction between the Court of Queen's Bench,
Crown side, and the Superior Court of the Prov­ince of Quebec follows the
constitutional division of authority between ""Criminal Law and Proce­dure
in Criminal Matters"" and all other matters. It is now firmly established
that extraordinary remedies by habeas corpus, certiorari and prohibi­tion
are to be classified from every jurisdictional point of view in this same way
by reference to the matter to which they relate (Minister of National
Revenue v. Lafleur[47];
In re Storgoff[48]).

In my view, the decision in Faber is conclusive against
appellants’ contention that the matter is ""criminal"" because the
enquiry was concerned with criminal activities. It is obvious that, in s.
91(27) B.N.A. Act, the scope of ""Criminal Law"" and
""Procedure in Criminal Matters"" is narrowed by the allocation to the
provinces of jurisdiction over the ""Administration of Justice"" in all
matters civil and criminal, which has consistently been held to include the
detection of criminal activities. The judgment in Batary shows that once
a charge is laid under the Criminal Code an accused may be said to be
subject to criminal proceedings, but Faber and the other cases cited
show that a person who is merely exposed to a charge is not in the same
situation. The conclusion reached in Faber cannot be viewed as proceeding
on the basis that the detection of crime was not the principal object of the
coroner's inquest. The fact is that this was the sole object of the inquest at
the particular time when the proceedings were initiated.

Appellants contended that if they were com­pelled to testify at
the enquiry, they would not have the benefit of the protection contemplated in
the Canada Evidence Act (R.S.C. c. E-10) because s. 2 under the heading
""PART I, Application"", reads:

[Page 193]

2. This Part applies to all criminal proceedings, and all
civil proceedings and other matters whatever respect­ing which the Parliament
of Canada has jurisdiction in this behalf.

Little need be said against this submission beyond quoting the
section granting the protection, namely, s. 5:

5. (1) No witness shall be excused from answering any
question upon the ground that the answer to such question may tend to criminate
him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the
instance of the Crown or of any person.

(2) Where with respect to any question a witness objects to
answer upon the ground that his answer may tend to criminate him, or may tend
to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown
or of any person, and if but for this Act, or the Act of any provincial
legislature, the witness would therefore have been excused from answering such
ques­tion, then although the witness is by reason of this Act, or by reason of
such provincial Act, compelled to answer, the answer so given shall not be used
or receiv­able in evidence against him in any criminal trial, or other criminal
proceeding against him thereafter taking place, other than a prosecution for
perjury in the giving of such evidence.

It would be absurd to suppose that when Parlia­ment, in subs. 2,
made reference to the ""Act of any provincial legislature"", it
intended that those words be devoid of any application. They can be given full
meaning without doing violence to the wording of s. 2; it is only necessary to
construe it as meaning that the application of Part I is intended to control
the admissibility of evidence only in matters of federal jurisdiction.

Furthermore, it should be noted that the refer­ence to provincial
legislation in s. 5 was introduced in 1901 that is after s. 2 which dates from
1893. If there was any conflict, s. 5 would therefore govern. However, a look
at the legislation as originally enacted shows that the intention was
completely unequivocal. Section 5 as re-enacted in 1898 (61 Vict., c. 53) read:

5. No witness shall be excused from answering any question
upon the ground that the answer to such ques­tion may tend to criminate him, or
may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of
the

[Page 194]

Crown or of any person; provided, however, that if with
respect to any question the witness objects to answer upon the ground that his
answer may tend to criminate him or may tend to establish his liability to a
civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person, and if but for
this section the witness would therefore have been excused from answering such
ques­tion, then, although the witness shall be compelled to answer yet the
answer so given shall not be used or receivable in evidence against him in any
criminal trial or other criminal proceeding against him thereafter taking place
other than a prosecution for perjury in giving such evidence.

The provision making this rule applicable to the case where a
witness was compelled to answer by virtue of provincial legislation was
originally enacted as follows by c. 36 of the statutes of 1901:

1. Section 5 of The Canada Evidence Act, 1893, as
that section is enacted by chapter 53 of the statutes of 1898, is hereby
amended by adding thereto the following subsection:

2. The proviso to subsection 1 of this section shall in like
manner apply to the answer of a witness to any question which pursuant to an
enactment of the legisla­ture of a province such witness is compelled to answer
after having objected so to do upon any ground men­tioned in the said
subsection, and which, but for that enactment, he would upon such ground have
been excused from answering.

The appellants also submitted that the matter was
""criminal"" because they were sentenced to a year in jail. On this
point, it should be noted first that provincial legislatures are empowered to
inflict punishment by fine or imprisonment for violation of provincial laws,
Such punishment is unrestricted and is not ""criminal"" in the constitu­tional
sense (Canadian Pacific Wine Co. v. Tuley[49]). In
the present case, the sentence was explicitly based on provincial enactments,
namely: the Order-in-Council directing the inquiry, the Police Act (Statutes
of Quebec 1968, c. 17), the Public Inquiry Commission Act (R.S.Q. 1964,
c. 11), and the Code of Civil Procedure, arts. 49-54. It is immaterial
that there are provisions in the Criminal Code respecting criminal
contempt of court. Even if these provisions were susceptible of

[Page 195]

application, it is clear in the present case that they have not
been applied. The sentences passed against the appellants are based exclusively
on enactments of the provincial legislature and they cannot possibly be
supported by reference to Criminal Code provisions because the tribunal
that passed those sentences does not have jurisdic­tion under the Criminal
Code.

Thus, the situation is completely unlike that which obtained in Re
Poje[50]. In
that case, civil proceedings for an injunction and other relief had been
settled and the plaintiff had agreed to aban­don its application for contempt
by violation of the injunction. It was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
of British Columbia who, being a judge of a superior court of general
jurisdiction civil and criminal, decided to enquire into the contempt and to
punish the guilty parties. Under those circum­stances, this Court held that
those proceedings were to be considered as proceedings for a criminal contempt
and as purely punitive. In the present case, the proceedings before the Police
Commis­sion were not completed but continuing when the appellants were
sentenced and the appellants' com­mitment was coercive not punitive. It was
ordered under art. 51 of the Code of Civil Procedure which reads:

51. Except where otherwise provided, anyone who is guilty of
contempt of court is liable to a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars or to
imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year.

Imprisonment for refusal to obey any process or order may be
repeatedly inflicted until the person condemned obeys.

Although this is not explicitly stated in the Code, it
appears to me that the principle enunciated by Vaughan Williams J. in Re
Armstrong[51], (cited
in Poje, at p. 518) would be applicable and the imprisonment would
determine ex debito justitiae as soon as the person committed yielded
obedience to the order of the tribunal, just as it could be

[Page 196]

inflicted again and again if the contempt was persisted in.

This does not mean that the appellants would be without redress
if the legislation was unconstitu­tional as they contend, but, because they
were committed under provincial legislation, such pro­vincial legislation, even
when it deals with the infliction of penalties by fine or imprisonment, is not
""criminal"" in the constitutional sense nor in the sense in which the
jurisdiction of courts is defined in the Criminal Code. As is established
by the judgment in Canadian Pacific Wine Co. v. Tuley, the procedure in
respect of the infliction of such penalties falls within the scope of
""Procedure in Civil Matters"" before provincial courts that is to say,
within provincial jurisdiction. Assuming the provincial legislation was
constitutionally invalid because it really dealt with a criminal matter, it
would nevertheless be for the provincial court of civil jurisdiction to declare
it invalid as was held in Birks v. City of Montreal[52]
and Switzman v. Elbling[53]. A
provincial statute can never be a criminal law in the constitutional sense. If,
in fact, it deals with criminal law, it is totally void and is no law at all.
Therefore, the appellants are not restrained of their liberty for ""some
criminal or supposed criminal matter"" and their remedy by habeas corpus
is before the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec under art. 851 of
the Code of Civil Procedure:

851. Any person who is confined or otherwise restrained of
his liberty except under an order in civil matters granted by a court or a
judge having jurisdic­tion, or for some criminal or supposed criminal matter,
or any other person on his behalf, may apply to a judge of the Superior Court
to obtain a writ of habeas corpus ordering the person under whose custody he is
detained to bring him forthwith before a judge of the court and to show the
cause of his detention, so that it may be decided whether such detention is
justified.

The demand is made by motion supported by an affidavit
affirming the truth of the facts on which it is based.

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 197]

Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ. con­curred with reasons
delivered by

DICKSON J.—

I

This appeal, in my opinion, must be dismissed, essentially for
two reasons. First, I cannot sub-scribe to the view that administration of
criminal justice is for Parliament alone to prescribe. Section 92(14) of the British
North America Act, 1867 gives the provinces power over ""Administration
of Justice within the Province."" To confine the mean­ing of
""Justice"" to civil justice alone is to give to s. 92(14) a strained
and truncated effect at war with the plain words of the section and with what
would appear to have been the clear intent of the Fathers of Confederation.
Secondly, as to the contempt power, from earliest times coroners inquiring into
deaths occurring from other than natural causes, fire marshals inquiring into
mysterious fires and countless commissioners holding public inquiries pursuant
to federal or provincial Public Inquiries Acts have had power to summon
witnesses, to require them to give evidence on oath and to punish them for
contempt for refusal to be sworn. The Quebec Inquiry Commission into Organized
Crime has the same powers, no more and no less. There is nothing in the record
to sustain the view that in the exercise of those powers the Inquiry Commission
has acted in any way differently from coroners, fire marshals or commissioners
holding public inquiries in the past.

This case arises out of the Quebec Inquiry into Organized Crime
established in 1972 pursuant to the Police Act, S.Q. 1968, c. 17.
Section 19 of that Act requires the Quebec Police Commission to make an
inquiry, whenever requested to do so by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council,
respecting any aspect of crime. The section also makes provi­sion for an
inquiry into the activities of an organi­zation or system, its ramifications
and the persons involved, to the extent prescribed, whenever there is reason to
believe that in the fight against organized

[Page 198]

crime or terrorism and subversion it is in the public interest to
order such an inquiry.

The Inquiry was established by Order in Coun­cil No. 2821/72,
dated September 27, 1972, the relevant portions of which read:

[TRANSLATION] Upon the recommendation of the Minister of
Justice and Attorney General, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:

THAT in the fight against organized crime, the Quebec Police
Commission shall make an inquiry into the activities of any organizations or
systems, including their ramifications and the persons involved, where such
organizations or systems operate in illegal gaming and betting, usurious loans
practices (shylocking), extortion, illegal trafficking in drugs and narcotics,
counterfeiting, commercial fraud, fraudulent bankruptcies, arson, fraudulent
stock manipulation or promotion, fraudulent dealings of corporations, illegal
pressure on businessmen or officers or members of associations or corporations
to control them or to extort from them money or property, theft of bonds, theft
of stamps and precious metals, theft and dismantling of automobiles, sale of
stolen goods, prostitution, illegal stills and distribution of adulterated
liquor, illegal consumers exploitation, blackmail, intimi­dation and corruption,
and illegal or fraudulent obten­tion of any permits issued by or decisions made
by any public body.

THAT the Quebec Police Commission shall submit to the
Attorney General, on or before December 31, 1975, ""the written report
setting forth the findings"" which it will have made, and that the
Commission shall be authorized to submit, in its discretion, to the Attorney
General, written reports whenever the Commission deems it appropriate.

The immediate question is whether s. 19 of the Police Act and
the Order in Council are beyond the constitutional competence of the Province
of Quebec to enact. At issue also is a question of more profound implication,
namely, whether the conduct of inquiries, unconnected with specific criminal
proceedings, into the state of public order within a province is beyond the
competence of provincial authority.

[Page 199]

In each province, the Legislature may ""exclu­sively""
make laws in relation to the ""Administra­tion of Justice in the
Province."" Section 92(14) of the British North America Act, 1867, in
part so provides. This plenary power is plainly very wide, but subtracted therefrom,
by s. 91(27), in favour of federal authority, is ""The Criminal Law, except
the Constitution of the Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction, but including the
Procedure in Criminal Matters"".

The scheme of the Act under ss. 91(27) and 92(14)
contemplates that jurisdiction over the Administration of Justice in a Province
will remain with the provinces; the provinces are invested with a plenitude of
powers in this area but subject to the reservation of criminal law and
procedure as an exception to the general principle.

Establishment of provincial superior, district or county courts
is a co-operative matter between federal and provincial authority. Section
92(14), which gives the provinces exclusive legislative power over ""The
Administration of Justice in the Province"", continues ""including the
Constitution, Maintenance and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of civil
and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those
Courts."" Section 96 provides for the appointment by the Governor General
of the Judges of the Superior, District and County Courts in each Province.
Thus procedure in criminal matters rests with the federal authority whereas,
generally speaking, procedure in civil matters in provincial courts, as well as
the constitution, maintenance and organization of these courts, falls under pro­vincial
jurisdiction.

The question in the present case is whether the words ""The
Administration of Justice in the Prov­ince"" are to be given a fair, large
and liberal construction or, whether by reason of the abstrac­tion of criminal
law and criminal procedure, they must receive such attenuated interpretation as
would confine ""administration of justice"" to noth­ing more than
""administration of civil justice"". In my opinion, Canadian
legislative history, as well as the development of legal institutions within
the Provinces since Confederation, favour the broader

[Page 200]

construction as do, by and large, the authorities, admittedly few
in number, which touch upon the subject under consideration.

II

Since Confederation, the provincial departments of the Attorney
General have in practice ""adminis­tered justice"" in the broadest
sense, at great expense to the taxpayers, and irrespective of whether the laws
being administered fell legisla­tively within the purview of provincial
legislatures or the federal Parliament. This is reflected in the provision of
police services and other enforcement agencies responsible to the provincial
Attorneys General for the investigation, detection and control of crime within
the respective provinces and in the maintenance of staffs for the prosecution
of all types of infractions whether within the purview of provincial
legislatures or the federal Parliament. In this way the provinces have
perpetuated since Confederation the comprehensive powers in the administration
of justice which they enjoyed and exercised in pre-Confederation times and
which the framers of the B.N.A. Act would seem to have intended them to
continue to have. Explaining the British North America Bill in the British
Parlia­ment, the Earl of Carnarvon stated on February 19, 1867:

To the Central Parliament will also be assigned the
enactment of criminal law. The administration of it indeed is vested in the
local authorities; but the power of general legislation is very properly
reserved for the Central Parliament.

It is a well-recognized rule of construction that if words in a
statute are fairly susceptible of two constructions of which one will result in
the statute being intra vires and the other will have the con­trary
result the former is to be adopted: McKay et al. v. The Queen[54],
at p. 804. We should not lightly decide that enabling legislation is beyond
the constitutional competence of the enacting body.

The fight against organized crime has been a responsibility of
the law enforcement agencies of the Province of Quebec. Although the tentacles
of organized crime reach far beyond provincial or

[Page 201]

even national boundaries, the Inquiry is bona fide directed
against acts done within the Province of Quebec where escalating levels of
crime and vio­lence have taken an increasing toll of lives and property.

The Inquiry by its terms is directed into the activities of
organizations and systems and to the ramifications of those organizations and
systems and the persons involved, to the extent that those organizations or
systems operate in areas notori­ously inviting to organized crime, such as
illegal gambling, extortion, shylocking, drug traffic, pros­titution and
corruption.

The Inquiry does not act as a criminal court or exercise criminal
jurisdiction. The conduct of the Inquiry is not part of a criminal prosecution
under the Criminal Code nor is it an investigation into a particular
crime or transaction which later might be the subject of a criminal charge. We
are not here concerned with a criminal trial, structured as a dispute between
two sides, the Crown and the accused. The function of the Inquiry is merely to
investigate and report; no person is accused; those who appear do so as
witnesses; there is no lis; there is no attempt to alter criminal
procedure. The proceedings of the Commission are not criminal proceedings in
the sense that punishment is their aim. The legislation under attack
establishes an inquiry into the nature and prevalence of certain types of
illegal conduct within the Province of Quebec but does not seek to create new
crimes or to alter old ones.

III

There is nothing new in a province setting up a body to enquire
into matters connected with the public business, with the power of summoning
witnesses and compelling those witnesses to give evidence on oath and to
produce such documents as might be requisite. In the Statutes of the Prov­ince
of Canada (1846), 9 Viet., c. 38 one finds just such legislation. The striking
similarity between

[Page 202]

that Act and the legislation by which the Province of Quebec
established the Inquiry into Organized Crime warrants recital of the 1846 Act:

Whereas it frequently becomes necessary for the Executive
Government to institute inquiries on certain matters connected with the good
government of this Province; And whereas the power of procuring evidence under
oath in such cases would greatly tend to the public advantage as well as to
afford protection to Her Majesty's subjects from false and malicious testimony
or representations: Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's Most Excellent
Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council and of
the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, constituted and assembled
by virtue of and under the authority of an Act passed in the Parliament of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and intituled, An Act to
re-unite the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, and for the Government of
Canada, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same, That
whenever the Gover­nor, Lieutenant Governor or person administering the
Government of this Province, acting by and with the advice of the Executive
Council thereof, shall cause injury to be made into and concerning any matter
connected with the good government of this Province, or the conduct of any part
of the public business thereof, or the administration of justice therein,
and such inquiry shall not be regulated by any special Act, it shall be lawful
for the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, or person administering the Government
as aforesaid, by the Commission to confer upon the Commissioners or per-sons by
whom such inquiry is to be conducted, the power of summoning before them any
party or witnesses, and of requiring them to give evidence on oath, orally
or in writing, (or on solemn affirmation if they be parties entitled to affirm
in civil matters), and to produce such documents and things, as such
Commissioners shall deem requisite to the full investigation of the matters
into which they are appointed to examine, and the Commissioner shall then have
the same power to enforce the attendance of such witnesses and to compel
them to give evidence, as is vested in any Court of Law in civil cases; And
any wilfully false statement made by any such witness on oath or solemn
affirmation, shall be a misdemeanor punishable in the same manner as wilful and
corrupt perjury: Provided always, that no such party or witness shall be
compelled to answer any question, by his answer to which he might render
himself liable to a criminal prosecution. (Emphasis added.)

It will be noted (1) that the Inquiry for which the 1846 Act provides
is directed to ""any matter

[Page 203]

connected with the good government of this prov­ince or the
conduct of any part of the public business thereof or the administration of
justice therein."" At that epoch, the distribution of legisla­tive powers
was not an issue, but the use of the phrase ""administration of
justice"" is significant as obviously embracing much more than mere estab­lishment
of, or regulation of proceedings in, the Courts. (2) The concluding sentence of
the Act allays a concern expressed in the present case, that a compelled answer
might render the witness liable to criminal prosecution. I shall advert to this
later. I wish at the moment only to emphasize that many early statutes of
Canada dealt with Administration of Justice, in connection with both civil and
crimi­nal matters. Reference to some of these will be found in the judgment of
the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Pelletier[55],
at p. 684: (1843), 7 Vict., c. 16; (1846), 9 Vict., c. 29; (1853), 16 Vict.,
c. 176; (1857), 20 Vict., c. 60; (1860), 23 Vict., c. 57.

An Act respecting Inquiries concerning Public Matters and
Official Notices, Consolidated Stat­utes of Canada, 1859, 22 Vict., c. 13,
a pre-Confederation statute, empowered the Governor in Council to make
inquiries concerning ""any matter connected with the good government of
this Prov­ince, or the conduct of any part of the public business thereof, or
the administration of justice therein"". The legislative history of The
Inquiries Act of Canada indicates that the Governor Gener­al in Council
following Confederation continued to have the power to cause inquiries to be
made, but no longer the power to order inquiries into matters connected with
the administration of justice. During the year following Confederation, an Act
respecting Inquiries concerning Public Matters, S.C. 1868, 31 Vict., c. 38,
was enacted which empowered the Governor in Council to cause inquiry to be made
concerning ""any matters con­nected with the good government of Canada, or
the conduct of any part of the Public business thereof', the words ""or the
administration of jus­tice therein"" appearing in the earlier acts having
been dropped. The same limited phraseology is to

[Page 204]

be found in the federal Inquiries Acts of 1886, 1906, 1927, 1952
and in the present Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-13.

Before Confederation, the Provinces exercised untrammeled powers
in respect of the Administra­tion of Justice, both civil and criminal. The
preamble to the Quebec Act 1774 refers to Ordi­nances ""relative to
Civil Government and Administration of Justice in the said Province."" That
Act provided also that the criminal law of England, of course then uncodified,
would be observed as law in the Province of Quebec. Follow­ing Confederation,
criminal law and criminal procedure fell under federal power but ""justice""
continued to mean ""criminal justice"" as well as ""civil justice.""

Provincial Public Inquiries Acts since Confed­eration have
reserved to the provincial authority the power to order inquiries into matters
connected with the Administration of Justice in the Provinces and associated
therewith the power to compel wit­nesses to give evidence under oath.

If it had been the intention of the Parliament at Westminster to
confine ""administration of justice"" in s. 92(14) to establishment and
constitution of courts it would have been a simple matter to have used the
language which that Parliament had adopted two years earlier in the Colonial
Laws Validity Act (1865), 28-29 Viet., c. 63, s. 5.:

Every Colonial Legislature shall have, and be deemed at all
Times to have had, full power within its Jurisdic­tion to establish Courts of
Judicature, and to abolish and reconstruct the same, and to alter the
Constitution thereof, and to make provision for the Administration of Justice
therein . .

We would do well to compare that language with the language of s.
92(14).

The words ""administration of justice"" in s. 92(14) are
intended to have wide meaning. They include, but are not limited to, the
constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts of civil and
criminal jurisdiction and they include procedure in civil matters. Any
interpretation

[Page 205]

which would limit s. 92(14) to the setting up of the courts
ignores the plain meaning of the words in the section and the plain meaning of
the order in which those words appear as well as history and legislative
intent. The use of the word ""including"" in s. 92(14) is no more
intended to confine the ""Administration of Justice"" to ""the
constitution, maintenance and organization of the Courts"" than the use of
the same word ""including"" in s. 91(27) is intended to limit ""The
Criminal Law"" to ""procedure in criminal matters."" As Mr. Justice
Estey observed in R. v. Pelletier, supra, at p. 685, the words following
""including"" in s. 92(14) seek to amplify rather than restrict.

IV

Both the federal and provincial governments have accepted for
over a century the status of the provincial governments to administer criminal
jus­tice within their respective boundaries. The provin­cial mandate in that
field has consistently been recognized as part and parcel of the responsibility
of a provincial government for public order within the province.

Under head 92(14) of our Constitution, as I understand it, law
enforcement is primarily the responsibility of the Province and in all
provinces the Attorney General is the chief law enforcement officer of the
Crown. He has broad responsibilities for most aspects of the Administration of
Justice. Among these within the field of criminal justice, are the court
system, the police, criminal investiga­tion and prosecutions, and corrections.
The provin­cial police are answerable only to the Attorney General as are the
provincial Crown Attorneys who conduct the great majority of criminal pros­ecutions
in Canada.

At the federal level one finds a prosecution service answerable
to the Attorney General of Canada, but s. 2 of the Criminal Code, defining
""Attorney General"", limits the authority of such service to the
Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory and to proceedings instituted at
the instance of the Government of Canada in respect of a violation of any act
or regulation of

[Page 206]

the Parliament of Canada other than the Criminal Code. Tremeear
(1964-1975 Supplement) and Crankshaw (1959-1971 Permanent
Supplement) both speak of the ""broadening"" in the role of the
Attorney General of Canada reflected in the re-enactment of this definition in 1968-69,
c. 38, s. 2(1). It is also interesting to observe that the learned author
of Tremeear (6th ed. p. 14) refers to the position of the Attorney
General of Canada in these words:

Since the statement in R. v. St. Louis (1897), 6 Que.
Q.B. 389, 1 C.C.C. 141 by the late Mr. Justice Wurtele:

As the conduct or supervision of criminal prosecutions
before the Courts devolves upon the provincial law officers, the Attorney General
of Canada has no ministerial duties or official legal functions to perform in
that connection, and consequently, when he, with the consent of a judge or
under an order of the Court, prefers a bill of indictment, and conducts a
prosecu­tion before the petit jury in which the Government of the Dominion is
interested he occupies a position which is analogous to that of a private
prosecutor,

the Attorney General of Canada has been given explicit
status in Code ss. 54, 100, 229, 420, 601, 679, 720, 724 and 743.

It seems late in the day to strip the provinces of jurisdiction
in respect of criminal justice which they have exercised without challenge for
well over one hundred years. That is not to say that jurisdic­tion in the
strict sense can come through consent or laches; however, history and
governmental atti­tudes can be helpful guides to interpretation. As Lord Atkin
said in Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. A-G. Can.[56],
at 317:

Both the Act and the section have a legislative histo­ry,
which is relevant to the discussion. Their Lordships entertain no doubt that
time alone will not validate an Act which when challenged is found to be ultra
vires; nor will a history of a gradual series of advances till this
boundary is finally crossed avail to protect the ultimate encroachment. But one
of the questions to be considered is always whether in substance the
legislation falls within an enumerated class of subject, or whether on the
contrary in the guise of an enumerated class it is an encroachment on an excluded
class. On this issue the

[Page 207]

legislative history may have evidential value. V

Implicit in the grant to the provinces of exclu­sive
legislative authority in respect of Administra­tion of Justice and in
the grant to the federal government of exclusive legislative authority in
respect of criminal law and procedure is an acceptance of a certain degree of
overlapping. One should not expect to be able to draw a fine line between the
two heads of power nor should one attempt to do so. Time and again the courts
have given effect to what was said by Duff C.J. in Reference re Validity of
the Combines Investiga­tion Act and of s. 498 of the Criminal Code[57],
at p. 413:

Matters, however, which in one aspect and for one purpose
fall within the jurisdiction of a province over the subjects designated by one
or more of the heads of s. 92, may in another aspect and for another purpose,
be proper subjects of legislation under s. 91, and in particu­lar under head 27.

Thus, a matter which for some purpose may fall within the scope
of the federal power over criminal law and criminal procedure may also fall
within the legitimate concern of the provinces as pertain­ing to the
Administration of Justice. An argument has been advanced to the effect that if
a province can inquire into what is said to be criminal law, it could equally
inquire into other fields of exclusive federal jurisdiction such as banking or
postal service or penitentiaries. In these proceedings, it is unnecessary to
express any concluded view on the right of a provincial government to inquire
into some subject of local concern, other than criminal law, touching upon one
of the subjects of exclusive federal authority. It should not, however, be
over-looked that a provincial inquiry into some aspect of exclusive federal
power, such as banking, may not be on the same footing as an inquiry into some
aspect of criminal activity, for in the latter inquiry the Province has a
special source of exclusive power, administration of justice, upon which it can

[Page 208]

draw, which may not be available to it in other inquiries.

VI

The Order in Council establishing the Commis­sion of Inquiry
requires the Commission only to inquire and report to the Attorney General. The
action taken will rest with the Attorney General. It could take the form of
establishing new and differ­ent techniques or organization within the bodies
charged with law enforcement. It could take the form of prosecutions, subject
to the protection afforded witnesses by the Canada Evidence Act. Changes
to the Police Act or other provincial legislation might be required in
which the provin­cial government could act within its constitutional capacity.
A provincial commission of inquiry, inquiring into any subject, might
submit a report in which it appeared that changes in federal laws would be
desirable. There is nothing novel in this. Changes to the Criminal Code might
seem war-ranted in which event one would expect the Attor­ney General to act in
liaison with the federal government, as is done daily. There are only two
questions to engage our attention: (1) Is the estab­lishment of the Inquiry
within the constitutional competence of the Province of Quebec? (2) Are the
constitutional rights against self-incrimination of any witness appearing
before the Inquiry infringed or likely to be infringed? The wisdom of the
Inquiry is not our concern. The novelty of the approach taken by the Province
does not affect constitutional validity and the approach taken was no doubt
considered by the Legislature of the Province of Quebec to be warranted to meet
the new and malign menace presented by organized crime.

VII

The phrase ""criminal procedure"" does not lend itself to
precise definition. In one sense, it is concerned

[Page 209]

with proceedings in the criminal courts and such matters as
conduct within the courtroom, the competency of witnesses, oaths and
affirmations, and the presentation of evidence. Some cases have defined
procedure even more narrowly in finding that it embraces the three technical
terms—plead­ing, evidence and practice. In a broad sense, it encompasses such
things as the rules by which, according to the Criminal Code, police
powers are exercised, the right to counsel, search warrants, interim release,
procuring attendance of witnesses.

The words of Mr. Justice Taschereau, as he then was, in A. G.
Que. v. A. G. Can.[58], at
p. 603 would suggest that the narrow construction is the more appropriate:

The power given to the federal Parliament to legislate in
criminal law and criminal procedure is the power to determine what shall or
what shall not be ""criminal"", and to determine the steps to be taken
in prosecutions and other criminal proceedings before the courts.""

Macdonald, C.J.A. in In re Public Inquiries Act: In re Clement[59],
at p. 117 wrote to the same effect:

The making of the criminal laws of Canada is assigned
exclusively to the Dominion, so is the regula­tion of procedure in criminal
matters. ""Criminal mat­ters"" are, in my opinion, proceedings in the
criminal Courts, and ""procedure"" means the steps to be taken in
prosecutions or other criminal proceedings in such Courts.

It is not necessary and perhaps impossible, to find a
satisfactory definition of ""criminal proce­dure."" Although I would
reject the view which would confine criminal procedure to that which takes
place within the courtroom on a prosecution, I am equally of the opinion that
""criminal proce­dure"" is not co-extensive with ""criminal
justice"" or that the phrase ""criminal procedure"" as used in the B.N.A.
Act can drain from the words ""administration of justice"" in s.
92(14) that which

[Page 210]

gives those words much of their substance—the element of
""criminal justice.""

The courts have long distinguished between procedure and
substantive law, and it would be wrong to take the form for the substance.

It would also seem that a valid distinction can be made between
criminal procedure and an inqui­ry into criminal acts. What is in issue here is
an inquiry into specific matters encompassed by the term, Administration of
Justice in the Province. The Inquiry possesses purposes and functions which are
separate and distinct from the proce­dures which accompany the investigation
and pros­ecution in a criminal matter. Accepting that police investigation of
an individual must comply with federal standards of criminal procedure, it is
not immediately apparent why an investigative over-view of crime on a
collective basis should be open to constitutional attack.

It has been argued that ""Administration of Jus­tice""
relates only to administration in respect of heads of exclusive provincial
power. I cannot accept that view. The phrase ""administration of
justice"" is free standing and an independent source of provincial power
which would be shorn of mean­ing if reliance had to be placed always on some
other head of power to give it effect.

VIII

None of the cases to which the Court has been referred save In
re Public Inquiries Act: In re Clement, supra, touches directly upon the
consti­tutional question which we face. Practically all of the cases can be
distinguished for one reason or another, but several of those cited are helpful
as reflecting the opinions held by jurists in the past as to the scope of the
criminal law power or the Administration of Justice power. The first in time is
R. v. Coote[60] in
which the Privy Council held to be intra vires provincial legislation
empowering provincially appointed Fire Commissioners to compel the attendance
of witnesses, to examine

[Page 211]

witnesses under oath, and to commit to prison any witness
refusing to answer without just cause.

It has been said that the Privy Council was mistaken in stating
that all members of the Court from which the appeal was taken, the Court of
Queen's Bench for the Province of Quebec, held that the constitution of the
Court of the Fire Marshal was within the competency of the provin­cial
Legislature. Even if the Board erred in this view, the important thing is that
the Board enter­tained no doubt as to the provincial competence to enact the
impugned legislation.

In one of the early cases, In re Prohibitory Liquor Laws[61],
Mr. Justice Sedgewick considered the jurisdictional basis of the right or
duty of maintaining peace and order and of seeing that law, whether of federal
or local origin, was enforced and obeyed. The learned judge is reported as
having said, at p. 248:

But it is argued that what is called ""the police
power"" is possessed by the provinces under ""municipal institu­tions"",
and that the right in question is a mere incident of the ""police
power"". Now, if by ""police power"" is meant the right or duty of
maintaining peace and order and of seeing that law, all law whether of
imperial, federal or local origin is enforced and obeyed, then I agree that
that power is wholly with the provinces. But it is with them, however, not
because it specially belongs to ""municipal institutions"" but because
they are charged with the ""administration of justice."" The
legislatures may delegate this duty to municipal functionaries, but the mode of
administration is purely a matter of provin­cial concern.

I can find little of assistance in Valin v. Langlois[62].
The issue in that case was the capacity of the federal Parliament to confer
authority on provincial Superior Courts and the judges thereof to try controverted
elections of Members of the House of Commons. In coming to the unanimous
decision that the statute was intra vires, the judges of the Supreme
Court of Canada considered inter alla the scope of s. 92(14) of the B.N.A.
Act. They

[Page 212]

were agreed that the provincial authority to legislate with
regard to the administration of justice and civil procedure did not derogate
from federal power to legislate regarding procedure in matters over which it
had exclusive legislative jurisdiction. (See Ritchie C.J. at pp. 15 & 22;
Henry J. at p. 67; Taschereau J. at p. 81). Parliament thus has the power to
legislate regarding procedure in mat­ters over which it has exclusive
jurisdiction, such as criminal law (although that power is specified in s.
91(27) regarding criminal procedure) and bankruptcy. Such a holding does not
affect the present case unless the Crime Inquiry is character­ized as a matter
of criminal law or criminal proce­dure-the very issue in controversy.

The appellants argue that ""criminal law"" must be
interpreted in its ""widest sense"" adopting those words from the decision
of the Privy Council in A.G. Ont. v. Hamilton Street Railway Company[63],
at p. 529. It would be well, however, to recall that Duff J., in Reference
re Validity of Combines Investigation Act and of s. 498 of the Criminal Code[64],
stated at p. 411 after commenting upon the Hamilton Street Railway
Company judgment:

Nevertheless, some limitation upon the general words of s.
91(27) is necessarily implied by (I) the fact itself that co-ordinate exclusive
authority in respect of a varie­ty of subjects is vested in the provincial
legislatures, and executive authority of the same order in the provincial
governments, and (2) character of the enactments of s. 92.

Reliance is also placed by appellants on a statement of Locke J.
in Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. The Queen[65],
at p. 308.

The power to legislate in relation to criminal law is not
restricted, in my opinion, to defining offences and providing penalties for
their commission. The power of Parliament extends to legislation designed for
the pre­vention of crime as well as to punishing crime.

While Locke J. does say that the federal government has powers to
prevent crime, his words must

[Page 213]

be read in context. The issue was the power to create prohibitory
orders under the Combines Investigation Act to prevent repeated
violations. The issue was not crime investigation.

The respondent and provincial intervenants can equally cite
Supreme Court authorities for provin­cial authority to legislate to prevent
crime. The provincial authority, derived from s. 92(14), over policing and the
suppression of crime, was the subject of comment by Duff C.J. in the case of Reference
re the Adoption Act[66], at
p. 403:

Moreover, while, as subject matter of legislation, the
criminal law is entrusted to the Dominion Parliament, responsibility for the
administration of justice and, broadly speaking, for the policing of the
country, the execution of the criminal law, the suppression of crime and
disorder, has from the beginning of Confederation been recognized as the
responsibility of the provinces and has been discharged at great cost to the
people; so also, the provinces, sometimes acting directly, sometimes through
the municipalities, have assumed responsibility for controlling social
conditions having a tendency to encourage vice and crime.

The next case which might be mentioned is Kalick v. The King[67],
in which one finds language supportive of the provincial position. The
issue was whether a bribe given in order to induce a police officer not to
proceed against a party for violation of The Saskatchewan Temperance Act was
given with intent to interfere with the ""administration of justice""
under s. 157 of the Criminal Code. Duff J. said at p. 182:

It seems clear that giving a bribe to prevent prosecu­tion
for an offence is prima facie an interference with the administration of
justice.

Later in the argument, after adverting to the argument that the
application of the section was limited to offenders suspected of offending the
criminal law strictly so-called, that is to say,

[Page 214]

against the criminal law as falling within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, the learned judge said:

While the word ""crime"" in the Criminal Code gener­ally
speaking applies only to crimes strictly so-called and probably has that
restricted meaning in this section, I think there is nothing requiring us to
limit the meaning of the words administration of justice in the way suggested.

At p. 186 Brodeur J. said:

The work which the police officer was carrying out was
authorized by the law and was absolutely necessary to put the wheels of justice
in motion.

I am of opinion that the ""administration of
justice"" mentioned in section 157 of the Criminal Code should not be
restricted to what takes place after an informa­tion had been laid; but it includes
the taking of neces­sary steps to have a person who has committed an offence
brought before the proper tribunal, and pun­ished for his offence. It is a very
wide term covering the detection, prosecution and punishment of offenders.

In Bédard v. Dawson[68], the
question was whether a Quebec statute authorizing a judge to order the closing
of a disorderly house was intra vires, the argument against validity
being that the statute dealt with criminal law by aiming at the punishment of a
crime. The Court held the statute to be intra vires the provincial
Legislature. Idington J. said, at p. 684:

... in a very wide sense it is the duty of the legislature
to do the utmost it can within its power to anticipate and remove, so far as
practicable, whatever is likely to tend to produce crime; ..

and on the same page Duff J. delivered the follow­ing brief
judgment:

The legislation impugned seems to be aimed at sup-pressing
conditions calculated to favour the development of crime rather than at the
punishment of crime. This is an aspect of the subject in respect of which the
provinces seem to be free to legislate. I think the legislation is not invalid.

The final case I would touch upon before going on to deal with
what might be termed the ""coron­er"" cases, is In re Public
Inquiries Act: In re

[Page 215]

Clement, supra, a decision of the Court of Appeal of
British Columbia. Mr. Justice Clement had been appointed a Commissioner to
inquire whether intoxicating liquor had been unlawfully imported into the
Province. The appointment was made pursuant to the Public Inquiries Act, R.S.B.C.
1911, c. 110 which empowered the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to appoint a
Commissioner to inquire into matters connected with the good gov­ernment of the
Province, the conduct of public business and the administration of justice in
the Province. The Court was unanimous in upholding the appointment. Chief
Justice Macdonald, early in his judgment, said, at p. 117:

I may say, at the outset that I have no doubt his
appointment for the purpose of inquiring into breaches of the British
Columbia Prohibition Act is not open to objection, and to that extent at
least the order in council appointing him is valid; but is that valid which
directed him to inquire into breaches of the criminal law of Canada? The
inquiry in this respect is not I think one connected with good government, or
the conduct of public business, and must be supported, if at all, as being
connected with the administration of justice in the province, as that phrase is
used in No. 14 of sec. 92 of the B.N.A. Act.

Later Chief Justice Macdonald said, at p. 118:

Under its powers in respect of administration of jus­tice
when crime has been committed, the province puts the machinery of the criminal
law in motion. This undoubtedly is one branch of the administration of justice,
but the discovery of crime when it is merely suspected may, I think, also fall
into that category. Provincial peace officers are charged with that duty
amongst others. A provincial detective force might, I think, be organized under
provincial laws for the very purpose for which the commissioner was appointed.
Now, if I am right in thinking that investigations, extra-judicially, into the
commission of crime for the purpose of discovering if and by whom committed are
within the subject-matters assigned to the province under the words,
""administration of justice,"" is there anything to prevent the
province from making the inves­tigation effective by imposing on individuals an
obliga­tion to give evidence under penalty for refusal? I think not. Such a
power is not inconsistent, but consistent with the jurisdiction of the province
to legislate concerning property and civil rights.

[Page 216]

and then continued with these words, which bear cogently:

No doubt to concede the power to the province to make
investigations into breaches of Dominion laws would appear at first blush to be
an anomaly, and it might well be argued that the powers conferred upon the
province in respect of the administration of justice ought to be interpreted as
conferring merely the duty or obligation to put the machinery of the Courts in
motion, and to take the requisite steps to prosecute persons accused of crime.
That narrow construction would, I think, preclude what has been generally
recognized as one of the functions of government in the administration of
justice, namely, the ferreting out of crime and iden­tification of criminals.
There is nothing novel in com­pelling a witness to give evidence which may tend
to incriminate him. That is done in the civil Courts and is the practice in one
of the oldest criminal Courts of the realm, the coroner's inquest. With the
justice or expe­diency of inquiries into crime by an extra-judicial pro­vincial
commission I have not to concern myself. The power to appoint such rests
somewhere. It is either with the Dominion or the province, or with each, and
hence it is idle to urge as a reason against the validity of the order in
council that it is inimical to the rights of the subject.

The other members of the Court expressed them-selves in a similar
vein.

There is little enlightenment, as to the scope of provincial
legislative power under s. 92(14), to be drawn from cases dealing with the
Coroners' Acts. Neither of the Supreme Court of Canada cases, Batary v. A.G.
Sask.[69], and
Faber v. The Queen[70] deals
with the constitutionality, in general, of such legislation.

The Batary case is of assistance in the present appeal
only on the issue of compellability of wit­nesses. In that case, a majority of
the Supreme Court (Fauteux J. dissenting) held that s. 15 of the Saskatchewan Coroners'
Act, which purported to compel the appellant, charged with non-capital
murder, to testify at the inquest into the death of his alleged victim, was ultra
vires. Batary is of little use to the appellants here, for they have not
been charged with any crime. Although one might

[Page 217]

argue that the protection against self-incrimina­tion extended to
those who might be charged with a crime, this contention was rejected by
the majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Re Wilson Inquest[71],
and by a majority of this Court in Faber, supra.

Faber is more helpful to this case, but it, too, is only
peripherally so. In that case, the sole issue before this Court was the
jurisdiction of the Court of Queen's Bench (Crown side) to grant a writ of
prohibition to a coroner who had sentenced the appellant for contempt for
refusing to testify at an inquest. The hearing had been ajourned after the
coroner held that death had been caused by crime perpetrated by unknown
persons. The proceedings were resumed two months later to determine their
identity.

Although constitutionality of the Coroners’ Act of Quebec
was clearly not in issue, Mr. Justice de Grandpré did discuss the criminal
nature of the inquest so as to decide the proper court for judicial review. One
should not unquestioningly transfer comments on ""criminal law"" in
this context to criminal law in the constitutional context, although they can
be of assistance.

Mr. Justice de Grandpré (writing on behalf of a majority of the
Court), held that a coroner's inquest was not a matter of criminal law. While
an ancillary or incidental result of the inquest might be a finding that a
crime was committed and that a specified individual was responsible, this was
not the sole or primary aim of the inquest. Thus the coroner's role is not
restricted to criminal matters, but extends to broader social questions such as
the determination of general trends endangering the public interest and the
reassurance to the public that the state is concerned with the danger and doing
something about it. Broad social interests underline the establishment of the
Quebec Crime Inquiry.

[Page 218]

Mr. Justice de Grandpré also analyzed the organization of the
coroners' inquest to show that it was not a matter of criminal law. There is,
as in the present case, no accused, no lis, and no adjudi­cation of
rights or guilt. If one applies Faber to the present case, one can argue
that the Inquiry does not deal with criminal law. Again there is no lis, no
accused; the concern is the gathering of infor­mation, not adjudication. One
might seek to distin­guish Faber with the argument that the multi-pur­pose
nature of the coroners’ inquest has no counterpart in the Crime Inquiry where
the sole concern is to identify the scope and operation of organized crime.
Arguably that is a federal matter either because a province cannot inquire into
a subject of federal jurisdiction (criminal law) or because it is a colourable
attempt to legislate regarding criminal procedure but in my opinion neither of
these grounds is tenable.

The Wilson Inquest case, supra, is the only one
which deals with the constitutionality of the Coroners' Act. A majority
of the British Columbia Court of Appeal found the Act constitutional as
relating to the administration of justice, largely for the reasons enumerated
by Mr. Justice de Grandpré in Faber. The Wilson Inquest case aids
in showing that an inquiry which deals to some degree with criminal matters is
not a matter of ""criminal law.""

IX

The committal of appellants for contempt was based upon a refusal
to be sworn and to testify, not upon a refusal to answer questions for fear of
self-incrimination. Notwithstanding, concern was voiced during the appeal that
the Crime Commis­sion's powers of subpoena and imprisonment for contempt
interfered with a citizen's right to pro­tection against self-incrimination. In
my view, there is little to justify this assertion in light of the provisions
of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, s. 5(2) and the Code
of Civil Procedure, art. 309.

[Page 219]

By s. 5(1) of the Canada Evidence Act, the common law
right of a witness to refuse to answer a question on the ground that his answer
might tend to incriminate him was abolished. Section 5(2) was enacted to
protect the witness against the use of his statements in subsequent legal
proceedings. These sections read:

5. (1) No witness shall be excused from answering any
question upon the ground that the answer to such question may tend to criminate
him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the
instance of the Crown or of any person.

(2) Where with respect to any question a witness objects to
answer upon the ground that his answer may tend to criminate him, or may tend
to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown
or of any person, and if but for this Act, or the Act of any provincial
legislature, the witness would therefore have been excused from answering such
ques­tion, then although the witness is by reason of this Act, or by reason of
such provincial Act, compelled to answer, the answer so given shall not be used
or receiv­able in evidence against him in any criminal trial, or other criminal
proceeding against him thereafter taking place, other than a prosecution for
perjury in the giving of such evidence.

A similar provision is found in art. 309, C.C.P., which is made
applicable to the proceedings of a Commission of Inquiry. Article 309 reads:

309. A witness cannot refuse to answer for the reason that his
reply might tend to incriminate him or to expose him to a legal proceeding of
any kind; but if he objects on that ground, his reply cannot be used against
him in any penal proceedings instituted under any law of this province.

It was suggested in argument that the Canada Evidence Act has
no effect in a provincial inquiry, as s. 2 reads:

2. This Part applies to all criminal proceedings, and to all
civil proceedings and other matters whatever respecting which the Parliament of
Canada has jurisdic­tion in this behalf.

With respect, I would disagree. The provisions in s. 5 prohibit
the use of incriminating statements

[Page 220]

by a witness in proceedings subsequent to that in which the
evidence is given. Section 2 has the effect of preventing the use of the statements
in all criminal proceedings and in all civil proceedings and other matters
subject to the legislative author­ity of the federal Parliament. The
protections pro­vided by the Act do not affect the provincial inquiry’s
operation, but subsequent proceedings.

In an exhaustive study of the subject of self-incrimination
(""Is there a Right against Self-Incrimination in Canada?"" (1973), 19 McG.L.J.
1) Professor Ed Ratushny observed, at p. 55:

The exclusion allowed by section 5(2) expressly extends to
statements made under the compulsion of provincial statutes. There are a great
number of provin­cial statutes under which witnesses may be compulsorily
examined. Although the federal government has legisla­tive jurisdiction over
Criminal Law and Procedure, under our distribution of powers, the legislatures
have exclusive jurisdiction over the Administration of Justice in their
respective provinces. As a result, the same persons are often involved in
dealing with both criminal matters and matters arising under provincial
legislation. The opportunity therefore arises for a provincial statute
authorizing the examination of witnesses, to be used to advance an
investigation with respect to a criminal offence.

The incriminating consequences to an accused of such a procedure
are obvious, even if the testimony itself cannot be used at the criminal trial.
The matter has received considerable judicial attention with respect to
coroners' inquests.

There may be some concern that a person appearing before a
commission of inquiry is not a ""witness"" in terms of s. 5. Although
some cases have held that a party examined on discovery is not a ""witness""
for purposes of the Evidence Acts (Harrison v. The King[72]
(Alta. C.A.); Webster & Kirkness v. Solloway Mills & Co., Ltd.[73]
(Alta. C.A.); Staples v. Isaacs[74] (B.C. C.A.) ),
I would

[Page 221]

agree with Rand J. in Klein v. Bell[75],
that the word ""witness"" should be broadly interpreted. He said at
p. 317:

A witness, in a broad sense, is one who, in the course of
juridical processes, attests to matters of fact .. .

A person appearing before a provincial inquiry and testifying
under oath or on affirmation is a wit­ness, for he or she is presenting
evidence to the inquiry. Therefore, I am of the view that a person subpoenaed
by the Commission can claim the pro­tection of s. 5(2).

There has also been expressed concern that the Commission of
Inquiry instituted a new method of crime investigation—at a
""wholesale"" rather than ""retail"" level. Although a person
cannot be forced to answer police questions at common law, it is argued that
the Inquiry now forces him to do so, and so restricts common law rights.
Professor Ratushny in the article mentioned above notes (at p. 64) that there
is:

... little evidence of a general common law right against
self-incrimination operative in Canada today. Section 5(of the Canada
Evidence Act) has eliminated the common law privilege of witnesses to
refuse to testify in certain circumstances. It also allows the Crown to compel
the accused to assist in advancing the prosecu­tion against himself in a number
of situations.

The Report of the Canadian Committee on Corrections, Toward
Unity: Criminal Justice and Corrections (The Ouimet Report) commented on
this limited protection, at p. 68:

A searching examination may . . . elicit facts or clues
which enable the case to be independently proved. Thus the abolition of the
privilege of a witness to refuse to answer on the ground that his answer may
tend to incriminate him places an additional and powerful weapon in the hands
of law enforcement.

[Page 222]

Whether or not one agrees with a result which may force a person
to assist in an investigation of his criminal activity, the provisions of s. 5
of the Canada Evidence Act and both federal and provin­cial Inquiries
Act compel such a result. Quebec's Crime Inquiry introduces no new and
insidious form of investigation into our judicial system and there is no
evidence before the Court that it is a colourable attempt to evade the
procedural provi­sions of the Criminal Code.

X

On July 22, 1975, Mr. Justice Beetz granted an order summarizing
the constitutional issue raised by the appellants in these appeals as follows:

Are Order in Council No. 2821-72 issued September 27th 1972, by
the Lieutenant-Governor in-Council for the Province of Quebec, as well as
sections 19, 21, 21a, 21-b, 21-c, 21-d, 21-e, 22, 22-b, 22-c, 22-d, 24 and 25
of the Police Act (Q.S. 1968, ch. 17 and amendments), sections 6, 7, 9, 10,
11, 12 and 16 of the Public Inquiry Commission Act (R.S.Q. 1964, ch. 11 and
amend­ments), and sections 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 and 284 of the Code of Civil Procedure
of the Province of Quebec, ultra vires or otherwise anti-constitutional
or inopera­tive?""

I would answer the question in the negative and dismiss the
appeals.

BEETZ J.—I agree in substance with Mr. Justice Pigeon and Mr.
Justice Dickson.

The purpose of s. 19 of the Police Act (Que. 1968,
c. 17 as amended) and accessory enactments is to uncover crime and organized
crime. The means are those of an inquest. They include coer­cion. Witnesses
summoned before the Police Com­mission may be examined under oath or affirma­tion
and must answer all questions put to them under pain of being found in contempt
and fined or incarcerated.

In my view, such a statute cannot be character­ized otherwise
than as a law relating to the administration of criminal justice and is within

provincial legislative competence under s. 92(14) of the British
North America Act, 1867.

Before Confederation, the provinces were in charge of the
administration of justice, including criminal justice. It was contemplated by
s. 91(27) of the British North America Act, 1867, that criminal law,
substantive and procedural, would come under the exclusive legislative
authority of the Parliament of Canada. But subject to this provision and to the
paramountcy of federal law enacted under primary or ancillary federal
jurisdiction, the provinces were to remain responsible in principle for the
enforcement of criminal law and to retain such power as they had before with
respect to the administration of criminal justice. They continued in fact to
police their respective territories, to investigate crime, to gather and to
keep records and informations relating to crime, to prosecute criminals and to
supervise police forces, sheriffs, coroners, fire commissioners, officers of
justice, the summoning of juries, recognizances in criminal cases, and the
like. Pertaining to such functions is the power to make laws relating to public
and reformatory prisons, expressed in s. 92(6) of the Constitution. Some of
those respon­sibilities are executive in nature; but to carry them required
instrumentalities which had to be regulat­ed, financed, abolished and
reconstituted and the jurisdiction and powers of which had to be defined by
legislation. Such legislation could not have been enacted unless the power to
make laws for the administration of criminal justice was vested in the
provincial legislatures. That is why s. 92(14) of the Constitution does not
distinguish between civil and criminal justice: the natural meaning of the
expression ""the administration of justice"" is broad enough to
encompass both; indeed, it is so broad that it would have enabled the
provincial legisla­tures to make laws relating to matters covered by ss. 96 to
100 of the Constitution, were they not prevented to do so by these very
sections. That the expression ""the administration of justice"" was
understood to have the widest scope is illustrated by s. 2 of the North-West
Territories Act, 1869, 32-33 Viet., c. 3 (Can.), where it is found in
conjunction with the expression generally used to

[Page 224]

confer, in terms of subject matters, the totality of legislative
powers:

2. It shall be lawful for the Governor, by any Order or
Orders, to be by him from time to time made, with the advice of the Privy
Council (and subject to such conditions and restrictions as to him shall seem
meet), to authorize and empower such Officer as he may from time to time
appoint as Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, to make
provision for the administration of Justice therein, and generally to
make, ordain, and establish all such Laws, Institutions and Ordinances
as may be necessary for the Peace, Order and good Government of Her
Majesty's subjects and others therein; provided that all such Orders
in Council, and all Laws and Ordinances, so to be made as afore-said, shall be
laid before both Houses of Parliament as soon as conveniently may be after the
making and enactment thereof respectively.

This Act was confirmed by the British North America
Act, 1871, s. 5.

Similarly, the Quebec Act, 1774, 14 Geo. III c. 83,
repealed the Royal Proclamation, 1763, so far as it related to the Province of
Quebec, ""and all and every the Ordinance and Ordinances made by the
Governor and Council of Quebec for the Time being, relative to the Civil
Government and Administration of Justice in the said Province ..."". The
intent of this enactement was to repeal all ordinances relating to any matter
whatever.

The Quebec Act re-introduced French Law with respect to
""Property and Civil Rights"", while it decreed the continuance of the
Criminal Law of England in the following terms:

""... That the same ""(Criminal Law of
England)"" shall continue to be administered and shall be observed
as law in the province of Quebec, as well in the description and quality
of the offence as in the method of prosecution and trial; and
the punishment and forfeitures thereby inflicted to the exclusion
of every other rule of criminal law, or mode of proceeding thereon,
which did or might prevail in the said Province before the Year of our Lord One
thousand seven hundred and sixty-four; subject nevertheless to such Alterations
and Amendments as the

[Page 225]

Governor . . ., by and with the Advice and Consent of the
Legislative Council of the said Province ... shall, from time to time, cause to
be made therein ..."".

These terms are at once detailed and all-embrac­ing, one reason
for such thoroughness being to stress the abolition of judicial torture which
was possible under French law. It is significant how-ever that while the
expression ""property and civil rights"" was repeated verbatim in s.
92(13) of the Constitution, the wording of s. 91(27) in no way approaches that
used in the Quebec Act, with respect to criminal law. Should any such
language be found in s. 91(27), it would leave no doubt that the Parliament of
Canada was solely empowered to make laws for the administration of criminal
justice. But the intent was to avoid this result. That is why s. 91(27) ought
not to be construed so as to leave to the provinces no legislative jurisdic­tion
over the administration of criminal justice. The natural meaning of s. 91(27)
and the basic jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada under that heading have
been most appropriately described by Taschereau J., as he then was, in A.G.
Que. v. A.G. Can.[76], at
p. 603:

""The power given to the Federal Parliament to legislate
in criminal law and criminal procedure, is the power to determine what shall or
what shall not be 'criminal', and to determine the steps to be taken in
prosecutions and other criminal proceedings before the Courts"".

Section 19 of the Police Act does not correspond to that
description.

It should be kept in mind that we are concerned in this case with
a provincial statute and with provincial jurisdiction, not with the ultimate
limits of federal jurisdiction nor with the extent to which provincial
legislation would remain operative should the Parliament of Canada decide to
enter and regulate the field of criminal investigation. Given the ancillary
powers of the Parliament of Canada and the interrelated aspects of criminal
justice, one is likely to find room for overlapping

[Page 226]

legislation in this area. In Proprietary Articles Trade
Association v. A.G. for Canada[77], the
Com­bines Investigation Act, (R.S.C. 1927, c. 26) and s. 498 of the Criminal
Code were found intra vires of the Parliament of Canada: the main
part of the legislation was criminal law; the rest could be supported
under s. 91(3) and 91(22) of the Consti­tution. Provision was also made in the
legislation for the appointment of a registrar and of commis­sioners and for
the holding of inquiries. The Judi­cial Committee had this to say on the latter
point:

If then the legislation in question is authorized under one
or other of the heads specifically enumerated in s. 91, it is not to the
purpose to say that it affects property and civil rights in the Provinces. Most
of the specific subjects in s. 91 do affect property and civil rights but so
far as the legislation of Parliament in pith and substance is operating within
the enumerated powers there is constitutional authority to interfere with
property and civil rights. The same principle would apply to s. 92, head
14, ""the administration of justice in the Province"", even if
the legislation did, as in the present case it does not, in any way
interfere with the administration of justice. Nor is there any
ground for suggesting that the Dominion may not employ its own executive
officers for the purpose of carrying out legislation which is within its
constitutional authority, as it does regularly in the case of revenue officials
and other matters which need not be enumerated (at pp. 326, 327).

The statement that the legislation in question did not
""interfere"" with the administration of jus­tice, whatever that means,
can be considered as an obiter: the legislation would have remained
valid even if it did trench upon the provincial power over the administration
of justice, as was expressly recognized by the Judicial Committee, and wheth­er
it had been enacted under the primary or the ancillary power of the Parliament
of Canada. The result would have been identical had the Judicial Committee
endorsed the submission of Counsel for the A.G. for Canada—which in my
view presented a better approach-to the effect that:

[Page 227]

""the primary intention and effect is to make certain
acts, when they are to the public detriment, offences; the provisions as to
investigations being reasonably neces­sary for carrying out that primary
intention. If any of those provisions are not directly within s. 91 head 27,
they nevertheless are valid as being ancillary provisions to carry out the
scheme of legislation ..."". [1931] A.C. 310, at p. 314.

I do not find it necessary to express an opinion as to whether
matters such as the issuance of search warrants upon a sworn information (Part
XIII of the Criminal Code) or compelling the appearance of an accused
person before a justice, by way of arrest or otherwise, (Part XIV of the Criminal
Code) fall under primary or ancillary federal jurisdiction. They would
appear to be relat­ed to specific crimes, already uncovered, and to the
gathering of evidence necessary for the prosecution of such crimes rather than
to an investigation of unknown criminal acts, of criminal practices and of
crime as an organized system. If this hypothesis is correct, then those parts
of the Criminal Code are perhaps essential elements of the criminal law,
but they differ substantially from the impugned provincial statute. If on the
other hand those enactments can be said to overflow into the field of criminal
investigation, all that need be asked is whether they conflict with the Police
Act. I see no such conflict.

We are not called upon to judge the wisdom of the impugned
legislation. There is no doubt that the power to establish a commission of
enquiry can be abused. This is true of almost any power, as has been said
repeatedly, and does not make it of federal rather than of provincial concern.
The issue whether there was abuse in the administra­tion of the Police Act does
not arise in the case at bar where the ground for contempt is the refusal by
appellants to be sworn in as witnesses and to answer questions put to them, on
the sole basis of the alleged unconstitutionality of the statute under which
the Commission was established.

The penalties imposed under the impugned legislation in cases where
witnesses refuse to testify

[Page 228]

are of a coercive nature. Even if they are punitive, s. 92(15) of
the Constitution would suf­fice to insure their constitutionality unless they
be used as a colourable device to create new crimes, or to punish old ones
otherwise than under the Criminal Code. This has been pleaded but not
established.

Of great importance in this case, is the principle against
self-incrimination. This criminal law prin­ciple would supersede provincial
law: witnesses called before the Police Commission could not be compelled to
give answers which might tend to incriminate them. This might impair the
inquest although it would not affect the constitutionality of s. 19 of the Police
Act nor improve the position of appellants: they have not declined to
answer questions which might tend to incriminate them; they have refused to
answer any question.

However, the principle against self-incrimina­tion has been
altered by s. 5 of the Canada Evi­dence Act (R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10)
insofar as the right to be excused from answering incriminating questions has
been replaced by the inadmissibility of self-incriminating answers obtained
under legal compulsion.

I agree entirely with the reasons given by Mr. Justice Pigeon and
Mr. Justice Dickson for hold­ing that the protection contemplated by s. 5 was
available to appellants.

I would answer the constitutional question in the negative and
dismiss the appeals.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law — Rape — Drunkenness as a defence — Distinction
between crimes of specific intent and crimes of general intent — Whether rape
crime of general intent — Miscarriage of justice — Criminal Code, s.
613(1)(b)(iii).

The accused, who did not give evidence or call wit­nesses
at his trial, made a voluntary statement to the police in which he confirmed
that intercourse had taken place but said that it had occurred with the complai­nant's
consent and without the use of force or threats on his part. This statement was
put in evidence at the trial. The accused now appeals on the grounds that the
trial judge erred in law in directing the jury that drunkenness was not a
defence to a charge of rape.

Held (Laskin C.J., Spence and Dickson JJ.
dissent­ing): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and de Grandpré JJ.: Four points arise: 1. The distinction between crimes of
specific intent and crimes of general intent; 2. Rape as an offence of general
intent; 3. Whether there was evidence that the accused was so intoxicated that
he could not form a criminal intent; 4. Whether there was a miscarriage of
justice. With regard to the first question, the distinction as stated in this
Court in The Queen v. George, [1960] S.C.R. 871, was unanimously upheld
in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Majewski, [1976] 2 All E.R. 142.
With regard to the second question, rape is to be considered a crime of general
intent and therefore the defence of drunkenness can have no application. With
regard to the third ques­tion, there was no evidence that the appellant was
drunk to such an extent as to be incapable of forming an intention to commit
rape. With regard to the fourth question, the accused having submitted a
defence of consent, could not at the same time claim that he was too drunk to
know what he was doing. Having chosen not to raise a weak alternative defence
at his trial so as not to prejudice his main defence, the accused cannot now
claim that he ought to be given a new trial for the

[Page 30]          

purpose of making it possible for him to raise the
alternative defence.

Per Laskin C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ., dissent­ing:
Drunkenness as such is not a defence to a charge of rape, but evidence of
drunkenness may be taken into consideration by the jury in determining whether
the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt the mens rea required to
constitute the crime. In order to prove rape, the Crown must prove the intention
to force intercourse and a realization by the accused that his conduct may lead
to non-consensual intercourse. It is not enough to say that because the accused
committed a physical act without the woman's consent, he must be taken to have
intended intercourse without consent. Evidence of intoxication would be
relevant in determin­ing the presence of the requisite mental element; the
state of mind of the accused being in issue, the Court should ask what was his
actual state of mind at the time of the alleged offence. The attempt to
distinguish be­tween specific intent and general intent is neither mean­ingful
nor intelligible and is, in practice, impossible to apply when mens rea is a
requisite element of a crime. If the accused was drunk, but it is proved that
he acted intentionally or recklessly, it is irrelevant that but for the
drinking he would not have done the act. But the fact that a man ingests a
substance that causes him to cast off the restraints of reason does not mean
that his conduct must be branded as reckless enough to support the crime
charged. Whether the act of drinking consti­tutes recklessness is a question of
fact to be determined in the circumstances of each case and not by application
of an irrebutable presumption against the accused. Recklessness, in the legal
sense, imports foresight and must have reference to the consequences of a
particular act. Finally, in the case at bar there was a possibility of a
miscarriage of justice since a properly charged jury might have cause for reasonable
doubt that the accused had the necessary mens rea.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia[1],
dismissing appel­lant’s appeal from his conviction for rape. Appeal dismissed,
Laskin C.J. and Spence and Dickson J.J. dissenting.

K. S. Fawcus, for the appellant.

G. S. Cumming, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ. was
delivered by

DICKSON J. (dissenting)—The appellant, Allan Henry Patrick
Leary, was convicted of rape before Meredith J. and a jury at the City of
Nelson in British Columbia. An appeal to the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia was dismissed and he has now appealed, by leave, to this Court on the
following question of law: ""That the learned trial judge erred in law in
directing the jury that drunk­enness was not a defence to a charge of
rape.""

I

The complainant testified that Leary, in a drun­ken condition,
forced her at knife point to submit to coition and other acts of sexual
humiliation. The defence was consent. After instructing the jury that the only
issue was whether or not the complai­nant had consented to sexual intercourse,
Mr.

[Page 32]

Justice Meredith said: ""I should add too at this point,
drunkenness is not a defence to a charge of this sort."" The issue in this
appeal is whether that is a correct statement of law.

The issue presented is an important one, requir­ing consideration
of basic criminal law principles of mens rea, and elaboration of the
defence of drunkenness in relation to criminal responsibility. One might have
thought that the effect of drunk­enness upon legal responsibility would have
been well settled by now but despite the legal scholar-ship and copious amount
of literature devoted to the subject, many underlying problems remain
unresolved and the subject of controversy. The confusion and uncertainty which
prevails is attributable, no doubt, in part to (a) the use throughout the
cases, and in the legal literature generally, of two chameleon-like phrases, mens
rea and ""specific intent,"" each with several distinct meanings
(see Smith & Hogan Criminal Law, 3rd. ed. p. 47); (b) the impact of
the proposition that drunkenness is no excuse for crime upon the fun­damental
principle that, generally speaking, guilt depends upon proof by the Crown that
the accused intended to do the acts with which he is charged, an intention
which may be entirely lacking in a state of advanced drunkenness; (c) failure
to dis­tinguish between (i) the effect of drunkenness on capacity to form the
requisite intent and (ii) intent in fact.

II

The Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Vandervoort[2]
held that drunkenness constitutes a valid defence to crimes in which
specific intent is an essential ingredient and that rape is a crime of specific
intent. The British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Boucher[3]
refused to follow the Vandervoort decision and held that rape was a
crime of general intent only and, therefore, drunkenness

[Page 33]

could not validly be pleaded in defence. In the present
proceedings the Court of Appeal for British Columbia relied upon its earlier
decision in Boucher in dismissing the appeal. There would seem to be
good reason not to perpetuate the jural conflict between two appellate Courts,
as a result of which a person accused of rape in Ontario has the
""defence"" of drunkenness open to him, but not if the charge is laid
in British Columbia.

Although the expression ""defence of drunken­ness"" is
often used, more precisely the defence is that the accused, by reason of
drunkenness, lacked the capacity to form the requisite intent or lacked the
intent in fact or that he had a positive though mistaken belief in consent.

III

I would answer the question of law posed in this appeal in this
manner—drunkenness, as such, is not a defence to a charge of rape but evidence
of drunkenness may be considered by the jury, to­gether with all other relevant
evidence, in deter-mining whether the prosecution has proved beyond a
reasonable doubt the mens rea required to con­stitute the crime.

 

IV

There are certain quasi-criminal strict liability offences—as affecting
public health or safety—where an absolute offence is created and a person may
be subjected to punishment even though he had no intention of contravening the
law. Duress, provocation, and mental abnormality also bear upon criminal
responsibility. In what follows, I should like to leave all of these matters
aside and consider basic principles as to which there can surely be little
question or cavil. The first of these is the presumption that mens rea is an
essential ingredient in every offence. This principle was enunciated by Wright
J. in Sherras v. De Rutzen[4] and
has since been repeated in countless cases. The concept of mens rea, that
the prohibited act must be accompanied by a certain mental element, has been
authoritatively established by this Court in

[Page 34]

such cases as The Queen v. Rees[5];
Beaver v. The Queen[6]; and
The Queen v. King[7]. In
the most recent of these decisions, Taschereau J., as he then was, said at
749:

It is my view that there can be no actus reus unless it
is the result of a willing mind at liberty to make a definite choice or
decision . .

The notion that a court should not find a person guilty of an
offence against the criminal law unless he has a blameworthy state of mind is
common to all civilized penal systems. It is founded upon respect for the
person and for the freedom of human will. A person is accountable for what he
wills. When, in the exercise of the power of free choice, a member of society
chooses to engage in harmful or otherwise undesirable conduct pros­cribed by
the criminal law, he must accept the sanctions which that law has provided for
the purpose of discouraging such conduct. Justice demands no less. But, to be
criminal, the wrong-doing must have been consciously committed. To subject the
offender to punishment, a mental ele­ment as well as a physical element is an
essential concomitant of the crime. The mental state basic to criminal
liability consists in most crimes in either (a) an intention to cause the actus
reus of the crime, i.e. an intention to do the act which constitutes
the crime in question, or (b) foresight or realization on the part of the
person that his conduct will probably cause or may cause the actus reus, together
with assumption of or indiffer­ence to a risk, which in all of the
circumstances is substantial or unjustifiable. This latter mental ele­ment is
sometimes characterized as recklessness.

The burden of proving all of the elements in the definition of
the crime charged, including the mental element, is always upon the Crown. The
presence or absence of evidence of intoxication in no way affects that burden.

The nature of the mental element varies with the definition of
the crime and it may be expressly

[Page 35]

spelled out in the definition, or it may be implied. By
definition, a male person commits rape when he has sexual intercourse with a
female person without her consent. That is the actus reus of the crime.
Parliament, as is often the case, has left unexpressed the mental element but
it would seem clear that in order to constitute the crime the Crown must prove,
beyond reasonable doubt, intercourse without consent, together with (a) an
intention to force intercourse notwithstanding absence of consent, or (b) a
realization that the conduct may lead to non-consensual intercourse and a
recklessness or indifference to that conse­quence ensuing. It will not do
simply to say that because the accused committed the physical act and the woman
did not consent, he must be taken to have intended to have intercourse without
consent.

 

Parenthetically, when the risk is substantial and unjustifiable,
proof of recklessness necessary to constitute the mental element essential to
criminal responsibility may be readily satisfied. This is exemplified in the
crime of rape. The harm to be anticipated from acting upon the mistaken belief
that the woman is consenting is very great whereas that which may be lost in
failing to act is slight. The risk then is both substantial and unjustifiable.
The conscious creation of risk in these circum­stances in acting with
indifference to the possibili­ty of non-consent is compatible with recklessness
constituting mens rea.

 

On principle, it would seem that evidence of intoxication should
be relevant in determining the presence of the requisite mental element,
inasmuch as intoxication undoubtedly affects a person's abil­ity to appreciate
the possible consequences or cir­cumstances. Consumption of alcohol affects
mental state. The state of mind of the accused being in issue it would seem
reasonable to ask—what was his actual state of mind at the time? If the
evidence in the case discloses some degree of intoxication, one might think,
consistent with fun­damental principles of criminal responsibility, that such
evidence would be relevant to any consider­ation of the mental state of the
alleged offender.

[Page 36]

But such, it is said, is not the case. The argument, of course,
is that Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard[8]
drew a distinction between crimes of specific intent and those of general
intent; that rape is a crime of general intent only and therefore drunkenness is
no defence. This Court decided in McAskill v. The King[9]
and repeated in Perrault v. The Queen[10] that
the rules of law for determining the validity of a defence of drunkenness to a
charge of murder were as stated in Lord Birken­head's second and third propositions
in Beard's case.

V

In earliest times, the settled rule in England was that voluntary
drunkenness would not excuse the commission of any crime. This law is found in Reniger
v. Fogossa[11], argued
in 1551 (see also Beverley's Case[12].
The principle that no one should be privileged to escape culpability for
crime com­mitted while in a state of self-induced intoxication is found in the
writings of Coke (1 Inst. 247a), Blackstone (4 Commentaries 26) Hawkins
(1 P.C. c. 1, s. 6) and Hale (1 Hale 31).

In the nineteenth century, the old rule was gradually relaxed by
judicial decisions (see R. U. Singh, ""History of Drunkenness in English
Crimi­nal Law"" (1933), 49 L.Q. R. 528 at p. 536). In R. v. Grindley[13],
Holyroyd J. held that the fact of a person being intoxicated could be taken
into account where on a charge such as a murder the material question was
whether the act was pre-meditated. This view was later rejected by Park J. in R.
v. Carroll[14].

In Regina v. Monkhouse[15], counsel
for the

[Page 37]

defence cited Regina v. Cruse[16],
in which the accused was charged with attempt to murder a child and Patteson
J. had instructed the jury to this effect:

... you must be satisfied that when he inflicted the
violence he had in mind a positive intention of murder­ing that child. Even if
he did it under circumstances which would have amounted to murder if death had
ensued, that will not be sufficient, unless he actually intended to commit
murder ... It appears that both these persons were drunk, and although
drunkenness is no excuse for any crime whatever, yet it is often of very great
importance in cases where it is a question of intention. A person may be so
drunk as to be utterly unable to form any intention at all, and yet he may be
guilty of a very great violence.

 

Coleridge J. in Monkhouse said that he agreed with the
substance of what Patteson J. was reported to have said in Cruse's case, but he
expressed himself as not so clear as to the propriety of adopting the very
words. Coleridge J. went on to say, at 56:

Drunkenness is ordinarily neither a defence nor excuse for
crime, and where it is available as a partial answer to a charge, it rests on
the prisoner to prove it, and it is not enough that he was excited or rendered
more irritable, unless the intoxication was such as to prevent his restraining
himself from committing the act in question, or to take away from him the power
of forming any specific intention.

The direction is of interest in that it recognizes drunkenness as
a ""partial answer to a charge and the phrase ""specific
intention,"" source of such confusion since Beard, was used for the
first time in a jury charge. There is nothing to suggest that the phrase was
there used in any technical sense, or as a term of art in contrast to basic or
general intent,

In R. v. Moore[17], the
prisoner was indicted for a misdemeanor in attempting to commit suicide when
after a violent quarrel with her husband she threw herself into a garden well,
thirty-eight feet deep. Fortunately, assistance was at hand and she

[Page 38]

was rescued, we are told, without much injury. The witness who
proved these facts also stated that at the time the prisoner was so drunk as
not to know what she was about. Jervis C.J. charged the jury in these words:

If the prisoner was so drunk as not to know what she was
about, how can you say that she intended to destroy herself?

In R. v. Doherty[18]', a
case of murder, tried in 1887, Stephen J. instructed the jury that the gen­eral
rule as to intention was that a man intends the natural consequences of his
acts but that this was not a necessary inference and in drawing it one had to
consider whether the prisoner was drunk or sober. He continued, at p. 308:

It is almost trivial for me to observe that a man is not
excused from crime by reason of his drunkenness. If it were so, you might as
well at once shut up the criminal courts, because drink is the occasion of a
large propor­tion of the crime which is committed; but, although you cannot
take drunkenness as any excuse for crime, yet when the crime is such that the
intention of the party committing it is one of its constituent elements, you
may look at the fact that a man was in drink in considering whether he formed
the intention necessary to constitute the crime.

The only other major case pre-Beard is R. v. Meade[19].
This was an appeal by a prisoner against conviction on a charge of
murder. Darling J., on behalf of the Court of Criminal Appeal, set forth the
following rule for determining whether the jury would be justified in returning
a verdict of man-slaughter on the ground of the voluntary drunken­ness of the
accused:

A man is taken to intend the natural consequences of his
acts. This presumption may be rebutted—(1.) in the case of a sober man, in many
ways: (2.) it may also be rebutted in the case of a man who is drunk, by shewing
his mind to have been so affected by the drink he had taken that he was
incapable of knowing that what he was doing was dangerous, i.e., likely to
inflict serious injury. If this be proved, the presumption that he intended to
do grievous bodily harm is rebutted.

[Page 39]

Coming then to Beard’s case: After reviewing at some
length the earlier cases, Lord Birkenhead L.C. listed under three heads the
conclusions which he considered could be drawn therefrom:

1. That insanity, whether produced by drunkenness or
otherwise, is a defence to the crime charged. The dis­tinction between the
defence of insanity in the true sense caused by excessive drinking, and the
defence of drunk­enness which produces a condition such that the drunk-en man's
mind becomes incapable of forming a specific intention, has been preserved
throughout the cases. The insane person cannot be convicted of a crime: Felstead
v. The King [1914] A.C. 534; but, upon a verdict of insanity, is
ordered to be detained during His Majesty's pleasure. The law takes no note of
the cause of the insanity. If actual insanity in fact supervenes, as the result
of alcoholic excess, it furnishes as complete an answer to a criminal charge as
insanity induced by any other cause.

 

2. That evidence of drunkenness which renders the accused
incapable of forming the specific intent essential to constitute the crime
should be taken into consider­ation with the other facts proved in order to
determine whether or not he had this intent.

3. That evidence of drunkenness falling short of a proved
incapacity in the accused to form the intent necessary to constitute the crime,
and merely establish­ing that his mind was affected by drink so that he more
readily gave way to some violent passion, does not rebut the presumption that a
man intends the natural conse­quences of his acts.

The third head has undergone change. Since Woolmington v.
D.P.P.[20]. proof
of incapacity has not rested upon the accused, and since Hosegood v. Hosegood[21]
the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his
acts is now regarded as a proposition of good sense rather than a proposition
of law.

 

VI

It is the second head of Beard which particular­ly
concerns us. The notion that drunkenness might negative an intent integral to a
more serious

[Page 40]

charge, such as murder, and permit conviction of a lesser charge,
such as manslaughter, of which the intent was not a constituent element, was
con­ceived in response to humanitarian urgings which sought to distinguish
between the homicide com­mitted in cold blood by a sober person and one
committed by a drunken person. Capital punishment or deportation was considered
on occasion to be unduly severe treatment for the inebriated offender. Although
the motivation was under­standable and the legal mechanism by which the graver
offence could be read down to the lesser offence seemed soundly conceived, the
irrational ""specific intent—basic intent"" dichotomy has pre­sented
difficulty ever since, for there are not, and have never been, any legally adequate
criteria for distinguishing the one group of crimes from the other. Indeed, the
question is often asked as to whether Lord Birkenhead intended any such
dichotomy. Certain well-known dicta found later in the judgment would
suggest the contrary, and leave the answer to the question far from clear. The dicta
have been thought by some to accept the principle that drunkenness may
negative mens rea in any and every crime.

The words used by Lord Birkenhead were these, at p. 504: ""I
do not think that the proposition of law deduced from these earlier cases is an
excep­tional rule applicable only to cases in which it is necessary to prove a
specific intent in order to constitute the graver crime .. It is true that in
such cases the specific intent must be proved to constitute the particular
crime, but this is, on ultimate analysis, only in accordance with the ordinary
law applicable to crime, for, speaking generally (and apart from certain
special offences) a person cannot be convicted of a crime unless the mens was rea.""

Great difficulty has been experienced by the Courts in seeking to
clarify what is meant by the phrase crimes of specific intent."" This is
under­standable for a person may have an intent which is specific but how does
one identify a ""specific intent"" as distinguished from a ""basic
intent"" or ""general intent"" or ""ulterior intent."" The
phrase

[Page 41]

""specific intent"" is not a concept known to psy­chology.
The expression is not contained in the Criminal Code. How a juryman can
be expected to recognize such an elusive cerebration in the mind of an accused
is obscure. The attempts made to distinguish, in the cases, between so-called
""specif­ic intent"" crimes and ""general intent"" crimes serve
only to confirm the difficulty of the task. It has been said that such words as
""with intent to,"" ""for a fraudulent purpose,""
""corruptly,"" ""wilfully"" [sic], ""knowingly,"" and
the like, contained in the defini­tion of the charge, identify crimes of
specific intent. Why this should be so is not self-evident as there is no
specificity to such words as ""intentionally"" or
""knowingly."" And it is conceded that the definition of the crime is
not exhaustive, as a specific intention may sometimes be embodied by
implication. None of this is very helpful to judge or jury, as many
distinguished scholars have taken pains to point out. It is understandable that
aca­demic discussion should have focused primarily upon the illogicality of
distinguishing between crimes of so-called specific intent from those of
general intent, with heavy emphasis upon the vio­lence said to be done to
fundamental principles of criminal law in attributing to an accused person a
mental state and an intent, which by reason of drunkenness, ex hypothesi he
does not have. The argument is made that if a person is so drunk as to be
incapable of forming the intent required, or in fact lacked that intent, he
should not be convicted of a crime which is committed only if that intent be
present and proven. The argument is com­pelling.

Consider the position of the jury. The members of the jury will
have heard all of the evidence as to drunkenness and are then, in effect, told
to excise it from their minds. The result is that either (a) the Crown, because
the accused was intoxicated, is relieved of the burden of proving a requisite
mental state which would have had to be proven if the accused had been sober,
(placing the intoxicat­ed offender in a worse position than the sober offender—the
antithesis of the policy sought to be implemented by the nineteenth century
jurists), or (b) in the alternative, the jury is required to examine the mental
state of the accused, notionally

[Page 42]

absent the alcohol, an impossible task and, in the case of a
general intent crime and a very drunk man, to find a fictional non-existing
mental state as an ingredient of guilt. The jury is expected to consider only
that part of the behaviour which had its genesis in considerations other than
drunken­ness. All of this suggests that the distinction sought to be made
between specific intent and general intent is neither meaningful nor intel­ligible.

VII

There seems little reason for retaining in the criminal law—which
should be characterized by clarity, simplicity, and certainty—a concept as
difficult of comprehension and application as ""spe­cific intention"".
If ""with intent"" crimes are regarded as crimes of specific intent, it
is apparent that many of these are as grave or graver crimes than those of
so-called basic intent, such as common assault; drunkenness can absolve in
respect of the graver crimes, yet not in respect of the lesser. Intent in
respect of robbery can be negatived by drink but not the intent for rape or
assault. Another incongruity lies in the fact that crimes of specific intent
are also crimes of basic or general intent.

 

In R. v. George[22], this
Court added a gloss to Beard. The Court of Appeal for Ontario in R.
v. Vandervoort, supra, had regard to these two authorities in reaching the
conclusion that rape was a crime of specific intent. Upon the same authorities
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in R. v. Boucher, supra, concluded
that rape was not a crime of specific intent and thus, drunkenness was no
defence. This diversity reflects the difficulty in the practical application of
Beard. The judgments in George appear to recognize the
possibility of drunkenness negating general intent if a person were so drunk
that he had no knowl­edge of what he was doing and, on principle, there is no
reason why intoxication should not negative

[Page 43]

mens rea in crimes of basic or general intent.

Whatever utility the concept of ""specific intent"" may
have had in the past, it is very doubtful whether any good purpose is served by
its reten­tion, having regard to the difficulties to which I have referred and,
since Beard, to the greater knowledge of the nature of intoxication and
alcoholism and the increasing emphasis on mental state as an element of
criminal responsibility. Society and the law have moved away from the primitive
response of punishment for the actus reus alone. The doctrine of mens
rea has increas­ingly emerged as an essential element of criminal
accountability. The effect of the second proposi­tion in Beard's case is
to hold the accused to account, not for his self-induced drunkenness, but for
whatever harm he may have done, without intending to do so, while in that
state. There is much to be said for the view that drunkenness should not be
regarded as standing alone but rather as possibly contributing to some
condition inconsistent with criminal responsibility. Thus, insanity caused by
excessive drinking affords an answer to a criminal charge but it is the
insanity to which attention is directed and the cause of the insanity is
irrelevant. The law has always distin­guished intoxication, however gross, from
insanity, permanent or temporary, induced by intoxication; psychiatry draws no
such distinction.

VIII

When an accused, in answer to a criminal charge, says that he was
so sodden as to be virtual­ly an automaton, incapable of knowing what he was
about, his defence is not drunkenness but an absence of voluntariness caused by
excessive drink­ing. The question then is whether the act was voluntary.
Likewise, when the offence with which he is charged includes a mental element
which must be established by the Crown, such as inten­tion or recklessness, it
should be open to an accused to contend that upon all of the evidence the Crown
has failed to establish the requisite mental element. The law should take no
note of the inducing cause which led to the incapacity or

[Page 44]

lack of intent. On the other hand, it is generally recognized
that the usual effect of drinking is merely to remove self-restraints and
inhibitions and induce a sense of self-confidence and, perhaps, aggressiveness.
If the accused was drunk at the time of the alleged offence but it is proved
that he did the act intentionally or recklessly, it is irrele­vant that but for
the drinking he would never have done the act. The intent or recklessness,
constitut­ing the necessary mental element, is present and the fact that, by reason
of drink, his judgment and control relaxed so that he more readily gave way to
his instinctual drives, avails him nothing.

 

I return then to the charge facing the present appellant, that of
rape. Cases where a man will have had intercourse without intending to do so
must be rare; cases where an accused, notwith­standing resistance on the part
of the woman, is under a drink-induced mistaken belief that the woman has
consented must be rarer. Speaking generally, rape is committed by persons who
intend to have intercourse with a woman knowing she has not consented, or who
are indifferent to her wishes. Intent is present. What is lacking is control.
This extends to the grossly intoxicated. Rape cannot be committed by accident.
Inter-course is an act normally consented to and if there is little or no
obvious resistance, ""half-won argu­ments of couples in parked cars,""
there would seem to be no principle precluding a defence of belief in consent,
though mistaken, and though alcohol be a contributing factor. Drunkenness is
simply a piece of evidence relevant to the determi­nation of the presence of
the requisite mental element. Drunkenness will not assist in exculpating an
accused if he got drunk in order to get courage to commit the crime or to aid
in his defence.

The present law is an uneasy and, if I may venture to say so, an
indefensible compromise between two other positions which might be taken. The
first, that drunkenness can never excuse; the second, that drunkenness can
excuse in all crimes except those of strict liability. The compromise was
adopted for the reason I have mentioned, to

[Page 45]

permit a reading down in cases of murder or other violent crime,
but it can only be justified at present on historical grounds.

 

IX

It is sometimes said that public policy demands retention of the
""specific intent"" concept no matter how illogical or difficult of
application that concept may be; see Director of Public Prosecu­tions v. Majewski[23],
at pp. 167-8. The point is made that a basic function of the criminal law
is protection of the public from unprovoked violence and that to depart from
the rule in Beard's case would leave no protection where such violence
is consequent upon the taking of drink or drugs; (id. at p. 152). I have
grave doubt that the rule in Beard deters or is capable of deterring the
intox­icated offender. Such an offender only has an excuse if he acted in
circumstances where he was incapable of forming an intent, or without an intent
in fact. Certainly when that state is reached, no prohibitive rule could deter.
But it is said (Austin, Jurisprudence, 5th ed. vol. I p. 496), that such
a state is voluntarily reached by an accused only at his peril, and that he
will be presumed to have intended any actus reus he commits as the
result of voluntary intoxication. Austin’s point is that voluntarily ingesting
an alcoholic substance to the point where one is incapacitated to form an
intent is recklessness sufficient to support a finding of mens rea. The
same point is made by Lord Elwyn-Jones L.C. and by Lord Russell in Majew­ski’s
case at pp. 151 and 171.

With great respect for those of another view, I think it is wrong
to say that merely because a man voluntarily ingests a substance which causes
him to cast off the restraints of reason, such conduct must inevitably be
branded as reckless enough to support the crime charged, whatever that crime
may be. There will be circumstances, no doubt, in which such will be the case.
A good example is Attorney General for Northern Ireland v.

[Page 46]

Gallagher[24], at
p. 382, where Lord Denning observed that a man may not form an intention and
voluntarily, by drink, obliterate his will in order to give himself the Dutch
courage to act in furtherance of that intention. But it is equally true that
there are circumstances where the ingestion of drugs or drink is not reckless
in the relevant sense. An example would be an inexperienced youth drinking with
older companions at their instigation for the first time. Such an offender, who
finds himself having committed a criminal actus reus while incapable of
forming any intent, highlights the artificiality and possible injustice of
presuming intention from the act of ingestion. This becomes clear when one
considers that drinking, as such, is not prohibited nor socially stigmatized in
contem­porary Canadian society. It may well be that an accused knows, or ought
to have known, that drink or drugs makes him prone to certain kinds of conduct.
A man who becomes violent when drunk, or a drug-taker who has reason to believe
he will obliterate his will and hence become a danger to others may be reckless
in the relevant sense. That is a question of fact to be determined in the
circumstances of each particular case and not by the application of what is, in
effect, an irrebuttable presumption against an accused.

Recklessness in a legal sense imports foresight. Recklessness
cannot exist in the air; it must have reference to the consequences of a
particular act. In the circumstances of a particular case, the ingestion of
alcohol may be sufficiently connected to the consequences as to constitute
recklessness in a legal sense with respect to the occurrence of the prohibited
act. But to say that everyone who gets drunk is thereby reckless and therefore
account-able is to use the word ""reckless"" in a non-legal sense and,
in effect, in the case of an intoxicated offender, to convert any crime into
one of absolute or strict liability.

If sanctions against drinking to excess be thought necessary
then, in my view, they ought to

[Page 47]

be introduced by legislation—as in a crime of being drunk and
dangerous—and not by the adop­tion of a legal fiction which cuts across
fundamen­tal criminal law precepts and has the effect of making the law both
uncertain and inconstant. If the point is deterrence from drink then such deter­rence
ought to be specific and precise, in the form of a legislative command.

X

For the reasons which I have sought to express, I have concluded
that it is no longer necessary nor desirable to maintain the fiction of
""specific intent"" and ""general intent"" crimes. From the
acts and statements of the accused and all of the other evidence adduced, the
jury should be entitled to draw inferences as to the mental state of the
accused. The concern is with the mental state of the accused in fact, and not
merely his capacity to have the necessary mental state. Intoxication is one
factor which, with all of the other attendant circumstances, should be taken
into account in determining the presence or absence of the requi­site mental
element. If that element is absent, the fact that it was absent due to
intoxication is no more relevant than the fact of intoxication giving rise to a
state of insanity. The jury should be instructed that it is open to them to
convict if they find that the accused intended to force intercourse
notwithstanding absence of consent, or that he was reckless, in the sense I
have indicated, as to wheth­er she consented or not. If the necessary intent or
recklessness is there, the fact that he acted in a way in which he would not have
acted had he been sober does not assist him at all (see R. v. Sheehan[25],
at p. 312). The jury should also be instructed that if they are not
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had the intent or
recklessness required by law, he should be acquitted. In deciding this
question, they should have regard to all of the evidence including the ages and
background of the accused and the woman, the time and place and circumstances
of the encounter, the conduct and statements at the time and following the
event, the sobriety of each,

[Page 48]

and should draw such inferences therefrom as appear proper in the
circumstances. In the case of an intoxicated or drugged accused, the jury may
have little difficulty in drawing an inference of intent or recklessness in the
relevant sense, but that remains an issue of fact for the jury to determine in
each particular case.

In my opinion, it was wrong for the trial judge in the present
case to withdraw from the jury any consideration of drunkenness. Such evidence
was open for consideration by the jury, as going not to defence but to the
establishment by the Crown of the mental element requisite to a finding of
guilt.

The question remains as to whether the curative provision of s.
613 (1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code should be applied. The appellant’s
degree of intoxi­cation would not appear to have been excessive but there can
be no doubt, as Mr. Justice Bull of the Court of Appeal observed, that he was
intoxicated. The complainant testified that he was ""pretty drunk"" and
midway through the acts alleged ""started to fall asleep."" The degree
of drunkenness and its effect upon the mental state of the accused is a
question of fact, determination of which rests with the jury. I am unable to
say that a properly charged jury could have no reasonable doubt that the
accused, at the critical time, had the mental element essential to culpability.

I would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the convinction [sic]
and direct a new trial.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré
JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.-At a jury trial the appellant was convicted of rape and
his appeal to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia was dismissed unani­mously.
This appeal is by leave of this Court on the following question of law:

That the learned trial judge erred in law in directing the
jury that drunkenness was not a defence to a charge of rape.

[Page 49]

The course of the trial was summarized as follows by Bull J.A.:

It was common ground at the trial, and the jury was properly
so told, that the only real issue was whether or not the sexual intercourse
that admittedly took place was with or without the consent of the complainant,
and whether or not any consent was extorted by threats of fear of bodily harm.
The complainant testified that the coition took place against her will and
objections and only after and because the appellant had threatened her with
bodily harm with a knife. The appellant did not give evidence nor call
witnesses. However, he made a voluntary statement to the police on the Monday,
March 18, 1974, in which he confirmed generally the complai­nant’s recital of
the events which led up to the inter-course, but said that it took place with
her consent and no knife or threats were used. Hence the principal task for the
jury was to determine whether to accept or reject the sworn evidence of the
complainant in the light of the appellant's unsworn allegation of consent and
his denial of force or compulsion.

On the matter of drunkenness, the learned trial judge included in
his charge to the jury this one sentence:

""I should add too at this point, drunkenness is no
defence to a charge of this sort.""

The Court of Appeal considered itself bound by its previous
judgment in Regina v. Boucher[26],
although noting that the view taken in the courts of Ontario seems to be
different (Regina v. Vandervoort[27];
Regina v. Schmidt & Gole)[28].

As it is clearly desirable to settle this conflict of opinion, I
will deal with the points arising out of the main question in the following
order:

1. The distinction between crimes of specific intent and offences
of general or basic intent;

2. Rape as an offence of general intent;

3. Whether there was evidence that the accused was so intoxicated
that he could not form a crimi­nal intent;

4. Whether there was a miscarriage of justice.

[Page 50]

In The Queen v. George[29], Fauteux
J. (as he then was) said (at p. 877):

In considering the question of mens rea, a
distinction is to be made between (i) intention as applied to acts considered
in relation to their purposes and (ii) intention as applied to acts considered
apart from their purposes. A general intent attending the commission of an act
is, in some cases, the only intent required to constitute the crime while, in
others, there must be, in addition to that general intent, a specific intent
attending the purpose for the commission of the act.

Ritchie J. adopted the following passage from Kenny’s Outlines
of Criminal Law, 17th ed., p. 58, para. 42 (at p. 891):

... in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard, [1920]
A.C. 479 ... it was laid down that evidence of such drunkenness as
""renders the accused incapable of forming the specific intent, essential
to constitute the crime, should be taken into consideration, with the other
facts proved, in order to determine whether or not he had this intent"". In
such a case the drunkenness, if it negatives the existence of the indispensable
mental ele­ment of the crime ""negatives the commission of that
crime"". Thus a drunken man's inability to form an intention to kill, or to
do grievous bodily harm involving the risk of killing, at the time of
committing a homicide, may reduce his offence from murder to manslaughter
(which latter crime requires no more than a realization that some bodily harm
may be caused). Drunkenness may likewise show that a supposed burglar had no
intention of stealing, or that wounds were inflicted without any ""intent
to do grievous bodily harm"", or that a false pretence was made with no
""intent to defraud"". But it must be remembered that a man may be so
drunk as not to form an intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm while yet
in sufficient control of his senses to be able to contemplate some harm and so
to be guilty of manslaughter or of an unlawful wounding.

I find it unnecessary to review the numerous authorities
available on the point seeing that they have just been fully dealt with by a
unanimous seven-member House of Lords in Director of

[Page 51]

Public Prosecutions v. Majewski[30].
The facts of the case and the question raised are stated as follows by Lord
Elwyn-Jones, L.C. (at pp. 144-5):

The appellant's case was that when the assaults were
committed he was acting under the influence of a com­bination of drugs (not
medically prescribed) and alcohol, to such an extent that he did not know what
he was doing and that he remembered nothing of the incidents that had occurred.
After medical evidence had been called by the defence as to the effect of the
drugs and drink the appellant had taken, the learned judge, in the absence of
the jury, ruled that he would direct the jury in due course that on the charges
of assault or assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the question whether he
had taken drink or drugs was immaterial. The learned judge directed the jury
that in relation to an offence not requiring a specific intent, the fact that a
man has induced in himself a state in which he is under the influence of drink
and drugs, is no defence. Since the counts for assault did not require proof of
any specific intent, the fact that the accused might have taken drink or drugs
was irrelevant, provided the jury was satisfied that the state which he was in
as a result of drink and drugs or a combination of both was self-induced.

…

The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal against conviction
but granted leave to appeal to your Lord-ships' House certifying that the
following point of law of general public importance was involved:

""Whether a defendant may properly be convicted of
assault notwithstanding that, by reason of his self-induced intoxication, he
did not intend to do the act alleged to constitute the assault.""

Here are now some key passages of the speech with which Lord Diplock,
Lord Simon and Lord Kilbrandon agreed: (at pp. 149-50):

In Attorney-General for Northern Ireland v. Gal­lagher ([1963]
A.C. 349 at p. 380), Lord Denning spoke of

""the general principle of English law that, subject to
very limited exceptions, drunkenness is no defence to a criminal charge nor is
a defect of reason produced by drunkenness ..."".

Gallagher's case was followed by Bratty v. Attorney-General
for Northern Ireland ([1963] A.C. 386), Lord Denning (at p. 410) said:

[Page 52]

"", .. If the drunken man is so drunk that he does not
know what he is doing, he has a defence to any charge, such as murder or
wounding with intent, in which a specific intent is essential, but he is still
liable to be convicted of manslaughter or unlawful wound­ing for which no
specific intent is necessary, see Beard's case ([1920] A.C. 479).""

The seal of approval is clearly set on the passage of the Beard
(at p. 499) decision. In no case has the general principle of English law
as described by Lord Denning in Gallagher's case and exposed again in Bratty's
case been overruled in this House and the question now to be determined is
whether it should be.

I do not for my part regard that general principle as either
unethical or contrary to the principles of natural justice. If a man of his own
volition takes a substance which causes him to cast off the restraints of
reason and conscience, no wrong is done to him by holding him answerable
criminally for any injury he may do while in that condition. His course of
conduct in reducing him-self by drugs and drink to that condition in my view
supplies the evidence of mens rea, of guilty mind cer­tainly sufficient for
crimes of basic intent.

At p. 154, Lord Simon said of what I have quoted above from Fauteux
J.’s judgment in George, that it was ""the best description of
specific intent in this sense that I know"". None of the other Law Lords
sitting differed. I find Lord Edmund-Davies saying (at pp. 167-8):

The undeviating application of logic leads inexorably to the
conclusion that a man behaving even as Lipman [R. v. Lipman, [1970] 1
Q.B. 152] unquestionably did must be completely discharged from all criminal
liability for the dreadful consequences of his conduct. It was, as I recall,
submissions of this startling character which led my noble and learned friend,
Lord Simon of Glaisdale, to comment trenchantly to appellant's counsel:
""It is all right to say 'Let justice be done though the heavens fall'. But
you ask us to say, `Let logic be done even though public order be threatened',
which is something very different"".

Are the claims of logic, then, so compelling that a man
behaving as the Crown witnesses testified the appellant did must be cleared of
criminal responsibility? As to this, Lawton LJ ([1975] 3 All E.R. 296 at p,
305) rightly said:

[Page 53]

""Although there was much reforming zeal and activity in
the 19th century, Parliament never once considered whether self-induced
intoxication should be a defence generally to a criminal charge. It
would have been a strange result if the merciful relaxation of a strict rule of
law has ended, without any Parliamen­tary intervention, by wittling it away to
such an extent that the more drunk a man became, provided he stopped short of
making himself insane, the better chance he had of an acquittal.""

If such be the inescapable result of the strict applica­tion
of logic in this branch of the law, it is indeed not surprising that
illogicality has long reigned, and the prospect of its dethronement must be
regarded as alarming.

II

As previously noted, the view taken by the Court below following
its previous judgment in Boucher differs from the view taken by the
Court of Appeal of Ontario in Vandervoort. In that case, after reviewing
the course of the trial, Aylesworth J.A. said for the Court (at pp. 384-5):

It is clear that one of the essential elements demand­ing
proof in a charge of rape is a specific intent by the accused to have
intercourse without the woman's con-sent. This has been established in a long
line of notable authority; it will be sufficient to refer to one or two cases
only.

In Regina v. Wright (1866), 4 F. & F. 967, 176 E.R.
869, Channell B. charged the jury that rape ""required an intention on his
(accused's) part to commit the act by force against her will"". And see Regina
v. Stanton (1844), 1 Car. & K. 415, 174 E.R. 872. In Rex v. Lloyd (1836),
7 C. & P. 318, 173 E.R. 141, the jury were told by Patteson J. ""In
order to find the prisoner guilty of an assault to commit a rape, you must be
satisfied that the prisoner, when he laid hold of the prosecutrix, not only
desired to gratify his passions upon her person, but that he intended to do so
at all events, and notwithstanding any resistance on her part.""

In my opinion, Aylesworth J.A. erred in saying that a
""specific intent by the accused to have intercourse without the woman’s
consent"" is one of the essential elements demanding proof in a charge of
rape. The three early English cases on which he relied, antedate Beard by
many years. None of

[Page 54]

them was referred to in Beard and drunkenness was not an
issue in any of them. In the earliest, R. v. Lloyd, the charge was not
rape but assault with intent to commit a rape and Patteson J. told the jury
that in order to find the prisoner guilty ""you must be satisfied that the
prisoner, when he laid hold of the prosecutrix, not only desired to gratify his
passions upon her person, but that he intended to do so at all events, and
notwithstanding any resistance on her part."" In the second, R. v.
Stan-ton, again the charge was not rape but assault with intent to commit a
rape and Coleridge J. instructed the jury that the intent required was intent
to have a connexion by force. In the third case, R. v. Wright, Channell
J. charged the jury that rape ""required an intention on his (accused’s)
part to commit the act by force against her will."" I do not consider that
any of these cases is helpful in determining whether rape is a crime of
specific intent, as distinguished from general intent, in the context of
drunkenness.

Aylesworth J.A. then quoted the following pas-sage from Lord
Birkenhead’s judgment in Beard, at p. 504:

""Drunkenness, rendering a person incapable of the
intent, would be an answer, as it is for example in a charge of
attempted suicide. In Reg. v. Moore ((1852), 3 C. & K. 319, 175 E.R.
571) drunkenness was held to negative the intent in such a case and Jervis C.J.
said: 'If the prisoner was so drunk as not to know what she was about how can
you say that she intended to destroy herself?' My Lords, drunkenness in this
case could be no defence unless it could be established that Beard at the time
of committing the rape was so drunk that he was incapable of forming the intent
to commit it, which was not in fact, and manifestly, having regard to the
evidence, could not be contended.""

Aylesworth J.A. then observed:

The ""intent to commit it"" referred to by the Lord
Chancellor is, of course, the intent to commit rape and

[Page 55]

rape imports a specific intent to have intercourse with-out
the woman's consent.

The words from Beard quoted by Mr. Justice Aylesworth were
part of a longer passage in which Lord Birkenhead also said:

For in the present case the death resulted from two acts or
from a succession of acts, the rape and act of violence causing suffocation.
These acts cannot be regarded sepa­rately and independently of each other. The
capacity of the mind of the prisoner to form the felonious intent which murder
involves is in other words to be explored in relation to the ravishment; and
not in relation merely to the violent acts which gave effect to the ravishment.

 

Lord Russell of Killowen, in Majewski, con­sidered the
entire passage and another short pas-sage from Beard reading at p. 507: ""There
was certainly no evidence that he was too drunk to form the intent of
committing rape"" and then said (at p. 172):

In my opinion these passages do not indicate an opinion that
rape is a crime of special intent. All that is meant is that conscious rape is
required to supply ""the felonious intent which murder involves"". For
the crime of murder special or particular intent is always required for the
necessary malice aforethought. This may be intent to kill or intent to cause
grievous bodily harm: or in a case such as Beard of constructive malice,
this, required the special intent consciously to commit the
violent felony of rape in the course and furtherance of which the act of
violence causing death took place. Beard, therefore, in my opinion does
not suggest that rape is a crime of special or particular intent.

Mr. Justice Aylesworth referred also to the deci­sion of the
Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, in R. v. Hornbuckle[31].
In that case, on a charge of rape, MacFarlan J. held:

... a specific intention to commit the crime of rape is, in
my opinion, an essential element or ingredient of the crime of attempting to
commit rape within the meaning of the judgment of the House of Lords in Beard's
Case.

[Page 56]

Lowe and Martin JJ. were of the same opinion. They relied upon
the two passages from Beard which Lord Russell considered in Majewski
and upon the fact that the Crimes Act 1928, s. 456, permitted
the jury to bring in a verdict on the included charge of not guilty of rape but
guilty of an assault with intent to commit rape. Lowe and Martin JJ. found a
possible anomaly in denying the defence of drunkenness to an attempt which
succeeded but in making it available where the crime remained in the attempt.
The judges resolved the anomaly in the following passage:

Analysis of the crime of rape involves at least these
elements, (a) an indecent assault, (b) an intent to have intercourse with the
female without her consent, and (c) the intended assault completed by the
having of inter-course. To hold that knowledge that the act of inter-course was
occurring sufficiently establishes the intent, because the man who knows he is
committing the act must intend it, even if prima facie warranted,
seems to us to fail to distinguish ""intent to have intercourse without the
consent of the female"". Once it is appreciat­ed that the above elements
are involved, the alternative verdict of assault with intent (now specifically
author­ized by the Crimes Act) follows naturally and any basis for the
suggested anomaly disappears.

Canadian law no longer knows of a crime of assault with intent to
commit rape; therefore the possible anomaly which gave Lowe and Martin JJ.
pause need not concern us.

I do not propose to analyze the judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia in R. v. Boucher, supra, in which the Court
concluded that it is no defence to a charge of rape that the accused was too
drunk to know that the complai­nant was not consenting. There are passages in
the judgment which one might question, such as Shep­pard J.A.'s reference to
the failure of the accused to prove that drunkenness resulted in that
degree of incapacity necessary to rebut the presumption of intent (see Woolmington
v. D.P.P.[32]) I
agree, however, with the conclusion reached in Boucher.

[Page 57]

In my view, rape is a crime involving only a general intention as
distinguished from a specific intention and is therefore a crime in which the
defence of drunkenness can have no application.

 

In R. v. Resener[33], the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia held that a specific intent to act
indecently was not an essential ingredient on a charge of indecent assault.
This comports with the English decision in R. v. Burns to which I
referred earlier. In Resener's case, after reference to Boucher and
Vandervoort and to what had been said by Fauteux and Ritchie JJ. in George,
Davey C.J.B.C. said:

Without attempting an exhaustive analysis of their judg­ments,
I consider it follows from them that a specific intent to assault indecently is
not an essential ingredient of the crime of indecent assault, as distinguished
from mens rea, which may be established, among other ways, by a general
intent to assault.

 

R. v. Schmidt & Gole[34] merely
followed Vander­voort but see Bolton v. Crawley[35],
where it was held that the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily
harm did not need a specific intent and that intoxication due to drugs could
not afford a defence.

In R. v. King[36], the
question was whether mens rea was a necessary element of the offence of
driving a motor vehicle while ability to do so is impaired by a drug. The Court
gave an affirmative answer to this question but in the course of a judgment
with which Martland J. agreed, Ritchie J. said (at p. 763):

If the driver's lack of appreciation when he undertook to drive
was induced by voluntary consumption of alcohol or of a drug which he knew or
had any reason-able ground for believing might cause him to be impaired, then
he cannot, of course, avoid the conse­quences of the impairment which results
by saying that he did not intend to get into such a condition, but if the
impairment has been brought about without any act of

[Page 58]

his own will, then, in my view, the offence created by s.
223 cannot be said to have been committed.

The existence of a rebuttable presumption that a man intends
the natural consequences of his own conduct is a part of our law, but its
application to any particular situation involves a consideration of what
consequences a man might be reasonably expected to foresee under the
circumstances.

In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Morgan[37],
the House of Lords considered whether in order to constitute a defence to a
charge of rape an errone­ous belief that the woman was consenting required not
only to be honestly held but also to be reason-able. In a controversial
decision, a three to two division, the majority expressed the opinion that an
honest belief in consent was a defence whether or not that belief was based on
reasonable grounds. All were, however, unanimous in holding that no miscarriage
of justice had occurred because as Lord Cross put it (at p. 353): "".. .
the only real issue in the case was whether what took place in the Morgan's
house that night was a multiple rape or a sexual orgy"". Lord Simon, who
dissented, saw fit to consider, although the others did not, wheth­er rape was
an offence of specific intent. He said (at p. 365):

This brings me to the fourth question, namely wheth­er rape
is a crime of basic or ulterior intent. Does it involve an intent going beyond
the actus reus? Smith and Hogan (Criminal Law (3rd Edn, 1973), p. 47) say No. I
respectfully agree. The actus reus is sexual inter-course with a woman who is
not in fact consenting to such intercourse. The mens rea is knowledge that the
woman is not consenting or recklessness as to whether she is consenting or not.

On the whole, I conclude that the British Columbia Court of
Appeal was correct in differing from the view taken by the Ontario Court of
Appeal that rape is an offence of specific intent.

III

I must now point out that while there is high authority for the
proposition that in some circum­stances it is desirable to express an opinion
on an

[Page 59]

important point of law although it is doubtful whether it can be
said to emerge at all on the facts of the case, I know of no authority holding
that it is ever proper, after dealing with the question of law in itself, to
dispose of the case without pro­ceeding to consider whether on the facts it is
material and if in the event, there is a miscarriage of justice.

In Beard, supra, the question of law was decided adversely
to the accused and, therefore, the convic­tion was restored. However, in Morgan,
as previ­ously noted, the decision was unanimous that, although the trial
judge's direction that belief in consent had to be reasonable was erroneous,
never­theless on the facts as presented by the accused, an honest belief in
consent was inconceivable and there had been no miscarriage of justice.

In rape cases, some consideration should be given to the plight
of a complainant and she must not be subjected to the humiliation of having to
testify again unless justice makes it imperative. Therefore, in the
circumstances, although it is not strictly necessary in view of my conclusion
on the question of law, I wish to say that, even if I held a different view, I
would have to hold that in the instant case there was no evidence that the
accused was drunk to such a degree as to be incapable of forming the intent to
commit rape. Here is what Bull J.A. said:

The evidence was clear that the appellant was intox­icated
(as was the boy friend Lesley) but there was no suggestion that he was in such
a drunken condition either that he did not know what he was doing or that he
would not appreciate that his menacing use of the knife, combined with this insistence
on sexual intercourse, extorted submission or consent to the act. The appel­lant's
position, as voluntarily made to the police, was merely that he ""started
petting"" with her, removed her tampax for her and had intercourse. The
whole statement was clear and concise as to event and details and negated any such
drunken condition.

I do not think that the trial judge’s remark indicates that he
thought there was some evidence of drunkenness going to the extent of an
inability

[Page 60]

to form a criminal intent. (Assuming this is at all possible in a
rape case, see Glanville L. Williams, The Mental Element in Crime (1965), p.
47.) In my opinion, the trial judge merely wanted to guard against the
erroneous view that mere drunken condition could be a defence.

IV

Even if it could be considered that there was some slight
evidence of absence of intent due to impairment of the mind by drink, I would
never­theless hold in this case that there was no miscar­riage of justice. It
is clear that the accused deliber­ately chose to submit to the jury a defence
of consent based on his statement to the police in which he admitted the fact
of intercourse. An accused cannot very well at the same time ask the jury to
believe his statement that the complainant did consent if, at the same time, he
says he was so drunk as not to know what he was doing. In Morgan, the
conclusion was unanimous that the accused could not at the same time ask the
jury to accept that they honestly believed the complainant was consenting in
spite of her resistance when they were also saying that, after initial
resistance, she had indulged in an orgy with them.

I am not unmindful of the rule that it is the duty of a trial
judge to put to the jury every defence available to the accused. However, when
the latter, with the advice of competent counsel, chooses not to raise a weak
alternative defence so as not to prejudice his main defence, it would not in my
view be consistent with the proper administration of justice to allow a new
trial for the purpose of making it possible to raise the alternative ground of
defence.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Hearsay—Accused electing to
stand mute—Admissibility of evidence of polygraph expert as to operation of
polygraph machine and veracity of accused—Applicability of s. 613 (1)(b)(iii)
of Criminal Code.

The appellant P is accused of having murdered
R in August, 1967. He was arrested thereafter but released when R’s wife, who
had seen her husband’s assailant immediately before the murder, was unable to
identify him from photographs or in person. In 1972, P told a friend that he
had stabbed R and subsequently described the course of events to the police.
His confession was admitted in evidence as were the opinions of a psychiatrist
and a psychologist called by the defence to prove that P had a tendency to
invent and to present himself in the worst possible light in order to attract
attention. The psychiatrist’s opinion was based in part on the results of a
polygraph test during which the accused said that he had lied to the police.
The accused himself declined to give evidence and called the polygraphist to
attest to his veracity at the time of the test, which was some two weeks after
the trial began. The trial judge refused to admit the evidence of the polygiraphist
and the accused was found guilty of non-capital murder. The Court of Appeal for
Ontario dismissed his appeal
from that verdict and this appeal was brought with leave of the Supreme Court
on the following question of law: Did the Ontario Court of Appeal err in
holding that the trial judge did not err in refusing to permit the polygraph
expert to testify?

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence J.: There may be circumstances where such evidence would be
admissible, but in the present case such evidence was certainly inadmissible.
If there were any doubt as to its admissibility, it would be proper to apply
the provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code. The
jury rejected

[Page 19]

the psychological evidence, which was based
in part on the results of the polygraph test, and it is therefore not likely
that they would have given any weight to the evidence of the polygraph expert
alone.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: It is well established
that second hand evidence is not admissible when the purpose of introducing it
is to establish its truth, although evidence as to statements made to
psychological experts is often admitted for the limited purpose of showing the
basis for the expert opinion, the polygraph expert however had neither the
qualifications nor the opportunity to form a mature opinion of the accused’s
personality. If the statements had been made to the polygraphist alone they
would be clearly inadmissible and the mere presence of a polygraph machine
which the polygraphist was experienced in using is not enough to make them
admissible. If it were otherwise an accused would be able to elect not to deny
his crime under oath and to substitute for his own evidence the results of a
test administered by a mechanical device.

[Subramanian v. D.P.P., [1956]
1 W.L.R. 965 followed; R. v. Dietrich (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 49; State
of Arizona v. Bowen, 449 P. 2d 603 (1969) referred to; R. v. Wong,
[1977] 1 W.W.R. 1 overruled.]

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario affirming a
judgment of Van Camp J. Appeal dismissed.

D. Crane, Q.C., for the appellant.

J.D. Watt, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence J. was
delivered by

SPENCE J.—I have had the opportunity of perusing
with considerable care the reasons for judgment which are being delivered by
Mr. Justice Ritchie. Since those reasons contain a detailed analysis of the
facts and issues in the present appeal, I need not repeat them.

The polygraph expert John Reid was presented to
give evidence on behalf of the accused, who had not testified in his own
defence, and to give his opinion that this accused, when examined by him during
the course of the trial and with the aid of the polygraph equipment, was telling
the truth when he stated that he had lied earlier in his statement to the
police. I am ready to agree that

[Page 20]

such eidence under those circumstances was not
admissible. I reserve my view as to whether, under other circumstances,
evidence given by an operator of a polygraph apparatus could ever be
admissible. There may be circumstances where such evidence should be admitted
but certainly the evidence proposed to be given by Mr. Reid in this appeal was
hearsay evidence of the worst self-serving type.

Were I in any doubt as to the correctness of the
view which I have expressed, I would certainly be of the opinion that it would
be proper to apply the provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code.

The defence was permitted to adduce the evidence
of Dr. Julio Arboleda, a duly qualified medical practitioner specializing in
the field of psychiatry. After a lengthy voir dire, Dr. Arboleda
was permitted to give his opinion based on two psychiatric interviews he had
with the appellant, on certain psychological tests which had been given to the
appellant by a Dr. Michael Girodo who also testified for the appellant, and
upon the results of the polygraph tests taken by John Reid. Therefore, the
result attributed by the expert defence witness to the polygraph tests was
already before the jury and, in my view, before that jury in a much more
persuasive fashion that it could ever have been put by a non-medical witness.
It is very evident that the jury refused to accept the opinions expressed by
Dr. Arboleda and Dr. Girodo and one could not therefore have expected them to
have had any regard for the polygraph results which were only one of the
materials upon which the expert witness Dr. Arboleda based his opinion.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought with leave
of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal from the
verdict of guilty of non-capital murder entered against the appellant after a
trial before Madam

[Page 21]

Justice Van Camp sitting with a jury. Leave was
granted on the following question of law:

Did the Ontario Court of Appeal err in
holding that the trial judge did not err in refusing, especially in the
particular circumstances, to permit the polygraph expert to testify about the
operation of the polygraph machine and to give his opinion as to the accused’s
veracity when he confessed to the murder.

The circumstances giving rise to this
prosecution are somewhat singular in that the alleged murder was committed on
August 9, 1967, whereas the trial was not held until November, 1972.

The murdered man, Léopold Roy, was the
superintendent of an apartment house at 275 Friel
 Street in Ottawa and was also employed by the City of Ottawa as a fireman. In the afternoon of August 9, 1967, his wife, who had been
engaged in housework in the apartment house, observed a suspicious man lurking
in the corridor and, as she thought, attempting to enter one of the apartments.
She noticed that the man was holding an alligator wallet which raised her
suspicion and she called out to her husband who was working in the basement.
The prowler appeared to be nervous and didn’t move, but when she called out to
her husband a second time and could hear him coming upstairs, the man ran
through the hallway to the back stairs, jumped over the railings to the landing
and Mr. Roy caught him and shoved him back into a corner and called out to his
wife “You know what to do”. Mrs. Roy then went down to her apartment and left
her husband holding the man on the stairway. The next thing she heard was a
call from her husband saying: “Don’t call the police, call a doctor”.

The next person to see Roy was Mr. Herbert, the oil burner serviceman who had come to clean
the furnace and who had been talking to Roy when his wife first called out to him. After finishing his work
this man found Roy lying on the
basement stairs covered with blood and with a knife wound immediately below his
heart. Herbert went outside to his truck and radioed his company to send the

[Page 22]

police but Roy was dead by the time the first
policeman arrived.

Shortly after these events, Mrs. Roy, who had
seen the prowler’s face three times, made several attempts to identify him in
“line-ups” where the appellant was present and in photographs, but she was
unable to make any positive identification and the appellant was released.

It was not until January, 1972, that the
appellant told his friend, Neil Miller, that he had stabbed the superintendent
in the apartment house on Friel Street in 1967 with a knife which he had taken from the kitchen of an
apartment that he had broken into. Neil Miller took this story to the police
and on January 11th and 12th, 1972, the appellant was interviewed by the
police, and after having been duly cautioned, made a statement as to his
actions on the afternoon of August 9, 1967. The learned trial judge found this
confession to be admissible after having conducted a voir dire concerning
the circumstances under which it was made, and it will be seen that the
appellant’s actions on the afternoon in question as recounted to Miller and to
the police, bear a striking resemblance to the actions of the “prowler” in the
apartment building as described by Mrs. Roy, as is illustrated by the following
brief excerpt from the appellant’s confession to the police:

…then I drove around, looking for an
apartment that I could go into, to steal. I got into one apartment on Friel Street, looked around inside, in
which I did not find any money. I had taken a knife from the kitchen of that
apartment. Going down the back stairs, I notice a man and a woman. The man
started coming down at me, I stabbed him. From there I ran to my car…

In any event, there is no denial of the fact
that the appellant’s statements related to the murder at 275 Friel Street on August 9, 1967. The
appellant elected to give no evidence, but in lieu thereof expert witnesses
were called for the defence, including a psychiatrist and a psychologist whose
evidence was directed to showing that the appellant had a deranged personality
and particularly that he would have a tendency to invent and attest

[Page 23]

to circumstances which never happened in order
to satisfy his desire to attract attention to himself. These witnesses,
together with John Edward Reid, an experienced polygraph examiner, were
obviously called to support the contention that the appellant had been lying
when he confessed to the police; this was the opinion expressed by the latter
at trial on the basis of his interpretation of recordings shown on the
polygraph machine when he administered a polygraph test to the appellant and it
is this evidence which was excluded by the learned trial judge.

The evidence of Dr. Girodo, a clinical
psychologist from the Faculty of Psychology at the University of Ottawa, was to
the effect that he had subjected the appellant to a number of standard tests,
no one of which is ever 100 per cent reliable, and as a result of these tests
he had formed the opinion that the appellant was psychologically unstable and
had a tendency to present himself in the worst possible light.

Dr. Arboleda, who is a specialist in psychiatry,
based his opinion on two psychiatric interviews which he had personally had
with the appellant, in one of which the appellant had been given some sodium
amytol, sometimes loosely referred to as a truth drug. The witness also
considered the psychological tests administered by Dr. Girodo and the results
of the polygraph test. Dr. Arboleda testified that the results of Mr. Reid’s
test with Mr. Phillion indicated that he had lied to the police when he
confessed to the offence in question and he expressed his opinion in the
following terms:

From the results of the two tests given him,
I would say they support to the idea that he was actually lying to the police.
That is all I can. (sic)

The evidence of both these medical witnesses was
admitted by the learned trial judge in reliance on such cases as The Queen v.
Lupien[1],
Wilband v. The Queen[2],
Toohey v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner[3], and R. v. Rosik[4]. No appeal was

[Page 24]

asserted from this ruling and any issues which
it may raise form no part of the question upon which leave to appeal was
granted in the present case.

It is well settled that second hand evidence is
not admissible when the object of calling it is to establish its truth. This
was clearly stated in the Privy Council in the case of Subramaniam v. Public
Prosecutor[5], where
it was said, at p. 970:

Evidence of a statement made to a witness
by a person who is not himself called as a witness may or may not be hearsay.
It is hearsay and inadmissible when the object of the evidence is to establish
the truth of what is contained in the statement. It is not hearsay and is admissible
when it is proposed to establish by the evidence, not the truth of the
statement, but the fact that it was made.

Statements made to psychiatrists and
psychologists are sometimes admitted in criminal cases and when this is so it
is because they have qualified as experts in diagnosing the behavioural
symptoms of individuals and have formed an opinion which the trial judge deems
to be relevant to the case, but the statements on which such opinions are based
are not admissible in proof of their truth but rather as indicating the basis
upon which the medical opinion was formed in accordance with recognized
professional procedures.

Entirely different considerations, however,
apply to the evidence of Mr. Reid who was neither a psychiatrist nor a
psychologist and does not appear to have had any other medical training. The
evidence indicates that he only saw the accused on the occasion when he
administered the polygraph test which was the day before he gave his evidence.
This means that the appellant was subjected to the test on the 3rd of November 1972, during the closing days
of his trial for murder which was opened on the 16th of October.

The polygraph evidence which was sought to be
introduced is accurately recorded in the judgment of the Court of Appeal as
follows:

Q. Mr. Reid, on the basis of your
experience and the recordings that you made of Mr. Phillion, during

[Page 25]

the course of the polygraph test, did you
form an opinion as to whether he was telling the truth when he answered no to
the relevant questions?

A. I am of the opinion that he is telling
the truth when he answered no to the relevant questions.

Among the relevant questions were the following:

‘Did you stab Léopold Roy on August 9th, 1967?

Did you kill Léopold Roy on August 9th, 1967?’

In my view, Mr. Reid had neither the
qualifications nor the opportunity to form a mature opinion of the propensity
of the man he was subjecting to the test either as to truthfulness or
otherwise. His opinion, however, was not based on the statements made by the
appellant, but on his own expertise in interpreting the recordings of the
machine. If the statements had been made to Mr. Reid alone, there is in my
opinion no doubt that they would have been inadmissible as self-serving, second
hand evidence tendered in proof of its truth on behalf of an accused who did
not see fit to testify and I am not prepared to hold on the evidence of this
case that the presence of the polygraph machine or the expertise of its
operator made them admissible. The admission of such evidence would mean that
any accused person who had made a confession could elect not to deny its truth
under oath and substitute for his own evidence the results produced by a
mechanical device in the hands of a skilled operator relying exclusively on its
efficacy as a test of veracity.

The elementary right of an accused not to give
evidence is in no way at issue here, but that right having been exercised, it
appears to me to run contrary to the basic rules of evidence to permit the
substitution of the opinion of a polygraph technician for the evidence which
could have been given by the appellant himself. I do not consider that this
view conflicts in any way with that expressed by Gale, C.J.O., in R. v. Dietrich[6], at p. 65, but if I thought
otherwise I would have to say,

[Page 26]

with great respect, that that case, was to that
extent, wrongly decided.

For these reasons alone I am satisfied that the
learned trial judge was correct in excluding the results of the polygraph test.

I should not leave this matter, however, without
indicating that I have had an opportunity to read a great many American
authorities on the subject of the reliability and hence the admissibility of
such answers given in the course of polygraph examinations. I find that in the
vast majority of cases the American courts have excluded this type of evidence
except in cases where both parties to the proceeding have stipulated that they
are prepared to have the anwers accepted.

There can be no doubt that improved polygraph
techniques have been developed over the years, but this does not appear to have
altered the attitude of the American courts. I cite in this regard the case of State
v. Bowen[7], a
decision of the Court of Appeals of Arizona where the then current position with respect to polygraph evidence
was characterized at p. 606 in the following terms:

There is no question but that evidence of,
or reference to, a polygraph test is in admissible for any reason. All
authorities are in accord. Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 86
S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed 2d 908 (1966); State v. McGee, 91 Ariz. 101, 370 P. 2d 261 (1962).

The present attitude of the American courts
towards the acceptance of polygraph evidence is discussed in the following
passage from the evidence of Mr. Reid:

Well, it has been admitted a number of
times over the objection of opposing counsel, but not a great number of times.
Now, I have had the experience of possibly three different cases where it was
admitted over the objection of opposing counsel, but most times it is done under
stipulation by both sides.

And he later said:

[Page 27]

Well, it appears that the attitude of the
Courts of our country is greatly changing. True, up until the present time it
was hardly even considered by stipulation. I don’t know what number of cases it
is accepted at the present time under stipulation, it might be five or six.

These are the opinions expressed by a polygraph
examiner from the United States
with thirty‑two and one half years’ experience who was presented to the
court as a definitive authority on the operation of the polygraph machine and
its reliability and acceptability.

In the comparatively recent case of U.S. v.
Ridling[8], Mr.
Justice Joiner, District Judge of the U.S. District Court of Michigan, wrote a
lengthy opinion in which he finally concluded that polygraph evidence should be
admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule. In the course of rendering these
reasons, the learned judge said (at p. 93):

Judicial opinions pertaining to the
admission of polygraph testimony seem all to point toward exclusion.

and he proceeds to cite seventeen cases in
support of this statement. Finally, Mr. Justice Joiner deals with the hearsay
rule in connection with this kind of evidence and says of the polygraph expert
there called:

In another sense, he must report to the
jury the statements made by the subject so as to make his opinion relevant to
the issue in the case, and as a result of his expertise and the tests conducted
he must indicate his opinion of the truthfulness of the statement. In this sense
the statements supported by the opinion of the expert appear to be hearsay but
since the very purpose of the test is to determine truthfulness, the evidence
should be admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule because of its high
degree of trustworthiness.

No such exception to the hearsay rule exists in
this country and notwithstanding the fact that I have had the benefit of
reading the exhaustive reasons

[Page 28]

for judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Meredith
in the case of R. v. Wong[9], at
p. 1, I am nevertheless unable to agree with the view that polygraph evidence
should be admitted. As I am satisfied in the present case that the learned
trial judge was not in error in refusing to allow the polygraph expert to give
his opinion as to the accused’s veracity, it follows that his evidence about
the operation of the machine is irrelevant, and was also properly excluded.

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN

Criminal law — Form of information — Whether accused
reasonably informed of allegation against him — Whether accused had opportunity
to adduce full defence on fair trial — Criminal Code, ss. 510, 732(1) and (3)
and 755(4).

The accused was charged with failing to provide a
breath sample contrary to s. 235(2) of the Criminal Code, the words ""without
reasonable excuse"" being omitted from the information. No objection was
made to this omission and a defence of reasonable excuse was tendered and
rejected by the magistrate. The accused appealed to the District Court on the
ground inter alia, that the magistrate erred in holding that he did not
have a reasonable excuse and a trial de novo was ordered. At the second
hearing the accused tendered the same defence and again made no objection to
the information as laid. The accused was convicted a second time and appealed
to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan on the ground that the judge erred in
holding that his excuse was not reasonable. At the hearing the Court of Appeal
gave the accused leave to add the ground that the information was incomplete
and on that basis quashed his conviction. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court
was granted on the question of law whether the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan
erred in failing to consider the application of ss. 732(1) and (3) and 755(4)
of the Code.

Held: The appeal should be allowed and the
convic­tion restored.

Per Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and de Grandpré JJ.: An accused must be reasonably informed of the charge
against him. In the case at bar the information complied with the requirements
of s. 510(5) of the Criminal Code in that all the relevant facts were
cited and were related to the offence defined in s. 235(2) of the Code. The
accused was clearly informed of the true nature of the charge and
therefore had the opportunity to adduce a full defence. Furthermore,

[Page 9]

in the case of The Queen
v. Major, decided by this Court fourteen months after the decision of the
Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, a similar situation, somewhat more favourable
to the accused, arose and it was held by this Court that if an essential
element that was omitted from a charge has been proved and there has been no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, a conviction should be confirmed.
In the case at bar the factual situation is so similar that the result must be
the same and the question of law defined in the order granting leave must be
answered in the affirmative: the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan erred in
failing to consider ss. 732(1) and (3) and 755(4) of the Code. Although
leave to appeal on the ground that the Court of Appeal also erred in holding
that the words ""without reasonable excuse"" were required in the
information was refused, this does not mean that the views of the Court of
Appeal on that point are confirmed. Section 730 of the Criminal Code might
lead to another conclusion.

Per Spence and Dickson JJ.: The information com­plied
with the requirements of s. 510(5) of the Criminal Code, the accused was
reasonably informed of the charge against him and he had the opportunity to
adduce a full defence. The Queen v. Major [1977] 1 S.C.R. 826, referred
to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1],
allowing an appeal by the respondent from the dismissal of his appeal by way of
trial de novo following his conviction for refusing to provide a breath
sample contrary to s. 235(2) of the Criminal Code. Appeal allowed and
conviction restored.

 

E. G. Ewaschuk, for the appellant. Orest Rosowsky, for the
respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré
JJ. was delivered by

DE GRANDPRÉ J.—The respondent was charged with the following
summary conviction offence:

THE INFORMANT SAYS THAT he has reasonable and probable
grounds to believe and does believe that Wilfred James COTE, Carpenter of Kamsack,
Sas­katchewan, on or about the 20th day of SEPTEMBER A.D. 1973, at Canora in
the Province of Saskatchewan

[Page 10]

did refuse to comply with a demand by a peace officer to provide
a sample of breath suitable for analysis to determine if any, the proportion of
alcohol in his blood, contrary to Section 235(2) of the Criminal Code.

The information, it will be seen, omits any refer­ence to the
words ""without reasonable excuse"" which are contained in s. 235,
subs. 2 of the Criminal Code. No objection was made to the information
by the respondent who tendered a defence of reasonable excuse, which was
rejected by the magistrate.

The respondent appealed his conviction to the District Court.
Several grounds were mentioned in the notice of appeal, the only relevant one
alleging error in the holding that Côté ""did not have a reasonable excuse
to refuse to comply with the demand"". At the trial de novo, the
respondent again made no objection to the information and again tendered the
same defence of reasonable excuse, which was rejected.

In the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan,
the only ground is stated in the following terms:

The learned Judge erred in holding that a person upon which
a demand for a sample of breath has been made does not have a reasonable excuse
to refuse to supply the sample even when he has affirmatively shown that he had
not been driving the motor vehicle nor had he been in care or control of the
motor vehicle.

Counsel informed us that only that point was argued before the
Court of Appeal, Côté not rais­ing the contention that the information did not
disclose an offence known to law. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal, without
calling upon the parties, granted leave to amend the notice of appeal so as to
raise this additional ground and quashed the conviction. The reasons for that
conclusion are contained in the following paragraph (21 C.C.C. (2d) 474 at p.
475):

It is to be noted that the information does not contain the
words ""without reasonable excuse"". The mere fail­ure or refusal to
comply with a demand made pursuant to s. 235(1) does not constitute an
offence under s. 235(2); to constitute an offence the failure or refusal
must be ""without reasonable excuse"". As the informa­tion does not
include this essential averment, it does not

[Page 11]

allege an offence under s. 235(2) and therefore the
conviction thereon cannot stand.

It is indeed unfortunate that the Court of Appeal did not have
the benefit of the arguments in depth submitted to this Court and for which we
are indebted to counsel. As it is, we are left in the dark as to the views of
that Court on the question of law upon which leave to appeal was granted by
this Court:

Did the Court of Appeal err in failing to consider the
application of the provisions of subss. (1) and (3) of s. 732 and subs. (4) of
s. 755 of the Criminal Code in the circumstances of the appeal to that
Court?

Subsections (1) and (3) of s. 732 and subs. (4) of s. 755 of the Criminal
Code read:

732. (1) An objection to an information for a defect
apparent on its face shall be taken by motion to quash the information before
the defendant has pleaded, and thereafter only by leave of the summary
conviction court before which the trial takes place.

…

(3) A summary conviction court may, at any stage of the
trial, amend the information as may be necessary if it appears

(a) that the information has been laid

(i) under another Act of the Parliament of Canada instead of
this Act, or

(ii) under this Act instead of another Act of the Parliament
of Canada; or

(b) that the information

(i) fails to state or states defectively anything that is
requisite to constitute the offence,

(ii) does not negative an exception that should be negatived, or

(iii) is in any way defective in substance,

and the matters to be alleged in the proposed amendment are
disclosed by the evidence taken on the trial; or

(c) that the information is in any way defective in form.

755. (4) The following provisions apply in respect of
appeals, namely,

[Page 12]

(a) where an appeal is based on an objection to an information
or any process, judgment shall not be given in favour of the appellant

(i) for any alleged defect therein in substance or in form, or

(ii) for any variance between the information or process and the
evidence adduced at the trial,

unless it is shown

(iii) that the objection was taken at the trial, and

(iv) that an adjournment of the trial was refused
notwithstanding that the variance referred to in subparagraph (ii) had deceived
or misled the appel­lant; and

(b) where an appeal is based on a defect in a convic­tion or
order, judgment shall not be given in favour of the appellant, but the court
shall make an order curing the defect.

In their present form, these texts were introduced by the
amendments of 1953-54 (the numbers were then ss. 704 and 727). The previous
enactments were somewhat different. For that reason, judg­ments rendered on the
prior legislation should be used with great care.

It is apparent that s. 732 is meant to be a replica in the case
of defective informations of s. 529 dealing with defective indictments.
Accordingly, both parties have referred us to practically every reported case
dealing with one or the other of these sections. It is unnecessary to make a
review of these cases; suffice it to say that, in my view, the judgments
applying the rule against duplicitous informations and indictments constitute a
class by themselves and cannot really help in the determi­nation of the case at
bar.

Of course, s. 732 comes into play only if there is a defect in
the information. Appellant submits that none exists, the words ""without
reasonable excuse"" being brought to the attention of the accused by the
specific reference to the section of the Crimi­nal Code creating
the offence. Appellant invokes subs. 5 of s. 510, which also applies to infor­mations:

A count may refer to any section, subsection, paragraph or
subparagraph of the enactment that creates the offence charged, and for the
purpose of determining

[Page 13]

whether a count is sufficient, consideration shall be given
to any such reference.

I agree with that submission; the golden rule is for the accused
to be reasonably informed of the transaction alleged against him, thus giving
him the possibility of a full defence and a fair trial. When, as in the present
case, the information recites all the facts and relates them to a definite
offence identified by the relevant section of the Code, it is impossible
for the accused to be misled. To hold otherwise would be to revert to the
extreme technicality of the old procedure.

 

The foregoing is enough to dispose of the appeal. However, the
parties have studied in depth the question defined in the order for leave and I
feel bound to express my views on their submissions. Assuming a defect in the
information and given the silence of the accused as to that point both in the
Magistrate Court and in the District Court, was the Court of Appeal right in quashing
the conviction?

The judgment of the Court of Appeal was ren­dered on December 23,
1974. On February 25, 1976, in The Queen v. Major unreported[2],
this Court dealt with the question raised by this appeal, namely the
omission of an essential element of the offence in the information. In my
opinion, the factual situation in Major and that in the case at bar are
so similar that the result must be the same. It is even possible to hold that
in Major, the circumstances were more favourable to the accused. They
are to be found in the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of
Nova Scotia reported at 25 C.C.C. (2d) 62, particularly in the opinion of the
Chief Justice. For my purpose, it is sufficient to summarize them as follows:

1) the information was seriously defective omitting entirely
a vital averment (the information, instead of alleging failure to report to
anyone at the scene, alleged only failure to report to the other driver);

[Page 14]

2) no motion to quash was made before plea at the trial
before the magistrate or before the trial de novo in County Court;

3) the trial was conducted by both Crown and defence as if
the missing averment had been present.

On these facts, the Court of Appeal was unani­mously of the view
that the conviction should be affirmed if the absence of the averment had
caused no substantial wrong, nor miscarriage of justice, provided, however,
that this essential ele­ment of the offence omitted from the charge had been
proven. The majority of the Court of Appeal, Macdonald J.A. concurring, were of
the opinion that there was no such evidence whereas Cooper J.A., dissenting,
was of the view that there was enough evidence to support the conviction.

On appeal to this Court, the Crown, of course, had only one point
to submit, namely that Cooper J.A. was right in his dissenting opinion, the evi­dence
being sufficient to support a conviction. On the other hand, respondent, as was
undoubtedly his right, supported the conclusion of the majority as to the lack
of evidence and raised again with considerable vigour the defence that the
omission of an essential element of the offence in the infor­mation is fatal.
He developed the submission in his factum and referred to the major decisions
on the point, namely Brodie and Barrett v. The King[3];
R. v. Leclair[4], R.
v. Wixalbrown and Schmidt[5]; R.
v. Breland and George[6]; R.
v. Hunt, Nadeau and Paquette[7]. He
also referred to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the case at bar. At the
conclu­sion of the submissions by appellant and by respondent, the Chief
Justice, speaking for the full bench, stated:

We do not need to hear you in reply, Mr. Gale. We agree with
Mr. Justice Cooper and, accordingly, this appeal is allowed, the judgment of
the Nova Scotia Appeal Division is set aside and the conviction is restored.

[Page 15]

In my view, this recent decision of our Court settles the matter
with the result that the question of law defined in the order granting leave
must be answered in the affirmative. It was an error on the part of the Court
of Appeal to fail to consider the application of the relevant provisions of s.
732 and s. 755 of the Criminal Code in the circumstances of the case and
to hold that the information did not disclose an offence known to law.

Before leaving the matter, I wish to make two observations, both
related to our decision in Major.

First, the Court of Appeal in that case did not feel that the
reference in the information to the relevant section of the Criminal Code is
in itself sufficient to make an information complete when it does not in
words recite all the elements of the offence. In the context of that appeal,
this Court did not have to deal with that precise point, being of the opinion
that the conviction had been proper­ly entered, the information and the
evidence being sufficient for the purpose. In my view, for the reasons
mentioned above, particularly in the light of s. 510 of the Criminal Code, this
particular conclusion of the Court of Appeal of Nova Scotia does not truly
represent the law.

The second point. Cooper J.A., in his dissenting reasons,
concluded not only that the evidence was sufficient but also that the
information should be amended to include the omitted averment. In allowing the
appeal and restoring the conviction, we did not see the need of amending the
informa­tion. This is in accord with the text of s. 732, subs. 1, of the Criminal
Code. Any information which omits words found in the relevant enactment
creat­ing the offence, contains a defect apparent on its face. If no objection
is taken by motion to quash before the defendant has pleaded, and if a defence
on the merits is tendered, the matter ends there and there is no need to amend
the information.

A further point. The respondent never alleged that he was
prejudiced by the omission of the words ""without reasonable excuse""
from the infor­mation and the Court of Appeal has made no

[Page 16]

finding of prejudice. The case at bar has been argued by
respondent on the basis that no valid proceedings could flow from an
information void ab initio. No question of miscarriage of justice was
raised.

Finally I must note that the Crown in its motion for leave had
also submitted that the Court of Appeal had erred in holding that the words
""without reasonable excuse"" were required to be set out in the
information. Leave was refused as to that point. This refusal does not amount
to a confirma­tion of the views of the Court of Appeal thereon. Section 730 of
the Criminal Code might lead one to another conclusion. However, because
of this refusal, I have examined the question defined in the order granting
leave as if the words ""without reasonable excuse"" did not
amount to an ""excep­tion, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification
prescribed by law"", thus not entering upon an examination of s.
730. I wish to make it clear, however, that in my mind this point is still
open.

I would allow the appeal and restore the conviction.

The judgment of Spence and Dickson JJ. was delivered by

SPENCE J.—I have the privilege of reading the reasons to be
delivered by my brother de Grandpré and I am in agreement with his conclusion
that the appeal should be allowed. I do so for the reasons first outlined in
the judgment of my brother de Grandpré, namely, that the particular form of the
information in the present appeal complied with the provisions of s. 510 of the
Criminal Code in that it referred to a section and subsection of the Criminal
Code and also outlined all the facts. I am also in agreement that the
accused had been rea­sonably informed of the transaction alleged against him
and had the opportunity to adduce a full defence upon a fair trial. In my
opinion, as my brother de Grandpré points out, the above conclu­sion is
sufficient to dispose of the appeal.

Unlike my brother de Grandpré, I am not of the opinion that I
should deal with the other matters outlined in the question upon which leave to
appeal was granted.

[Page 17]

The Queen v. Major, a judgment rendered by this Court on
February 25, 1976, and apparently unreported[8], was an
oral judgment delivered after the argument and, in my view, dealt only with the
difference of opinion between the majority and minority in the Appeal Division
of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. That difference of opinion was, as my
brother de Grandpré pointed out, upon the question of whether there had been
sufficient evidence adduced to prove an essential element of the offence
charged. In allowing the appeal, this Court, in my view, dealt only with that
question of sufficiency of evidence so I am not ready in this appeal to express
any view upon the effects of ss. 732 and 755 of the Criminal Code.

As I have said, I would allow the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Extraordinary
remedies—Prohibition—Application for prohibition and motion to quash—Criminal
Rules requiring return of all documents—Failure of Provincial Court to make the
return—Right of Provincial Court to proceed further on failure to make
return—Ontario Criminal Appeal Rules 4-8—Criminal Code, s. 714.

Appellant was charged on April 3, 1975, with
impaired driving and was brought before the Provincial
 Court on the same day. Problems arose with fixing a
date for trial. After new informations charging the same offences had been laid
on July 17, 1975, and the
accused appeared on September 12, 1975, the case was rewarded for a week. On
September 19 again no trial date was fixed and then on September 26, despite
objections by the defence, a further adjournment was directed “to set a date
for the trial”. On September 29, 1975, appellant moved to quash to order adjourning the case, to quash
the proceedings and to prohibit any Provincial Court Judge from proceeding with
the matter. The notice of motion was served on the Provincial Court Judge with
the endorsement prescribed by Rule 6 of the Ontario Criminal Appeal Rules requiring
him to make a return of the record to the Supreme Court. The motion to prohibit
was made returnable on October 10, 1975, in accordance with the Rules. However
on October 3 the Provincial Court Judge before whom the matter came directed
that the trial proceed on October 8. Counsel for appellant did not draw to the
Court’s attention that he had moved for prohibition. On October 8, on being
advised of the motion the case was set over to October 15 to set a new trial
date. Because the transcript of proceedings (Rule 8) was not ready there were
several consent adjournments of the motion eventually to December 5, 1975. Neither appellant nor his
counsel appeared before the Provincial Court on October 15. A different Provincial Court Judge presided and a
new Crown counsel appeared and asked for a bench warrant for the arrest of the
appellant. The arrest was made but

[Page 989]

appellant released on a recognizance of $500
with one surety. The case was then remanded for one week to December 11, 1975.
On December 5 a second notice of motion was brought seeking to quash the
warrant of arrest, set aside the order for a recognizance and the recognizance,
asking for prohibition and asking that the return required Rule 7 be made. Both
motions were then adjourned to December 12 and then to December 23. The remand
date of December 11 had intervened and, while neither appellant nor his counsel
appeared and the judge issued a bench warrant, counsel who had previously
appeared for him addressed the Court as amicus curiae and objected that
the Court had no jurisdiction to make any order in the matter before it. The
judge suggested that the execution of the warrant be postponed pending
termination of the prohibition proceedings. That same afternoon the case was
called again and an order sought and made for forfeiture of appellant’s bail.
This resulted in a third notice of motion for prohibition. All three motions
were dismissed on December 23 on the basis that the service of the notices of
motion to prohibit did not deprive, suspend or strip of jurisdiction the Provincial
Court Judge. The subsequent appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal without
reasons.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Judson, Spence and Dickson JJ.: The argument by the Crown that if the
effect of a motion for prohibition and for an order to quash is to suspend the
jurisdiction of the Provincial Court Judge pending disposal of the motion,
there would be a stultification of criminal proceedings in the Provincial
Courts, was not persuasive. Such an argument could equally apply to any
proceedings, civil or criminal, available to challenge the jurisdiction of an
inferior Court Judge, and Superior Courts are well able to control abuses of
process should they occur or recur. However the matter is regarded there must
be a suspension of jurisdiction when an application to quash or an application
to prohibit and to quash is served on an inferior court with the command, under
the rules, to make a return forthwith. The judge compelled to make the return
cannot go on with the matter before him until the application to the Superior
Court is disposed of. While not holding that there was any loss of jurisdiction
in the Provincial Court

[Page 990]

the unexplained delay by the Provincial Court
Judges to make the return forthwith had the same effect as if a return was
properly made whereupon jurisdiction was suspended. Hence the Provincial Court had no power to order the
arrest of the accused, no power to require that he enter into a recognizance of
bail and no power to order forfeiture of bail. Jurisdiction over the accused in
respect of the charges was not however lost by the Provincial
 Court.

Per Martland,
Richie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: The main issue is the
effect of the service of a notice of motion for prohibition and to quash
proceedings pending in the Provincial Court on the jurisdiction of that Court,
in a case where the judge served with the notice has neglected to make the
return required by Rule 7 forthwith to the Registrar of the Supreme
Court. If the Provincial Judge complies with the mandatory direction in Rule 7
he is left with nothing on which to proceed with the case and can take no
further steps concerning it unless or until the order is refused in which event
the clerk of the court refusing the motion is authorized to return the matter
to the jurisdiction from which it was removed in terms of s. 714 of the Criminal
Code. Notwithstanding any differences which may exist between civil and
criminal proceedings by way of certiorari, s. 714 contemplates the subsistence
of the Provincial Court’s
jurisdiction between service of the notice and disposal of the motion by the
Supreme Court. The jurisdiction continues, though dormant, at least until such
time as the motion is granted. The failure of the Provincial Court Judges to
make the required return may well be the subject of other proceedings but could
not be treated as affecting the continued jurisdiction of that Court which is
recognized by the Criminal Code.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing without
reasons an appeal from a judgment of O’Driscoll J. dismissing three motions for
prohibition. Appeal allowed to the extent of setting aside the warrant of
arrest, the recognizance of bail and the forfeiture of bail.

[Page 991]

H.J. Keenan, for the appellant.

Jeff Casey, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Judson, Spence
and Dickson JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This Court is concerned in
this appeal with the main ground on which the appellant has challenged the
decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal affirming, without written reasons, the
judgment of O’Driscoll J. dismissing three motions by the appellant for
prohibition directed to certain Provincial Court Judges and seeking also orders
quashing informations charging offences under ss. 234 and 236 of the Criminal
Code. That ground relates to the effect of service of such a motion as
aforesaid, made pursuant to Rules 4 and 5 of the Ontario Criminal Rules, upon
the jurisdiction of a Provincial Court Judge to proceed with pending charges,
and to the effect upon his jurisdiction of his failure to make a return
forthwith to the Registrar’s Office of the Supreme Court of Ontario, as
prescribed by Rule 7 of the Criminal Rules.

The appellant raised other issues in this
appeal, including a contention that a Provincial Court Judge was powerless to
grant more than one adjournment under s. 738(1) of the Criminal Code, at
it stood at the time of the proceedings herein, but this Court did not call
upon the respondent Crown to deal with them, being unanimously of the opinion
that they were without merit in the present case. I would add, parenthetically,
that an amendment to the Criminal Code, enacted by 1974-75-76 (Can.), c.
93, s. 43 as s. 440.1, and which came into force on April 26, 1976, after the
proceedings in this case commenced, now provides that there is no loss of
jurisdiction by a failure to comply with the provisions of the Criminal Code
relating to adjournments or remands.

It is said by the Crown, on the point in issue
in this appeal, that if the appellant is correct in his submission that the
effect of service of a notice of motion for prohibition and for an order to
quash is to suspend the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court Judge, pending
disposition of the motion, there would be a stultification of criminal
proceedings in

[Page 992]

the Provincial Courts, a means of paralyzing
criminal process. This argument, of itself, is hardly persuasive and is an
argument, really in terrorem, which can be made with respect to any
proceedings, civil or criminal, which are available to challenge the
jurisdiction of an inferior Court Judge to proceed with a matter before him.
Superior Courts are well able to control abuses of process if they occur and if
they recur. The issue raised by the appellant must be dealt with on its merits,
and there is, apparently, a need to do so to provide guidance in this area of
the law.

There is no doubt, on the record herein, that
there were tactical moves involved in connection with the charges laid against
the accused, a jockeying or manoeuvering on adjournments that could easily have
been cut off if any one of the Provincial Court Judges before whom the
proceedings successively came had simply asserted his authority and given
peremptory directions for trial both to the Crown and to the accused. That,
unfortunately, was not done until the accused had been before the Court for
four successive weeks on the new informations sworn against him when those
first laid were declared nullities on a date fixed for trial thereon. Moreover,
it was not until the third notice of motion to prohibit and to quash was
brought that the Provincial Court Judge to whom it was directed made the return
required by Ontario
Criminal Rule 7. There was an interval of more than
two and one half months (from October 1, 1975 to December 18, 1975) between the launching of
the first and third motions.

I turn to the chronology of events in this case.
The accused was charged on April 3, 1975, was brought before the Provincial
Court on the same day, and, on indication by him that he wished to retain
counsel, the case was adjourned to April 17, 1975 (presumably by consent) to
set a date for trial. On the latter date, the accused appeared with counsel and
it was agreed that the trial would proceed on July 9, 1975. When the case then
came on before Judge Munro, objection was taken to the informations as being defective
on their face. Crown counsel it was who said they were nullities,

[Page 993]

and the informations were quashed accordingly.
Two new informations charging the same offences were laid on July 17, 1975 and the accused was summoned to
appear on September 12, 1975.

Counsel for the accused wished to proceed at
that time but Crown counsel stated that the case was “not marked for trial
today”, and he added “This is the first time up, and it is merely to set a date
for trial” and further (when defence counsel objected) “That is the standard
procedure”. Again defence counsel insisted on going on and appealed to the
Court for a ruling, adding that it was unfair to the accused to be put off
again and contending that in view of the previous proceedings September 12 must
be taken as a trial date. The Crown was not ready with any witnesses and the
trial judge, Judge Rennicks, said he would follow “the practice here... that on
the first time up he would be granted an adjournment”. It was of course “the
first time up” on the new informations but not the first time up for the
charges against the accused.

It is clear from the exchanges of counsel at the
time that defence counsel felt that the criminal process was being abused, but
when Crown counsel asked him if he had a trial date to suggest he said “no”,
and refused to consent to the Crown’s suggestion of November 18, 1975. It is obvious to me that
the proper course for the trial judge to have taken was to fix a trial date but
instead he remanded the matter to September 19, 1975 to set a date for trial.
Defence counsel then said “Might that be a date to commence trial?”, whereupon
Crown counsel said that his police officer witness was on holidays but “he’ll
be here in November”. Defence counsel objected and refused again to consent to
have the case go over to November 18, more than two months away. The Court then
said “Well then all I can do is to remand it for a week”. That, however, was
far from being all he could do.

[Page 994]

On September 19, 1975, the case came up again
before a third Provincial Court Judge, Judge Newall, and the Crown too was
represented by a third counsel. There was again a contention by the defence
that the trial should go on but the matter had been marked to set a date for
trial. The Crown, wishing to go on with other cases, asked that defence counsel
consent to trial on November 21, but when the latter refused Crown counsel said
“I am suggesting one week, September 26th to set a date”. Defence counsel asked
“Can we have a trial at some stage of these proceedings, Your Honour?” The
Court did not fix a date but simply accepted Crown counsel’s suggestion to put
the case over for a week, and the last entry on the transcript is Crown
counsel’s statement “To set a date for trial”. There is legitimate ground to
wonder who was in charge of the Court’s proceedings.

So the case came back on September 26, and
although this time the Judge was the same, a fourth counsel appeared for the
Crown. It seems to me that he misstated the position when he said, referring to
what occurred on September 19, “there was no consent to the adjournment last
time and we had to put it over till today”. What defence counsel wanted was a
trial date to be fixed by the Court and not another adjournment to fix a trial
date. During the proceedings on September 26, defence counsel referred again,
as he had on the earlier occasions, to an alleged representation to him by the
Crown that the charges would not be re-laid. Crown counsel said he knew nothing
of this and would check, and the matter was stood down temporarily to enable
him to do so. When it was called again after a recess, this is what the
transcript discloses:

MR. KRUPNIK [Crown Counsel]: Returning
to the matter of Fred Batchelor, Your Honour, I’ve tried to get in touch with
Mr. Applegath who is the acting Crown in the Scarborough
 Court, but he was in the process of proceeding with a
trial and could not get out to speak to me. I have therefore spoken to
Mr. Peter Rickaby of the Crown Attor-

[Page 995]

ney’s office of this Judicial District and
advised him of the facts. He in fact remembered speaking to Mr. Batchelor
and advised him that the Crown would be proceeding in this matter, and he also
advised Mr. Evans of that fact.

THE COURT: I am going to put this matter
over for obvious reasons and I think you know what they are Mr. Evans.

MR. EVANS: I would be obliged if you
would put it on the record for what reason you are putting it over. I might
indicate at this time I don’t see the point in putting it over.

THE COURT: I can’t deal with the matter for
obvious reasons.

MR. KRUPNIK: Your Honour, this is not
a trial date, this is just a date to set a date.

And so, again, despite objections by the
defence, and the Court not taking the matter in hand, an adjournment was
directed by Judge Newall to October 3, 1975, Crown counsel stating without any remark on the matter by the
Court that it was to set a date for trial. In his factum in this Court, counsel
for the Crown said that Judge Newall disqualified himself and adjourned the
matter accordingly, but I do not find this in the transcript of the particular
proceedings, although it appears from the subsequent proceedings on October 3
that Crown counsel had told the Judge on September 26 that the Crown wanted to
proceed against the accused because he had a record, and it was because of this
disclosure that Judge Newall said that he could not hear the matter.

Of course, the Judge was precluded by s. 738(1)
of the Criminal Code from adjourning the matter for more than eight days
unless there was consent for a more extended enlargement but a trial date could
have been indicated, and, lacking consent, there could be adjournments made
within the terms of s. 738(1) to bring the parties to that date.

On September 29, 1975 the accused moved to quash
the order adjourning the case and to quash the proceedings, and also to
prohibit Judge Newall or any other Provincial Court Judge from proceeding with
the matter. The notice of motion questioned the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court to

[Page 996]

make repeated adjournments, the allegation being
that there was no proper exercise of judicial discretion in allowing the
adjournments and that there was undue hardship on the accused, amounting to a
denial of natural justice, when he had been ready on four successive occasions
to proceed to trial. The notice of motion contained the endorsement prescribed
by Rule 6 of the Ontario Criminal Rules, as follows:

By virtue of Rule 7 of Part I of the Rules
Respecting Criminal Proceedings of the Supreme Court of Ontario, you are, upon
receiving this notice, to return forthwith to the Registrar’s Office at
Toronto, the Orders herein referred to, together with the information, exhibits
and other papers or documents touching the matter, as fully and as entirely as
they remain in your custody, together with this notice and the certificate
prescribed in the said Rule.

An affidavit of service of the notice of motion
on Judge Newall on October 1, 1975 was sworn on October 2, 1975. The motion was made returnable on October 10, 1975, this being in accordance with
the Ontario Criminal
Rules.

It will be convenient to set out the relevant
Rules at this point, they being Rules 4 to 8 inclusive:

4. (1) Proceedings in criminal matters by
way certiorari, mandamus and prohibition shall be brought by originating
notice, and may include an application to quash a conviction, order, warrant or
inquisition, and an application for discharge of a person in custody.

(2) Such proceedings shall be brought
before a Judge of the High Court of Justice sitting in court.

5. Notice of a motion that includes an
application to quash shall be served within thirty days of the conviction,
order, warrant or inquisition sought to be quashed, shall be returnable within
ten days of service of the notice of motion, and shall be served at least seven
days before the return day thereof upon the judge, Provincial Judge, justice or
justices making the conviction or order, or issuing the warrant, or the coroner
making the inquisition, and upon the informant (if he is not a peace officer),
and upon the Attorney General (if he is not the applicant). The notice shall
specify the objections intended to be raised, and no other objections may be
raised save by leave of the Judge hearing the matter.

[Page 997]

(Note: as to other notices of motion, see
Rules 215-217 of Practice and Procedure.)

6. Upon a notice of motion under Rule 5
shall be endorsed a notice in the following form, addressed to the judge,
Provincial Judge, justice or justices, or coroner as the case may be:

“By virtue of Rule 7 of Part I of the Rules
Respecting Criminal Proceedings of the Supreme Court of Ontario, you are, upon
receiving this notice, to return forthwith to the Registrar’s Office, at
Toronto, the conviction (or as the case may be) herein referred to, together
with the information, exhibits and other papers or documents touching the
matter, as fully and as entirely as they remain in your custody, together with
this notice and the certificate prescribed in the said rule.

for the Applicant

To: A.B.

                                                     Provincial
Judge at

                                                                              (or
as the case may be)”

7. Upon receiving the notice so endorsed,
the judge, Provincial Judge, justice or justices, or coroner shall forthwith
return to the Registrar’s Office at Osgoode Hall, Toronto, the conviction,
order, warrant or inquisition, together with the indictment, information,
exhibits and any other papers or documents touching the matter, and the notice
served upon him with a certificate attached thereto in the following form:

“Pursuant to the accompanying notice, I
herewith return to this Honourable Court the following:

“1. The indictment or information;

“2. The conviction (or as the case may be);

“3. The exhibits;

“4. Any other papers or documents touching
the matter.

“And I hereby certify to this Honourable
Court that I have above truly set forth all exhibits, papers and documents in
my custody or power relating to the matter set forth in the said notice of
motion.”

8. (1) The documents listed in the
certificate together with the transcript of the proceedings (if any be supplied
by the applicant) shall have the same effect as a return to a writ of
certiorari.

(2) The Judge hearing the application may
direct a further or amended return.

Before the return date of the motion, the
accused appeared again with counsel before the

[Page 998]

Provincial Court, this time before Judge McEwan,
on October 3, 1975. Again there were exchanges between counsel (the same Crown
counsel this time who had appeared on September 26 and the same counsel who had
appeared for the accused throughout) but the Judge took a stronger stand than
the Court had exhibited previously and directed, peremptory to the Crown, that
the trial proceed on October 8. Counsel for the accused did not disclose the
fact that he had moved for prohibition, a matter that ought certainly to have
been drawn to the Court’s attention.

When the case was called on October 8, the same
Crown counsel appeared but another counsel appeared for the accused, a partner
of accused’s previous counsel. Crown counsel immediately advised the Court, the
Judge being Judge Camblin, of the motion to quash and for prohibition
returnable on October 10, said he was ready to proceed but suggested that in
view of the motion the case should be adjourned to some day after the motion
was heard. Defence counsel contended that there was nothing the Provincial Court could do because the
record ought to have been returned to the Supreme Court and that Court would
decide whether the case would be returned to the Provincial
 Court for hearing. Judge Camblin feared that if he did
nothing jurisdiction might be lost and so he put the case over to October 15 to
set a new trial date.

The motion for prohibition came before the Weekly Court in Toronto on October 10, 1975
but was adjourned on consent to October 23 because the transcript of the
proceedings (referred to in Criminal Rule 8) was not ready. Successive
adjournments, apparently for the same reason, were made on consent on October
23 and November 13, the adjournment on the latter date being to December 5, 1975.

The accused did not appear before the Provincial Court on October 15 nor was
counsel there on his behalf. A different Provincial Judge presided and a new
Crown counsel appeared who asked immediately for a bench warrant for the arrest
of the accused. There was no reference to the motion for prohibition in the one
page transcript of the proceedings. The Judge directed issue of the war-

[Page 999]

rant. The accused was arrested on December 4, 1975 and taken before Judge Gardhouse
who, on the suggestion of Crown counsel, directed that the accused be released
on entering into a recognizance in the amount of $500 with one surety. Duty
counsel appeared for the accused and accepted this as satisfactory, and the
case was then remanded for a week to December 11, 1975.

On December 5, 1975, the adjourned date of the
first motion for prohibition a second notice of motion as of that date, was
brought before Osler J. seeking to quash the warrant of arrest and to set aside
the order for a recognizance and also the recognizance, asking for prohibition,
and also asking that Judge Newall or any other Provincial Judge make the return
required by Criminal Rule 7. This second notice of motion was served on the
agent of the Attorney‑General present at that time and also on Judge Gardhouse,
Osler J. having directed abridgement of the time for service on Judge
Gardhouse.

Osler J. adjourned both motions for prohibition
to December 12, 1975, noting on
the record that this was by reason of the failure of the Provincial Judge to
forward the record as required by Criminal Rule 7. On December 12, 1975, the
two motions for prohibition were further adjourned on consent to December 23, 1975.

In the meantime, the remand date of December 11
intervened, and Crown counsel who had appeared on September 26, October 3 and
October 8, informed Judge Bigelow, who was presiding in the Court, that
prohibition proceedings had been taken. Crown counsel had been advised by
counsel for the accused that it was not likely the accused would appear and so
Crown counsel intended to ask for a bench warrant. Judge Bigelow first
expressed doubt whether he could issue such a warrant in view of the fact that
the Supreme Court of Ontario
had prohibition proceedings before it. After being told that the accused was
supposed to appear so a trial date could be set, Judge Bigelow issued the
warrant, saying that was the only way jurisdiction could be retained. Although
the accused did not appear on December 11 nor was he represented, counsel who
had appeared for him on October 8 asked to address the Court as amicus

[Page 1000]

curiae and
thereupon objected that the Court had no jurisdiction to make any order in the
matter before it. Judge Bigelow was inclined to agree, but after hearing from
Crown counsel he suggested that execution of the bench warrant be postponed
pending termination of the prohibition proceedings and to be governed by the
outcome of the prohibition proceedings.

This seemed to be satisfactory but in the
afternoon of December 11 the accused’s case was called again and, he not
appearing, an order was sought and made that the bail he had given after being
arrested on December 4, 1975 be forfeited. On December 18, 1975, a third notice
of motion for prohibition, dated December 17, was served on Judge Bigelow and a
copy delivered to the Attorney-General, returnable on December 23, 1975. This notice of motion, in
addition to asking for an order of prohibition, asked that the warrant of
arrest and the estreat of bail be set aside and, as well, the recognizance of
bail entered into on December 4, 1975.

On December 23, 1975 the three motions for
prohibition came before O’Driscoll J. who dismissed all of them, stating that

The service of a notice of motion to
prohibit the Provincial Court
judge did not deprive, suspend or strip him of jurisdiction, although he may
have proceeded thereafter at his own peril.

In my view, there was nothing said, done or
happened in the Provincial Court that brought about any loss or lessening of
the jurisdiction of that court to hear the two outstanding charges against the
accused Applicant. Consequently, each of the three applications to prohibit
will be dismissed.

He refused to make an order as to costs because
of “the failure of those at the Provincial Court to carry out the terms of the Rules Respecting Criminal
Proceedings”. As to this failure, he remarked:

Under no circumstances could I, nor do I
wish to be taken as having placed any stamp of approval upon the actions of
those in the Provincial Court, Old City Hall, Toronto, who have chosen to
disregard or ignore the provisions of Rule 7 under Rules Respecting Criminal

[Page 1001]

Proceedings from October 1, 1975, until
approximately mid-December, 1975. On the hearings before me, Counsel for the
Attorney General was unable to give any reason, let alone any satisfactory
reason, for the lateness of the return, nor was he able to explain why the Provincial Court judges involved did not
sign the certificates as required by Rule 7 (supra).

However, he castigated counsel who had appeared
for the accused prior to October 8, 1975 as having acted in a way “designed and
intended to obfuscate the proceedings before the various Provincial Court
Judges”, a harsh assessment in my opinion if based on that counsel’s
unwillingness to consent to Crown counsel’s convenience as to a date for trial.
Further, he characterized the motions for prohibition as coming perilously
close to an abuse of process.

O’Driscoll J.’s short reasons contained no
exposition of the effect of service of a notice of motion for prohibition upon
the jurisdiction of a Provincial Court Judge, or of the effect on jurisdiction
of a Provincial Court Judge’s failure to make a return. The Court of Appeal saw
nothing in the case that warranted any reasons for judgment on these matters,
probably because a return had been made on or about December 22, (even if
irregular because the certificate was signed by a court clerk) and was before
O’Driscoll J. on December 23, 1975. In my opinion, the two matters deserve
consideration in the light of the law as it was when prohibition and certiorari
involved two-step procedures, and in light of the fact that there is now no
need to ask first for issue of a writ and, especially, in light of the terms of
Criminal Rule 8 providing that the return required by Rule 7 together with the
transcript of proceedings (if any be supplied by the applicant) shall have the
same effect as a return to a writ of certiorari.

The Rules of Practice of the Quebec Court of
Queen’s Bench (Crown Side), S1/74-53, effective June 1, 1974 take a clear and direct line
on the matters aforesaid. Section 19 of those Rules provides

[Page 1002]

Service of the motion suspends proceedings
in the inferior tribunal but the Judge may at any time, even on an ex parte application,
give an order permitting such proceedings to continue.

Section 20 of the Quebec Rules directs
transmission of the record of the case immediately after service of the motion
and, in this respect, is similar to Ontario Criminal Rule 7.

Although the Ontario Rules do not speak clearly on
whether or when prohibition and certiorari proceedings have a suspensive
effect on proceedings in the inferior Court, the obvious resort is to consider
what is the effect, in this connection, of a return to a writ of certiorari,
within the meaning of Ontario Criminal Rule 8. I note here that although
for convenience of reference, I have referred to the three motions brought on
behalf of the accused as motions for prohibition they each include applications
to quash, as is permitted by Ontario Criminal Rule 5, and were in conformity
with Rule 6, requiring the return of the record forthwith as is provided by
Rule 7.

I note too that the concern here is with
criminal not civil proceedings, and hence pronouncements in respect of civil
proceedings such as that made by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Re Cedarvale
Tree Services Ltd. and Labourers’ International Union[1], at p. 49, are not applicable. In that
case, Arnup J.A. speaking for the Court said this, speaking of administrative
tribunals of an adjudicative character:

It is also clear law that such a tribunal
is not required to bring its proceedings to a halt merely because it has been
served with a notice of motion for an order of certiorari or
prohibition. It is entitled, if it thinks fit, to carry its pending proceedings
forward until such time as an order of the Court has actually been made
prohibiting its further activity or quashing some order already made by which
it assumed jurisdiction.

Arnup J.A. went on to refer to and to discuss Re
Holman and Rea[2], but
did not make any point of the fact that it concerned prohibition in respect of
criminal proceedings (a summary trial of the accused), the prohibition being
sought by the com-

[Page 1003]

plainant and not by the accused. He noted that
the Ontario Divisional Court, in the reasons of Middleton J. (the others
agreeing in the result), put the suspension of proceedings on a basis of
courtesy rather than on an obligatory basis where the magistrate purports to
proceed with the matter before him, although knowing his jurisdiction is
disputed and even after having been served with a notice of motion for
prohibition. This is a correct view since Middleton J. said, clearly enough
(after observing that it would have been more consistent with judicial dignity
to have enlarged the hearing until the question of jurisdiction had been
determined) that “there is no power in the Court to stay proceedings in an
inferior Court pending the hearing of the motion” (at p. 439). However,
Middleton J. cited in support In re Miron v. McCabe[3], which involved prohibition arising out of
a purely civil matter, a claim in a Division Court whose jurisdiction was disputed.

In his reasons in Re Holman and Rea Middleton
J. observed, at p. 438, that “counsel failed to point out any
section authorizing the adoption of the course pursued in this case. The
case, therefore, falls to be determined upon general principles”. At the time
that Re Holman and Rea was decided, prohibition was not within the Ontario
Criminal Rules, being introduced into them only on May 7, 1973 when the
present Rules were passed effective September 1, 1973. Although s. 533 of the Criminal
Code of 1892 authorized the making of Rules respecting prohibition as well
as respecting other prerogative writs (the power is now found in s. 438 of the Criminal
Code), the Ontario Rules, passed March 27, 1908 dealt only with motions to
quash. They included, however, the provisions which are now found in Ontario
Criminal Rules 5, 6, 7 and 8. In Re Holman and Rea, so far as appears,
the motion in that case did not include an application to quash, as is the case
here.

Notwithstanding the view taken in Re Holman
and Rea that an inferior court ought to desist as a matter of courtesy when
it is aware of the chal-

[Page 1004]

lenge to its jurisdiction brought before a
superior court, the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Hannon v. Eisler[4], a case dealing with custody proceedings,
said speaking through Coyne J.A. (at p. 195) that “as a general rule I think it
can be laid down that the inferior tribunal is bound to desist on application
for prohibition in the Queen’s Bench and while an appeal is pending in the
Court of Appeal from a decision thereon if the tribunal is aware of [the]
application or appeal because, among other reasons, such an appeal is ‘a step in
the cause or matter in which it is taken’: Court of Appeal Rule 1; and the
cause or matter is not complete until after the step, if undertaken is
completed”.

Arnup J.A. said in the Cedarvale case
that Re Holman and Rea was followed in Hannon v. Eisler. That was
so, but not on the point under discussion here. Middleton J. was followed only
in so far as the right to have prohibition was concerned, but he was not
followed on the question of the suspensive effect of service of a notice of
motion for prohibition on the proceedings in the inferior court. The two cases
clearly diverge on this question.

The Rules of the Alberta Supreme Court
respecting Crown Practice are similar to the present Ontario Criminal Rules. There is provision for moving by notice of motion without first
seeking a rule or an order nisi; there is provision for service and for
endorsing on the notice of motion a notice requiring a return forthwith of the
record, and there is a requirement that the magistrate or justice make the
return forthwith to the clerk of the Supreme Court with an endorsed certificate
in a prescribed form specifying what is in the return. The relevant Rules
conclude with Rule 866 which states that “the certificate shall have the same
effect as a return to a writ of certiorari”. In Frankel v. The Queen[5], the Alberta Appellate Division held that
an application for prohibition with certiorari in aid, directed to a
magistrate in respect of criminal proceedings before him, has the effect, upon
service of the application upon him, of

[Page 1005]

suspending the criminal proceedings but that the
Court, upon disposing of the application and dismissing it where it has no
merit, may make an order by way of procedendo and send the proceedings
back to the magistrate to continue with the matter that was before him.

It is clear from this judgment that the Alberta
Appellate Division, although concerned as its reasons disclosed, about possible
abuse in the resort by an accused to extraordinary remedies, felt that it was
obliged to respect the proceedings so taken by an accused but would deal with
them speedily to avoid undue delay in the carrying out of judicial processes.
It does not appear from the reasons whether the magistrate in the Frankel case
made the required return to the application for prohibition with certiorari in
aid. Ex facie, the Alberta Appellate Division’s reasons treat the mere
service of the notice of motion upon the magistrate as sufficient to suspend
his jurisdiction pending disposition of the motion; and if this is so, then, a
fortiori, is there a suspension upon the return of the record to the
superior court since there is nothing then left before the inferior court upon
which it can proceed.

The relevant inquiry is then whether the
inferior court can continue to exercise its jurisdiction by refusing or failing
to make the return which the Rules require to be made “forthwith”? That court
cannot be in a better position by non-compliance with a statutory duty than it
would be in if the duty had been carried out. O’Driscoll J.’s mild admonishment
of the inferior court in this case for ignoring the requirements of Criminal
Rule 7 for about two and one-half months was followed by his briefly stated
conclusion that service of the notice of motion for prohibition “did not deprive,
suspend or strip him of jurisdiction, although he may have proceeded thereafter
at his own peril”. I do not understand these concluding words unless they
relate to the eventual successful outcome of the accused’s application for
prohibition. Moreover, there is, in any event, no question of a complete loss
or deprivation of jurisdiction, but only of suspension while the prohibition
proceedings are on foot; and, if there is a suspensive effect,

[Page 1006]

the Provincial Court need be under no fear (as
Judge Camblin was) that it will lose jurisdiction if it does not keep bringing
the accused back within successive eight day periods; its jurisdiction can be
re‑asserted immediately upon the dismissal of the prohibition
proceedings.

This is provided by s. 714 of the Criminal
Code, which is in Part XXIII dealing with extraordinary remedies.
Section 714 is as follows:

714. Where a
motion to quash a conviction, order or other proceeding is refused, the order
of the court refusing the application is sufficient authority for the clerk of
the court forthwith to return the conviction, order or proceeding to the court
from which or the person from whom it was removed, and for proceedings to be
taken with respect thereto for the enforcement thereof.

Clearly, this section, which was in the original
Criminal Code of 1892 as s. 895, makes it unnecessary to invoke the old
procedure of a procedendo which the Alberta Appellate Division resorted
to, apparently ex abundanti cautela, in the Frankel case. Of
course, the fact that a procedendo was necessary under the old procedure
was indicative of the need for some affirmative direction by the superior court
to enable the inferior court to re-assert its jurisdiction.

I come, at long last, to consider what
significance is to be attached to Ontario Criminal Rule 8 providing that the
return under the certificate (prescribed by Rule 7) “shall have the same effect
as a return to a writ of certiorari”. At common law, a writ of certiorari
had to be authorized by an order of the Court upon an application for the
issue of the writ. The order having directed the issue of the writ, the
inferior court was directed by the writ to return the record of the challenged
proceedings together with the writ to the superior court. An order or rule nisi
followed requiring the Judge of the inferior court to show cause why the
application to quash should not succeed. Following a hearing on the matter, the
rule nisi would be discharged or made absolute in favour of the
applicant. Statutory and Rule modifications of the procedure were introduced
over the years. For example, in England, the application for the writ

[Page 1007]

to quash a summary conviction could be made ex
parte and an order nisi obtained requiring the inferior court to
show cause: see Short and Mellor, The Practice of the Crown Office (2nd
ed. 1908), pp. 49-57. Procedural changes in the Provinces of Canada resulted in
dispensing with the need for an order or rule nisi: see Tremeear, Criminal
Code (6th ed. 1964), pp. 1286‑1289. An indication of the older
practice in Ontario before the introduction of the modern simplified procedure
may be gleaned from R. v. Cluff[6]; and
see also Daly, Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice (3rd ed. 1936),
pp. 405-421 (and especially the Forms at pp. 413-421).

The material point for present purposes is that
the common law was clear that upon the service of the writ of certiorari upon
the Judge of the inferior court the proceedings before him out of which they
arose were suspended: see 4 Blackstone, Commentaries (1st ed. reprint),
Book IV, c. 24, p. 315; Paley, Summary Convictions (9th ed. 1926), p.
835; Seager, Criminal Proceedings Before Magistrates (3rd ed. 1930), p.
451.

When the Ontario Judges adopted their Criminal
Rules of 1908 and provided therein for a simplified procedure in respect of
certiorari to quash which, upon a return being made, would be dealt with
on the merits by the superior court (and thus displace the elaborate procedure
of first seeking a writ of certiorari, to which, if issued, a return
would be made, and then going back for a hearing on the merits), a question was
raised in R. v. Titchmarsh[7],
whether the rule-making authorization in the Criminal Code empowered the
Judges to abolish the writ of certiorari and to substitute the
simplified procedure of a notice of motion. The power to do so was upheld by
the Ontario Appellate Division. Riddell J., speaking for the Court, pointed out
that although the writ of certiorari was abolished, the remedy remained,
and it was the remedy that the Criminal Code was concerned with. As he
put it, under the Rules “the remedy

[Page 1008]

exists; the manner of obtaining it is
different—that is all” (at p. 578).

As in criminal matters so too in civil matters,
the complex common law procedure, regulated though it was by Rules, was
displaced in Ontario (and
elsewhere in Canada) by the
simple notice of motion: see, now, The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1970, c.
228, s. 69. Accused persons and civil law litigants were thus empowered to
operate the machinery of the Court, without the Court’s prior intervention, and
to require the presiding Judge of the inferior court to make a return to
process issued unilaterally by them.

In the Frankel case, the Alberta
Appellate Division applied the common law rule to the simplified procedure that,
similar to that of Ontario, is
prescribed in the Alberta Rules on Crown Practice. In short, although there is
now no prior order of a Court for issue of a writ of prohibition with certiorari
in aid, the service of an authorized application for such a remedy was
given the same suspensive effect upon the proceedings in the inferior Court as
was given at common law upon service of a writ of certiorari granted by
order of the Court. An illustration of this result under the common law
practice a few years before the Ontario Criminal Rules of 1908 were
promulgated is seen in R. v. Foster[8].
There the accused was convicted of a liquor offence after a trial in his
absence, and a warrant of commitment was issued for his imprisonment pursuant
to the sentence imposed upon him. The day prior to the conviction and sentence,
a writ of certiorari for which the accused had obtained an order a few
days earlier was served on the Judge and Crown Attorney. There was apparently a
return to the writ and the discharge of the accused from custody was sought on
the return of a writ of habeas corpus. The discharge was ordered by
Street J. who said that “the proceedings against Robert Foster were removed
from the Court below by the certiorari issued on 30th January, 1903
and served on Judge Bell on the 2nd February, 1903 and that the subsequent
proceedings taken before him were void” (at p. 627). He

[Page 1009]

restated the principle at the conclusion of his
reasons, as follows (at p. 628):

...as there appears to have been no authority
in the Court below to issue the commitment under which the prisoner is held,
after the proceedings before it had been removed by certiorari, there must be
an order for his discharge from custody.

I am not aware of any other effect at common law
of a return to a writ of certiorari than that the inferior court, having
nothing before it, was powerless to continue with any proceedings against an
accused. The common law did not make suspension of inferior court proceedings
contingent upon a return to the writ but as following from mere service
thereof. There may have been some misunderstanding of the situation when the
1908 Rules were promulgated, these Rules having abolished the writ of certiorari
altogether, as noted in R. v. Titchmarsh; and it may have been
thought that by reason of the simplified procedure the direction for a return
of the record would make it abundantly clear that thereafter the inferior court
was powerless to proceed. As put by Létourneau, The Prerogative Writs in
Canadian Criminal Law and Procedure (1976), at p. 161:

...in criminal law, the transmission of the
record of the proceedings to the superior court, as required to be made
forthwith by most rules of court on an application for certiorari, in fact
operates as a stay of proceedings.

The author goes on to say that the inferior
court is deprived of its jurisdiction to resume the proceedings as, after the
removal, nothing is left before it. I think it more accurate to say that the
proceedings are merely suspended pending the outcome of the contest in the
superior court; jurisdiction will indeed be lost if the application to prohibit
and quash is successful but, if not, it survives.

It seems to me that, however the matter is
regarded, there must be a suspension of jurisdiction when an application to
quash or a combined application to prohibit and to quash is served on

[Page 1010]

the inferior court with the command, under the
Rules, to make a return forthwith. The Judge, compelled to make the return,
cannot, unless he risk disobedience with its attendant consequences, go on with
the matter before him until the application to the superior court is disposed
of by dismissal thereof.

The result to which I would come in this case
may be shortly stated. I do not hold that there was any loss of jurisdiction in
the Provincial Court, but it is
my opinion that the unexplained and seemingly flagrant disregard by Provincial
Court Judges of the obligation cast upon them to make a return forthwith had
the same effect as if a return was properly made whereupon jurisdiction was
suspended. Hence, there was no power to order the arrest of the accused, no
power to require that he enter into a recognizance of bail, no power to order
forfeiture of bail. I would, accordingly, allow the appeal to the extent of setting
aside the warrant of arrest, the recognizance of bail and the forfeiture of
bail. Otherwise, I do not subscribe to the contentions of counsel for the
appellant that jurisdiction over the accused in respect of the charges against
him has been lost. The record should accordingly be returned to the Provincial Court so that the charges may be
tried and, I hope, with some expedition. I would also direct that an order of
protection of the various Provincial Court Judges issue under Criminal Code,
s. 717.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and de Grandpré JJ., in which Dickson J. also concurred, was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice in which he has accurately
recounted the very complicated set of facts giving rise to this appeal and as
he has also reproduced Rules 4 to 8 inclusive of the Ontario Criminal Rules,
(hereinafter referred to as “the Rules”) it will be unnecessary for me to
recite them again in full.

The main issue in this appeal is the effect of
the service of an originating notice for prohibition and to quash certain
proceedings pending in the Pro-

[Page 1011]

vincial Court on the jurisdiction of that Court,
in a case where the judge upon whom the notice is served has neglected to ‘‘forthwith
return to the Registrar’s Office at Osgoode Hall, Toronto, the conviction,
order, warrant or inquisition together with the indictment, information,
exhibits and any other papers or documents touching the matter...” as he is
required to do by the terms of Rule 7.

There is no doubt in this case that the
necessary notice and endorsement were duly served on the Provincial Court
Judges in accordance with the requirement of Rule 6 and it follows that upon
receiving the notice so endorsed, the Judges were seized with the duty to
return the requisite documents forthwith to the Registrar under Rule 7.

It appears to me that if the Provincial Judge
complies with the mandatory direction contained in Rule 7 to return all papers
touching the matter before him forthwith on receipt of the notice, he is left
with nothing upon which to proceed with the case and, as a practical matter, he
can take no further steps concerning it unless or until the order is refused by
the Judge of the Supreme Court who hears the motion, in which event the clerk
of that Court is authorized to return the proceeding to the jurisdiction from
which it was removed in accordance with s. 714 of the Criminal Code to
which the Chief Justice refers and which reads as follows:

714. Where a
motion to quash a conviction, order or other proceeding is refused, the order
of the court refusing the application is sufficient authority for the clerk of
the court forthwith to return the conviction, order or proceeding to the court
from which or the person from whom it was removed, and for proceedings to be
taken with respect thereto for the enforcement thereof.

Notwithstanding any differences which may exist
between civil and criminal proceedings by way of certiorari, and apart
from procedural problems which may arise in determining the effect to be given
to “a return of a writ of certiorari” under Rule 8, I am satisfied that s. 714
contemplates the subsistance of the Provincial Court’s jurisdiction between the
service of the notice and the disposal of the motion by the Supreme Court. This
section

[Page 1012]

in my view constitutes recognition by the
Parliament of Canada of the
continuation of this jurisdiction, though dormant, at least until such time as
the motion is granted. If it were otherwise the provisions for return of the
proceedings in the event of the refusal of the application would be
meaningless.

The second question raised by this appeal is
whether the unjustified and unexplained conduct of the Provincial Court Judges
in failing to make a return as they were required to do by Rule 7 is to be
treated as extinguishing that Court’s jurisdiction. I cannot accept the
suggestion that a Judge can obliterate the jurisdiction of his Court by
disobeying mandatory rules governing his conduct. It may well be that mandamus
would lie to compel such an official to comply with his duty, but the
persistent disregard of that duty by Judges cannot affect the continued
jurisdiction of the Court which is recognized by the Criminal Code.

It has been suggested that if the service of a
notice to quash in accordance with the Criminal Rules has the effect of
suspending the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court until it is disposed of in
the Supreme Court, the result will be that an accused person by his own act
could interrupt the course of his trial and stultify the proceedings against
him. In my view this suggestion presupposes that the Rules will be disobeyed by
the Judges in that no return will be made in accordance with Rule 7. It is,
however, not to be lightly assumed that the direction contained in the notice
served under Rule 6 would be ignored by a Provincial Judge and the
circumstances which developed in the present case must be regarded as
exceptional. If the return is made forthwith, I think it may be taken that the
motion will be dealt with expeditiously in the Supreme Court. In my opinion,
the proceedings are not brought to a halt by service of the notice, and if the
rules are complied with, the period of interruption of the hearing before the
Provincial Judge will be minimal.

For these reasons I would dispose of this appeal
in the manner proposed by the Chief Justice.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Practice—Prosecution by
indictment—Precondition—Previous conviction—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, as amended by R.S.C. 1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 2,
ss. 133(3), 133(7), 591.

Section 133(3) of the Criminal Code provides
that a person who fails to comply with a condition of his undertaking or
recognizance “is guilty of (a) an indictable offence…, or (b)
an offence punishable on summary conviction”. However according to
s. 133(7) “where an accused is charged with an offence under
subsection (3) …he shall not be prosecuted by indictment unless he has
previously been convicted of an offence under this section”. Here the Crown
proceeded by indictment but offered no proof of previous conviction. For this
reason, the trial Judge acquitted the appellant. The Court of Appeal quashed
the acquittal stating that the absence of a previous conviction did not
exculpate the accused. Hence the appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

It is clear from the mandatory words of
s. 133(7) that proof of a previous conviction is a precondition of
proceeding by indictment and is jurisdictional in that respect. This does not
mean that proof of a previous conviction must be offered before the indictment
is laid but, rather, that the actual trial cannot proceed as the trial of an
indictable offence until the Crown had provided proof of a previous conviction
under s. 133.

acquittal by the trial Judge. Appeal allowed.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—There is one short but
important point in this appeal. It is here as of right because the Quebec Court
of Appeal set aside the acquittal of the accused on two charges under Criminal
Code, s. 133(3)(a). The acquittal was based on the failure of the
Crown to establish, as being fundamental under s. 133(7) to its right to
proceed by indictment, that the accused had previously been convicted of an
offence under s. 133.

Section 133(3) reads as follows:

133. …

…

(3) Every one who, being at large on his
undertaking or recognizance given to or entered into before a justice or a
judge and being bound to comply with a condition of that undertaking or
recognizance directed by a justice or a judge, fails, without lawful excuse,
the proof of which lies upon him, to comply with that condition, is guilty of

(a) an indictable offence and
is liable to imprisonment for two years, or

(b) an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

The charges against the accused were laid
expressly under s. 133(3)(a), hence exposing the accused to a
greater penalty than if the charges were laid as summary conviction offences.
Section 133(7), which is central to this appeal is in these terms:

133. …

…

(7) Notwithstanding anything in this
section, where an accused is charged with an offence under subsection (3),
(4) or (5), he shall not be prosecuted by indictment unless he has previously
been convicted of an offence under this section.

The Crown offered no proof of a previous
conviction nor was an admission of such a conviction sought from the accused.
The Crown’s position was put as follows by Casey J.A., who accepted it

[Page 523]

in speaking for the Quebec Court of Appeal:

The Crown now argues that C.C. 133(3)
creates the offence leaving it to the Crown to proceed one way or the other,
that a previous conviction is not an essential element and that Respondent
should have raised the objection in limine. With this I agree. The absence of a
previous conviction does not exculpate Respondent; it merely entitles him to be
tried under Part XXIV which means, in this case, that the punishment cannot go
beyond 722. In this case we are dealing only with a matter of procedure and so
far Respondent has not been prejudiced. For these reasons I would quash the
acquittal.

Casey J.A. concluded by ordering that the record
be returned to the Court of first instance “placing the parties in the position
they were in when the Crown declared its case closed”.

The Crown’s position in this Court was not that
proof of a previous conviction was an element of the offence but that, although
it was a pre-condition, its existence was to be presumed from the mere laying
of the indictment and that it was for the accused to prove otherwise. I cannot
agree with this view. It is clear from the mandatory words of s. 133(7),
“he shall not be prosecuted by indictment unless” etc., that proof of a
previous conviction is a precondition of proceeding by indictment and is
jurisdictional in that respect. This does not mean that proof of a previous
conviction must be offered before the indictment is laid but, rather, that the
actual trial cannot proceed as the trial of an indictable offence until the
Crown has provided proof of a previous conviction under s. 133. The
situation here lies outside of Criminal Code, s. 591 which is concerned
with a reference to previous convictions in an indictment and not to an a
priori condition of trial if the Crown chooses to proceed by indictment.

It follows, therefore, that this appeal must be
allowed and the judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside. The trial Judge,
strictly speaking, ought

[Page 524]

to have quashed the proceedings because of the
Crown’s failure to satisfy the condition upon which they depended. Since it
does not appear, however, that the Crown had any proof of a previous conviction
to support its choice of proceeding by indictment, I would not interfere at
this late date (the time for summary conviction proceedings having long ago
run) with the trial Judge’s disposition made on July 15, 1976 and,
consequently, I would restore his judgment of acquittal.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA, APPEAL
DIVISION

Criminal law — Evidence — Rights of the accused — Voir dire —
Extent of procedural safeguards neces­sary to have inadmissible statements
withheld from the trier of fact.

The appellant was alleged to have been part of a
large scale operation to traffic in hashish. The plan was that the hashish was
to be cached on the Cape La Have Islands, just off the coast of Nova Scotia,
and to be taken from there by helicopter to the mainland for packaging and
resale. The appellant was a passenger on one of these flights but there was no
direct evidence that he was aware of the nature of the cargo. Subsequent to the
flight, appellant and another passenger were ques­tioned by uniformed R.C.M.P.
officers and they and others were arrested shortly thereafter. During the time
they were in custody they were interviewed by two officers and according to the
evidence of one of these officers ""as a result of conversation with the
accused and with some of the co-accused"" they went to a cottage and
removed some articles (clothing and toiletries) which they brought to the jail.
Some of these were given to the accused ""because he requested them"".
It was clear that the trial judge regarded this evidence as important and he
commented that the acceptance of the clothing was unexplained and that the
cabin from which the clothes had been taken was where some 1765 1/4 lbs. of
cannabis resin had been found. Appellant was con­victed in the County Court Judges
Criminal Court, without a jury, on a charge of having in his possession
cannabis resin for the purposes of trafficking. The Appeal Division dismissed
his subsequent appeal.

The interview when the accused and the other passen­ger
were confronted by two uniformed R.C.M.P. officers was admitted into evidence
by the judge without a voir dire despite the objection of counsel. Only
one of the officers testified and the accused did not. That officer testified
that he and his colleague had merely been investigating complaints from a
person suspicious of what was going on. The trial judge regarded an affirma­tive
response by the appellant to one of the constable's questions as an adoption by
him of his companion's false

[Page 927]

story. Although the exact words were not disclosed
the fact of the subsequent conversations regarding the cloth­ing was also
admitted without a voir dire again over the objection of counsel.

Held (Martland, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.
dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey
JJ.: This appeal affords an opportunity for further clarifica­tion of the
question of the admissibility of statements made by an accused to persons in
authority. The ques­tion essentially is whether a voir dire is always required
in respect of such statements or whether no voir dire is needed if the
statement is ""obviously volunteered"". A voir dire is clearly
necessary if the statement in question is made to police during investigation
of a crime just as it is necessary for statements made after the accused is in
custody, after he has been charged and after a decision to charge him has been
reached. The view that a voir dire is unnecessary where the
statement is ""volun­teered"" or obviously volunteered is unsound.
Quite apart from doubt as to whether the ""voluntariness"" test does
encourage practical efficiency in the conduct of trials, other interests must
be considered viz. the assurance of a full hearing of the evidence of both
sides on the issue of voluntariness; the maintenance of the rights of the
accused; and the integrity of the functional distinction between the voir
dire and the trial itself. There is no justification for engrafting upon
the general rule, amply borne out by the authorities, any exceptions,
particularly one expressed in such terms as ""obviously voluntary"" or
""volunteered"".

Per Beetz and Pratte JJ.: The issue is whether
the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence two verbal statements without
holding a voir dire which in both instances had been requested by
counsel for the defence. The first statement was made to a police officer in
the presence of another constable and of another person; the accused was then
under surveillance and the police officer did not know that he was
investigating an impor­tant criminal operation that was to lead to the arrest
of the appellant; shortly after the conversation, upon being instructed to do
so, the police officer proceeded to the arrest of the appellant. This first
statement was not admissible in evidence unless it was proven to have been made
voluntarily [Ibrahim v. The King, [1914] A.C. 599]. Such proof is
normally made on a voir dire and a request for a voir
dire should not be denied save in rare circumstances which were not present
here. However, the failure to hold a voir dire that should have been
held is not necessarily fatal since the statement may other-wise have been
proven to have been made voluntarily. This is not the case here where there was
an almost

[Page 928]

complete dearth of evidence as to the circumstances
in which the statement was made. The statement should therefore not have been
allowed. In the light of the evidence, this is not a case where resort should
be had to s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code. As to the second
statement, our unanimous decision not to disturb the decision of the trial
judge was announced in Court at the hearing.

Per Martland, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. dissenting:
It is established that the burden rests on the Crown to satisfy the trial
judge that all statements made by an accused which it seeks to introduce in
evidence against him have been freely and voluntarily made. Where, as here, a voir
dire is requested, the trial judge should require one to be held. The
failure to hold a voir dire in this case did not however occasion any
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice or vitiate the trial as the
circumstances were such as to make the voluntary nature of the statements self
evident. The sole purpose of a voir dire is to determine whether such a
statement was made volun­tarily and the necessity for holding such an inquiry
is to be determined by the circumstances under which the statement is made. The
only statements which can be challenged as improperly introduced are those made
prior to the appellant's arrest. There is however other ample evidence to
support the finding of guilt. In any event the case is one in which s.
613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code should be invoked.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia,
Appeal Division[1],
dismiss­ing an appeal from conviction, by judge sitting without a jury, on a
charge of possession of cannabis

[Page 929]

resin for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 4(2) of the
Narcotic Control Act. Appeal allowed, Martland, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.
dissenting.

David F. Walker, Q.C., for the appellant.

E. G. Ewaschuk and R. Fainstein, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ. was
delivered by

DICKSON J.—Not long ago, this Court put an end to the
difficulties which had plagued trial judges in attempting to distinguish inculpatory
statements from exculpatory statements for the purpose of applying the voir
dire rules. The Court held that exculpatory statements made to a person in
authority by an accused would be subject on voir dire to the same
requirements as inculpatory statements: Fiché v. The Queen[2].
The present appeal affords an opportunity for further clarifica­tion and
rationalization in determining the admis­sibility of statements made by an
accused to persons in authority.

The Court is called upon to decide the extent of the procedural
safeguards necessary to support the substantive rights of the accused to have
inadmis­sible statements withheld from consideration by the trier of fact. The
question essentially is wheth­er a voir dire is always required
in respect of statements made by an accused which the prosecu­tion seeks to
introduce in evidence, or whether, as the Crown contends, no voir dire is needed
if the statement is ""obviously volunteered."" The issue has not
previously arisen for decision in this Court, but there are many dicta which
support the con­clusion that a voir dire is always needed. Many
of the cases appear simply to assume the necessity of a voir dire as
consistent with the basic principles governing the admission of statements made
in response to questions from police officers or from other persons in
authority.

[Page 930]

The Principle

The classic formulation of the applicable princi­ple is that of
Lord Sumner in Ibrahim v. The King[3], at
pp. 609-10:

It has long been established as a positive rule of English
criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against
him unless it is shewn [sic] by the prosecution to have been a voluntary
statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear
of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in
authority. The principle is as old as Lord Hale.

That statement of the rule has been adopted in decisions of this
Court: see Prosko v. The King[4],
Boudreau v. The King[5], Fiché
v. The Queen, supra.

The rule in England is expressed in 11 Hals. (4th ed.), para.
410, in these words (footnotes omitted):

It is a fundamental condition of the admissibility in
evidence against any person, equally of any oral answer given by that person to
a question put by a police officer and of any statement made by that person,
that it shall have been voluntary in the sense that it has not been obtained
from him by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage, exercised or held out by a
person in author­ity, or by oppression. In order to render such extra-judi­cial
admissions or confessions admissible the prosecution must prove affirmatively
to the satisfaction of the trial judge that they were not induced by any
promise of favour or advantage, or by the use of fear, threats or pressure by a
person in authority. It is not sufficient for the prosecution to show that the
person in authority had not intended to extract a confession or that there had
been no impropriety on his part; what is necessary is to show, as a matter of
fact, that the statement in question had not been obtained in consequence of
something said or done by him which amounted to an express or implicit threat
or promise to the defendant.

The first sentence of the foregoing passage derives from the
Judges' Rules published in 1964 (Home Office Circular No. 31/1964, p. 5,
reprinted in ""Practice Note,"" [1964] 1 W.L.R. 152 at p. 153). It is
said to be ""overriding and applicable in all cases."" The Judges'
Rules are, of course, merely administrative instructions which do not
have the force of law in this country nor, indeed, in England,

[Page 931]

but it is of importance that the sentence to which I have
referred was adopted as a correct statement of the law by Lord Reid, speaking
for a unanimous House of Lords in Commissioners of Customs and
Excise v. Harz[6].

I think it can now be taken to be clearly estab­lished in Canada
that no statement made out of court by an accused to a person in authority can
be admitted into evidence against him unless the prosecution shows, to the
satisfaction of the trial judge, that the statement was made freely and
voluntarily: Boulet v. The Queen[7],
Powell v. The Queen[8], Fiché
v. The Queen, supra.

Procedure on Voir Dire

Accepting that a burden rests upon the Crown to show
affirmatively that the statement sought to be introduced was voluntary, how
does the Crown go about discharging that burden? In my experi­ence, the usual
procedure has been for the Crown, before adverting to the statement, to request
the trial judge to retire the jury. In the absence of the jury the Crown calls
witnesses, normally the police officers to whom the statement was made or
given, and any other police officers who might have been in a position to
threaten or to offer hope of advan­tage to the accused. These witnesses testify
affir­matively to statements made and to the absence of threat or promise. They
are cross-examined. The defence then calls its witnesses, including frequent­ly
the accused, and they are cross-examined. Then follows argument of counsel, and
the ruling of the trial judge as to whether the statement is voluntary and,
therefore, admissible. There is, in every sense, a trial within a trial. Once
admitted, the statement goes to the jury who must then pass upon whether the
statement was, in fact, made and the weight, if any, to be given to it.

Function of the Voir Dire

It is axiomatic that the voir dire and the trial
itself have distinct functions. The function of the voir dire is to
determine admissibility of evidence. The function of the trial is to determine
the merits of the case on the basis of admissible evidence. The

[Page 932]

voir dire is conducted in the absence of the jury, who
should not be informed, at any time, of the subject matter of the voir dire.
The accused may testify on the voir dire while remaining silent
during the trial. Evidence on the voir dire cannot be used in the trial
itself. The fundamental nature of this functional separation was recently reaf­firmed
by this Court in The Queen v. Gauthier[9]. Mr.
Justice Pigeon, speaking for the majority, stated that the procedure is similar
whether or not the trial is before a jury, and he emphasized the necessity for
a voir dire in both cases, at p. 450:

.. For this reason I fail to see how it could be decided
that in a trial without a jury, a voir dire is unnecessary, and
statements made by the accused may be admitted in evidence without a
preliminary decision as to whether or not they were freely and voluntarily
made. Furthermore, no one appears to suggest that in a trial without a jury
a voir dire is unnecessary. But if this is so, how can it be maintained
that the rules are different? [emphasis added]

In a later passage, Pigeon J. also expressed his view that the
holding of a voir dire is an essential requirement (at p. 451):

In deciding as it did in the case at bar, the Court allowed
the accused to testify on the voir dire on a portion of the case that
suited his purposes, while avoid­ing cross-examination on the rest and
preventing the prosecution from referring to it. This can hardly be described
as formalism; it touches one of the most basic aspects of the administration of
justice, namely the rule that any judgment must be based exclusively on the
evidence presented at the trial. If it were to be held that in a trial
without a jury it is not essential to hold a voir dire, and the judge may
admit evidence of statements made by the accused, provided he rules on their
admissi­bility at the end of the trial, I would not agree, but I would
consider it less objectionable than a voir dire that does not respect
the basic rule, namely that it is a trial within a trial, and accordingly the
evidence produced therein is to be used on the voir dire only, even
though the same judge presides at the voir dire and decides on the
merits. [emphasis added]

The courts have formulated strict standards gov­erning the
admissibility of statements in order to safeguard carefully the rights of an accused
person. The principles focus on the jury trial, but they apply equally to trial
by a judge alone.

[Page 933]

The Court of Appeal Decision

It would seem to follow, as a matter of simple logic, that if the
Crown fails to establish that the statement was not obtained by fear of
prejudice or hope of advantage held out by a person in author­ity, it has
failed to discharge the burden upon the Crown and the statement should be ruled
inad­missible. In the case at bar, however, the trial judge, sitting without a
jury, notwithstanding a request of defence counsel, refused to hold a voir
dire in respect of two statements made by the appellant Erven to police
officers. In upholding the conviction, the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia adopted what had been said earlier by Macdonald J.A. of that
Court (16 N.S.R. (2d) 422-427) in respect of a statement given to the police by
one Mayer, a co-accused of Erven, when Mayer's conviction was under appeal. The
points taken by Mr. Justice Macdonald were: (i) when questioned by the police,
the accused was not under arrest, nor even under the threat of arrest; (ii) in
the opinion of Mr. Justice Mac­donald, the conversation by the accused with the
police officer was entirely voluntary and ""even if a voir dire had
been held such would surely have been found to have been made voluntarily and
hence admissible in evidence."" Mr. Justice Mac­donald quoted from an
earlier judgment of the Appeal Division (R. v. Spencer[10])
in which the view was taken that the holding of a voir dire would have
been an ""unnecessary farce"" and the law does not require that a judge
hold a ""wholly useless voir dire"" when the result would
have been the same if the magistrate had held a voir dire.

Two issues arise from the Court of Appeal decision, one
substantive as to the scope of the general rule, and one procedural as to how
the general rule is to be put into practice in the course of the trial. I will
deal with the substantive issue first.

Investigatory Stage

I cannot accept the view that a voir dire is unnecessary
(or required only where special cir­cumstances cast doubt on voluntariness) if
the statement in question is made to police during

[Page 934]

investigation of a crime, rather than after the accused is in
custody, or after he has been charged, or a decision to charge him has been
reached, see, e.g.: R. v. Rushton[11];
R. v. Sweezey[12];
R. v. Spen­cer, supra; R. v. Armstrong[13]. Such
statements of the accused enjoy no exemption from the requirement of proof of voluntariness
before admission into evidence. As Martin J.A. stated, in words I would adopt,
in R. v. Sweezey, at p. 413:

I conclude that the rule with respect to proof of volunta­riness
is not confined to statements made by a person in custody or charged or about
to be charged with an offence. I am consequently of the view that a statement
made by a person to a police officer conducting an investigation with respect
to a suspected offence must be shown to have been made voluntarily before it is
admis­sible against that person in a criminal trial in which he is an accused.
The words ""statement by an accused"" used by Lord Sumner in Ibrahim
v. The King, [1914] A.C. 599, in my view, refer to a statement made
by a person who is an accused in a criminal trial when the statement is sought
to be introduced against him rather than to the fact that he was an accused at
the time he made the statement.

As Idington J. stated in the decision of this Court in Prosko
v. The King, supra, at p. 234:

It is the inducement exercised by the officers in charge that
is to be guarded against and not the acciden­tal circumstances of an arrest and
the bearing thereof on the mind of one accused that has to be guarded against.

The voluntariness rule is one of broad and gene­ral application.
It applies with as much force to statements made during investigation as to
state­ments made after the accused person is in custody. The procedure does not
vary depending upon the stage at which the statement is made. Such a
distinction would be fraught with difficulties in its application. Is the test
subjective or objective? Where is the line to be drawn when investigation,
discovery, custody, and arrest are a rapid conti­nuous series of events?
Practical considerations provide an additional reason which dictates the
rejection of this distinction. The opportunities for

[Page 935]

abuse by delaying arrest are obvious. I should note in passing
that even cases supporting a special rule for statements made at the
investigative stage generally require a voir dire where counsel
expressly contests the admissibility of the state­ments, as counsel did in the
present case: see R. v. Sweezey, supra, at p. 417.

""Volunteered""

Nor can I accede to the second proposition which found favour
with the Appeal Division, namely, that a voir dire is unnecessary where
a statement is ""obviously voluntary"" or ""volun­teered"", or
where the voluntariness of a statement is ""apparent from the circumstances
under which it was made"", or when it can be ""abundantly established
in some other way"", absent a voir dire: see R. v. Spencer,
supra; R. v. Sweezey, supra; R. v. Toulany[14].

No doubt the ""obviously voluntary"" test derives from a
desire to encourage practical efficiency in the conduct of trials. On that
point alone, there are grounds for some doubt as to the efficacy of the test.
However, there are also other interests which must be weighed in the balance
along with effi­ciency—(i) the assurance of a full hearing of the evidence of
both sides on the issue of voluntariness; (ii) the maintenance of the rights of
the accused; and (iii) the integrity of the functional distinction between the voir
dire and the trial itself. It is in the light of each of these interests,
as well as that of trial economy, that the proposed test for a voir dire ought
to be measured.

Hearing All the Evidence

In my respectful opinion, no judge at trial nor appellate judge
should decide any issue on hearing only one side of the matter. It is trite in
civil law that anyone having the duty to decide anything must hear both sides
before reaching a decision. The obligation is not any less in criminal law.
Unusual prescience would be required to determine that a statement is obviously
voluntary before the accused has had a chance to call wit­nesses, testify, and
present argument, and where

[Page 936]

all the persons involved have not been called as required by Thiffault
v. The Queen[15].

What would occur if a statement could be admitted without a voir
dire where the context did not cast doubt on its voluntariness? The
testimony of the Crown witness outlining the circumstances surrounding the
statement might give no indica­tion of any involuntariness. Defence witnesses
might be prepared to give contrary testimony which; might be believed over that
of the Crown witness. The defence witnesses, however, could not be called at
this point, as they can only be called after the Crown has concluded its case.
Thus no evidence up to this point would have cast any doubt on the voluntariness
of the statement, and it would be admitted into evidence for consideration by
the jury. Even if the statement were later excluded, the harm would be done:
see R. v. Armstrong, supra. As Dennistoun J.A., speaking for the
Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Baschuk[16], said
at p. 209:

Once the confession was read to the jury it was hopeless for
the accused to call witnesses to show it was not a voluntary statement. The
damage was done and could not be undone.

All surrounding circumstances must be exam­ined on a voir
dire. Although the main point of decision in Boudreau v. The King,
supra, was that the absence of a warning would not bind the hands of the
court so as to compel it to rule out a statement, Kerwin J. said, at p. 267:
""All the surrounding circumstances must be investigated and, if upon their
review the Court is not satisfied of the voluntary nature of the admission, the
statement will be rejected."" The last words of the last defence witness to
testify in respect of the statement may establish that it was involuntary.

Rights of the Accused

An accused may testify on a voir dire without
prejudice to his privilege not to take the stand before the jury. He may be
examined and cross-examined

[Page 937]

with regard to the statement allegedly given by him to one in
authority, but not upon his innocence or guilt.

It is a most important right of the accused to call witnesses and
present argument separately on the issue of the admissibility of a statement
direct­ly after the Crown's evidence on this matter has been adduced. This
right would be totally lost if a statement of the accused could be admitted
without a voir dire as part of the Crown's evidence because nothing in
that evidence cast doubt on its voluntariness. An accused has the right to
testify in the absence of the jury on the issue of voluntari­ness alone. On the
voir dire he is permitted to testify on the issue of the voluntary
nature of his statement without prejudice to his right not to testify on the
main issue. The testimony of the accused may be the only evidence which
indicates involuntariness. If a voir dire is not held, and the accused
exercises his right not to testify on the main issue, the evidence negating voluntariness
will never be revealed to the trial court nor to an appellate court. If the
judge denies a voir dire, the accused may have to become a
witness on the issue of whether the statement is voluntary, but he thereby is
improperly exposed to Crown examina­tion on the main issue of guilt or
innocence. The effect of limiting the voir dire to cases where there is
evidence of involuntariness is to obligate the accused to adduce such
evidence, thereby relieving the Crown of a burden which properly rests on the
Crown and placing an unwarranted evidential burden upon the accused.

The Distinction between Voir Dire and Trial

The essential separation between proceedings on a voir
dire and those in the trial itself would be undermined if a voir dire were
held only where doubt was cast on the voluntariness of a statement by evidence
given in the trial itself. As Kaufman says in The Admissibility of
Confessions (2nd ed.), at p. 51, ""... to say that a statement may have
been admissible without a voir dire because it was voluntary is putting
the cart before the horse."" The importance of keeping all evidence of a
statement from the jury unless the statement is admitted

[Page 938]

in evidence is expressed by Kaufman in the following passage (at
p. 52):

Despite these last two judgments [John v. The Queen, [1971]
S.C.R. 781 and R. v. Bohack (1971), 6 C.C.C.(2d) 457 (Ont. C.A.)], it
would still appear that a voir dire must be held, and where the Crown
attempts to tender a statement without first requesting a trial within the
trial, the Court must order it proprio motu. This may
create a problem where the jury was made aware of the existence of a statement.
In that case, the Court should proceed with the voir dire, but if the
statement is rejected, a mistrial may be in order.

Can it ever be said that an answer given in response to questions
asked by a police officer in circumstances of compulsive authority, as in the
case at bar, are ""volunteered?"" One immediate objection to the
introduction of an exception relat­ed to ""obviously voluntary"" or
""volunteered"" is the likelihood of confusing the word (i)
""voluntary"", which has a well-recognized and technical conno­tation
when used in relation to statements given by accused persons to those in
authority (variously expressed, but generally taken to mean free of fear of
prejudice or hope of advantage) with the word (ii) ""volunteered"",
which is a word of common parlance implying spontaneity. Yet, as pointed out in
""Developments in the Law: Confessions"" (1966), 79 Harv. L. Rev. 935,
1103, the Canadian concept of voluntariness, unlike the one prevailing in
Scotland, does not imply spontaneity. Rand J. made this clear in R. v. Fitton[17],
at pp. 962-3, where he said: ""The Chief Justice of Ontario, speaking
for the majority of the Court of Appeal, has treated the expression 'freely and
voluntarily' used in Boudreau v. The King, as if it connoted only a
spontaneous statement, one unrelated to anything as cause or occasion in the
conduct of the police officers; but with the greatest respect that is an
erroneous interpretation of what was there said.""

Statements should not slip in without a voir dire under
the pretext that they form part of the res gestae: see R. v. Spencer,
supra; R. v. Toulany, supra. The rules regarding res gestae are
substan­tive rules regarding hearsay and the admissibility

[Page 939]

of evidence. They do not affect the procedure by which decisions
are to be made regarding admissi­bility of statements made to persons in
authority. Statements constituting part of the res gestae are admissible
as exceptions to the general rule excluding hearsay. As with all statements by
an accused, they are subject to the general requirement of voluntariness. In order
to determine whether they are voluntary, as well as whether they are, in fact,
part of the res gestae and otherwise admissible, such statements must be
con­sidered by the judge on a voir dire in the absence of the
jury.

The Efficient Administration of Criminal Justice

I suspect that in a trial by judge sitting without a jury there
is a tendency, in what is thought to be the interests of trial economy, to lose
sight of the distinction between voir dire and trial. The dis­tinction
is just as important when the judge is sitting alone (and assumes also the jury
function of trier of fact) as when he is presiding at a trial with jury, and
the same rules apply so far as the voir dire is concerned: R. v.
Gauthier, supra. The distinction between a ""formal"" and an
""informal"" voir dire was firmly rejected by this Court in Powell,
at p. 368, where Mr. Justice de Grandpré said:

I note that for the second time the learned appeal judge
uses the expression ""formal voir dire"". I assume that this is
a slip of the pen because no voir dire at all was held and, in any
event, I cannot see any difference between an informal voir dire and a
formal one.

It is sometimes urged that the holding of a voir dire results
in delay and, therefore, a loss in trial economy. I have some doubt whether
trial econo­my would be achieved by recognition of an excep­tion, expressed in
terms of ""volunteered"" or ""obvi­ously voluntary"", to the
general requirement of a voir dire. The normal response, if a voir
dire were denied, would be an appeal, with consequent cost in time and
money. Accepting, arguendo, that a voir dire entails delay in the
judicial process, it does not necessarily follow that efficient adminis­tration
of justice should be sought at the expense of the legitimate rights of an
accused.

It must be sound policy to have rules of practice which are clear
and uncomplicated. This is particulary

[Page 940]

true in the field of criminal law. Rules should be such as to be
easily applied in the great variety of cases and circumstances which daily come
before the courts. In my respectful view, a rule requiring a voir dire only
after there is some evidence suggesting involuntariness is neither clear nor
easily applied.

If a statement is, in fact, ""volunteered"", this means
merely that voluntariness is easier to estab­lish than in other cases. It does
not mean there is a different procedure to determine voluntariness. The voir
dire in such a case may take only a few minutes. On the other hand, where
the initial impression is that the statement was voluntary, other evidence on
the voir dire may point to quite the opposite conclusion. Either way,
the rights of the accused will be protected and the efficient administration of
justice enhanced by the holding of a voir dire.

Further, I would not want to say that counsel may not expressly
waive the holding of a voir dire in a proper case where all precautions
have been taken: see Powell v. The Queen, supra, at p. 368; R. v. Sweezey,
supra, at p. 416; R. v. Dietrich[18], at
pp. 734-7 (Ont. C.A.) (leave to appeal to this Court dismissed [1970] S.C.R.
xi). I do not express any concluded view on the matter of waiver, however, as
there is no suggestion that defence counsel waived voir dire in the case
at bar.

The Cases

Generally speaking, the authorities appear to be against any
exception to the general rule requiring a voir dire. In the
recent case of Boulet v. The Queen, supra, it was affirmed that previous
state­ments made under oath by the accused during a judicial proceeding are
admissible without proof of voluntariness, and that therefore no voir dire
is required in respect of such statements. The Court, speaking through Mr.
Justice Beetz, contrasted the situation where a statement is made out of court
to a person in authority and clearly envisaged that the admissibility of such a
statement would always

[Page 941]

be decided in the absence of the jury, on a voir dire, (at
p. 343):

The courts have long made a distinction between statements
made by the accused out of court to persons in authority and those which are made
in a judicial proceeding. The first are admitted in evidence once the
presiding judge had decided alone, without the jury, after a voir dire, that
they were freely and voluntarily made, the onus of proving these conditions
being on the prosecution: R. v. Warickshall; Rex v. Baldry; Ibrahim v. Rex;
Fiché v. The Queen; Powell v. The Queen. [emphasis added]

While the decision in Powell v. The Queen, was carefully
restricted to what was necessary to decide the outcome of that case, it
nevertheless established a stringency in the need for a voir dire which
is consistent only with its requirement in all cases where voluntariness must
be established. In his reasons, Mr. Justice de Grandpré quoted the Court of
Appeal's view of the matter, at p. 367:

In our view, it would have been preferable for the trial
judge to have conducted a formal voir dire, then ruling on the voluntariness
of the statement [ ... ]; but it is perfectly plain from his reasons for
judgment that he directed himself to that question and considered the statement
to be voluntary.

and then de Grandpré J. stated.

I am unable to accede to the proposition that if a trial
judge directs himself to the question of the voluntariness of a statement and
is satisfied on the whole of the evidence of the guilt of the accused, there is
no need for a voir dire.

In Powell this Court also expressly rejected the
contention that a voir dire was only needed where counsel for the
accused objected to the admission of the evidence. Mr. Justice de Grandpré
stated, at p. 368:

The Crown further submits that, the evidence of Constable
Fisher having been received without any objection by counsel for the accused,
this silence amounts to an admission that the statement was volun­tary.
Although the point was mentioned by Hall J.A., it was not dealt with in the
Court of Appeal. For my part, I do not believe that this submission is well
founded. While I might be ready to accept in a proper case that counsel for an
accused may well waive the holding of a voir dire, I see a considerable
difference between an expressed waiver surrounded by all the precautions

[Page 942]

indicating that the question has been examined in depth and
mere silence on counsel's part. The heavy onus resting on the Crown certainly
cannot be displaced in such an informal fashion.

In a comment on Powell, (1976), 18 Crim. L.Q. 404,
Professor S. I. Bushnell noted that the case dealt with four questions:

(1) Must all statements made by an accused to a person in
authority pass the test of voluntariness?

(2) Need there be a voir dire for those confessions
to which the rule applies?

(3) Is there any obligation on the defence to object to the voluntariness
of a confession in order to require a voir dire?

(4) In a case in which there should have been a voir
dire, and none was held, can s. 613(1)(b) (iii) of the Criminal Code be
applied?

In discussing the second question, he stated, at p. 411:

(2) Need there be a voir dire in all cases?

The answer, following Powell, must also be a yes,
except when there has been an express waiver. Spencer had called it a
wise precaution to have a voir dire until the limits of Fiché
v. The Queen were clarified. The clarification has now occurred in Powell.
Sweezey and Rushton must be considered overturned on this point.

In a more recent article in (1978), 20 Crim. L.Q. 312, Professor Ratushny
said, at p. 324:

In Powell v. The Queen the court clearly established
that all statements made to a person in authority must pass the test of voluntariness
on a voir dire in the absence of an express waiver on the part of
the accused. Moreover, there is no obligation on the part of defence counsel to
object where the necessity for such a voir dire has been
overlooked.

I do not think the Crown can take any comfort from John v. The
Queen, supra. In John, the point here in issue was expressly not
decided because, in any event, there was sufficient admissible evidence of the accused's
guilt to apply the provisions of s. 529(1)(b)(iii) (now s. 613(1)(b)(iii)).

[Page 943]

In my opinion, it is always necessary to hold a voir dire to
determine the voluntariness of a statement made by an accused out of court to a
person in authority. Only in this way can fairness to the accused be assured.
To require a voir dire only if doubt is cast on the voluntariness
of a statement by the circumstances under which it was made, as determined from
evidence given in the trial proper, would not only shift a burden to the
accused but also, in other respects, cause him significant preju­dice. One must
be realistic with the jury process. If the statement is subsequently ruled
inadmissible, the jury will, nevertheless, at least be left with the knowledge
that a statement was made by the accused which has now been excluded. This is
bound to arouse suspicion as to its content. If evidence of the context of the
statement is allowed to be given for some time before anything casts doubt on
its voluntariness, the jury will know something, and perhaps much, of its
content. Prejudice will surely result. Such a limited requirement would destroy
the fundamental distinction between the function of the voir dire, which
is to determine voluntariness, and that of the trial proper, which is to
determine guilt.

I can see no justification for engrafting upon the general rule,
which is remarkably free of qualifica­tions, any exception and, particularly,
one expressed in such terms as ""obviously voluntary"" or
""volunteered."" Attempts in the past to water down the rule have not
met with success and, in my opinion, the present attempt should also be
repelled.

The Facts

I turn now to the evidence in the case. I do not think the
evidence is of great importance because it is not the task of this Court nor,
with respect, the task of any appellate court to make an independent judgment
as to whether a particular statement is voluntary. If the true rule is, as I
conceive it to be, that the voluntary nature of a statement given to a person
in authority can only be determined in a voir dire, then it is
undisputed that the judge at trial failed to hold a voir dire, though
requested to do so. I do not think it can be seriously contended that the
statements admitted

[Page 944]

in evidence without a voir dire were not of impor­tance
on the issue of guilt.

The facts are these. The accused was alleged to have been part of
a large-scale operation to traffic in hashish. The plan called for the hashish
to be cached on the Cape La Have Islands, just off the coast of Nova Scotia,
and to be transported by helicopter to an isolated cottage at Beech Hill, on
the mainland, for packaging and later resale. On August 21, 1974, one Robson
made three trips transporting hashish by helicopter from Cape La Have Islands
to the cottage. On the first of the trips, the appellant Erven and one Mayer
were passengers. The helicopter picked them up at Crescent Beach, on the
mainland, and transported them to the Islands. Upon arrival at the Islands, the
appellant and Mayer disappeared for two or three hours, during which time
Robson loaded the hashish into the aircraft and made two trips to the cottage,
where the hashish was unloaded. After the helicopter had been loaded by Robson
for the third and final time, the appellant and Mayer reap­peared and were
taken back to Crescent Beach, where they were dropped off. The helicopter con­tinued
its flight to the cottage. During the flights, the hashish was packed in large
wrapped bags and transported in the luggage compartment of the aircraft, out of
sight of pilot and passengers. There is no direct evidence that the appellant
was aware of the nature of the cargo.

Immediately after the appellant and Mayer returned to Crescent
Beach, they were confronted by two uniformed R.C.M.P. officers, Botham and Gaudet,
who began asking questions. In response, Mayer indicated that he and the
appellant were involved in a Search and Rescue operation, as well as collecting
soil samples from the Cape La Have area. In reply to a question by Constable Botham,
the appellant acknowledged that he was engaged in the same operations. He gave
the same address in Vancouver, British Columbia, as Mayer. The appellant and
Mayer were later picked up at the beach by a red Maverick automobile, driven to
the beach by a Miss Hale, but driven, on leaving, by the appellant. The trial
judge found, as a fact, that the red Maverick was a rented vehicle in the same

[Page 945]

of one of the persons involved in the narcotics operation.

The appellant and the others were arrested shortly after leaving
the beach. During the time the appellant and several co-accused were in cus­tody,
they were interviewed on August 27, 1974 by two officers, Berry and Melbourne.
According to Constable Melbourne, ""as a result of conversation with the
accused and with some of the co-accused,"" he and Constable Berry went to
the cottage at Beech Hill and removed some articles of clothing and toiletries.
They brought these articles to the jail and gave various of them to the
accused, ""because he requested them."" The importance of this evidence
to the trial judge is expressed in the following passage from his judgment:

..it seems to me that the acceptance by the accused of these
three items of clothing is some evidence which is unexplained and which
connected the accused with the whole operation. It is perhaps convenient to
point out, at this point, that a very large quantity of cannabis resin, some
seventeen hundred, sixty-five and a quarter pounds was found in eighty-nine
packages in the cabin at Beech Hill from which the clothes were removed.
Indeed, it was at this point the general evidence indicates that the resin was
being packaged by two persons who are not before me in this trial.

The accused was tried without a jury in the County Court Judges'
Criminal Court, on a charge of unlawfully having in his possession cannabis
resin, for the purposes of trafficking.

The interview on Crescent Beach when the accused and Mayer were
confronted by two uniformed police officers, Botham and Gaudet, was admitted
into evidence by the trial judge without a voir dire, as I have
indicated, despite the objection of defence counsel. Constable Botham was the
only officer to testify. The accused did not testify. According to Constable Botham,
he and Constable Gaudet did not, at that point, know the nature of the
operation they had discovered. However, they were, he testified, investigating
complaints from a person who was very suspicious of what was going on. The
trial judge regarded the affirmative response of the appellant to Constable Botham's
question as an adoption by the appellant of May­er's false story that the
appellant and Mayer, and

[Page 946]

the helicopter, were just engaged in collecting soil samples.

Although the exact words were not disclosed, the fact of the
conversations on August 27, 1974, respecting the clothing and the result of
those conversations, was also admitted without a voir dire, again over
the objection of defence counsel.

The appellant was convicted and sentenced to five years'
imprisonment. The Appellate Division dismissed the appeal. Three main grounds
of appeal were advanced in the Appellate Division. It was contended that the
trial judge erred in admitting without a voir dire the statements made
by the appellant to the police on August 21 and August 27, 1974, and that the
judge erred in the wrongful use of hearsay evidence. On this last point, Mackeigan
C.J.N.S. said:

Dealing first with the last, I respectfully think the
learned judge erred in admitting and referring in his decision to hearsay
evidence by a police constable that the red Maverick car driven from the beach
by the appellant was rented, and even more seriously erred in saying in his
decision, with no evidence to support it, that the vehicle had been rented 'in
the name of one of the persons involved in the series of circumstances to which
I have related.' The judge did not specify which of Carr, Robson, Mayer or Miss
Hale had, as he understood, rented the car.

Carr was one of those found packaging the hashish in the cottage.
The learned Chief Justice continued:

I do not, however, look upon this error as fatal. The
wrongfully imputed rental of the car does not constitute a vital or
indispensable link between the appellant and Carr or Robson. Without it, strong
and ample evidence connects the appellant with Robson and his handling of the
hashish in the helicopter and at the cottage-includ­ing his unexplained
presence on the helicopter, his adop­tion, if admissible, of Mayer's false
story that they were just engaged in collecting ""soil samples"", and
his acceptance, if admissible, of some clothing picked up at the cottage. I am
of opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred and
that the learned judge's conclusion would necessarily have been the same had he
not made this mistake. Section 613(1)(b)(iii) may properly be applied.

[Page 947]

The Appeal Division, in sustaining the conviction, applied s.
613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, and in so doing relied upon (1) the
unexplained pres­ence of the appellant on the helicopter; (2) the appellant's
adoption, if admissible, of Mayer's false story that they were just engaged in
collect­ing soil samples; (3) the appellant's acceptance, if admissible, of
clothing picked up at the cottage.

Conclusion

For the reasons expressed earlier, in my opinion a voir
dire should have been held to determine the admissibility of the
appellant's statement to police at the beach on August 21, 1974. During argu­ment
of this appeal, counsel for the Crown was advised from the Bench that the Court
did not need to hear him with respect to the request for clothing. I therefore
say nothing further with respect to August 27 and the clothing. Consider­ation
of that aspect is not, in my view, essential to the outcome of the appeal, for
it cannot be said with assurance that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice occurred from the denial of a voir dire in respect of the
earlier August 21 ""beach"" statement. In light of the importance of
that evidence as affecting credibility, I do not believe this to be a proper
case for the application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii). That is not to say that the
failure to hold a voir dire will in every case provide grounds
for ordering a new trial. As with every other case where inadmissible evidence
is admitted at trial, consideration has to be given to the impor­tance of the
evidence improperly admitted in light of the whole of the case. When one
considers, however, the function of a voir dire, and the interests at
stake in the holding of a voir dire, it will be but rarely that the
admission of such statements will have caused no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice, such that the appellate court may apply s.
613(1)(b)(iii).

I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the
Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and order a new trial.

[Page 948]

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal from a judgment
delivered by MacKeigan, C.J.N.S., on behalf of the Appeal Division of the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, whereby he dismissed the appellant's appeal from
a conviction entered by His Honour Judge R. F. McLellan sitting without a jury
on a charge of possession of cannabis resin for the purpose of trafficking,
contrary to s. 4(2) of the Narcotic Control Act.

This appeal is brought pursuant to leave granted by this Court on
the following question of law:

Did the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division, err in
holding that the trial Judge did not err in refusing to hold a voir
dire in respect of the voluntariness of statements allegedly made by the
accused to officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on August 21 and August
27, 1974 and in admitting such statements accordingly?

The circumstances giving rise to this prosecution are somewhat
complex, but the background indicating involvement on the part of the appellant
is described in the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge which were
in this regard adopted by the Court of Appeal. From these reasons I excerpt the
following passages with respect to which it can be said that there is no
dispute:

It is clear from the evidence before me that there was
evolved a very sophisticated high grade operation, the object of which was to
import a large quantity of cannabis resin into this country. I, of course, am
not involved with the importing aspect but the whole of the evidence makes it
abundantly clear that the importation was the first step in what led to the
charges to which I have referred and has led to the charge before the accused.
At some point the cannabis resin was cached on Cape LaHave Island and it was
transported from there to a cottage in the Beech Hill area in Lunenburg County.
The accused's connection with this matter, if any, arises out of the
transportation aspect to which I have referred. It was accomplished by the use
of a helicopter, a rented helicopter, which made three trips between a point on
Cape LaHave Island and a cleared out area adjacent to a cottage in or near
Beech Hill. This transportation was accomplished in three trips made on August
21st, 1974... .

[Page 949]

By prior arrangement with somebody, the helicopter which was
engaged by one of the principals or one of the subordinates in the scheme which
involved the transpor­tation of this drug, picked up the accused and one,
Mayer, from a point on Crescent Beach on August 21st, 1974. The accused and
Mayer were transported to a point on Cape LaHave Island. They disembarked from
the helicopter and reappeared, at least as far as the evidence goes, only to
join the aircraft after the last of the cannabis resin had been stored aboard
the aircraft, entered the aircraft and were deposited by the helicopter at or
near the same point on Crescent Beach where they had been picked up. There is
no evidence, at least no direct evidence, that either of these men which of
course includes the accused, had any hand or part in the loading of the
aircraft. I accept the evidence that on the last occasion, that is the occasion
of the third trip required to transport the forbidden substance, the forbidden
substance was all stored in the compartment at the rear of the helicopter.
While the accused and Mayer were on the beach, they were interviewed by
Constable Botham of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

The interview which ensued was admitted by the trial judge
without the holding of a voir dire notwithstanding the objection of
counsel for the defence and this constitutes one of the alleged errors referred
to in the order granting leave to appeal to this Court. The relevant evidence
describing this interview is to be found in the following testimony
given by Constable Botham of the R.C.M. Police:

Q. Alright, well now witness, you were questioning these two
men, that is Mayer and the accused, about the circumstances under which they
were on the beach and were in the proximity of the boat and motor, is that
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And were they under arrest at that time? 

A. No.

Q. And what was your general purpose in being in the area
that day?

A. Well the initial reason we had there was because the
person that called was very suspicious of what was going on.

Q. Alright, you were investigating. 

A. Complaints.

An objection followed from the accused's counsel and the witness
then continued:

[Page 950]

Q. Yes, would you continue Cst. Botham, you met these chaps
and what happened?

A. After finding out their names I also obtained their
addresses in Vancouver, B.C. as 132 Ontario Street. This applied to both Mr.
Mayer and Erven. Mr. Mayer indicated that he was a commercial artist; Mr. Erven,
the accused, indicated he was a truck driver working with Wells Fargo. We had
some conversation for I would say approximately five minutes. During that time
Marcel Patrick Mayer, after being asked what he was doing in the area, stated
he was working with search and rescue and that he was in this area to collect
soil and water samples from the Cape LaHave Island area. After that, I asked
Bruce Keith Erven if this was what he was doing as well and he said, 'Yes'.

Upon it being suggested to Constable Botham in cross-examination
that some other member of the R.C.M. Police had told him to say what he did
about the reference to soil samples and water samples, he made the following
answers:

A. Actually at the time I didn't realize it was impor­tant.
I didn't realize any of this was important at the time. But I couldn't add
it to my notes four hours later when I found out it could have been. [The
italics are my own.]

Q. Now let me ask you these questions. You didn't think it
was important so I take it you didn't read the notes back to Mr. Mayer or Mr. Erven
on any occasion?

A. No, I did not. Initially I had no idea of what was
even going on. [The italics are my own.]

Q. No. And so your
question Mr. Erven was in relation to what Mr. Mayer said he was doing?
A. Yes. Mr. Mayer did ninety per cent of the talking, or more.

Q. Mr. Mayer, in other words, virtually

A. Gave the story. I just asked Mr. Erven if he was doing
the same thing and he indicated he was.

Q. How did he indicate it? 

A. 'Yes'.

[Page 951]

And later in the cross-examination the Constable said:

Q. Certainly you have no knowledge that anything that Mr. Erven
told you as to name, address or occupation or where he was staying at that
time, is incorrect?

A. Not at that time, no.

Q. No, at any time, as far as his name or his address or the
place he was staying on August 21, 1974, did you ever subsequently find out
that any of that was incorrect?

A. No I did not.

Q. No, and you never found out that what he said about his
occupation was incorrect?

A. I have not made any inquiries to determine otherwise if
it is incorrect.

I think it to be established that the burden rests upon the Crown
to satisfy the trial judge that all statements made by the accused which it
seeks to introduce in evidence against him have been freely and voluntarily
made and where, as here, counsel for the accused objects to the admission of
such statements without the holding of a voir dire, the trial judge
should require one to be held, but his failure to do so in this case did not
occasion any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice or viti­ate the trial
as the circumstances were such as to make the voluntary nature of the
statements self evident and no basis was suggested in argument upon which the
appellant's answers might have been held to be otherwise than voluntary had a voir
dire in fact been held. Apart from the fact that the statements were made
to police officers, no evidence was adduced casting any doubt on the voluntary
nature of the answers.

The principle was recently restated by de Grandpré J., speaking
on behalf of this Court in Powell v. The Queen[19],
where he observed at pp. 366 and 367:

It is conceded by the Crown that in principle before a
statement of any kind can be admitted in evidence against a person accused, it
must be shown by the prosecution to the satisfaction of the trial judge to have
been freely and voluntarily made by that accused person. This principle, of course,
has been repeatedly stated by this Court, particularly in Sankey v. The
King, [1927] S.C.R. 436, Fiché v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R. 23,

[Page 952]

John v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R. 781, and R. v.
Gauthier, a judgment of June 26, 1975, still unreported.

In the Powell case, the accused was charged with having
assaulted a woman and a statement which he had made to a constable which placed
him at the scene of the assault was admitted by the trial judge, who was
sitting alone, without the holding of a voir dire. In finding that the
trial judge was wrong in so admitting the statement, Mr. Justice de Grandpré
observed, at p. 366:

Was the statement admissible without a voir dire? It
must first be remembered that the conversation reported in the above quotation
took place in a context. When the police officers first made the accused aware
of the purpose of their investigation, they were met with a flat denial that he
had been in the vicinity of the hotel. Again, a few minutes later, upon being
charged and cautioned by the police officers [sic], he denied involvement. It
is only when Constable Melvin was busy attending to some other duties that the
impugned conversation took place. Later on, that same night, when questioned by
detectives, the accused twice repeated having no knowl­edge of the occurrence.

Later in the same judgment the learned judge observed that these
circumstances clearly show ""that the rule had to be applied without
question"".

It will readily be seen that the context in which the statements
were made by the accused at Crescent Beach differs in all material respects
from that in the Powell case. Here, when the police questioned Erven and
his companions they were not aware of any crime having been committed by anyone
but were acting on suspicion resulting from a telephone tip from someone who
was very suspi­cious of what was going on at the beach. The two men being
questioned were not under arrest and no crime was at that time being
investigated.

In my view, the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice de Grandpré
in Powell reaffirm the rule that the sole purpose of a voir dire is
to determine whether the statement sought to be introduced against the accused
was made voluntarily and that the necessity for holding such an inquiry is to
be determined by the circumstances under which the statement is made. The
matter was clearly put by

[Page 953]

Mr. Justice Rand in the case of Boudreau v. The King[20],
where he said at p. 269:

The cases of Ibrahim v. Rex, [1914] A.C. 599, Rex
v. Voisin, [1918] I K.B. 531, and Rex v. Prosko, 63 S.C.R. 226 lay
it down that the fundamental question is whether the statement is voluntary. No
doubt arrest and the presence of officers tend to arouse apprehension which a
warning may or may not suffice to remove, and the rule is directed against the
danger of improperly instigated or induced or coerced admissions. It is
the doubt cast on the truth of the statement arising from the
circumstances in which it is made that gives rise to the rule. What the
statement should be is that of a man free in volition from the compulsions or
inducements of authority and what is sought is assurance that that is the case.
The underlying and controlling question then remains: is the statement freely
and voluntarily made?

The historical origins of the rule making it necessary to ensure
that the trial judge is satisfied as to the voluntary character of all
statements made by the accused has its origins in early inquisitorial practices
when torture was far from unknown in order to extort a confession and brib­ery
frequently employed to the same end.

The nature of the burden of proof resting upon the Crown in order
to establish the voluntariness and therefore the admissibility of statements
made by an accused person has long been accepted as it was stated by Viscount
Sumner in Ibrahim v. The King, supra, at p. 609 where he said:

It has long been established as a positive rule of English
criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against
him unless it is shewn [sic] by the prosecution to have been a voluntary
statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear
of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in
authority.

The statements made by the accused at Crescent Beach in the
present case are limited to his having given his address and occupation and
having agreed when he was asked whether he was engaged like his companion in
working for search and rescue and in collecting soil samples. I can

[Page 954]

think of no way in which doubt could be cast on the voluntariness
of the first statement as to his address and occupation and although I am satis­fied
that the second statement was untrue, I do not think that this affects its
admissibility. The mere fact that an untrue statement may be exculpatory does
not of itself, in my opinion, make it inadmiss­ible under the judgment of this
Court in Fiché v. The Queen[21]. It
was stated more than once in the majority judgment in that case that the
initial question to be determined in deciding whether or not such statements
should be admitted was whether or not it was voluntarily made. In a case tried
with a jury when such a statement has been admitted after holding a voir dire,
the question of its truth is a separate issue for the jury to determine
and, as is pointed out by Mr. Justice Pigeon in the case of R. v. Gauthier[22],
the issues of truth and voluntariness in such cases are to be treated as
severable even where the trial is conducted by a judge sitting alone.

It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the fact that
the statements in the present case were made to police officers who were
obviously persons in authority is enough to raise a doubt as to whether they
were obtained from him by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage, and while it
may frequently be the case that questioning by police officers could affect the
voluntariness of the answers, I think the matter is best viewed in light of
what was said by Mr. Justice Rand in The Queen v. Fitton[23],
at pp. 963 and 964 where he said:

The accused was not at the time under formal arrest although
he had been requested to stay in the police station and, for the greater part
of the time, remained in the general office, and the earlier questions were
such as the police might have addressed to any person in the remotest way drawn
into the enquiry. Questions without intimidating or suggestive overtones are
inescapable from police enquiry; and put as they were here, they cannot by
themselves be taken to invalidate the response given. The question still
remains: was the statement made through fear or hope induced by authority?

[Page 955]

The statements made by Erven at Crescent Beach were in answer to
questions such as the police might have addressed to any person in the remotest
way drawn into the inquiry. They were not made by a person who was under arrest
or in custody and I find no suggestion of intimidation or suggestive overtones
in anything which the police asked of the accused. Furthermore, it appears to
me to be unrealistic to treat Constable Botham as having held out any fear of
prejudice or hope of advantage to Erven in relation to the commission of any
offence, particularly as he did not realize that the conversation was important
and ""initially ... had no idea of what was going on"". Even if a voir
dire had been held, there was, in my opinion, nothing which could raise a
doubt in the mind of the trial judge as to the voluntary character of the
answers given by the accused.

The order granting leave to appeal to this Court is not limited
to the statements made by the appellant at Crescent Beach on August 21, but
also puts in question the admissibility of state­ments allegedly made by him
while in custody on August 27. This Court was, however, of opinion that the
exchange between the appellant and the police while he was in custody when he
accepted the items of his clothing which had been found in the cabin at Beech
Hill, was admissible without a voir dire and it was stated at the
hearing that it was not necessary to call on the respondent in this regard.

It is thus apparent that the only statements which are now
challenged as having been improp­erly introduced without the holding of a voir
dire are those made by the appellant to Constable Botham at Crescent Beach.
These statements were limited to the appellant giving his address in Vancouver
and his having said ""Yes"" when asked whether he was engaged, as Mayer
had claimed to be, in work with search and rescue collecting samples in the
area.

As I have indicated, I do not think that the learned trial judge
erred in admitting the conver­sation at Crescent Beach without the holding of a
voir dire, but even if he had been in error in this regard, it appears
to me from a careful reading of his judgment that the statements made by the

[Page 956]

appellant at that time did not play an essential part in the
reasoning which led to his finding that the appellant was guilty of possession
of cannabis resin.

The learned trial judge found that the appellant and his friend
Mayer had made two or three trips to and from LaHave Island in the helicopter
which was carrying the drug and he further made the following finding
concerning the clothing found at the cabin where the cannabis resin was stored:

It seems to me that the acceptance by the accused of these
three items of clothing is some evidence which is unexplained and which
connected the accused with the whole operation.

The two items of evidence to which I have last referred afford
ample material to support the find­ing of guilt and whatever doubt may be cast
on the admissibility of the brief words spoken by Erven at the beach, I am
satisfied that the judge's verdict would have been the same if these words had
been excluded from the evidence and that their admis­sion occasioned no
substantial wrong or miscar­riage of justice. I am therefore in any event of
opinion that this is a case in which s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code should
be invoked.

I would accordingly dismiss this appeal.

The judgment of Beetz and Pratte JJ. was deliv­ered by

PRATTE J.—I agree with my brother Dickson that the appeal should
be allowed, but I come to this conclusion on narrower grounds. I feel obligat­ed
to express my views separately.

The issue is as to whether the trial judge erred in admitting
into evidence two verbal statements allegedly made by appellant to officers of
the R.C.M.P. without holding a voir dire which in both instances
had been requested by counsel for the defence.

The first statement was made to Const. Botham of the R.C.M.P. on
August 21, 1974, when in the course of a conversation that lasted approximately
five minutes, appellant answered questions as to his name, his address and the
reason for his presence

[Page 957]

on the beach. This conversation took place in the presence of
another constable, and of one Mayer, who was appellant's companion in the
venture; after this conversation, the two constables kept appellant and Mayer
under surveillance for about one and a half hours and then proceeded to their
arrest.

We know little about the circumstances of the conversation
between Const. Botham and appel­lant. Of the four witnesses to this
conversation, only Botham gave evidence; he said that at the time he did not
know that he was investigating an important criminal operation and that
appellant was to be arrested shortly after the conversation. There is no
evidence as to the actions of the other constable prior to and during the
conversation between appellant and Botham.

In my opinion, the statement made on the beach by appellant to
Const. Botham was not admissible in evidence unless it was proven by the
prosecution to have been made voluntarily (Ibrahim v. Rex[24],
at p. 609).

The normal procedure for determining the voluntariness of a
statement of the accused is through a voir dire and, the onus
being on the Crown to prove voluntariness, a request for a voir dire should
not be denied save in rare circumstances, where, for instance, the request
would be clearly frivolous or would constitute a demon­strable abuse of
process.

In the case at bar, the trial judge refused to hold a voir
dire because he was of the view that the voluntariness of the statements of
the appellant had been established by the decision of the Nova Scotia Supreme
Court, Appeal Division in R. v. Mayer[25]. Whatever
be the merits of the decision in Mayer, it was not concerned with the
statement here in question. Whether a statement is voluntary or not is
essentially a question of fact to be determined by the trial judge who hears
the case. In D.P.P. v. Ping Lin[26], Lord
Salmon spoke thus at p. 606:

[Page 958]

... In deciding whether an alleged confession or statement
was free and voluntary and should be admitted in evidence, it is useless, just
as it is in an accident case, to search for another case in which the facts
seem to be similar and treat it as binding. Facts vary infinitely from case to
case. The judge's task is to consider the evidence before him, to assess its
implications and to decide the case on his view of that evidence in the light
of the basic established principle.

I am therefore of the opinion that the trial judge erred in
refusing to hold a voir dire as to the voluntariness of the first
statement of August 21, 1974.

But it does not necessarily follow that such error on the part of
the trial judge be fatal and the statement necessarily inadmissible. The
holding of a voir dire is only a means to an end and a statement
should not be held to be not voluntary for the sole reason that no voir dire
was held. The substantive issue always is whether the statement has been
proven to have been made voluntarily. There are some situations where the
failure to hold a voir dire which should have been held, while a
technical breach of a rule of procedure, would entail no practical effect
because the statement would otherwise have been proven to be voluntary; for
instance, in R. v. Spencer[27], Chief
Justice MacKeigan said at p. 36:

... Even if a voir dire had been held, the statement
would have had to have been held to be voluntary. This was shown in subsequent
evidence by the accused and his friends who said nothing to dispute the circum­stances
but only disputed exactly what was said and by whom: the accused indeed
admitted being asked the question about the carton of hashish but claimed:
""No, I think I said, 'Yeah, let's go.' ""—rather than the police
version of his reply, namely: ""Yes, that's all"", or ""Yes.""

The situation in the case at bar is entirely dif­ferent; there is
an almost complete dearth of evi­dence as to the circumstances in which the
statement of August 21 was made. The evidence does not indicate whether or not
there was any inducement or threat. The mere fact that the appellant was only
under surveillance and not yet under arrest cannot be the determining factor in
estab­lishing the voluntary nature of the statement.

[Page 959]

It has also been suggested to us that the statement should be
admitted in evidence because it was volunteered by appellant. I cannot agree. A
statement that is volunteered is one that is not asked for. The verb ""to
volunteer"" means: ""To communicate (information, etc.) on one's own initiative""
(Shorter Oxford English Dictionary). It is clear that the voluntary nature of a
volunteered statement would be much easier to prove than that of a statement
which, while not volunteered, is nevertheless voluntary. But in both cases, the
rule in Ibrahim is applicable. In the case at bar, the evidence does not
support the conclusion that the appellant took the initiative to communicate to
Const. Botham information as to his name, his address and also as to the
reasons for his presence on the beach.

I am therefore of the opinion that the statement of August 21,
1974 has not been proven to have been made voluntarily and should not have been
allowed in evidence. I am further of the view that the rest of the evidence is
not so strong against the appellant as to permit me to say that the error of
the trial judge resulted in no miscarriage of justice. This is therefore not a
case where we should exercise our discretion under art. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code.

As to the statement of August 27, our unani­mous decision not to
disturb the decision of the trial judge was announced in Court at the close of
the argument for the appellant.

I would therefore dispose of this appeal in the manner proposed
by my brother Dickson.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEWFOUNDLAND, IN BANCO

Extradition—Procedure—Depositions for
extradition proceedings—Right of counsel for accused to be present—Right of
counsel for accused to cross-examine deponents—Statements prepared in
typewritten form prior to appearance merely signed before magistrate—Mandamus
to direct that affidavits be properly taken—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, s. 468—Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21,
s. 31.

Mandamus—Depositions for use in extradition
proceedings—Depositions sent to foreign state—Allegations of
impropriety—Availability of mandamus—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
s. 468—Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21, s. 31.

Accused, a former senior civil servant in the
Province of Newfoundland, was
charged under the Criminal Code with fraud, bribery and breach of trust.
Warrants were issued for his arrest. He was taken into custody in Panama and flown to Miami, Florida,
where he was to be transferred to an Air Canada flight to Montreal. At Miami accused applied for landed immigrant status and became the subject
of an application for extradition. In order to pursue the extradition
proceedings the Director of Public Prosecutions of Newfoundland had a number of
witnesses brought before a magistrate to give evidence by deposition for use in
the Florida extradition proceedings as provided in s. 31 of the Extradition
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑21. Sub-section (1) of s. 31
provides that the depositions may be taken ‘in the absence of the person
accused of an extradition crime. Counsel for the accused attended some of the
proceedings at which the respondent magistrate ruled that he could not
cross-examine the deponents. Counsel for the accused was not informed of the
time or place of taking the remaining depositions although he requested such
information from the Crown. Some of the depositions were apparently prepared in
advance and simply signed by the depo-

[Page 294]

nents in the presence of the magistrate. The
depositions once signed and sworn were certified by the magistrate and then
sent to the United States after
authentication by T. Alex. Hickman, Attorney General of Newfoundland, the
Deputy Minister of Justice at Ottawa and by a U.S. Embassy official at Ottawa. Accused sought a writ of mandamus in the Supreme Court of
Newfoundland, first, to stay proceedings, second, to declare the depositions
null and void and, third, to order the return of the documents to the
Magistrate’s jurisdiction. The Chief Justice of Newfoundland dismissed the
application for mandamus and his judgment was confirmed on appeal by the
Supreme Court of Newfoundland in banco. Appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada lay as of right pursuant to s. 36 (b) of the Supreme
Court Act (since repealed by 1974(Can.), c. 18, s. 3) when
appellant sought, firstly, an order to recall the depositions and/or to inform
the Minister of Justice for Canada that they were not taken according to the
laws of Canada and, secondly, an order to allow counsel for the appellant the
right to cross-examine on any deposition taken or to be taken under s. 31
of the Extradition Act.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence J. dissenting in part): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré: Section 31(1) of the Extradition
Act authorized the magistrate to take depositions in the absence of the
accused appellant who had no right to be present by counsel or to have his
counsel cross‑examine the deponents. The words of s. 31(1) “… in
like manner as he might take the depositions if the accused were present and
charged before him with such extradition crime” could not be regarded as
importing all of s. 468 of the Criminal Code. Sections 31(1)
imports, at most, the mechanical aspects of deposition-taking alluded to in
s. 468. The duty of the magistrate under s. 31(1) is simply to “take
depositions”. He is not presiding at a hearing, nor is he determining any issue
of fact or law. A deposition is nothing more than a statement on oath in a
judicial proceeding, taken down in writing and sworn before a justice and the
facts alleged by appellant did not support the view that the depositions were
not taken before the magistrate.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence J. dissenting: While s. 31 of the Extradition
Act does not entitle the person whose extradition is sought to participate
in the taking of the depositions and while notice need not be given to that
person there is no reason why counsel instructed by him

[Page 295]

should be prevented from attending at the
taking of the depositions. If s. 468 of the Criminal Code has any
operation at all it should include openness of the proceedings. In the
circumstances and on the basis of the affidavits filed, mandamus should issue
to direct that depositions taken from three of the deponents be taken properly.
While pre-preparation of a deposition need not be per se irregular what
was done in these three cases passed acceptable informality.

v. Shine (1902), 187 U.S.
181; Re State of Wisconsin and Armstrong, [1973] F.C. 437 referred to.]

Courts—Jurisdiction

Court Act, R.S.C. 1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 10—Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. E-21, s. 31.

Per Curiam:
A magistrate taking depositions under the Extradition Act performs a
function different from that of an extradition judge. The peripheral powers
exercised by the magistrate under the Extradition Act are analogous to
his usual judicial duties and do not justify regarding him as a persona
designata and therefore within the scope of s. 2(g) of the Federal
Court Act, R.S.C. 1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 10. The mandamus was properly
sought in the Provincial Supreme Court.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of Newfoundland in banco[1] dismissing
an appeal by the accused from the dismissal of an application for a writ of
mandamus. Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J. and Spence J. dissenting in part.

Robert Nelson, for the appellant.

James J. Greene, Q.C., for the
respondents.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence J. was
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting in part)—I
agree with my brother Dickson that s. 31 of the Extradition Act, respecting
the taking of deposi-

[Page 296]

tions to be used in a foreign state in
connection with the extradition of a person accused of an extraditable crime,
does not entitle that person to participate in the taking of the depositions.
The fact that the accused person held in a foreign state becomes aware of the
fact that depositions will be taken and instructs counsel to represent him does
not change the situation.

In my view, however, although notice need not be
given to that person, I see no reason why counsel instructed by him should be
prevented from attending at the taking of the depositions. If s. 468 of
the Criminal Code, which is referentially mentioned in s. 31 of the
Extradition Act, has any operation at all, it should certainly include
openness of the proceedings, which is an important value in our system of
administration of justice. The evasion practised by the then Director of Public
Prosecutions in Newfoundland when information was sought by the appellant’s
counsel as to the time and place of the taking of the depositions is fully set
out in an affidavit of that counsel, and I accept unreservedly his narration of
what occurred. (The appellant was, of course, represented by a different
counsel in this Court.) I think that the Crown counsel behaved badly towards a
fellow lawyer without reasonable excuse. That, however, gives no ground of
relief to the appellant in this case.

The point in this appeal which troubles me is
whether certain depositions were regularly taken. The record shows that about
thirty-six depositions were taken, and three of these are the subject of
affidavits which indicate that they were not so much taken as presented for
signature, after having been prepared by the Director of Public Prosecutions
without a fair opportunity to the deponents to consider their contents and to
have them verified before a magistrate. I refer to the depositions taken from
William Alexander MacPherson, Prospero Joseph DeSantis and Jack L. Goodson. The
affidavit of appellant’s counsel (previously referred to) respecting the
Goodson deposition and the affidavits of MacPherson and DeSantis as to how
their depositions were taken persuade me, in the absence of evidence to the
contrary, that

[Page 297]

they were foisted on the deponents by the
Director of Public Prosecutions. There is no indication that a stenographer was
present to record any of the proceedings; indeed, the affidavit of appellant’s
counsel states in respect of the Goodson deposition that no stenographer was
present nor was any recording equipment evident.

I think it is open to the Court to issue mandamus
at the instance of the appellant to direct that the depositions of the
aforementioned three persons be taken properly. I do not say that pre‑preparation
of a deposition is per se irregular, but what was done in the three
instances I have mentioned passes any acceptable informality.

I would allow the appeal to this limited extent.
I may add that I also agree with my brother Dickson that mandamus could
properly be sought in this matter from the Newfoundland Courts and that it is
not within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon,
Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—This appeal raises an important
question as to the right of cross-examination; subsidiary questions are
presented but they fall to be determined only if the primary question is
decided favourably to the appellant, Oliver L. Vardy.

The case arose in this way. Mr. Vardy, a
former senior civil servant of the Province of Newfoundland, was charged under
the Criminal Code in December, 1973, with fraud, bribery and breach of
trust. Warrants were issued for his arrest. He was taken into custody in
Panama, late in January, 1974, and placed on a Pan-American plane to go from
Panama City, Panama to Miami, Florida where he was to be transferred to an Air
Canada flight to Montreal. At Miami he applied for landed immigrant status. He
also became the subject of a complaint for extradition filed in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. He was arrested and
released on $50,000 bond upon condition that he remain

[Page 298]

within the Southern and Middle Districts of
Florida, where he currently resides.

From affidavits filed, it appears that on
January 25, 1974, the Canadian Embassy at Washington, D.C., delivered a note to
the State Department of the United States requesting Vardy’s extradition.
Section 30(1) of the Extradition Act authorizes the Minister of Justice
of Canada to make a requisition for the surrender of a fugitive criminal from
Canada, who is or is suspected to be in a foreign state with which there is an
extradition treaty. Section 31 of the Extradition Act, the construction
of which is at the heart of the present appeal, makes provision for the taking
in Canada of depositions for use in extradition proceedings in a foreign state.
Sub-sections (1) and (2) of s. 31 read:

31. (1)
Whenever, for the purposes of this Act, it becomes necessary or expedient to
secure evidence by depositions taken in Canada to be used in a foreign state,
any justice of the peace, or any person having authority to issue a warrant for
the apprehension of persons accused of offences and to commit such persons for
trial, may take depositions in the absence of a person accused of an
extradition crime in like manner as he might take the depositions if the
accused person were present and charged before him with such extradition crime.

(2) Such justice of the peace or person
having authority as aforesaid may, by subpoena or order, command the attendance
at the time and place therein mentioned, of any person or witness for the
purpose of being examined as to any extradition crime charged under this Act,
and may require the production of any writings or other documents relating to
the charge that are in the possession or power of such person or witness.

The Director of Public Prosecutions of
Newfoundland, John Connors, issued subpoenas to approximately 36 people to give
evidence by deposition for use in the Florida extradition proceedings. The
appellant Vardy retained counsel to appear for him at the taking of the
depositions. At the taking of the deposition of one Jack L. Good-son, charged
in conjunction with Vardy, Mr. Connors objected to the presence of counsel
for Vardy, as did Goodson and his counsel. The respondent magistrate, Clement
Scott, ruled that counsel

[Page 299]

could attend the proceeding but not
cross-examine Goodson. Counsel for the appellant was not informed of the time
or place of taking the remaining depositions although he requested such
information from Mr. Connors. In all, some 24 depositions were taken and
sworn before Magistrate Hugh O’Neill and 13 depositions before Magistrate
Clement Scott. The depositions were bound and then certified by the magistrate
and, accompanied by a certificate of authentication completed by T. Alex.
Hickman, Attorney General for the Province of Newfoundland, delivered to the
Deputy Minister of Justice at Ottawa. Further certificates of authentication
were added by the Deputy Minister and by an official at the United States
Embassy at Ottawa. Finally, on April 12, 1974, two copies of the extradition
record were delivered to the United States Department of Justice in Washington.
The record was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Florida at Miami on May 6, 1974. The extradition hearing in
Florida, on the merits, has been postponed sine die pending the outcome
of an interlocutory appeal by the appellant before a Louisiana Court.

The proceedings in Canada took the form of a
motion for a writ of mandamus before the Supreme Court of Newfoundland.
The notice of motion reads as follows:

TAKE NOTICE that leave of the Honourable
the Chief Justice having been given on the 10th day of May A.D. 1974, the Court
will be moved on the 28th day of May A.D. 1974, at 10:30 o’clock in the
forenoon or as soon thereafter as Counsel may be heard, on behalf of Oliver L.
Vardy, for an Order directed to the Respondents to show cause why a Writ of
Mandamus to the said Respondents ordering that the proceedings with respect to
two certain Informations charging Oliver L. Vardy with violations of Section 338(1),
Section 110(c) and Section 111 of the Criminal Code of Canada and those certain
proceedings seeking extradition of the said Oliver L. Vardy in respect of said
Informations and all depositions, affidavits, sworn statements and other
matters made, taken, obtained and sworn to in respect of the proceedings above
set forth be stayed, and further to declare with respect thereto that all
proceedings, affidavits, depositions and sworn statements taken, made and sworn
to in respect to the aforesaid extradition proceedings are null and void, and
further to issue a Writ of

[Page 300]

Mandamus commanding that all such
proceedings, affidavits, depositions, and sworn statements be withdrawn from
usage, withheld and returned to the Magistrate’s jurisdiction unless and until
such time as the said Respondents shall fully comply with the laws of Canada
and the Province of Newfoundland made and provided in respect to the carrying
on, making, taking and swearing of the same.

In effect, the appellant in the notice of motion
asked for three types of relief: (1) a stay of proceedings (on the charges and
on the extradition); (2) a declaration that the depositions were null and void;
and (3) an order for the return of the documents to the Magistrate’s
jurisdiction. The notice of motion was directed to Magistrate Clement Scott, to
the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Connors, and to the Attorney
General of Newfoundland, Mr. Hickman. On the return of the motion before
Chief Justice Furlong of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland, counsel for the
respondents Hickman and Scott, and Mr. Connors in person, raised the
point, by way of preliminary objection, that mandamus would not lie
against the respondents. Chief Justice Furlong sustained the preliminary
objection and dismissed the mandamus application. Chief Justice
Furlong’s judgment was confirmed on appeal by the Supreme Court of Newfoundland
sitting in banco. An appeal to this Court was then taken pursuant to
s. 36(b) of the Supreme Court Act (since repealed by 1974
(Can.), c. 18, s. 3) which gave an appeal as of right from a final
judgment in mandamus.

Before this Court, the relief asked by the
appellant Vardy differed radically from that asked in the lower courts. The
order he seeks reads as follows:

(a) That the Respondents or either of them
be ordered to recall the said depositions and/or to inform the Minister of
Justice for Canada that the said depositions were not taken in accordance with
the laws of Canada.

(b) That the Respondents or either of them
be ordered to allow Counsel for the Appellant the right to cross-examine on any
depositions taken or to be taken under Section 31 of the Extradition Act in
relation to the said requisition for extradition of the Appellant.

[Page 301]

Paragraph (a) is new. The Minister of Justice of
Canada is not and has never been a party to the proceedings and counsel for
Vardy conceded during argument that mandamus would not lie against the
Minister in the present proceedings. At the conclusion of argument counsel said
that what he was actually seeking was an order directed to Magistrate Scott to
require cross-examination on the depositions which have been taken. A request
in this form releases Mr. Hickman and Mr. Connors from the
proceedings. The request is silent on the matter of the 24 depositions taken
before Magistrate O’Neill, not a party to these proceedings.

The first observation which might be made is
that none of the three forms of relief sought in the notice of motion is
related to a specific public duty owed by any of the three respondents. Before mandamus
can issue there must be a duty, without discretion, upon the person or body
against whom the order is directed to do the very thing ordered. Here the
request made on behalf of the appellant leaves in obscurity the source of the
right to be enforced, a fortiori the duty, which would require the
magistrate to order the return of the depositions from the United States
courts. The request pays scant heed to the substantial body of jurisprudence
which holds that mandamus will not lie to undo that which has already
been done in contravention of statute. In short, it sits strangely in the
context of mandamus jurisprudence.

One must, however, examine carefully s. 31
of the Extradition Act, quoted earlier, to determine whether it gives
the appellant the right he asserts. Counsel rests his entire case on the
submission that the effect of s. 31(1), in particular the words “… any
justice of the peace… may take depositions in the absence of a person accused
of an extradition crime in like manner as he might take the depositions if the
accused person were present and charged before him with such extradition crime”
is such as to import into the Extradition Act s. 468 of the Criminal
Code, or at least that portion of s. 468 which gives a right of
cross-examination to the accused or his counsel. Section 468 reads in part:

[Page 302]

468. (1)
Where the accused is before a justice holding a preliminary inquiry, the
justice shall

(a) take the evidence under
oath, in the presence of the accused, of the witnesses called on the part of
the prosecution and allow the accused or his counsel to cross‑examine
them; and

(b) cause a record of the
evidence of each witness to be taken

(i) by a stenographer appointed by him, or
in legible writing, in the form of a deposition, in Form 27, or

(ii) in a province where a sound recording
apparatus is authorized by or under provincial legislation for use in civil
cases, by the type of apparatus so authorized and in accordance with the
requirements of the provincial legislation.

(2) Where a deposition is taken down in
writing, the justice shall, in the presence of the accused, before asking the
accused if he wishes to call witnesses,

(a) cause the deposition to
be read to the witness,

(b) cause the deposition to
be signed by the witness, and

(c) sign the deposition
himself.

(3) Where depositions are taken down in
writing the justice may sign

(a) at the end of each
deposition, or

(b) at the end of several or
all of the depositions in a manner that will indicate that his signature is intended
to authenticate each deposition.

The appellant’s submission is unsupported by
authority other than a broad general statement in Extradition To and From
Canada (1961) by G. La Forest, at p. 95:

The Act makes provision for taking evidence
to be used in extradition proceedings abroad. It authorizes every justice of
the peace, or any person having authority to issue a warrant for the
apprehension of persons accused of offences, to take depositions required for
proceedings abroad in the absence of the accused, and to summon witnesses and
require the production of documents for the purpose. The justice or other
person may do this in the same manner as he would take depositions if the
accused were present and charged before him of the crime. This imports into the
proceedings section 453 of the Criminal Code. The depositions are
therefore given on oath or affirmation and taken down in writing by a
stenographer. These must then be signed and authenticated as provided in
section 453. [Section 453 is the present s. 468]

[Page 303]

The author’s attention does not seem to have
been directed to the exercise of a right of cross‑examination by an
accused or his counsel, but rather to the more mechanical aspects of the
process.

Counsel for the respondents urges that s. 31
(1) was placed in the Extradition Act for the purpose of protecting the Crown
and not of giving rights to a fugitive accused. The sole object, it is urged,
is to permit witnesses to be heard and depositions to be taken in the absence
of the accused in derogation of the right of an accused, enshrined in common
law and statute, to face his accusers. This submission has considerable force.
The primary purpose of the subsection is clearly as respondent’s counsel
contends. In accepting this proposition, however, one must be careful to give
some effect to the concluding words of the subsection, beginning with “in like
manner”.

If s. 31(1) of the Extradition Act imports
s. 468 of the Criminal Code, as is contended, it is obvious that it
cannot import all of s. 468. That section requires that the evidence
of prosecution witnesses be heard “in the presence of the accused”. If the
accused were present there would be no need for extradition proceedings.
Similarly, if s. 31 imports a right of cross‑examination because of
s. 468, the right must be one exercisable only by counsel for the accused
and never by the accused in person. Again, one cannot import s. 468(2) of
the Code to the extent that it requires the reading and signing of
depositions “in the presence of the accused”. The matter of “asking the accused
if he wishes to call witnesses”, more particularly spelled out in s. 469,
is equally out of place. So that when one carves out of s. 468 those parts
which are clearly inapposite because of the absence of the accused, and when
one qualifies even the alleged right of cross-examination by limiting its
exercise to counsel, and not the accused, the result is incongruous. It compels
the conclusion that s. 31 imports, at most, the mechanical aspects of
deposition-taking alluded to in s. 468. While the presence of the accused
is central and indispensable to a preliminary hearing, absurdities result when
one tries to adapt the procedures of a preliminary hearing to a

[Page 304]

proceeding in which the accused is absent by choice.

In In re Collins[2] at p. 445, an extradition case,
Duff J., as he then was, endorsed the view that “…the technicalities of the
criminal practice should not be allowed to smother or encumber the
administration of the procedure prescribed by these modern statutes …”. Duff J.
quoted with approval the language of Mr. Justice Brown, delivering the
judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in Grin v. Shine[3] at p. 184 “… proceedings for a
surrender are not such as put in issue the life or liberty of the accused. They
simply demand of him that he shall do what all good citizens are required and
ought to be willing to do, viz: submit themselves to the laws of their
country”.

The proceedings at the extradition hearing are
not such as to jeopardize the liberty of the accused, nor does the taking of
depositions preparatory to an extradition hearing. At an extradition hearing in
Canada the fugitive is brought before a judge. Section 13 of the Extradition
Act applies. It reads:

13. The
fugitive shall be brought before a judge, who shall, subject to this Part, hear
the case, in the same manner, as nearly as may be, as if the fugitive was
brought before a justice of the peace, charged with an indictable offence
committed in Canada.

There are two significant points of difference
between s. 13 and s. 31(1): First, the use of “shall” in s. 13
and “may” in s. 31, and, second, the presence in s. 13 of the words
“… judge… shall… hear the case …”, which enjoins all the concomitants of
a hearing whereas s. 31(1) does not.

Section 16 of the Extradition Act provides
for the admission of deposition evidence in extradition hearings in Canada. In Re
State of Wisconsin and Armstrong[4], the
Federal Court of Appeal was called upon to consider whether a fugitive criminal

[Page 305]

was denied due process and a fair hearing if he
were not afforded an opportunity for cross‑examination upon the affidavit
evidence at the actual extradition hearing. A unanimous court rejected the
fugitive Armstrong’s appeal. Mr. Justice Thurlow, with whom
Mr. Justice Cameron concurred, used these words in reference to the nature
of an extradition hearing (at pp. 276-77 C.C.C., at p. 443 F.C.)

If the proceedings were in the nature of a
trial on the subject of guilt or innocence the absence of a right or opportunity
to test the evidence of the applicants by cross‑examination might well be
a serious objection to the fairness and justice of such a rule, but, as already
pointed out, that is not the situation. The hearing is a mere inquiry and what
the extradition Judge has to determine is not the guilt or innocence of the
fugitive but the question whether the evidence produced would justify his
committal for trial. The fugitive is entitled to be made aware, by the reading
of the affidavits presented, of the case against him, upon which his
extradition for trial may be ordered, but he is not required to answer that
case and even if he elects to do so, by evidence or otherwise, the Judge’s
function remains the same. He is not empowered to decide the merits of guilt or
innocence, or to pass upon the credibility of witnesses but simply to determine
whether there is a sufficient case against the fugitive to justify his
committal. The trial and determination of the fugitive’s rights with respect to
the charge are left to the trial Court.

The foregoing observations apply with even
greater force to proceedings antecedent to the extradition hearing. The stage
of gathering deposition evidence is further removed from a determination of
guilt or innocence than the process in Armstrong.

The duty, and authority, reposed in the
magistrate by s. 31(1) is simply to “take depositions”. He is required to
take the evidence of the witness under oath, to cause the deposition to be read
to, and signed by, the witness, and to sign the deposition himself. That is
all. He is not presiding at a hearing, nor is he determining any issue of law
or fact. Depositions are not taken for use at the trial of an accused but
merely for use at an extradition inquiry which antedates a possible preliminary

[Page 306]

inquiry. This last-mentioned procedure in turn
precedes a trial at which guilt or innocence is decided.

A further consideration in determining the scope
of s. 31(1) lies in the effectiveness of the right claimed. If the
submission on behalf of Vardy is valid, the Extradition Act would become
ineffective as a means of extraditing fugitive criminals, for if a fugitive has
a right of cross‑examination of witnesses giving evidence by way of
deposition, he should be afforded an opportunity for the effective exercise of
that right. This would require, minimally, that the fugitive be given notice,
that he be permitted to retain counsel, and that he be advised, personally or
through counsel, of the time and place when each deposition is to be taken. If
there is a genuine right of cross-examination imported into the Extradition
Act from s. 468 of the Code, it would not do to leave the
exercise of the right to chance, available only if the accused or his counsel
happened to learn fortuitously that a deposition was to be taken at a certain
time and place. When one recalls the parts of the world in which fugitive
criminals may seek refuge, the language and other difficulties in communicating
with authorities in those countries, and the complicated legal-diplomatic lines
of communication in extradition matters, it is obvious that a right to notice
would frustrate or defeat the entire extradition process.

Appellant would import into a pre-trial, and
indeed pre-inquiry, procedure most of the panoply and trappings of a criminal
trial—and all of this in respect of proceedings in which time may be of the
essence.

Counsel for the appellant in his factum referred
to s. 2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights but the point was
not even faintly pressed during the oral argument on appeal.

For the foregoing reasons I do not believe that
s. 31(1) should receive the construction for which the appellant contends.
In my opinion the magistrate was authorized to take depositions in the absence
of the accused appellant and the accused appellant had no right to be present
by counsel or to cross-examine.

[Page 307]

Before leaving the case there are two other
matters to which I would briefly refer, both of which were raised from the
bench during the argument on the appeal.

First, whether on the facts of the case, it
could be said that the magistrates had, in fact, taken “depositions”. It
appeared from the affidavit of one William Alexander MacPherson, filed in
support of the motion, that MacPherson was questioned by a constable of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police who wrote out his version of the interview which
MacPherson signed. Some months later MacPherson was given a finished typed
document to sign as his deposition, the contents of which came from
MacPherson’s original statement and the minutes of a meeting of a Board of
Directors at which MacPherson was present. One DeSantis completed an affidavit
in which he said that the procedure adopted for the taking of the depositions
had not been that of questions and answers; rather he had been asked to sign a
written statement which had been prepared in advance. Mr. Isaac Mercer,
counsel for the appellant in the earlier proceedings, swore that Goodson had
been handed a document consisting of 15 to 20 pages and informed that the
magistrate was going to read the document, leaving it to Goodson to make any
corrections found necessary. Very few corrections or alterations were made. I
do not think these alleged facts support the view that there were no
depositions taken. A deposition is nothing more than a statement on oath in a
judicial proceeding, taken down in writing and sworn before a justice. Form 27
referred to in s. 468(1)(b)(i) of the Code merely says “XY
having been duly sworn, deposes as follows: (insert deposition as nearly as
possible in words of witness)”.

Second, a question was raised as to the
jurisdiction of the Newfoundland courts to hear the application for a writ of
mandamus, since the respondents were purporting to act in accordance with
s. 31 of the Extradition Act. By s. 18 of the Federal Court
Act, R.S.C. 1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 10, the Trial Division of the Federal
Court has exclusive original jurisdiction to issue a writ of

[Page 308]

mandamus against “any federal board, commission
or other tribunal”. Section 2 (g) of the Act defines that phrase as
follows:

“federal board, commission or other tribunal”
means any body or any person or persons having, exercising or purporting to
exercise jurisdiction or powers conferred by or under an Act of the Parliament
of Canada, other than any such body constituted or established by or under a
law of a province or any such person or persons appointed under or in
accordance with a law of a province or under section 96 of The British
North America Act, 1867.

Clearly a magistrate or justice of the peace taking
depositions under s. 31 of the Extradition Act is a person
exercising powers conferred by an Act of the Parliament of Canada. The question
is whether he or she is excluded from the definition by the proviso dealing
with provincial appointments.

The apparently broad words of s. 2 (g)
have been interpreted to confer jurisdiction on the Federal Court in cases
involving County Court judges who sit as extradition judges (Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico v. Hernandez[5]) and
those who exercise powers under the Indian Act (Lavell v. A.-G. Can.[6]). Although County Court judges are
appointed under s. 96 of the British North America Act, it has been
held that they fall within the scope of s. 2 (g) when they
sit as persona designata.

A magistrate taking depositions under the Extradition
Act performs a function different from that of an extradition judge. He
performs a simple administrative task similar to his role when hearing evidence
in a preliminary inquiry. In contrast, an extradition judge is involved in
decision-making, performing a task integral to the comprehensive extradition
scheme created by statute and treaty. Thus, there would appear to be more
reason to regard an extradition judge as a persona designata and thus a
“federal board” subject to

[Page 309]

Federal Court supervision. The magistrate,
appointed under a law of a province and exercising only peripheral powers under
the Extradition Act, analogous to his usual judicial duties, remains
subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of provincial superior courts.

I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Appeal by Crown—Notice of appeal signed by
counsel for Attorney General—Instructions to counsel signed by official in
Attorney General's depart­ment—Implied authority to delegate—Notice of appeal
valid—Manner of proof when authority of counsel questioned—Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 605(1).

The respondent was acquitted at trial on twelve
counts of theft by conversion. On appeal by the Crown a preliminary objection
to jurisdiction was taken on the ground that the notice of appeal did not
comply with the provisions of s. 605(1) of the Criminal Code. The notice
of appeal had been signed ""J. E. Spencer, Counsel for the Attorney
General"". Mr. Spencer's authority was derived from a letter bearing the
letterhead ""Attorney General, Province of British Columbia"", signed
by an official of that department, Mr. N. A. McDiarmid, ""Director,
Criminal Law"". The respondent argued suc­cessfully before the Court of
Appeal that in order to comply with s. 605(1) of the Code, Mr. Spencer's
instructions must come directly from the Attorney Gen­eral or from the Deputy
Attorney General of the Prov­ince. The Crown appealed from the judgment of the
Court of Appeal to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be allowed.

There is implied authority in the Attorney General to
delegate the power to instruct in s. 605(1). Section 605(1) does not require
the Attorney General personally to appeal or personally to instruct counsel to
appeal in every case. Although there is a general rule of construc­tion in law
that a person endowed with a discretionary power should exercise it personally (delegatus
non potest delegare) that rule can be displaced by the lan­guage, scope or
object of a particular administrative scheme. Where the exercise of a
discretionary power is entrusted to a Minister of the Crown it may be pre­sumed
that the acts will be performed, not by the Minister in person, but by
responsible officials in his

[Page 239]

department. While there was no evidence in the
present case that the Attorney General of British Columbia personally
instructed Mr. McDiarmid to act on his behalf in appealing judgments or
verdicts of acquittal of trial courts it was reasonable to assume the ""Director,
Criminal Law"" of the Province would have that author­ity to instruct. The
definition of Attorney General in s. 2 of the Criminal Code includes
""the lawful deputy"" of the Attorney General. The words ""lawful
deputy"" are not confined to ""Deputy Attorney General""; they com­prehend
all persons appointed to act on behalf of the Attorney General when acting
within the scope of their authority.

In the absence of direct challenge, no evidence need
be adduced to confirm the authority of counsel who appeals on behalf of the
Crown and describes himself as ""counsel for"" or ""counsel
instructed by"" or ""agent for"" the Attorney General or in words
to like effect. Advo­cates are officers of the Court and it is to be taken, in
the normal course, that when a counsel is acting with the authority of the
Attorney General he is indeed clothed with that authority. If objection is
taken which raises ground for doubt as to authority, it is normally sufficient
if counsel produces a letter which he can say he received and believes to be
signed by the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General or an officer of the
department whom he understands to have requisite au­thority to institute
criminal appeals.

v. Badall, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 503, considered; R. v. Green (1970), 1

APPEAL by the Crown from the dismissal of an appeal to the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia on a preliminary objection to jurisdic­tion
on the ground that the notice of appeal did not comply with the
provisions of s. 605(1) of the Criminal Code. Appeal allowed.

J. E. Smith, for the appellant.

J. T. Steeves, for the respondent.

[Page 240]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The respondent Harrison was acquitted before Judge Mussallem
in Provincial Court at Vancouver on twelve counts of theft by conversion of
sums of money. On appeal by the Crown a preliminary objection to jurisdiction
was taken on the ground that the notice of appeal did not comply with the
provisions of s. 605(1) of the Criminal Code which reads:

605 (1) The Attorney General or counsel instructed by him
for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal

(a) against a judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial
court in proceedings by indictment on any ground of appeal that involves a question
of law alone, .. .

The notice of appeal had been signed ""J. E. Spenc­er,
Counsel for the Attorney General"". Mr. Spenc­er's authority was derived
from a letter bearing the letterhead ""Attorney General, Province of
British Columbia"", signed by an official of that department, Mr. N. A. McDiarmid,
""Director, Criminal Law"". The respondent Harrison argued successful­ly
before the Court of Appeal that in order to comply with s. 605(1) of the Code,
Mr. Spencer's instructions must come directly from the Attorney General or
from the Deputy Attorney General of the Province.

In reaching its conclusion, the Court of Appeal relied on R.
v. Badall, a decision of that Court then under appeal to this Court. Some
three weeks after the present case was before the British Columbia Court our
Court, in a unanimous deci­sion of the full bench, set aside the judgment of
the Court in Badall[1]. Counsel
for the Crown submits that the rationale of Badall applies to the case
at bar. I am by no means persuaded that such is the case. In Badall the
Court concentrated on the form of the notice of appeal and did not deal with
the question of implied authority to delegate at issue here. As in the present
case the question was whether the Crown's notice of appeal from the
respondent's acquittal complied with s. 605 of the Criminal Code. In Badall,
however, counsel had

[Page 241]

signed the notice of appeal as ""Agent for the Attorney
General of Canada"" rather than ""Coun­sel for the Attorney General of
Canada"". It was contended that an agent could not bring an appeal in the
name of the Attorney General if the notice was signed by such ""agent""
even though no doubt had been cast on the fact of agency. Support for the
contention was said to be found in s. 748(6) of the Code dealing with
appeals in summary convic­tion matters, which in contrast to the words of s.
605(1) authorizes an appeal by, inter alia, ""the Attorney General or
his agent"". In the course of his reasons delivered on behalf of this
Court, the Chief Justice referred to Lemay v. The King[2],
which had not been brought to the notice of the British Columbia Court of
Appeal, in which this Court rejected the contention that the Attorney General
must sign the notice of appeal personally. At the time Lemay was
decided, the section of the Code corresponding to the present s. 605(1)
was s. 1013(4) which gave a right of appeal only to ""the Attorney
General"". The right has been extended in the present s. 605(1) to
""the Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose"".
The Chief Justice's observations in Badall with respect to the
difference between a counsel who is ""agent of the Attorney General""
and one who is ""instructed by the Attorney General"" were in these
terms:

In my opinion, the extension of the Crown's right to appeal
to counsel instructed by the Attorney General, while also keeping the right in
the Attorney General as before, has not made the Lemay case
inapplicable. Indeed, I am unable to appreciate any but a semantic difference
between a counsel who is an agent of the Attorney General and a counsel
instructed by the Attor­ney General; the latter can surely be no more than an
agent, albeit perhaps a special one for the occasion.

In Badall, counsel for the respondents contended also that
there was no proof that the person signing as agent was in fact counsel for the
Attor­ney General or that he had been instructed by the Attorney General for
the purpose of the appeal. While that is the substantial point in the present
appeal, it was not essential to the decision in

[Page 242]

Badall. Nor was it discussed by the Court because the only
argument raised in the Court of Appeal had been that an agent was not empowered
by s. 605 to sign the notice of appeal.

Therefore this Court has not considered R. v. Green[3]
or R. v. Martin (No. 1)[4], to
which we have been referred by counsel for the respondent in this appeal.
Neither Green nor Martin is directly on point. In Martin's case,
an application for an order extending the time for giving notice of appeal was
made by ""Mr. MacMillan for F. Sigsworth repre­senting the Attorney-General
of Canada"". The form of the signature was explained as ""due to Mr. Sigsworth's
absence in Japan"". Nowhere in the record of the application was there any
allegation that either Mr. MacMillan or Mr. Sigsworth had been instructed by
the Attorney General of Canada for the purpose of the appeal. The judg­ment of
the Court was delivered by Traynor C.J. P.E.I. who directed attention to the
distinction (rejected by this Court in Badall) between s. 605(1) appeals
and those in summary conviction matters. The learned Chief Justice said, p.
275:

On the appeal, counsel for the appellant strenuously urged
that the application had not been properly made within the provisions of s.
584(1). He argued that there was nothing to show that Mr. Sigsworth was the
agent of the Attorney-General of Canada, although as I intimated above, the
statute requires more than agency. He demonstrates from the record that there
was nothing to show connection between Mr. MacMillan and the Attorney-General
of Canada and that there was nothing to show any delegation of authority to Mr.
MacMillan.

and continued, p. 276:

When objection was raised, it was still open to counsel to
apply for leave to adduce evidence that at the date of the application Mr. Sigsworth
had in fact been instructed to enter an appeal against the order of July 20,
1970. However, no attempt was made to have such evidence presented; and we do
not think that the deficiency was cured by the filing of the notice of appeal
on September 28, 1970, in which the signature is followed by the words,
""counsel instructed by the Attorney-General of Canada"" without
further evidence that instruction by

[Page 243]

the Attorney-General of Canada had been given before the
application for the order now under appeal.

The order appealed against was set aside.

In Green's case the notice of application for leave to
appeal from sentence was signed by coun­sel as ""Agent of the Minister of
Justice for Canada"" and not as ""Counsel for the Attorney General for
Canada"". The Minister of Justice is ex officio Attorney General of
Canada. Limerick J.A. deliv­ered the judgment of the New Brunswick Supreme
Court, Appeal Division, and in the course of that judgment said, p. 146:

Any presumption of proper authority to institute the appeal
was rebutted when Crown counsel filed with the Court a letter on which he
relied for his authority to appeal. This letter purported to be signed by one
""J. M. Bentley, For Director, Criminal Law Section"", and was written
on the letterhead of the Department of Justice. There was no indication as to
J. M. Bentley's occupa­tion; it might be that of a stenographer.

Section 2(2) ... of the Code provides that with cer­tain
inapplicable exceptions ""Attorney General"" includes Deputy
Attorney-General.

The learned judge of appeal continued, p. 147:

Where a statutory power is given to an officer or an
individual that power cannot be delegated to another in the absence of
statutory authority so to do. See Abrahams v. The Queen (1881), 6
S.C.R. 10.

Section 584 clearly intends that there must be instruc­tion
to appeal given by the Attorney-General or Deputy Attorney-General directly to
counsel. The wording ""instructed by him for the purpose"" must be
given its ordinary meaning.

The right of appeal is not a common law right but a
statutory creation and, in the case of an appeal by the Crown, one of quite
recent creation and must be strictly construed. The wording ""instructed by
him"", differing so materially from the wording conferring the right of
appeal given by s. 720 of the Code, would suggest that in the case of an
appeal by the Crown in procedure by indictment there is a greater
responsibility resting on the Crown than in summary conviction matters and the
Attorney-General or his Deputy must take the personal responsibility for
instituting such an appeal. That au­thority cannot be delegated to others,
certainly not to a

[Page 244]

person or [sic] unidentified capacity purporting to sign ""For
Director, Criminal Law Section"". (Italics are mine.)

The Court concluded that counsel for the Crown was not vested
with the power to make the applica­tion for leave to appeal as ""he had not
been instructed by the Attorney-General or his Deputy for the purpose.""

The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta reached a
different, and, I believe, prefer-able conclusion on identical facts in R.
v. Wiens[5]. The
notice of appeal had been authorized, it appeared, by Mr. J. M. Bentley of the
Department of Justice. The Court referred to what had been said by Jenkins J.
and by Denning L.J. (as he then was) in Metropolitan Borough and Town Clerk
of Lewisham v. Roberts[6]. Lord
Denning said, p. 621:

... Now I take it to be quite plain that when a minister is
entrusted with administrative, as distinct from legisla­tive, functions he is
entitled to act by any authorized official of his department. The minister is
not bound to give his mind to the matter personally. This is implicit in the
modern machinery of government...

The Alberta Court disposed of the preliminary objection in these
words, p. 640:

The word ""official"" is used in each of these quota­tions.
This would imply that the person who gave the instructions to appeal held such
a position in the Department that it could be implied that he was performing
this duty on the instructions of the Minister. I am not suggesting that such a
person must hold any specific office in the Department. The present case
illustrates the type of person who would be included as an ""offi­cial"".
The criminal law section is charged with the responsibility for all criminal
litigation conducted by the Government of Canada. As director of that section,
Mr. J. A. Scollin, Q.C. would have the implied authority to authorize these
appeals. Mr. Bentley, as the person next senior to Mr. Scollin and authorized
to act as director in his absence, would unquestionably have similar author­ity.
A similar inference could be drawn from other officials, who, because of their
position in the Department, it could be assumed, had been authorized to act for
the Minister in such cases. The preliminary objection is dismissed.

[Page 245]

In my opinion there is implied authority in the Attorney General
to delegate the power to instruct, in s. 605(1). I do not think that s. 605(1)
requires the Attorney General personally to appeal or personally to instruct
counsel to appeal in every case. Although there is a general rule of construc­tion
in law that a person endowed with a discre­tionary power should exercise it
personally (delegatus non potest delegare) that rule can be displaced by
the language, scope or object of a particular administrative scheme. A power to
dele­gate is often implicit in a scheme empowering a Minister to act. As
Professor Willis remarked in ""Delegatus Non Potest Delegare"", (1943),
21 Can. Bar Rev. 257 at p. 264:

.. in their application of the maxim delegatus non potest
delegare to modern governmental agencies the Courts have in most cases
preferred to depart from the literal construction of the words of the statute which
would require them to read in the word ""personally"" and to adopt such
a construction as will best accord with the facts of modern government which,
being carried on in theory by elected representatives but in practice by civil
servants or local government officers, undoubtedly requires them to read in the
words ""or any person authorized by it"".

See also S. A. DeSmith, Judicial Review of Administrative
Action, 3d ed., at p. 271. Thus, where the exercise of a discretionary
power is entrusted to a Minister of the Crown it may be presumed that the acts
will be performed, not by the Minister in person, but by responsible officials
in his department: Carltona, Ltd. v. Commissioners of Works[7].
The tasks of a Minister of the Crown in modern times are so many and varied
that it is unreasonable to expect them to be performed personally. It is to be
supposed that the Minister will select deputies and departmental officials of
experience and competence, and that such appointees, for whose conduct the
Minister is accountable to the Legislature, will act on behalf

[Page 246]

of the Minister, within the bounds of their respec­tive grants of
authority, in the discharge of minis­terial responsibilities. Any other
approach would but lead to administrative chaos and inefficiency. It is true
that in the present case there is no evidence that the Attorney General of
British Columbia personally instructed Mr. McDiarmid to act on his behalf in
appealing judgments or ver­dicts of acquittal of trial courts but it is
reasonable to assume the ""Director, Criminal Law"" of the Province
would have that authority to instruct.

I do not find anything in the Criminal Code which
derogates from the thought that the duties imposed upon the Attorneys General
are to be exercised under their authority by responsible offi­cials of their
respective departments. ""Attorney General"", according to an amendment
to s. 2 of the Code made in 1968-69, includes ""the lawful
deputy"" of the said Attorney General or in the French version de «substitut
légitime». I do not read ""lawful deputy"" as confined to ""Deputy
Attorney General"". The words comprehend all persons appointed to act on
behalf of the Attorney General when acting within the scope of their authority.

The authority of Crown counsel to act in instituting an appeal is
not something which must be proved as part of the case on appeal. In the
absence of direct challenge, no evidence need be adduced to confirm the
authority of counsel who appeals on behalf of the Crown and describes himself
as ""counsel for"" or ""counsel instructed by"" or ""agent
for"" the Attorney General or in words to like effect. Advocates are
officers of the Court and it is to be taken, in the normal course, that when a
counsel states he is acting with the authority of the Attorney General he is
indeed clothed with that authority. Technical challenges to jurisdiction based
upon alleged insufficiency of signature to notices of appeal can be wasteful of
time and money. If, however, objection be taken which raises ground for doubt
as to authority, the ques­tion arises as to how far one must go, and what
evidence must be adduced, to establish authority. The answer will depend on the
circumstances of the particular case. Without attempting to lay down any
general rule, it would normally be sufficient

[Page 247]

if counsel produces a letter which he can say he received and
believes to be signed by the Attor­ney General or Deputy Attorney General or an
officer of the department whom he understands to have requisite authority to
institute criminal appeals. See R. v. Turner[8].

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for British Columbia allow­ing the preliminary objection and direct that
the appeal be proceeded with.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Order of absolute
discharge—Appeal by Crown—Jurisdiction of appellate Court to interfere with
provincial judge’s order and to enter conviction and impose sentence—Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 605(1)(a), 614, 618(2)(a), 662.1(1),
(3)(a) [enacted 1972, c. 13, s. 57].

The appellant, who pleaded guilty to a charge
of assault causing bodily harm, was granted an absolute discharge by the
Provincial Judge, pursuant to s. 662.1(1) of the Criminal Code. On
appeal, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta quashed the
order of absolute discharge, entered a conviction and imposed a fine of $200
with imprisonment for 30 days in default of payment. The appellant appealed to
this Court, asserting he had an appeal as of right under s. 618(2)(a)
because he was a person who had been acquitted of an indictable offence and
whose acquittal had been set aside on appeal. His principal submission was that
the Appellate Division was without jurisdiction to hear the Crown’s appeal
because the effect of s. 662.1(3)(a) was to require the
Crown, if it would appeal from an order of discharge, to found its appeal on
s. 605(1)(a) and hence to be limited to a question of law
alone.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The appellant could come to this Court only
by leave, pursuant to s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act. Leave was
granted nunc pro tunc to enable the Court to consider the appellant’s
principal submission.

The Appellate Division had jurisdiction to
interfere with the order of the Provincial Judge and to enter a conviction and
impose a penalty. The words in s. 662.1(3)(a) “in the case of an
appeal by the Attorney General, [as if that direction were] a finding that the
accused was not guilty” were necessary in order to

[Page 196]

enable the provincial appellate Court to
enter a conviction upon setting aside an order of discharge and thereafter to
impose a sentence pursuant to s. 614. In order to fit an appeal from a
discharge into the scheme of appeals from sentence, which are predicated upon a
conviction, it was necessary to give the appellate Court power to enter a
conviction where it was disposed to allow an appeal from a discharge order and
this was done by s. 662.1(3)(a). This provision cannot be
regarded as giving a right of appeal on a different foundation than that for
existing appeals against sentence so as to make it virtually impossible for the
Crown to appeal a discharge order.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division[1],
quashing an order of absolute discharge, entering a conviction and imposing a
penalty. Appeal dismissed.

A.M. Harradence, Q.C., for the appellant.

B.A. Crane and P. Chrumka, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The appellant in this case
pleaded guilty to a charge of assault causing bodily harm. After making this
finding the Provincial Judge declared that “I do not convict the accused, I
find that it is in the interests of the accused and not contrary to the public
interest to grant to the accused an absolute discharge pursuant to
s. 662.1 of the Criminal Code.” The Provincial Judge, before making
the order of absolute discharge, delineated the considerations which moved him
to that determination. The Crown appealed to the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta, coupling its assertion of an appeal de plano with
an application for leave if it should be necessary. The Appellate Division
quashed the order of absolute discharge, entered a conviction and imposed a
fine of $200, with imprisonment for 30 days in default of payment.

The convicted appellant now appeals to this
Court, asserting he has an appeal as of right under

[Page 197]

s. 618(2)(a) of the Criminal Code because
he was a person who had been acquitted of an indictable offence and whose
acquittal had been set aside on appeal. For the reasons that follow, it is my
opinion that (1) the appellant can come to this Court only by leave, pursuant
to s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. S-19, as
amended; (2) leave should be granted nunc pro tunc to enable this Court
to consider the appellant’s principal submission, namely, that the Alberta
Appellate Division was without jurisdiction to hear the Crown’s appeal to it
from the order of absolute discharge; (3) the Alberta Appellate Division had
jurisdiction to interfere with the order of the Provincial Judge and to enter a
conviction and impose a penalty; and (4) I would dismiss the appeal to this
Court from the decision of the Alberta Appellate Division.

By amendments to the Criminal Code made
by 1972 (Can.), c. 13, s. 662.1 was enacted to provide for absolute
or conditional discharges in certain circumstances and for appeals in such cases
and, concurrently, the definition of “sentence” in s. 601 was amended to
include “a disposition made under s. 662.1(1)…”. It will suffice for
present purposes to set out the provisions of s. 662.1(1) and (3), and
they are as follows:

662.1 (1)
Where an accused, other than a corporation, pleads guilty to or is found guilty
of an offence, other than an offence for which a minimum punishment is
prescribed by law or an offence punishable, in the proceedings commenced
against him, by imprisonment for fourteen years or for life or by death, the
court before which he appears may, if it considers it to be in the best
interests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest, instead of
convicting the accused, by order direct that the accused be discharged absolutely
or upon the conditions prescribed in a probation order.

…

(3) Where a court directs under
subsection (1) that an accused be discharged, the accused shall be deemed
not to have been convicted of the offence to which he pleaded guilty or of
which he was found guilty and to which the discharge relates except that

[Page 198]

(a) the accused or the Attorney
General may appeal from the direction that the accused be discharged as if that
direction were a conviction in respect of the offence to which the discharge
relates or, in the case of an appeal by the Attorney General, a finding that
the accused was not guilty of that offence; and

(b) the accused may plead autrefois
convict in respect of any subsequent charge relating to the offence to
which the discharge relates.

Were it not for s. 662.1(3)(a), it
would be clear beyond peradventure that an appeal from an order of absolute or
conditional discharge is an appeal against sentence, and hence governed, where
the appeal is by the accused, by s. 603(1)(b) and s. 614; and,
where the appeal is by the Crown, governed by s. 605(1)(b) and
s. 614. Leave is required in either case from the Court of Appeal. Counsel
for the appellant contends, however, that the effect of s. 662.1(3)(a)
(and especially the words “in the case of an appeal by the Attorney General,
[as if that direction were] a finding that the accused was not guilty”…) is to
require the Crown, if it would appeal from an order of discharge, to found its
appeal on s. 605(1)(a) and hence, to be limited to a question of
law alone. In short, the contention is that the appeal is from an acquittal and
this contention is also carried forward to support the appellant’s position
that there is an appeal de plano to this Court under s. 618(2)(a).

The effective answer to this line of argument
was given by counsel for the respondent who submitted, correctly in my opinion,
that the quoted words of s. 662.1(3)(a) were necessary in order to
enable the provincial appellate Court to enter a conviction upon setting aside
an order of discharge and thereafter to impose a sentence pursuant to
s. 614. The drafting in s. 662.1(3)(a) could have been
clearer, but there is no doubt, when regard is had to the amended definition of
sentence and to the distinction made between guilt and conviction in
s. 662.1, that in order to fit an appeal from a discharge into the scheme
of appeals from sentence, which are predicated upon a conviction, it was
necessary to give the appellate Court power to

[Page 199]

enter a conviction where it was disposed to
allow an appeal from a discharge order and this was done by s. 662.1(3)(a).
I cannot agree that this provision is to be regarded as giving a right of
appeal on a different foundation than that for existing appeals against
sentence so as to make it virtually impossible for the Crown to appeal a
discharge order.

In the present case, leave to appeal the
discharge order was sought, and I take the Appellate Division’s decision to
have been made by granting leave and concurrently disposing of the appeal on the
merits. This is not a case in which leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to
s. 41(1) should be given. I would therefore quash the appeal to this Court
in so far as it was brought de plano, and dismiss it on the point on which
leave was granted.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Possession of stolen
goods—Motion for nonsuit—Sufficiency of evidence or absence of evidence—Rule in
Hodge’s Case not applicable—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
s. 312.

Respondent was charged with being in
possession of two television sets knowing them to have been stolen. The Crown
presented no evidence and relied solely on the admissions of fact. These
disclose that the two television sets were loaded on a freight car which was
sealed when the car left Brockville and the seal upon which was unbroken when it arrived in Montreal. Neither of the consignees
received these television sets, which were found when the police searched the
premises of respondent. Respondent then filed a motion of nonsuit on the ground
that there was no evidence that the goods had been stolen. The judge of the
Court of Sessions of the Peace granted the motion. This decision was affirmed
by a majority of the Court of Appeal of Quebec. Hence the appeal to this Court.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence and de Grandpré JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ.: A motion for nonsuit cannot be
granted unless there is no evidence on which a jury acting reasonably might
have convicted the accused. The test propounded in Hodge’s Case (1838),
2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136, was concerned with the weight to be attached
to the evidence, whereas here the question is whether there is any evidence to
weigh. The admissions constitute evidence upon which a jury might reasonably
have concluded that the goods were stolen and that respondent knew that they
had been obtained by theft. Even if the facts can be otherwise interpreted, the
burden upon the Crown is not to negative every conjecture to which
circumstantial evidence might give rise and which might be consistent with the
innocence of the accused.

[Page 182]

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence and de Grandpré JJ., dissenting: Even if there is
no question that on a motion for nonsuit the accused can only be released if
there is an absence of evidence, that does not mean that the motion must be
dismissed whenever there is an iota of evidence, no matter how inconsequential
this may be. In the case at bar theft was an essential element of the charge
and the Crown did not submit evidence that there was a theft in the car in
which the television sets were placed, or that the consignees were unlawfully
deprived of them. The doctrine of recent possession must be dismissed if its foundation,
namely the theft, is not established.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
for Quebec, affirming a
judgment of the Court of Sessions of the Peace granting a motion for nonsuit.
Appeal allowed, Laskin C.J., Spence and de Grandpré JJ. dissenting.

G. Fortier and P. Sauvé, for the
appellant.

G. Thouin and Fernande Rainville-Laporte,
for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence and de
Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

DE GRANDPRÉ J. (dissenting)—The Crown
asks this Court to set aside a judgment of the Court of Sessions of the Peace
granting a motion of nonsuit, a judgment affirmed by a majority of the Court of
Appeal.

The indictment reads as follows:

[TRANSLATION] On or about January 12, 1972,
did unlawfully have in his possession two (2) R.C.A. Victor television sets, a Sylvania television set and a Phono-Sonic
stereo, the whole having a value of approximately $1,875, the property of
various persons, in which Canadian National has a special interest, knowing
that the said items were obtained by the commission in

[Page 183]

Canada of an
offence punishable by indictment, namely: a theft, committing thereby a
criminal offence, prescribed by s. 312 of the Criminal Code.

The appeal is concerned only with the two R.C.A.
Victor television sets, as the Crown admitted in the Quebec courts that it lacked sufficient evidence with respect to the other
two items.

In the case at bar the Crown summoned no
witnesses, relying solely on the following admissions:

[TRANSLATION] …the parties agree to admit
that:

(1) on January 11, 1972, two (2) R.C.A.
Victor television sets, produced as Exhibits P-1 and P-2 and here present in
the court, shipped to Paradis T.V. Enregistré of St‑Pascal, Province of
Quebec, and to Ouellet & Fils Limitée of Rimouski, Province of Quebec, were
delivered at Prescott, Province of Ontario, by Mr. Thomas Degroot, shipper
with R.C.A. Victor Limited, to Mr. Francis Ferguson, driver for Canadian
National;

(2) this delivery was recorded in two (2)
contracts of carriage numbered P-10 403 and P-14 01976, signed by
Messrs. Degroot and Ferguson;

(3) on the same day Mr. Ferguson
delivered the two (2) R.C.A. Victor television sets to Mr. Pervus
Dillabough at Brockville, Province of Ontario;

(4) this delivery was recorded on the
aforesaid contracts of carriage;

(5) Mr. Dillabough placed the two (2)
aforesaid television sets in car CN 523257 of train No. 212, originating at
Brockville and destined for Montreal, on January 11, 1972, and sealed the said
car CN 523257 with seal No. C 441889-90;

(6) in Montreal, at about five fifty-five (5:55) A.M. on January 12, 1972, Mr. Thrimp (according to
his testimony), the checker for Canadian National in Montreal, checked car No. CN 523257 in train No. 212, and found that the
seals were intact;

(7) Ouellet & Fils Limitée and Paradis
T.V. Enregistré did not receive the television sets they had ordered from
R.C.A. Victor Limited in Prescott;

(8) the aforesaid television sets, together
with a Sylvania set and a Phono-Sonic stereo, were found in a search conducted
by officers of Canadian National and the Montreal Police at the premises of the
accused, at

[Page 184]

about one-thirty (1:30) P.M. on January 14,
1972, at 8877 Tolhurst, in Montreal, Province of Quebec;

(9) if the police officers who carried out
the investigation were heard, they would identify the accused as the person on
whose premises they found the television sets on January 14, 1972.

The Crown having indicated that its evidence was
concluded after the presentation of the foregoing admissions, the defence
immediately moved for nonsuit; this motion was taken under reserve and finally
granted. On this point the transcript reads as follows:

[TRANSLATION] The Court grants the motion
of nonsuit and acquits the accused.

The Crown has not been able to present
evidence establishing the allegation beyond any doubt.

Further, in his oral judgment, the trial judge
said:

[TRANSLATION] I have concluded that the
motion for nonsuit should be granted, as the Crown has not established to my
satisfaction the commission of a prerequisite for the existence of the offence
as stated, namely a theft.

Brossard J., speaking for the majority of the
Court of Appeal, concluded that

[TRANSLATION] there is no evidence
on the record establishing that the aforesaid articles were actually stolen
(emphasis added).

Thus he concurs in the conclusion of the trial
judge, while emphasizing that the language used by the latter was not
especially well chosen, but that this could not have the effect of causing the
trial judgment to be set aside, if no valid evidence really existed in support
of one of the essential aspects of the information, namely theft. The relevant
paragraph from the reasons of Brossard J. is as follows:

[TRANSLATION] Undoubtedly the trial judge
would have been wiser not to go beyond the finding that no evidence of theft
existed, and add the opinion that, in any event, he did not have before him
evidence to support beyond any reasonable doubt a conviction of the accused of
unlawful possession of stolen goods, knowing them to be stolen; but this can
have no effect on the validity of the dismissal of the information for lack of
evidence of theft of the goods found in the possession of

[Page 185]

the respondent, and accordingly of any link
between such a theft and the possession of respondent.

Turgeon J. was of the same view, stating that
there existed no

[TRANSLATION] evidence of theft of the
articles found in the possession of respondent.

For his part, Lajoie J. summarized his
dissenting opinion in the following way:

[TRANSLATION] The motion for nonsuit could
only have been granted if there was a total lack of evidence against the
accused. If there was any basis for assessing the sufficiency of the evidence,
as in my opinion was the case here, the motion should have been dismissed and
the accused called to state whether or not he had a defence to present. The
judge could not proceed to assess the evidence and make a decision on the
merits until after the conclusion of that evidence on both sides.

Relying on this dissenting opinion the Crown
brought the case to this Court, stating the legal argument on which it relies
as follows:

[TRANSLATION] Did the Court of Appeal of
Quebec err in law in holding in its majority decision that there was a total
lack of evidence in the record of the essential element of theft required to
support the charge of unlawful possession of stolen goods?

There is no question that on a motion for
nonsuit the accused can only be released if there is an absence of evidence. In
this connection we need only refer to the remarks of Pigeon J. in The Queen
v. Kyling[1], at
p. 956:

Regarding the contents of the judge’s
report, I must respectfully point out that an absence, not an insufficiency, of
evidence is meant in the following reason: “the Crown did not adduce the
evidence necessary to show that the charge is well founded”.

In The King v. Morabito, [1949]
S.C.R. 172, this Court held that a nonsuit pronounced on a motion by the
defence after the close of the case for the Crown is a decision on a question
of law, namely the absence of evidence. This rule was also held applicable to
summary proceedings by the judgment in Feeley et al. v. The Queen, [1953]
1 S.C.R. 59. I have found nothing in the 1955 Criminal Code that
might imply a change in the principles underlying these judgments, nor has
anything to this effect been brought to our attention.

[Page 186]

As Pigeon J. points out, the applicable
principles were discussed more fully in Morabito and Feeley, and
I adopt the reasons expressed in those cases.

However, the expression “absence of evidence”
does not mean that the motion for a nonsuit must be dismissed whenever there is
an iota of evidence, no matter how inconsequential this may be. On the
contrary, a careful reading of Feeley, referred to above, discloses that
there were few iotas of evidence in that case. Appellants had been acquitted at
first instance on a motion for nonsuit, and the Court of Appeal had set aside
this acquittal and ordered a new trial. This Court unanimously reinstated the
judgment of acquittal with respect to three of the four appellants. Cartwright
J., as he then was, speaking for the Court, emphasized that the various aspects
of the evidence “taken together, are insufficient to make out a prima facie case”
(p. 64). This conclusion must be read in the light of the following paragraph,
taken from the reasons of Cartwright J. (at p. 60):

It is common ground that had the learned
Magistrate refused the motion the appellants would have had the right to call
evidence for the defence if so advised and counsel for the respondent submits
that the decision of this Court in The King v. Morabito establishes (i)
that at that stage it was not open to the learned Magistrate to dismiss the
charge unless there was no evidence on which, had the trial been before a jury,
a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, might have convicted the
accused, and (ii) that whether or not there was such evidence is “a question of
law alone” within the meaning of section 1013(4) of the Code. I agree with
this submission.

In my view, therefore, the judges of the Court
of Appeal, on appeal by the Crown, applied the pertinent principles of law in
examining the record.

It must now be considered whether Brossard and
Turgeon JJ. were correct in concluding, as they did, that there was no evidence
on the record establishing theft of the two television sets, in the sense that
must be attributed to the phrase “absence of evidence”. On this point, Brossard
J. observes:

[Page 187]

[TRANSLATION] In my opinion counsel for the
respondent correctly maintained that there was no evidence on the record
establishing that the aforesaid articles were actually stolen; the most that
could be inferred from the Crown evidence and the admissions was that at some
point, not specified, these articles, under circumstances that were not
established, ceased to be in the possession of the carrier, and were not
subsequently delivered into the actual possession of their original consignees.
In my view, this evidence could not serve as the foundation of evidence of
commission of a theft, whether from the shipper or the consignees. Conjectures
and assumptions do not constitute evidence of the unlawfulness of possession.

I consider that this conclusion was correct.

In a case such as that before the Court, where
the indictment charges respondent with unlawful possession of stolen articles,
knowing that those articles were obtained by the commission of a theft, theft
is an essential element which has to be established by the Crown: Geist v.
The Queen[2], (Court
of Appeal of Quebec); R. v. Vogelle and Reid[3], (Court of Appeal of Manitoba); R.
v. Gowing[4], (Court
of Appeal of Alberta).

If the Crown submits no evidence (in the sense
defined above) of the commission of a theft, an accused who makes a motion for
nonsuit must be acquitted. Moreover, the Crown concedes the merit of these
principles, since it relies in its factum on [TRANSLATION] “proof that the
buyers had not alienated the goods”, “the absence of evidence of any title in
the accused to the said goods”, and “the other circumstances of the case”. In
the case at bar, I have read and re-read the admissions which constitute the
Crown’s only evidence, and I find absolutely no proof

(a) that there was in fact a theft in the car in
which the television sets were placed; on the contrary, the last time this car
was examined (para. six of the admissions) the seals were intact;

(b) that the consignees, namely Ouellet and
Paradis, were unlawfully deprived of the televi-

[Page 188]

son sets; on the contrary, the only statement to
be found in the admissions (para. seven) is that they were not received, but it
is in no way alleged that such non-delivery was against their will.

The record thus contains no evidence of the
theft alleged in the indictment, and consequently the entire argument of the
Crown based on “recent possession” must be dismissed, since the foundation of
that argument, namely the theft, was not established.

For all these reasons, I would affirm the
judgment of the Court of Appeal and the acquittal of respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec affirming the judgment rendered
at trial in the “Cour des Sessions”, whereby the learned trial judge granted
the motion for nonsuit advanced by the present respondent at his trial on a
charge of being in possession of stolen goods knowing them to have been stolen,
on the ground that there was no evidence that the goods found in the
respondent’s pessession had been stolen. The conclusion of the learned trial
judge, which was affirmed by a majority of the Court of Appeal (Lajoie J.
dissenting) was phrased as follows:

[TRANSLATION] I have concluded that the
motion for nonsuit should be granted, as the Crown has not established to my
satisfaction the commission of a prerequisite for the existence of the offence
as stated, namely a theft.

The Crown presented no evidence and this appeal
falls to be determined in accordance with a statement of admitted facts which
has been recited by Mr. Justice de Grandpré in the course of the reasons
for judgment which he has prepared for delivery in this appeal.

In summary, these facts disclose that two R.C.A.
Victor television sets produced at the trial had been shipped from Prescott,
Ontario, by the C.N. Railway, one to Paradis T.V. Enregistré of St-Pascal and
the other to Ouellet et Fils Limitée

[Page 189]

of Rimouski, and that these sets were loaded on
a freight car which was sealed and the seal upon which had not been broken when
it arrived in Montreal in the early hours of January 12, 1972. Neither of the
consignees received these television sets, both of which were found when the
police searched the premises of the respondent in Montreal on January 14, 1972.

It was agreed also that if the police officers
who effected the search had been heard at the trial they could have identified
the accused as the person in whose premises the television sets were found.

The position of a Magistrate in considering a
motion for nonsuit is authoritatively described by Cartwright J., as he then
was, in Feeley and others v. The Queen[5],
at p. 61 where, after making reference to the case of R. v.
Morabito[6], he
adopts the submission

…that at that stage it was not open to the
learned Magistrate to dismiss the charge unless there was no evidence on which,
had the trial been before a jury, a properly instructed jury, acting
reasonably, might have convicted the accused, and (ii) that whether or
not there was such evidence is “a question of law alone” within the meaning of
section 1013(4) of the Code.

The underlining is my own.

On the admitted facts the two television sets
were known to have been in a sealed C.N.R. freight car in Montreal en route to
their respective destinations at St-Pascal and Rimouski in the early hours of January
12th. They were never received by the consignees, but two and a half days later
had found their way to the respondent’s premises in Montreal and I am of
opinion that from these facts a properly instructed jury might reasonably have
drawn the inference that they did not get there without having been stolen by
somebody.

It is suggested, however that as the evidence
disclosed by the admissions is purely circumstantial, the proper test to be
employed in assessing the

[Page 190]

weight to be attached to it is that first
propounded by Baron Alderson in charging the jury in Hodge’s Case[7], which was adopted by Sir Lyman
Duff, C.J., on behalf of this Court in R. v. Comba[8]. This test is, however, to be read
in light of what was said by Spence J., speaking on behalf of the majority of
this Court in R. v. Mitchell[9], at
p. 478, where he said:

Does the fact that evidence is
circumstantial necessarily require that an instruction be given to the jury in
accordance with that which was given in Hodge’s Case!

To answer this question it is desirable to
recall just what were the circumstances of Hodge’s case. The report
states that the prisoner was charged with murder, the case was one of
circumstantial evidence altogether, and contained no one fact which, taken
alone, amounted to a presumption of guilt.

Baron Alderson told the jury that the case
was made up of circumstances entirely; and that, before they could find the
prisoner guilty, they must be satisfied, not only that those circumstances were
consistent with his having committed the act, but they must also be satisfied
that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person.

It is quite clear that this direction
was concerned only with the identification of the accused as being the person
who had committed the crime. (The underlining is my
own)

This statement was reaffirmed in R. v.
Bagshaw[10], at
p. 6. (a case of theft).

We are not concerned here with the
identification of the thief. The issue is not who stole the goods, but whether
there is any evidence justifying the inference that they were stolen. It should
be observed also that the rule in Hodge’s Case, supra, which was
reaffirmed in R.v. Comba, supra, was concerned with the weight to
be attached to the evidence, whereas here the question is whether there was any
evidence to weigh.

It is admitted that the goods in question were
found in the accused’s home on January 14, 1972, and if the admissions
constitute evidence upon

[Page 191]

which a properly instructed jury might
reasonably have concluded that the goods were stolen, it would follow that they
might also have concluded that the respondent knew that they had been obtained
by theft in accordance with the rebut-table presumption to which such possession
would give rise. See R. v. Schama: R. v. Abramovitch[11], Ungaro v. The King[12], and many other cases in this
Court.

It is said, however, that the admitted facts are
capable of being construed as leading to other rational conclusions than the
theft of the goods such as the conclusion that the consignees were a party to
their goods being diverted from the custody of the railway company to the home
of the accused. As to this contention reference may be had to the statement
made by McRuer, C.J.H.C. in R. v. Mclver[13], at p. 309, which was adopted
in this Court in Wild v. The Queen[14],
and in R. v. Bagshaw, supra, and where it is said:

The rule (in Hodge’s Case) makes it clear
that the case is to be decided on the facts, that is, the facts proved in
evidence and the conclusions alternative to the guilt of the accused must be
rational conclusions based on inferences drawn from proven facts. No conclusion
can be a rational conclusion that is not founded on evidence. Such a conclusion
would be a speculative, imaginative conclusion, not a rational one.

I do not think that the burden resting upon the
Crown to establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt includes
the added burden of negativing every conjecture to which circumstantial
evidence might give rise and which might be consistent with the innocence of
the accused.

As I have indicated, however, I do not think
that the judgment of Sir Lyman Duff in the Comba Case, supra, in which
he reiterates the rule in Hodge s Case has any application to the circumstances
here disclosed. I am rather of opinion, as indicated by Mr. Justice Pigeon
in R. v. Kyling[15],

[Page 192]

at p. 957, that the true test to be applied
before granting a nonsuit is whether the Crown evidence gives rise merely to a
suspicion or whether it is such as to justify the drawing of an inference.

In my view the facts disclosed in the admissions
are such that a properly instructed jury might reasonably draw the inference
that the goods had been stolen, and as there was no evidence to support any
other rational conclusion, I am of opinion that this was not an appropriate
case in which to grant an order of nonsuit, and I would accordingly allow the
appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and the verdict of
acquittal and direct a new trial.
