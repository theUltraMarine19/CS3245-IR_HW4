2709201,"R v SINGH, SINGH, SINGH, SINGH & SINGH [2011] NSWDC 217","SENTENCE 

1HIS HONOUR: Today I am sentencing five people for offences involving acts of considerable violence. All five offenders are men of otherwise good character with no prior criminal history, yet what they did together on 13 December 2009 is something which requires that they each be punished, and significantly so. 

2The five offenders are Amrinder Singh, Jagdar Singh, Jatinder Singh, Harminder Singh and Gurwinder Singh. Five other people were involved in the matter as victims, Harvinder Singh, Dalbag Singh, Gurpreet Singh, Valjit Singh and Karmjit Kaur, the only female involved. In view of the fact that many people concerned in this matter have the same family name I will refer to them, without any disrespect being intended, by their given names. All people involved in this matter appear to have been born in the Punjab region of India, coming to Australia on various forms of visa. 

3The events of 13 December 2009 seem to have had their genesis in some approaches made by Harvinder, Valjit and Gurpreet towards a married woman, Ramon Diep. Her husband was not living with her at the time. He working in Melbourne. Ms Diep was living with her cousin, Amrinder, in Griffith. The evidence suggests that Harvinder was paying attention to her which in the Punjabi tradition was not welcome. Ms Diep told her cousin what had happened. On 13 December 2009 she says that she was followed to her home by Valjit and Gurpreet. Gurpreet took her hand and asked her whether she would like to move in with them. Ms Diep said that she did not and asked that her hand be released. This did not happen and she said that she would call her cousin Amrinder. In response Valjit and Gurpreet said to her that it did not matter who was called, they were not going to stop. It was then that Ms Diep called her cousin Amrinder and as a result of speaking to him he and four of his friends committed the offences I am about to describe. 

4The offenders lived in Griffith. Harvinder, Dalbag, and a woman named Karmjit Kaur, lived next door. Gurpreet and Valjit were visiting them on the afternoon of 13 December 2009. Valjit was upstairs, Harvinder and Dalbag were downstairs in the lounge room. Gurpreet and Karmjit were downstairs in the kitchen. 

5The internal door leading from the garage to the interior of the premises was partially open. The offenders came running through the door. Amrinder was holding a baseball bat and Jagdar was holding a metal rod. Some of the offenders were shouting ""hit them, hit them"" or ""kill them, kill them"". Dalbag said ""what's up""? Jagdar said ""move away, we have nothing against you"" and pushed Dalbag. Amrinder hit Dalbag with the baseball bat to the right hand causing pain and swelling. Gurwinder hit the female involved, Karmjit Kaur, to the face a number of times. Gurpreet started to run up the stairs. Harminder and Jagdar hit Gurpreet with the baseball bat and iron rod respectively. Whilst doing so they were yelling ""kill him, kill him"". Gurpreet ran into a bedroom and closed the door, holding it with his hands. Valjit came out of the bathroom upstairs. Amrinder hit him to the face with the baseball bat, causing a cut under his right eye. 

6Jagdar, Harminder and Jatinder pushed on the bedroom door and gained entry. The offenders continued to hit Gurpreet to his arms, shoulder and back. Gurpreet felt something hit his head and he fell to the ground. He tried to cover his head. Despite the fact that he was helpless on the ground covering, the three offenders continued to hit him. One of the offenders was saying ""kill him, don't leave him"". Gurpreet said ""save me, save me, don't kill me"". It was then that the offenders stopped hitting him. 

7While this occurred upstairs Dalbag attempted to go upstairs to assist Gurpreet but Gurwinder held his hands to stop him from going upstairs. He then pushed Dalbag into the corner of the room and slapped him to the left side of his face. Gurwinder said to Dalbag ""you stay in the corner"". 

8Whilst this was happening Harminder restrained Harvinder on the mattress. One of the offenders downstairs, we do not know who, held Karmjit Kaur's hands and pushed her from behind, hurting her neck. Gurwinder hit her again in the face with the back of his hand, this time making her tooth bleed. Valjit ran downstairs and out of the unit. 

9Dalbag and Harvinder went upstairs and saw that Gurpreet was bleeding from his head and was largely incoherent. Dalbag and Harvinder assisted him outside the unit. He said to them ""save me, I'm going to die"". 

10The offenders left the victims' unit and returned to their own. They took the baseball bat/iron rod with them and then left in a white car. Police and ambulance were called. Gurpreet was transferred by ambulance to Griffith Base Hospital where he stayed overnight and received stitches to the cut to his head. Gurpreet also suffered bruising to his hands, back and right side of his thigh. Valjit was transported to hospital and received five stitches to the cut below his eye. 

11As a result of this conduct each of the offenders is to sentenced for an offence of entering a dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence in circumstances of special aggravation. The circumstance of special aggravation relied on by the Crown concerns the wound inflicted by Valjit but other circumstances of special aggravation exist, namely the wound to Gurpreet's head. It is to be noted that there are a number of circumstances of aggravation, not special aggravation which are also present. Amrinder and Jagdar were armed with offensive weapons. The offenders were in company, corporal violence was used, the people inside the house had their liberty deprived for a short period and each of the offenders knew that there were people inside the place where the offence was committed. 

12As well as that offence there are related offences on a s 166 certificate. Gurwinder is to be sentenced as well as the primary matter for an offence of assault occasion actual bodily harm. Other offenders to be sentenced by me on related matters are: Harminder for the common assault occasioned by restraining Harvinder on the mattress downstairs; Jagdar for the common assault occasioned by pushing Dalbag; and Amrinder for the offence of assault occasion actual bodily harm which came about when he hit Dalbag with a baseball bat to his right hand. 

13All five offenders appear to have reacted to what they perceive as severe provocation, occasioned by the unwanted attention being shown to Ms Diep but this scarcely explains the extent of the violence, let alone what appears to be Gurwinder's entirely gratuitous assaults on the only female present in the house, Ms Karmjit Kaur. 

14As I mentioned earlier, all offenders were born in the Punjab region of India. Amrinder was raised in a stable and supportive family environment. He married his wife in India and they came to Australia in 2008 when his wife gained a place as an overseas student. Amrinder was granted a visa to live in Australia as the spouse of a student but their relationship deteriorated until they divorced in September 2010. He lived at Griffith at the time of the offence, working on a long term casual basis on a farm. A reference from his employer, Deeda Singh was tendered on his behalf. It speaks highly of him, saying that he is a true asset to the community as well as his employer. 

15Jagdar was also raised within a stable and supportive family environment. He too came to Australia after his wife was granted a student visa and he was granted a visa to live in Australia as the spouse of a student. At the time of the offence his wife was living in Melbourne while he worked in the Griffith area in various casual farmhand positions. The pre-sentence report states that Jagdar's employer said he was an excellent worker and a person with exceptionally good and reliable personal qualities. 

16Jatinder was likewise raised in a stable and supportive family environment in India and came to Australia on a visa granted to him as the spouse of a student. He was working, doing casual farm labouring work in the Griffith area at the time of the offence but more recently he has been living in Melbourne with his wife and working at a car wash business. 

17Harminder was also raised in a stable and supportive family environment and came to Australia as the spouse of a student. He and his wife live in Griffith with one infant son. He is working at a local packing shed and was described by his employer as an excellent worker who was held in high personal regard. 

18Finally Gurwinder was also raised in a stable and supportive family environment and came to Australia as the spouse of a student. He and his wife live in Toowoomba in Queensland where he does casual farm work. 

19Given the lack of criminal history and the otherwise good character of the offenders it is remarkable that they appear for sentence today on such serious charges. It is also remarkable given their otherwise good character, that they each lied to the author of the pre-sentence reports prepared concerning each of them. Everyone of the offenders denied that anyone was armed, a position of course they later abandoned. The fact that they each told that lie however is an important aspect in determining their attitude, at least at the time of lying, to their offences. None of the offenders gave evidence, so none of the offenders told me that he was sorry for what he had done. 

20Mr Stanton who appeared for each of the offenders told me that his clients had asked him to convey their remorse to me, but that is a long way from the offenders accepting responsibility for the wrongfulness of their conduct. Indeed there is little in the material before me to suggest that if the offenders were faced with the same circumstances again, they would not commit similar offences. This suggests that there is a greater need for personal deterrence to be part of the sentence which I will impose upon the offenders than would otherwise be the case. 

21Of course general deterrence and retribution are also important aspects of the sentences I must impose and it was conceded by Mr Stanton that in each case a custodial sentence of some description was inevitable. I will return later to the question as to what form that custodial sentence should take. 

22Each offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so I will reduce the sentences I would otherwise have imposed by twenty-five per cent. I also regard it as a mitigating feature that, to a limited extent, these offences were provoked by unwanted attention being paid to a married woman. I do have to say however that whatever the level of insult or dishonour that such conduct involves, it is for the offenders when in Australia to obey Australian standards of moral responsibility and criminal law. 

23Subjectively, there is little to distinguish between the five offenders. They all have remarkably similar backgrounds and they are all roughly the same age but they did not all do the same things in the commission of their various offences. It is appropriate to distinguish them as far as their objective criminality is concerned. 

24Amrinder and Jagdar are at the top; they were armed with weapons and used them. At the next level down are Jatinder and Gurwinder, who each inflicted violence, Jatinder on Gurpreet upstairs and Gurwinder downstairs. It is to be noted however that Gurwinder's actions involved two specific offences of violence on top of the major offence common to all offenders which will see his sentence approaching that of those I will impose on Amrinder and Jagdar. Finally at the lowest level we have Harminder who remained downstairs and whose actions appear to have been limited to restraining Harvinder on a mattress, but even he, it must be remembered, was playing his part in a joint criminal enterprise to commit an offence of significant gravity. 

25Of course some of the distinguishing features to which I referred are the subject of specific offences to be dealt with separately as they appear on a s 166 certificate. It is important therefore that I state categorically that I have not double counted by both sentencing an offender for a specific offence appearing on the s 166 certificate and then also taking that into account as an aggravating circumstance for the offence of enter dwelling house with intent in circumstances of special aggravation. 

26Mr Stanton submitted that I would suspend any sentence of imprisonment imposed upon his clients. I am not going to do that. In some cases that is because the length of the sentence is such that suspension is not an option and in the remaining cases, that is because suspending the sentence would be insufficient to properly punish these offenders and insufficiently deter them and others in the community from the commission of similar offences. 

27In each case I make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour relating to the fact that this will be his first time in custody and he will benefit from an extended period of supervision upon release to parole. The offenders are sentenced as follows: 

28Amrinder Singh for the offence of assault occasion actual bodily harm appearing on the s 166 certificate the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of six months, to have commenced on 4 September 2011. That sentence is a fixed term because of the sentence I am about to announce. For the offence of specially aggravated break and enter with intent to commit an indictable offence the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of twelve months, to commence on 5 December 2011. I set a head sentence for that matter of two years. Thus the overall sentence is one consisting of a non-parole period of one year and three months and a head sentence of two years and three months. The non-parole period will expire on 4 December 2012 on which date the offender is to be released to parole. 

29Jagdar Singh for the offence of common assault appearing on the s 166 certificate the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of two months, to have commenced on 4 September 2011. That sentence is a fixed term because of the sentence I am about to announce. For the offence of specially aggravated break and enter with intent to commit an indictable offence the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of twelve months, to commence on 5 October 2011 and a head sentence of two years. The overall sentence is thus one consisting of a non-parole period of one year and one month with a head sentence of two years and one month. The offender is to be released to parole on 4 October 2012. 

30Jatinder Singh. I sentence him to imprisonment for the offence of specially aggravated enter dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence. I set a non-parole period of nine months, to have commenced on 7 September 2011. I set a head sentence of eighteen months. The non-parole period will expire on 6 June 2012 on which day he is to be released to parole. 

31Harminder Singh is sentenced to imprisonment for the offence of specially aggravated enter dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence. I set a non-parole period of six months, to have commenced yesterday, 7 September 2011. I set a head sentence of twelve months. The non-parole period will expire on 6 March 2012, on which date the offender is to be released to parole. 

32Gurwinder Singh for the offence of common assault appearing on the s 166 certificate the offender is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of two months, to have commenced on 7 September 2011. For the offence of assault occasioning bodily harm appearing on the 166 certificate he is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of six months, to commence on 7 October 2011. Those sentences are fixed terms because of the sentence I am about to announce. For the offence of specially aggravated enter a dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for nine months, to commence on 7 December 2011 with a head sentence of eighteen months. Thus the overall sentence is one consisting of a non-parole period of one year and a head sentence of one year nine months. The non-parole period will expire on 6 September 2012 on which day the offender is to be released to parole. 

33I dismiss the back up matters on the s 166 certificates. 

34Before concluding I should say that I am fully aware that the ratio of non-parole period to head sentence is not the same for each offender. This is not an oversight. In my view the non-parole periods I have imposed are in each case the shortest which would properly reflect the objective gravity of each of the offender's conduct.

2709212,Lewis v R [2011] NSWCCA 206,"Judgment 

1WHEALY JA : I agree with the judgment of Harrison J and the orders he proposes. 

2LATHAM J : I agree with Harrison J. 

3HARRISON J : The applicant pleaded guilty before Payne DCJ on 20 May 2010 in the Armidale District Court to a series of offences. Freeman DCJ sentenced him for those offences on 19 August 2010 as follows: 

Count 1 : 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months to date from 4 February 2009 and to expire on 3 December 2010. 

Count 2 : (taking into account items on the Form 1), 1 year and 8 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months to date from 4 August 2010 and to expire on 3 November 2011. 

Count 3 : (taking into account the item on the Form 1), 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months to date from 4 August 2011 to expire on 3 June 2013. 

Count 4 : 5 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months to date from 4 December 2012 to expire on 3 August 2014. 

Two s 166 matters : in each case, 6 months fixed term to date from 4 February 2009 to expire on 3 August 2009. 

4The applicant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 8 years and 10 months commencing on 4 February 2009 and expiring on 3 December 2017 with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months expiring on 3 August 2014. The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed upon the following grounds: 

Ground 1 : The sentencing judge failed to have proper regard to the sentencing principles relating to mental illness and failed to give proper weight to the mental illness of the applicant when sentencing him. 

Ground 2 : The sentencing judge failed to have proper regard to the totality principle in his accumulation of sentence. 

Ground 3 : The sentencing judge failed to consider that the steal from dwelling offence could have been dealt with in the Local Court. 

Ground 4 : The sentence is manifestly excessive. 

Background 

5The following facts were agreed. 

6With respect to count 1, the victim's partner woke in the early hours of 4 January 2009 to find the applicant standing in the doorway of their bedroom. He called out to the victim to turn her light on, which she did. The applicant could then be seen standing in the room. The victim told the applicant to leave and followed him out. She was then naked. As she went to close the door behind him, the applicant grabbed her on her crotch and said, ""I love you"". The victim pushed his hand a way and said, ""Don't touch me"". She shut and locked the door behind him. The applicant was employed to mow lawns that included the premises occupied by the victim. These facts constituted the break and enter and commit serious indictable offence charge. 

7The victim of count 2 was absent from her residence at New England Girls' School between December 2008 and 19 January 2009. During that time she received two sexually explicit and offensive text messages from the applicant. These are the subject of charges on a Form 1. Upon her return to her residence the applicant found a note under her door. It was in similarly explicit and offensive terms. The victim reported this to the police. She moved out of the premises two days later. These facts constituted the intimidate offences. The Form 1 contains a further offence involving another customer of the lawn mowing business. The applicant also left a note in similarly explicit and offensive terms, which included his mobile telephone number. 

8The victim of count 3 also lived at the school. She was on holidays between 22 November 2008 and 27 December 2008. On her return she washed her laundry and left it on racks to dry. She then spent three days away from the premises. Upon her return she discovered that ten pairs of her underpants had been stolen. She went to stay with her boyfriend for a few days on 3 February 2009. She left her room closed but not locked. On 6 February 2009 the victim attended the police station to make a statement. She identified her stolen property, including a video camera and a bikini bottom that she had not previously missed. These items relate to the steal from dwelling offence and the larceny charge, relating to about ten pairs of underpants, on the Form 1. 

9The victim of count 4 was a 17-year-old female living at the school. Early on the morning of 4 February 2009 the applicant entered her bedroom as she slept and placed his hand inside her underpants. He inserted his fingers into her vagina. He continued this with increasing force as the victim awoke from her sleep. The applicant restrained the victim and despite her calling for help he persisted pressing his fingers into her vagina. This did not cease until the applicant fled following noise from an adjacent room. 

10His Honour Freeman DCJ made the following findings. The applicant was heavily intoxicated when he committed the offences on 3 February 2009, and his intoxication contributed to the commission of the offences. The applicant has an intellectual disability that causes him difficulty in foreseeing the long-term consequences of his actions. The applicant has extremely limited interpersonal skills and coping abilities, equivalent to the level of functioning of a six year old, and he is prone to anti-social behaviour. The applicant's poor frontal lobe function produces a tendency to be impulsive, to feel entitled and to be disinhibited. The applicant had sufficient wit to proffer an explanation to police for his presence in the school grounds when he was apprehended on the morning of 4 February 2009. There had been a level of planning overnight on 3 February 2009 to commit ""some evil doing under cover of darkness"", if not the specific offences themselves. The applicant suffers from alcohol related brain damage and chronic alcoholism. His criminal history is of benefit to him as he has not previously offended in a similar way. The applicant progressed fairly rapidly from stealing women's underwear in late 2008 to a forceful, sustained and apparently uninhibited sexual assault on 4 February 2009. There is a moderate risk of reoffending. Special circumstances existed because of the manner in which the applicant will be held in custody. 

Ground 1 

11His Honour accepted the applicant's submission that the delay in entering his guilty plea was explained in part by the need to have him assessed as to his fitness and the difficulties in getting him fully to understand the implications of the charges that he faced. His Honour accepted these submissions concerning the timing of the plea and awarded a one sixth discount on sentence as a result. No complaint is made about that. 

12Because there was a causal link between the applicant's mental illness and his offending, the applicant submitted that it was properly open to his Honour to find that the applicant's moral culpability was reduced in light of cases such as R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33] - [36] as follows: 

""[33] Mental illness may be relevant - and was relevant in the present case - in three ways. First, where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced; there may not then be the same call for denunciation and the punishment warranted may accordingly be reduced: Henry at [254]; Jiminez [1999] NSWCCA 7 at [23]; Tsiaras [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; Lauritsen (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [51]; Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [23]; Pearson [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43]. 

[34] Secondly, mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration: Pearce (NSW CCA, 1 November 1996, unreported); Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71 per Gleeson CJ; Letteri (NSW CCA, 18 March 1992, unreported); Israil at [22]; Pearson at [42]. 

[35] Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person: Tsiaras at 400; Jiminez at [25]; Israil at [26]. 

[36] A fourth, and countervailing, consideration may arise, namely, the level of danger which the offender presents to the community. That may sound in special deterrence; Israil at [24]."" 

13The applicant contended that his Honour appeared instead to move away from the position identified in Hemsley on account of the applicant having demonstrated an inability to control his sexual urges only relatively recently, at the age of approximately 40, whereas his disability had been of longstanding. His Honour ultimately held that the applicant's entitlement to be sentenced more leniently should be tempered with a certain degree of caution concerning his prospects of rehabilitation. 

14In cases involving offenders suffering from intellectual disabilities or mental disorders, general deterrence is given less weight and may be moderated according to the extent to which a particular offender knows what he or she is doing and the gravity of his or her actions. Basic norms of sexual privacy and human dignity are not intellectual notions and persons of lesser intelligence are not necessarily more likely to commit such assaults: R v Champion (1992) 64 A Crim R 244; R v Bus (NSWCCA, 8 March 1996 - unreported). 

15Dr Furst reported that the applicant suffered from a mildly severe intellectual disability that affected his ability to process information, make decisions, solve problems and regulate his emotions. He also showed signs of communication problems and difficulties with daily living skills and socialisation. Dr Furst assessed his interpersonal and coping skills as consistent with a child aged 6 years and 8 months. He said that this level of disability made it much more difficult for him than a normal person to understand concepts and learn new information. 

16It was in these circumstances that the applicant contended that the sentencing judge placed undue weight on the moderate risk that the applicant would re-offend, in circumstances where, as his Honour remarked, ""such improvements as can be made to his understanding and appreciation of the wrongfulness of his actions remain[ed] unclear"". The applicant submitted that whilst it was appropriate for his Honour to give weight to community protection in those circumstances, as in Hemsley at [36], his Honour failed properly to consider the way in which the applicant's illness rendered him an inappropriate vehicle for specific deterrence or to moderate the need for general and specific deterrence. The applicant conceded that whereas his Honour had given appropriate weight to the impact of custody upon him as a consequence of his mental condition, he gave insufficient weight to his mental illness in all of the circumstances. 

17His Honour clearly accepted that there was a causal connection between his mental condition and the offending conduct. He referred to R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71 as follows: 

""The existence of such a causal relationship in a particular case does not automatically produce the result that the offender will receive a lesser sentence, any more than the absence of such a causal connection produces the automatic result that an offender will not receive a lesser sentence in a particular case. For example, the existence of a causal connection between the mental disorder and the offence might reduce the importance of general deterrence, and increase the importance of particular deterrence or the need to protect the public."" 

18In Zaharos v R [2008] NSWCCA 336 at [14], McClellan CJ at CL said: 

""[14]...Where mental illness has played a part in the offending, the need for general deterrence may be diminished: R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48. However, where an offender understands what he is doing and the gravity of his actions, general deterrence may be of continuing significance: Wright at 51; R v Henry & Ors [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [252]-[254]. The issue is further discussed in R v Matthews [2004] NSWCCA 112; (2004) 145 A Crim R 445 and R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[36]."" 

19Moreover, Howie J in Courtney v R [2007] NSWCCA 195; (2007) 172 A Crim R 371 at [83] said this: 

""[83] The fact that an offender is mentally ill does not mean that the sentence imposed must be less than that imposed upon a person who commits the same criminal act without any abnormality of mind. It may do so for all the reasons given in R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 225. In particular the fact that the offender is suffering from a mental illness may reduce the person's culpability. But even that fact does not necessarily result in a lesser sentence ... Provided that the sentence is commensurate with the gravity of the offence viewed objectively, there is no error of principle in imposing a sentence aimed at protecting the community from the offender's recidivism by removing him or her from society."" 

Consideration of Ground 1 

20I am not satisfied that his Honour fell into any error in the way that he took account of the applicant's mental condition in arriving at the sentences that he imposed. It is not suggested in this case that the applicant was so mentally disabled that he was incapable of understanding the nature and quality of his actions or that they were wrong. The evidence from Dr Furst does not support such a position. It does appear that the applicant's condition may have materially contributed to the commission of the offences in the sense that he was less able to regulate his emotions. As earlier noted, his Honour expressly accepted ""that there [was], in this case, a causal connection between [the applicant's] mental incapacity and the commission of these offences"". 

21Dr Furst expressed agreement with the results of an assessment conducted by Dr Drew at the MRRC on 1 September 2009 suggesting that she did not regard the applicant as having a mental condition and no specific mental health treatment was recommended. There was no evidence of serious mental illness. The applicant suffers from a mild developmental disability: his Full-Scale IQ score of 60 was consistent with mild intellectual disability. 

22With the exception of the count 3 offences (which are referred to later in these reasons when considering ground 3), the sentences imposed would appear to be commensurate with the gravity of the offences concerned, having regard to the applicant's mental condition. The limited nature and extent of the applicant's mental illness in this case would not lead me to conclude that the individual sentences are infected by error. Moreover, his Honour would appear clearly to have been concerned about specific deterrence and the risk of reoffending. Dr Furst opined that the applicant was in a category of offenders at moderate risk of reoffending. That risk was not lessened by the applicant's alcohol abuse. He expressed the view that ""[c]ounselling for his sexual offending that includes elements of victim empathy and education about appropriate intimacy could also be of assistance in reducing his future risk of offending"". His Honour was entitled to take these matters into account in terms of the risk to the community and the need for specific deterrence. 

23His Honour's remarks on sentence contain the following passage to which in my view no identifiable exception can be taken: 

""I think the proper approach, having identified where on the scale of criminality his activities lie, is to sentence him more leniently than would be the case with a man without his disabilities, but to temper this with a certain caution about his ability to reform and rehabilitate."" 

24It does not appear to me, however, that his Honour consistently or uniformly gave effect to these sentiments. The sentence for count 3 seems to me to be disproportionately long, both in isolation and in comparison to the other sentences. No allowance for the applicant's mental condition appears to have been brought to account with respect to it. By way of contrast, the non-parole period imposed in respect of count 4 is admittedly somewhat lenient. For example, the larceny charge on count 3 has a non-parole period that is 2 months less than the sexual assault on count 4. That could certainly be explained by the influence of the applicant's mental condition, and favourably to him. 

25In general terms, the extent of the accumulation of the sentences has produced an overall sentence that is arguably manifestly excessive. I do not however consider that this flows from any failure by his Honour to accommodate or apply considerations arising from the applicant's mental condition. I do not consider that this ground is made out. If the applicant is able to establish that some other sentence is warranted and should have been passed, it is for other reasons. This is referred to in more detail later when considering ground 4. 

Ground 2 

26In passing sentence in respect of the fourth count, his Honour expressly stated that he had disturbed the statutory proportions of that sentence, in part because of the accumulation. The accumulation in respect of the sentences for the first three counts was 80 per cent of the non-parole period. The applicant contended such accumulation was not ""some degree of partial accumulation"" but instead a very significant degree of accumulation in each case. 

27In R v Clements (1993) 68 A Crim R 167 at 172-3, Macrossan CJ and de Jersey J held that the court should look for some clear reason why sentences should be served cumulatively in a particular case before so ordering and should also determine whether the resulting effective sentence was out of proportion to the combined series of offences. Concurrent terms will usually be called for in a series of related offences over a short time span. While the need for caution was noted, the judicial discretion in addressing the question was also acknowledged. 

28The applicant contended that the degree of accumulation chosen by his Honour was substantial and at odds with his finding that ""from stealing women's underwear in late 2008 [the applicant] progressed fairly rapidly to the indecent assault of Ms S... in January then, via the range of text messages and other messages sent to his victims in late January, to finally sexually assaulting Ms K... in this forceful and sustained and apparently uninhibited way on 4 February"". While acknowledging the need to apply the principle in R v Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34 that the community should not be left with the impression that the offender has escaped effective punishment for the offences committed, the applicant submitted that his Honour failed to have sufficient regard for the principle of totality. That principle ""enables a court to mitigate what strict justice would otherwise indicate, where the total effect of the sentences merited by the individual crimes become so crushing as to call for the merciful intervention by the court by way of reducing the total effect:"" per King CJ in R v Rossi (CCA (SA), 20 April 1988, unreported). 

29The Crown contended that the offences were unrelated in time or type. Some degree of accumulation was to be expected but this was not a case where the criminality of one offence comprehended and reflected the criminality of any other. The Crown drew upon the remarks of Hall J in R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115 at [52]. 

30The Crown pointed out that the overall ratio of the non-parole period to the total term was 62 per cent, varying for individual sentences between 33 per cent and 75 per cent. The Crown submitted that the individual sentences were structured so that the overall result achieved through staged accumulation supported the view that his Honour had in fact had proper regard to the principles of totality. The overall result did not support a conclusion that his Honour's discretion miscarried. 

Consideration of Ground 2 

31I disagree with this last submission by the Crown. As I have previously intimated, the degree of accumulation of the various sentences has produced an overall sentence that is in my view manifestly excessive. The acts of individual criminality in this case were separate and distinct and were deserving of a degree of accumulation to reflect that fact in accordance with well-known principles. However, I accept the applicant's submission that in terms of totality, his Honour has imposed an overall term and a total non-parole period that are each disproportionate to the combined level of criminality involved. This appears to be so notwithstanding his Honour's expressed concerns about specific deterrence and the protection of the community. The 22-month non-parole period for the count 1 break enter and commit an indecent assault offence expires on 3 December 2010, whereas the 20 month non-parole period for the count 4 sexual intercourse without consent offence does not commence until 2 years later on 4 December 2012. The intervening period is taken up by a combination of the non-parole periods of 15 months on the count 2 intimidation offence and 22 months on the count 3 break and enter and commit larceny offence. 

32This level of accumulation produces an unduly harsh result and is indicative of error. 

Ground 3 

33The larceny offences related to items that were valued at less than $60,000. In those circumstances the offence must be dealt with in the Local Court unless an election is made for trial on indictment: s 260 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and cl 8 of Schedule 1. The election by the prosecution is likely to have been made because the remaining three counts were required to be dealt with in the District Court. 

34The relevant principles are to be found set out by Hall J in R v Palmer [2005] NSWCCA 349 at [15] as follows: 

""[15] The written submissions on behalf of the applicant and those also on behalf of the respondent refer to a number of decisions of this Court. For the purposes of this application, they are stated in short form as a series of propositions or principles as follows:- 

(a) The first is that a judge in the District Court is not bound by the jurisdictional limit imposed on the Local Court when dealing with an offence on indictment which was capable of summary disposal, but may have regard to that limit when the case is one which could appropriately have been disposed of in the Local Court: Regina v. Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297 at [16]; Regina v. LPY (2002) 136 A. Crim. R. 237 at 240 and Regina v. El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [30]. 

(b) Secondly, the fact that a matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court, had the prosecuting authority not elected otherwise, remains a relevant consideration in the exercise of the discretion reserved to the sentencing judge: Crombie (supra) at [15]. 

(c) Thirdly, however, the relevant decisions that establish that principle do not go so far as to require the sentencing judge to proceed upon the basis that the maximum available sentence is that which could have been imposed in the Local Court. At most they establish that the circumstance identified is to be taken into account. Depending upon the objective and the subjective criminality of the offender, it may properly be regarded as calling for some mitigation of the sentence that would otherwise be imposed in the District Court for an offence prosecuted upon indictment. Where it appears that that circumstance has been entirely overlooked by the sentencing judge, it may properly justify the granting of leave to appeal: Crombie (supra) at [16]. 

(d) Fourthly, the significance of the loss of the chance of the matter being dealt with in the Local Court varies from case to case. In some cases it would contribute to mitigation of sentence. It is a matter to be taken into account, but is not a universal factor for the reduction of sentence: Regina v. Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115. 

(e) Fifthly, the failure by a sentencing judge to mention the matter in his or her remarks on sentence and the length of the sentence does not necessarily establish that the sentencing judge failed to have regard to the matter. In some circumstances the length of the sentence may not suggest that the matter was overlooked: Regina v. Depoma [2003] NSWCCA 382 at [17]. 

(f) Finally, in circumstances where a sentencing judge has made no reference to the summary disposal argument in his or her remarks on sentence, it is necessary to consider whether that omission is indicative of error. One way of testing that proposition is to consider whether the sentence itself appears manifestly excessive in all the circumstances of the case - if the factor had been taken into account and given appropriate weight, a substantially lesser sentence was appropriate in the case: El Masri (supra) at [45] per Johnson, J. (with whom Hunt, AJA. and Hulme, J. agreed)."" 

35See also McCullough v R [2009] NSWCCA 94; (2009) 194 A Crim R 439 at [21] - [27]. In Bonwick v R [2010] NSWCCA 177, Davies J said this at [43] -[45]: 
""[43] Whilst it is clear that there is no obligation on the sentencing Judge to regard himself or herself limited by the maximum penalty available in the Local Court, two relevantly important principles emerge from the cases. The first is that the extent of the criminality is an important consideration in having regard to the Local Court penalty: R v Hanslow [2004] NSWCCA 163 at [21]; Regina v Said El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [29] and McCullough at [26]. Secondly, where it appears that the matter of the Local Court penalty has been entirely overlooked by the sentencing Judge that may properly justify the grant of leave to appeal: R v Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297 at [16]. 

[44] In the present case, it is likely that the matter was entirely overlooked by the sentencing Judge because it is accepted that neither counsel drew it to the Judge's attention. Further support for that inference derives from the omission of the sentencing Judge to make any reference to the fact that the offences could have been dealt with by the Local Court and from the length of the sentence imposed for each of the offences. 

[45] This failure to refer to the Local Court limitation on sentence amounts to an error justifying the intervention of this Court. This is because, as the highlighted passages in Palmer make clear, the fact that the Local Court could have dealt with the matter is a relevant consideration to be taken into account."" 

36In Dagdanasar v R [2010] NSWCCA 310 at [40] -[42], Price J dealt with the issue in this way: 

""[40] It is unsurprising that the sentencing judge did not mention that the offence could have been dealt with summarily. The objective seriousness of the offence, the criminal record of the applicant and the fact that it was committed in breach of parole all called for a sentence in excess of two years. The applicant was not entitled, in my opinion, to any weight being given to the loss of chance of summary disposition. In R EI Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167, Johnson J (with whom Hunt AJA and Hulme J agreed) said at [29]: 

'It is a well-established sentencing principle that a court dealing on indictment with a matter which was capable of summary disposal may have regard to that fact on sentence: R v Sandford (1994) 72 A Crim R 160 at 195; R v Griggs (1999) 109 A Crim R 484 at 485-6; Crombie, at paragraph 16; Doan, at 123ff (paragraph 35ff); R v LPY (2002) 135 A Crim R 237 at 240. But it is not a universal rule (Sandford, at 195) nor a factor which operates universally to reduce sentence (Doan, at 124). In some circumstances, the Court may conclude that the offender's criminality was too serious to be dealt with in the Local Court and that the matter was properly before the District Court: R v Hanslow [2004] NSWCCA 163 at paragraph 21. The significance of the loss of a chance to be dealt with in the Local Court will vary from case to case: R v Depoma [2003] NSWCCA 382 at paragraph 13.' 

[41] In Palmer, when discussing the principles relevant to the possibility of summary disposal, Hall J (with whom Grove J and Smart J agreed) said at [15]: 

'(a) The first is that a judge in the District Court is not bound by the jurisdictional limit imposed on the Local Court when dealing with an offence on indictment which was capable of summary disposal, but may have regard to that limit when the case is one which could appropriately have been disposed of in the Local Court: R v Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297 at [16]; R v LPY (2002) 136 A. Crim. R 237 at 240 and R v El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [30].' 

[42] The offence could not have been appropriately disposed of in the Local Court. I do not consider in the present case that the sentencing judge's failure to make reference to the fact that the offence could have been dealt with in the Local Court in his sentencing remarks indicates that his Honour erred. I would reject this ground of appeal."" 

37Finally in Strickland v R; O'Connor v R [2011] NSWCCA 166 at [25] - [26], Buddin J said this: 

""[25]It is common ground that the offences which gave rise to counts 2a, 3a and 4a in respect of each applicant were all Table 1 matters, within the meaning of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 , and as such were capable of being dealt with in the Local Court. The maximum penalty which the Local Court can impose for such an offence is 2 years imprisonment. It was in that context that counsel for each of the applicants relied upon this Court's decision in Bonwick v R [2010] NSWCCA 177... 

[26]It is also common ground that, as in Bonwick , the sentencing judge in the present case made no reference to the fact that the offences in question could have been dealt with in the Local Court. It is equally clear that neither party drew the matter to her Honour's attention. It was urged on behalf of the applicants that her Honour's conclusion that each of the offences in question were ""below mid-range"" was of particular significance in an assessment of this ground. It was submitted that the total sentence of 4 years and 3 months imprisonment imposed upon the applicant Strickland in relation to Court 4a was impossible to reconcile with her Honour's finding, particularly as he had pleaded guilty and was remorseful. Moreover, it further demonstrated, so it was submitted, that her Honour had simply overlooked the fact that that matter, as well as the other two offences, could have been dealt with in the Local Court. It was submitted on behalf of the applicant O'Connor that there was even greater warrant for consideration to have been given to this issue in his case, since his role was limited to that of a principal in the second degree in respect of the two break, enter and steal offences, whilst in respect of the remaining matter he was to be sentenced in relation to the less serious offence of receiving."" 

38The applicant accepted that the failure by his Honour to mention in his remarks on sentence that the matter could have been disposed of in the Local Court does not necessarily establish that he failed to have regard to it. In some circumstances, the length of the sentence may not suggest that the matter was overlooked: R v Depoma [2003] NSWCCA 382 at [17]. However, the applicant contended in the present case that the length of the sentence imposed rather suggested that the sentencing judge did not have regard to this issue when determining the appropriate sentence. 

39In circumstances in which the sentencing judge makes no reference to the summary disposal issue in the remarks on sentence, it is necessary to consider whether that omission is indicative of error. The applicant submitted that one way of testing the proposition was to consider whether the sentence itself appears manifestly excessive in all of the circumstances of the case. If the factor has been taken into account and given appropriate weight, a substantially lesser sentence will be appropriate: R v El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [45] per Johnson J. The applicant contended that the present case was such a case. 

40It is common ground that no submissions were made to his Honour about this. His Honour found that the offences taken in combination were ""unarguably serious"". He later remarked, ""these crimes require significant periods of imprisonment"". However, he identified the particular offence on count 3 to be an offence ""below mid range, even after taking into consideration the fact that there is another item to be taken into account on the Form 1"". 

41The sentence imposed exceeded the limit in the Local Court. The Crown submitted that his Honour was of the opinion that there was no loss of chance of summary disposal. He also had to take account of the matters on the Form 1. The Crown contended that this was not a matter that could have been appropriately disposed of in the Local Court. 

Consideration of Ground 3 

42I disagree that count 3 could not have been appropriately dealt with in the Local Court. The theft of a video camera, part of a two-piece swimsuit and some underpants from a dwelling appears to me to be an offence that would in the normal course almost always be dealt with in that jurisdiction. The $60,000 jurisdictional limit alone would emphatically suggest as much, having regard to the presumed value of the stolen items in the present case. However, his Honour's so-called failure to refer to the summary disposal option was not made the subject of submissions to him and it would to my mind be somewhat artificial in the particular circumstances of this case to conclude that his Honour relevantly made an error that should lead this Court to intervene. It is in my opinion preferable, having regard to the conclusions I have otherwise reached, not to treat this ground of appeal as an independent ground because it overlaps to a considerable extent with the allegation of manifest excess in ground 4, and is more appropriately accommodated in that context. It follows that the arguably differing emphases exposed in the cases to which I referred do not need to be examined. 

Ground 4 

43Having regard to the discount applied by his Honour in recognition of the plea of guilty, the starting point for the sentence was 10.6 years, or a little over 10 years and 7 months. The applicant submitted that that was an excessive total term having regard to the offences committed. 

44In his remarks on sentence his Honour indicated that he intended to impose a total term of 8 years and 6 months, whereas in fact he imposed a total term of 8 years and 10 months. In addition, the applicant contended that the total sentence of 8 years and 10 months, with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months, was excessive considering the combination of the following benign factors: 

His moral culpability was reduced because of his disability. 

The sexual assault offence is at the bottom of the mid range of objective seriousness. 

The applicant's antecedents are not such as to disentitle him to leniency. 

The applicant had no history of prior similar offending. 

The applicant's disability means that his incarceration will have a harsher impact upon him. 

45The applicant submitted that the imposition of a total term of 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months for stealing one video camera, one bikini bottom and 10 pairs of underpants from a dwelling was manifestly excessive. This is particularly so given the fact that it could have been dealt with summarily. The applicant also relied upon the previous three grounds of appeal in aid of the contention that the overall sentence was manifestly excessive, but in particular ground 2. 

46The Crown submitted that the overall sentence was not excessive and that no other sentence was warranted or should have been passed. 

Consideration of Ground 4 

47It will already be apparent that I consider that the overall effective sentence is manifestly excessive. A second look at the sentences suggests that a term of imprisonment of 8 years and 10 months with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months for a mentally disabled man with no relevant criminal history committed over a short period of time was excessive. It may be that the applicant had sufficient wit to offer an explanation of his presence in a particular place when confronted by the police, so that some practical appreciation of the applicant's mental illness, and his corresponding level of criminality, more clearly emerges. However, this has to be fairly starkly contrasted with the fact that he provided his mobile telephone number to the victim of the intimidation offence, and thereby to the police, with the inevitable result that he would be apprehended. 

48His Honour certainly gave the applicant the benefit of some considerable leniency on the sexual assault charge in count 4. However, the non-parole period for the less serious indecent assault offence on count 1 is the same as for count 4. The difference between them is reflected in the greater balance of term in the case of the sexual assault count. Each sentence appears clearly to take account of the applicant's mental illness. In contrast, the break and enter and commit larceny offence on count 3 relating to inexpensive items of underwear and a camera attracted a non-parole period 2 months longer than either the sexual assault or indecent assault counts. The intimidation offences in count 2 were described by his Honour as vile, but were manifestly guileless and evidently causally connected to the applicant's mental disability. 

49In my opinion the principle of totality impels me to the conclusion that his Honour's sentencing discretion miscarried. A lesser sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. With the exception of the sentence for the offences in count 3, I propose to impose the same sentences that his Honour imposed but to vary the extent of accumulation and to increase the level of concurrence of these sentences. With respect to the offences in count 3, I consider that a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months should be imposed in lieu of his Honour's sentence of 2 years and 6 months. 

Conclusion 

50Having regard to my conclusions, I consider that the following orders should be made: 

1. Grant leave to appeal. 

2. Allow the appeal. 

3. Quash the sentences imposed by his Honour Freeman DCJ on 19 August 2010. 

4. In lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced as follows: 

Count 1 : to a term of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 4 February 2009 and expiring on 3 August 2011 with a non-parole period of 22 months commencing on 4 February 2009 and expiring on 3 December 2010 and a balance of term of 8 months commencing on 4 December 2010 and expiring on 3 August 2011. 

Count 2 (taking into account items on the Form 1): to a term of imprisonment of 1 year and 8 months i commencing on 4 August 2010 and expiring on 3 April 2012 with a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months commencing on 4 August 2010 and expiring on 3 November 2011 with a balance of term of 5 months commencing on 4 November 2011 and expiring on 3 April 2012. 

Count 3 (taking into account the item on the Form 1): to a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 4 April 2012 and expiring on 3 April 2013. 

Count 4 : to a term of imprisonment of 5 years commencing on 4 January 2011 and expiring on 3 January 2016 with a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months commencing on 4 January 2011 and expiring on 3 September 2012 with a balance of term of 3 years and 4 months commencing on 4 September 2012 and expiring on 3 January 2016. 

S 166 matters : in each case to a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months commencing on 4 February 2009 and expiring on 3 August 2009. 

51The overall effective sentence is therefore one of imprisonment for 6 years and 11 months commencing on 4 February 2009 and expiring on 3 January 2016, with an effective non-parole period of 4 years and 2 months commencing on 4 February 2009 and expiring on 3 April 2013 with a balance of term of 3 years and 9 months commencing on 4 April 2013 and expiring on 3 January 2016. The first date upon which the applicant will be eligible for parole is 3 April 2013.

		13 September 2011",2011-09-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2709214,R v Hendricks [2011] NSWCCA 203,"Judgment 

1BASTEN JA : In circumstances more fully described by Garling J, the applicant seeks leave to appeal in respect of two sentences imposed on him by the District Court on 27 April 2010. The sentences relate, respectively, to sexual assaults committed by the applicant on his then partner, on 13 August and 19 October 2008 respectively. The basis of complaint is not the length of the respective sentences, but the fact that the second was made entirely cumulative upon the non-parole period for the first. 

2Such a complaint may be approached in one or both of two ways. First, it is open to this Court to assess the objective circumstances, as revealed by the sentence itself, together with any findings of fact made by the sentencing judge, and determine whether the degree of accumulation demonstrated an error in point of principle. The second approach is to examine the reasons of the sentencing judge to determine whether they reveal an error in terms of principle. 

3Where adequate reasons have been given, it is appropriate to combine the two considerations. Adequate reasons should be given: s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW (""the Sentencing Procedure Act "") relevantly provides as follows: 

"" 5 Penalties of imprisonment 

(1) A court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. 

(2) A court that sentences an offender to imprisonment for 6 months or less must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, its reasons for doing so, .... 

(3) Subsection (2) does not limit any other requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions."" 

4That a sentencing court is required, generally, and not merely in the circumstances identified in s 5, to record the reasons for its orders is not in doubt: Regina v JCE [2000] NSWCCA 498; 120 A Crim R 18 at [19] (Fitzgerald JA, Whealy and Howie JJ agreeing). 

5Where an indictable trial proceeds before a judge without a jury, the judge makes a ""finding"" that has the same effect as a verdict of a jury: Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), s 133(1). The section further provides: 

""(2) A judgment by a Judge in any such case must include the principles of law applied by the Judge and the findings of fact on which the Judge relied."" 

6In dealing with a predecessor to this provision, the High Court has held that, although it ""does not use the expression 'reasons for judgment', it should not be taken as intending that the requirements of [s 133(2)] be satisfied merely by a bare statement of the principles of law that the judge has applied and the findings of fact that the judge has made. Rather, there must be exposed the reasoning process linking them and justifying the latter and, ultimately, the verdict that is reached"": Fleming v The Queen [1998] HCA 68; 197 CLR 250 at [28]. 

7At the commencement of the judgment in Fleming , the Court referred to statements by McHugh JA in Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 277-278, identifying the historical transfer of fact-finding functions in civil proceedings from the jury to the judge and the consequences for both statutory appeals and other forms of review. The Court stated that similar issues were drawn into the field of criminal law by the provision for trial by judge alone: at [3]. Soulemezis was one in a line of authorities dealing with the obligation of a judge to provide reasons in respect of findings of fact and the process by which a final conclusion was reached. Soulemezis expanded the basic principle from its well-established area of operation, namely in respect of decisions from which there was a right of appeal, a process started in Housing Commission of New South Wales v Tatmar Pastoral Co Pty Ltd [1983] 3 NSWLR 378 at 386 (Mahoney JA): see Soulemezis at 278C. 

8The function of sentencing falls within the area of decision-making from which an appeal lies, albeit with leave: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5(1). Given the seriousness of the subject-matter of a sentencing proceeding, it cannot be doubted that the obligation of a sentencing judge in respect of reasons is not less than that which would apply in a civil case. The proceeding culminates in a judgment, comprised of the orders of the court and the reasons therefor. 

9The important function of reasons in the sentencing process should not be diminished by the conventional reference to them as ""remarks on sentence"". Whatever the historical explanation for that nomenclature, it should be abandoned. 

10One of the problems in the present case, as identified by Garling J, is that the sentencing judge provided little by way of explanation for his decision to accumulate the non-parole periods in full. In the circumstances, the Court is left to infer from the result, the principles, correct or otherwise, which were applied, or not applied. As explained in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505: 

""It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred."" 

11There are two important factors which should have weighed against a total accumulation. Neither of them was referred to in the judgment in this context, and it may, accordingly, be inferred that there was error. 

12The first point was that, as his Honour expressly identified in an earlier part of the judgment (p 6), an aggravating factor in relation to the first charge, namely an assault occasioning actual bodily harm, was required to be taken into account on a form 1, in respect of the second count. His Honour was at pains to avoid treating that factor as an aggravating factor in relation to the first charge: however, if, as was required, it were taken into account in respect of the second charge, there was a strong basis for the sentences being partly concurrent. 

13The second consideration was that each offence took place between two persons in a well-established (if at times unstable) relationship, which had included the birth of two children. As Garling J explains, the commission of the first offence, which resulted in a sentence of imprisonment for three years, did not destroy the relationship. Rather, although the applicant no longer lived on the same premises, he continued to help look after the family. It was only after his incarceration that the two young girls were removed to the custody of their paternal grandparents, because the mother could not care for them alone. I would therefore infer that the ongoing familial relationship was a matter of some practical importance in the period between the two offences. 

14For these reasons, as well as those provided by Garling J, there should have been a significant degree of concurrence in respect of the non-parole periods for each offence. I agree with the orders which his Honour has proposed. 

15SIMPSON J: I agree with Garling J. 

16GARLING J: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed in the District Court of New South Wales by his Honour Judge Freeman on 27 April 2010. 

17The applicant, Dan Hendricks, initially pleaded guilty before Finnane DCJ to two offences involving sexual intercourse without consent. He maintained that plea when he came before Freeman DCJ for sentencing. 

18The first offence was one contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 namely that on 13 August 2008 the complainant had sexual intercourse with the victim, SM, without her consent. 

19The maximum penalty for an offence against this section is 14 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of seven years' imprisonment applies. 

20The second offence was one which occurred on 19 October 2008 and involved the contravention of s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, namely, the offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. Again, it was alleged that the sexual intercourse occurred with SM without her consent. The circumstance of aggravation relied upon was that at the time of the sexual intercourse the applicant inflicted actual bodily harm on the victim. 

21The maximum penalty for this offence is 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years is applicable. 

22As well, there were three further offences considered by the sentencing judge. Two charges on a Form 1 were placed before the sentencing judge to be taken into account on the second offence and one offence was put before the judge for sentence on a certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

23For the first offence, the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment which comprised of a non-parole period of two years and three months commencing on 19 October 2008 and finishing on 18 January 2011 and a balance of term of nine months to conclude on 18 October 2011. 

24For the second offence, the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment which comprised a non-parole period of five and a half years and balance of term of three and a half years. He ordered that the sentence commence on 19 January 2011. The effect of this was that the non-parole periods for each of these two offences were entirely accumulated although there was concurrence for nine months between the non-parole period of the second offence and the balance of term on the first offence. 

25In addition with respect to the charge of breaching an apprehended violence order which was dealt with on the s 166 certificate, the learned sentencing judge imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 19 January 2011, and concluding on 18 January 2012. 

Facts 

26A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered to the sentencing judge. It is necessary for the purposes of this appeal to provide a brief summary of those facts. 

First Offence 

27The applicant and SM, prior to the offence occurring, had been in a relationship for about six years. They had two daughters of their relationship, aged six and one. Their relationship had been turbulent and often argumentative largely due to the consumption of alcohol by the applicant. However, their relationship had proceeded to the stage where they had planned to be married on 23 August 2008. 

28Following an argument on the afternoon of 12 August 2008, and the consumption of alcohol by both the applicant and SM through the late evening of that day and into the early hours of the following morning, SM retired to bed. After that time a series of events occurred, only one of which was relied upon by the sentencing judge as constituting the offence. 

29The first episode occurred shortly after the victim went to bed. The applicant entered the bedroom and attempted to instigate sexual intercourse. SM clearly rejected his advances and refused to consent to sexual intercourse. The applicant then engaged in two acts of sexual intercourse, one involving oral/vaginal intercourse and the other involving penile/vaginal intercourse. He used force to make SM submit to him. At one point she tried to sit up but was pushed back down on to the bed and whilst the second episode of intercourse was occurring the applicant said to the victim "" you love it, you're going to be my wife soon "", to which she responded "" yeah, but I'm not a piece of steak, I'm not a piece of meat "". 

30SM attempted to leave the bed to attend to her youngest daughter who was sleeping in her bedroom, but the applicant prevented her from attending to her child, pushing her down onto her stomach on the bed. He then again had penile/vaginal intercourse with her from behind, and as he did so, he both pushed her back down and pulled her hair. SM was very upset and was crying at the end of this episode. 

31After some further conversation between the applicant and SM, which occurred variously in other rooms of the dwelling, SM returned to her bedroom. The applicant again started to grope SM and removed her pants. SM yelled "" stop it "". The applicant persisted saying "" you want it and you don't want it "". SM yelled "" I didn't want this. No, this is wrong. No means no, Dan . This is disgusting. This is rape. You've got no respect for me "". The applicant then pushed SM down on her stomach and eventually had penile/vaginal intercourse with the victim against her will, which continued for two to three minutes. 

32He then left the bedroom and returned to the lounge room where he lay on the couch. After a further verbal and physical altercation in which SM kicked the applicant in the face, the police were telephoned and eventually attended. 

33In the meantime an ambulance had attended and established that SM was not suffering any serious injury. The police attended and found that the applicant had packed a bag for SM and their children and was in the process of forcing them out of the premises. 

34When interviewed at the Coffs Harbour Police Station the applicant claimed that the whole of the sexual activity between him and SM was consensual. 

35An interim Apprehended Violence Order was ordered by the Local Court at Coffs Harbour on 19 August 2008 which extended up to and including 28 October 2008. The Apprehended Violence Order provided that the applicant was not to 

""...assault, molest, harass, threaten or otherwise interfere with the [complainant] ..."". 

36There was an additional condition of the Apprehended Violence Order which should also be noted, namely that the applicant: 

""...must not approach [the victim] or any such premises or place at which [the victim] from time to time resides or works, within twelve (12) hours of consuming intoxicating liquor or illicit drugs."" 

37The agreed facts contained no material at all which suggested that when the applicant attended at the premises of SM on the morning of 19 October 2008, he had consumed any alcohol or drugs within the preceding twelve hours. 

38In considering any questions surrounding the applicant's conduct on 19 October 2008, there was no basis in the agreed facts to find that his attendance at the house, and his speaking to SM constituted a breach of this Apprehended Violence Order. 

Second Offence 

39The second offence occurred on 19 October 2008. On that day, early in the morning, the applicant was seated in his motor vehicle outside SM's residence. He saw her in the company of another male who was from Jamaica. The male left the residence. She returned inside her residence and observed that the applicant had come to the house and knocked on the door. He made his way inside the house. An argument was initiated about the fact that SM had been in the company of the other male. The applicant expressed his disagreement with SM's description of their relationship. He then grabbed SM in a bear hug and put her over his shoulder. He carried her down the hallway to one of the bedrooms where he pushed SM onto the floor. He removed his trousers, asserting to the victim that it was now "" his turn "". SM resisted his advances but the applicant forcibly removed her clothes and after some initial attempts, the applicant positioned himself on top of the victim using his strength to engage in oral/vaginal intercourse. He attempting penile/vaginal intercourse, but this was unsuccessful. 

40In the course of this, SM said to him "" get off, no, get off, you're disgusting, you haven't learned "". The applicant replied "" I don't care if the cops come, you fucked an African, now it's my turn "". 

41After the intercourse had concluded, verbal abuse occurred between the applicant and SM. The police were called. By the time they arrived the applicant had left, he was arrested later the same day. 

42He thereafter remained in custody until the time of his sentencing hearing. 

43The applicant pleaded guilty to the charges before the Local Court at Coffs Harbour on 7 April 2009 and ultimately adhered to that plea before the District Court at Coffs Harbour on 23 April 2010. 

Applicant's submission on sentence 

44The applicant agreed with the facts tendered by the Crown. 

45The applicant did not give evidence on his sentence hearing, but two reports were tendered. The first of these was a report of Graham Schubert from the Macleay Valley Psychological Services Pty Ltd dated 9 May 2009 and the second was from Dr John Kasinathan, a consultant forensic psychiatrist. This report was dated 7 June 2009. 

46During submissions, Mr Harrison, who appeared for the applicant, submitted with respect to the first offence that the criminality involved was 

""...very much bottom of the range in terms of the sort of offence that your Honour might see in relation to facts encompassed in s 61I."" 

47With respect to the second offence, Mr Harrison submitted that his client had ""... completely lost the plot "". He conceded that the Court should find that the second offence was "" ...very close to, if not reaching, mid-range "". This concession appeared to be on the basis of the aggravating features involved in the conduct and the nature of the injuries involved. 

48Mr Harrison also conceded that the description which had been given in the Probation and Parole Service report of 1 June 2009 in respect of the second offence that: 

""...he became enraged at his ex-partner seeing another male and he wanted to punish her for what he perceived as infidelity."" 

was correct. 

49It is relevant to note that the agreed facts recorded that between the two offences, the applicant had continued to visit SM, that they had discussed their future together on a number of occasions, the applicant retained a key to the premises in which SM was living with their children and that there had been ongoing episodes of sexual intimacy between them. 

Subjective features of the applicant 

50The applicant was born in August 1966 and was aged 42 at the time of the offences and 43 at the time sentence was passed. 

51The applicant was born in the Cook Islands of a brief encounter between his biological parents. When he was a few weeks old, he was removed from his mother's care by his father and then left in the care of an unrelated foster family. He was apparently not well treated by that family and was subjected to abuse and effective enslavement. 

52He left school at about the age of 14 and ultimately joined the Merchant Navy. In his 30s, having travelled to various countries around the world, he decided to settle in Australia. He was then somewhat peripatetic as he was employed in the carnival industry. 

53Ultimately he, having commenced a relationship with SM, came to live in Coffs Harbour and prior to his arrest, was working for a security firm in Coffs Harbour on a regular basis and was also from time to time engaged in unskilled labouring positions. 

54The only other matter which the applicant had on his criminal history record was a minor motor vehicle offence in 2005 for which he had been convicted and fined. This was not suggested by the Crown to the sentencing judge as having any relevance to the sentencing hearing. 

Remarks on Sentence 

55In dealing with the first offence, the sentencing judge concluded that he needed to identify one of the episodes of sexual intercourse as being the act upon which the count was based. He chose the act of penile/vaginal intercourse which was the last in point of time and the one which immediately followed the victim saying to him, amongst other things, "" No, this is wrong. No means no Dan "". 

56His Honour described this as one of the more obvious and serious forms of sexual intercourse and expressed this conclusion with regard to the level of criminality involved: 

""It falls below the mid-range of seriousness apart from the fact that the following aggravating elements are present: that it was committed in the home of the victim"" (T6.1) 

57His Honour did not take into account, in forming this opinion, one element of the conduct namely that of an assault occasioning actual bodily harm because that conduct was to be found on the Form 1 which related to the second offence. 

58The finding made by the sentencing judge to which I have referred in [56] above, was made after receiving submissions from the applicant's counsel. There was no written or oral submission made by the Crown with respect to the assessment of the level of criminality which ought be found to exist in either of the two offences. 

59On the second offence, his Honour found that he was satisfied that the objective criminality reached the mid-range of seriousness. 

60The sentencing judge found that it was appropriate to give the applicant a 25 per cent discount for the utilitarian value of his early plea of guilty to all offences. 

61His Honour then turned to the subjective circumstances of the applicant. He found that the applicant had had a disadvantaged start in life. He found that it was a positive feature of his subjective history that he had always been fully employed and the absence of any criminal record entitled him to be considered as a person who was not of any "" ...particularly criminal intent or predilection "". 

62His Honour then recorded that the applicant had no psychological illness and accepted the submission of the applicant's counsel that 

""...having regard to his background, he has never really understood a relationship in which trust and gentleness predominate."" 

63The sentencing judge was persuaded that special circumstances applied to the sentences which he imposed. On the question of concurrence or accumulation, the learned sentencing judge said: 

""The two main offences are of course entirely discrete separated by a period of time. Mr Harrison argued for there being a high level of absorption of one into the other whereas the Crown position is as I understand it, there ought to be a greater level of accumulation. I think accumulation is the predominant element but that has required of course that I make some adjustment to the proportions of the second sentence ..."" 

64As noted earlier, the two non-parole periods were entirely accumulated although there was a concurrent period of nine months between the two sentences. 

65The sentence for the s 166 certificate matter of breaching the apprehended domestic violence order was ordered to be wholly concurrent with the sentence on the second offence. Little was said about this offence in the Judge's remarks on sentencing. 

Grounds of Appeal 

66Two grounds of appeal were relied upon by the applicant: 

""1. The overall sentence imposed was manifestly excessive due to his Honour's failure to consider the totality of the sentence imposed as a result of which the sentence for the second offence remained fully accumulated upon the first offence. 

2. His Honour failed to consider the principle of totality."" 

67These two grounds can conveniently be considered together because they address the same issue, namely whether, having regard to the appropriate sentences to be imposed for the individual offences, proper attention to the principle of totality in sentencing required a degree of concurrence greater than that which his Honour allowed. 

68In considering the principle of totality, it is appropriate to commence with Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610. In Pearce , McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said at [40]-[46]: 

""40. To the extent to which two offences of which an offender stands convicted contain common elements, it would be wrong to punish that offender twice for the commission of the elements that are common. No doubt that general principle must yield to any contrary legislative intention, but the punishment to be exacted should reflect what an offender has done; it should not be affected by the way in which the boundaries of particular offences are drawn. ... 

... 

45. ...A Judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality: Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59. 

46. Sentencing is not a process that leads to a single correct answer arrived at by some process admitting of mathematical precision. ... It is, then, all the more important that proper principle be applied throughout the process."" 

69The principle of totality was also discussed by this Court in R v AEM Snr [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [63]-[64]. At [70] in AEM Snr , this Court said: 

""The principle of totality can be simply stated. It requires that the effective sentence imposed upon an offender represent a proper period of incarceration for the total criminality involved."" 

70In considering questions of totality, it is necessary to keep in mind, the effect of the two additional offences which the sentencing judge was required to deal with by virtue of the Form 1 ""List of Additional Charges"" which the Court was asked to take into account pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Those two offences involved an assault occasioning actually bodily harm on 13 August 2008 and possession of a prescribed restricted substance on 19 October 2008. The applicant asked the Court to take those matters into account in respect of the second offence, namely the aggravated sexual assault offence. 

71The principles to be applied in taking a Form 1 offence into account can conveniently be found in two decisions of this Court. The first is R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371-372 where Hunt CJ at CL (Allen J and Loveday AJ agreeing) said: 

""The only limitation upon the penalty to be imposed when dealing with matters to be taken into account ... is ... that the penalty must not exceed the maximum penalty which the court would have been empowered to impose if no other offence had been taken into account... [However] it is wrong in principle that there should only ever be little by way of addition to the penalty imposed upon the offence charge when another offence is taken into account. ..."" 

72In R v Bavadra (2000) 115 A Crim R 152, Wood CJ at CL (Beazley JA and James J agreeing) said at 158: 

""When serious offences are included in a Form 1, the sentence imposed, in respect of the count for which they are taken into account, must reflect the totality of the criminal involvement. It is not the case that Form 1 offences need only be noted in passing, or that little by way of additional penalty should be imposed by reason of their existence ... 

There is a considerable advantage to the administration of justice, and to accused persons, for a party facing sentence to clean up the record. For that purpose the Form 1 procedure is beneficial. The objective of individual rehabilitation can be advanced by its use, since the offender does not face the prospect of further trials. There is a utilitarian value in the admission of guilt that is involved so far as there can be a saving of the resources of the law enforcement agencies and the courts concern. Additionally, the sentencing judge is placed in a position where it is possible to sentence the offender for the totality of his or her outstanding criminality to that point. However, unless proper weight is given to the additional offences that have been disclosed, this procedure fails its true purpose."" 

Decision 

73The applicant's submissions to this Court accept that the learned sentencing judge arrived at appropriate sentences for each individual offence. But they contend that he failed to assess the appropriateness of the total sentence. 

74Accordingly, the applicant does not seek to challenge the individual sentences imposed for both offences but rather submits that there should have been a far greater degree of concurrence. 

75The Crown does not take issue with the individual sentences imposed. It submits that the total sentence was within the sentencing judge's discretion. 

76In light of the applicant's limited approach to the appeal, this Court should proceed upon the basis that the two sentences imposed were appropriate, or at least within an appropriate range for the offences, and examine what the sentencing judge said and did about accumulation. 

77The entirety of the sentencing judge's remarks on this question are to be found in the passage set out above at [63]. His Honour recognised that there needed to be accumulation, which he regarded as the predominant element. He recorded that the Crown did not submit that the sentences should be totally accumulated. 

78In considering the identified passage in his Honour's judgment, it does appear that the only factor to which his Honour had regard was that the two principal offences were "" ...entirely discrete separated by a period of time "". 

79As the Crown most properly conceded during submissions to this Court, if that was the sole basis upon which the learned sentencing judge relied to determine concurrence or accumulation, then he fell into error. The Crown, however, argued that there were other matters which the learned sentencing judge took into account. In particular, the Crown noted that earlier in his judgment the learned sentencing judge had recorded that the second offence had occurred whilst the applicant was on conditional bail for the first offence. 

80The Crown submitted that this fact would merit a substantial degree of accumulation between the two offences. 

81The reference to the second offence being committed by the applicant whilst on bail for the first offence is to be found in that part of the Remarks on Sentence where his Honour was assessing the objective seriousness of the criminality involved in the second offence. I reject the Crown's submissions that this passage of the Remarks on Sentence was dealing with the concurrence/accumulation issue. Clearly, in assessing the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the learned sentencing judge took the matter into account. 

82He did not have regard to it again. I am thus satisfied that his Honour fell into error in determining the extent of concurrence and accumulation between the two sentences which he imposed, because he only took into account the fact that the offences were discrete and separated in point of time. More was required, as the Crown conceded. 

83The total non-parole period that this applicant was ordered to serve was seven years and nine months, that is, from 19 October 2008 to 18 July 2016. 

84Having regard to the fact that his Honour allowed 25 per cent discount because of the utilitarian value of the applicant's pleas of guilty, the sentence which the applicant received represented an undiscounted non-parole period of 10 years and four months. 

85Although the offences were eight weeks apart, there were significant elements of commonality in all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the offences which merited careful consideration on the issue of concurrence and accumulation in this case. 

86Of particular importance, was the nature of the relationship between the applicant and SM. The agreed facts noted these features about it: 

(a)The relationship had existed for about six years and was an ongoing one at the time of the first offence; 

(b)Both the applicant and SM had planned to marry about two weeks after the first offence; 

(c)Although that marriage did not take place, and notwithstanding the occurrence of the first offence, the applicant and SM had a number of discussions about their future together; 

(d)They continued to see each other in the period between the two offences and were sexually intimate on a number of occasions; 

(e)As the agreed facts recorded, the applicant and SM, in the period between the two offences, 

""...saw each other on numerous occasions, for reasons including access to the children, supply of general items to the children, friendship and intimacy"". 

87As well, the nature of the offences, the nature of the conduct involved and the circumstances in which they occurred, all warranted the sentences being made concurrent to a degree far greater than that which the sentencing judge did. 

88The applicant's subjective case which the sentencing judge assessed as strong, also warranted a greater degree of concurrence. 

89In those circumstances I am satisfied that there should have been a real period of concurrence in the non-parole periods to which the applicant was sentenced. Without that, the effect of the sentences was manifestly excessive. 

90In my opinion error is demonstrated. 

Further evidence 

91The applicant filed an affidavit upon which he relied in the event that his application for leave was granted and his appeal was upheld. 

92The affidavit indicated that the applicant has undergone some courses in education during his period of custody, that he has been a regular attendee at Bible study groups which he proposes to continue after his release. He has a supportive sister and brother-in-law and that upon release he has been offered a job with his brother-in-law. 

93Of particular importance to the applicant were the changed circumstances of his daughters who had formerly been in the care of his partner, the victim of these assaults. Of that position he says: 

""3. I suffered a great deal of stress over the care of my daughters. The Department of Community Services (DOCS) removed them from their mother's care as she was unable to look after them. I had to arrange for DOCS to rehouse them with their maternal grandparents. This is not very satisfactory as they both suffer from poor health and it is difficult for them to look after two small girls. 

4. I get to speak to my daughters every two weeks by telephone. I do not get to see them very often because Junee is too far away from where they live in Coffs Harbour. 

5. I have been told I can't apply to be moved to a gaol closer to where my daughters live until I am reclassified. "" 

94The applicant's daughters would now be aged seven and three. 

95Special circumstances were found to exist by the learned sentencing judge. That was clearly correct. Those circumstances justify an alteration to the statutory ratio fixed by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

96Given the fact that there was significant commonality to be found in the underlying facts and circumstances of these two offences, albeit, that they were separated by about two months, there ought to be a real period of concurrence to reflect the need for attention to the principle of totality. 

97I am satisfied that the commencement date for the sentence for the second offence of aggravated sexual assault should have been 19 July 2009 rather than 19 January 2011. The effect of this adjustment is that instead of accumulation being only nine months, which represented the balance of term on first offence, there will be a period of concurrence for all but nine months of the sentence on the first count. 

98The first available date for release parole will now not be 18 July 2016, but will be 18 January 2015. By that stage the applicant will have spent six years and three months in custody for the two offences. I am satisfied that this is an appropriate period for him to spend in custody to represent the total criminality involved. 

99In light of this conclusion, there is no need to amend the date of the sentence on the third offence which was brought forward on the s 166 Certificate. 

Orders 
100I propose the following orders: 

1. Leave to appeal granted. 
2. Sentence of Freeman DCJ in the District Court of New South Wales on 27 April 2010 be quashed. 
3. In lieu thereof impose the following as sentences: 

a) Count 1: Sexual Assault contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act , Dan Hendricks is sentenced to a non-parole period of two years and three months commencing on 19 October 2008 and concluding on 18 January 2011. He is sentenced to a balance of term of nine months, which will conclude on 17 October 2011. 

b) Count 2: Aggravated Sexual Assault contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act and taking into account the offences on the Form 1, Dan Hendricks is sentenced to a non-parole period of five and a half years to commence on 19 July 2009 and conclude on 18 January 2015. He is sentenced to a balance of term of three and a half years, which is to conclude on 17 July 2018. 

c) I confirm the sentence with respect to the offence of breaching an Apprehended Violence Order on the s 166 Certificate of a fixed term of imprisonment for twelve months to commence on 19 January 2011 and conclude on 18 January 2012. 

d) The first date upon which Mr Hendricks can be released on parole is 18 January 2015.

		30 September 2011",2011-09-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2709215,State of New South Wales v Reed [2012] NSWSC 308,"Judgment

Introduction

1The State of New South Wales applied for an extended supervision order in respect of the defendant under s 9(1) of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (the Act) for a period of four years. The original Summons was filed in the Court on 30 May 2011 and after several amendments now takes the form of a Further Amended Summons filed in Court with leave on 5 September 2011. At preliminary hearing of the application before McCallum J on 23 June 2011 in accordance with s 7(3) of the Act her Honour made orders under s 7(4) ""appointing two experts to conduct psychiatric examinations of the defendant and furnish reports of those examinations to the Court."" 

2At the time of the hearing before me the defendant was on parole, having been sentenced by the District Court on 8 May 2007 to 5 years imprisonment commencing on 12 September 2006 and concluding on 11 September 2011 with a non-parole period of 3 years on one count of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900. 

3On 9 September 2011 I made the extended supervision order, although only for three years, in respect of the defendant, who did not oppose it. There was some controversy about some of the conditions sought by the plaintiff, which was resolved after discussion sufficiently appearing in the transcript. Although, in effect, the defendant consented to the supervision order, the Court itself is required to consider certain matters specified in the Act and be independently satisfied that the statutory requirements are met. I was so satisfied after perusing the material tendered in the proceedings and, hence, decided that the order should be made. Having regard to the timeframe, it was not possible to provide reasons at the time and I informed the parties that I would do so in due course. These are those reasons. 

The statutory criteria

4Section 9(2) of the Act prescribes the test which must be applied by this Court when determining whether or not to make a an extended supervision order under s9(1)(a). Section 9(3) lists the matters which the Court must consider in determining whether or not to make an extended supervision order. Accordingly, before considering whether to make the application it is necessary to have regard to criteria established in s9(3).

Section 9(3) criteria

5The following are relevant in the defendant's case. 

Section 9(3)(h) - criminal history 

6 On 10 May 1988 the defendant was sentenced in the District Court to an effective term of 16 years imprisonment commencing on 18 October 1987 with a non-parole period of 7½ years in respect of eight counts, comprising four counts of sexual intercourse without consent in respect of two separate victims, two of break and enter with intent to commit a felony, one of malicious wounding and one of armed robbery, committed against female victims on 28 June, 7 July and 6 October 1987. On 15 September 1995 the defendant was sentenced to a further aggregate term of imprisonment of nine years commencing on 28 February 1995, with a fixed term of 3 years concluding on 27 February 1998 in respect of one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and a minimum term of six years on each of three counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent to be served concurrently and an additional term of three years commencing on 28 February 2001. On 8 May 2007 the defendant was sentenced to a further term of five years imprisonment, backdated to commence on 12 September 2006, with a non-parole period of three years on one count of sexual intercourse without consent. All told, the defendant has been convicted of, inter alia, 5 counts of sexual intercourse without consent and 3 counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent against 4 female victims committed between June 1987 and August 2005. The defendant entered pleas of guilty to all of the offences for which he was sentenced. 

7Brief details of the offences for which the defendant has been sentenced are as follows. While a private soldier in the Australian Army and living at the East Hills army barracks, the defendant, then aged 22, drove to the female army personnel barracks at Moorebank in the early hours of the morning of 28 June 1987 having consumed a quantity of wine. He gained access to the room occupied by a 21 year old female who was asleep. He covered her mouth with his hand and placed a knife against her throat. She woke and, in trying to push the knife, away cut her thumb. The defendant threatened her with the knife and thereafter forced her to engage first in oral and then vaginal intercourse, finally binding her wrists and ankles with electrical tape he had brought with him. 

8In the early hours of 7 July 1987 the defendant, after having consumed a quantity of beer and smoked marijuana, returned to the female barracks at Moorebank and, in possession of a knife, gained access to the room of a 21 year old female. The victim, who woke to find the defendant sitting on her bed, pushed out at the defendant and cut herself. After a brief exchange in which the defendant said to the victim ""I am going to undress"", he touched the victim's vaginal area and the two struggled, the victim attempting to knee the defendant in the groin. During the struggle the two fell to the floor and the victim screamed, alerting another soldier who entered the room. As she did so, the defendant regained his footing and ran past her, subsequently cutting her arm when both women sought to restrain the defendant. 

9On the morning of 6 October 1987 the defendant drove to Kings Cross and engaged the services of a female prostitute aged 17 years. The defendant drove her to a location in Potts Point where he produced a knife and demanded that she perform oral intercourse upon him, which she did. At the direction of the defendant, who was still holding the knife, she subsequently undressed and the defendant had vaginal intercourse with her. He then demanded money and, upon receiving forty dollars, he threw all of her clothing from the car, excepting a grey leather coat which she was wearing, ejected her from the car and drove off. 

10Whilst at liberty on parole for the offences committed in 1987 the defendant, early on the morning of 28 February 1995, approached a 34-year-old female prostitute on Canterbury Road and offered her money in exchange for sex. She entered the defendant's car and the pair drove to an industrial estate in Riverwood where he produced a knife and stabbed the victim, resulting in a small cut to her right hand. The defendant threatened her with the knife and directed her to undress and perform oral sex on him. The defendant digitally penetrated the victim's vagina and had penile intercourse with her, after which she managed to escape from his car and flag down a police vehicle which pursued the defendant. He was arrested a short time later.

11Early on the morning of 21 August 2005, some 18 months after the expiration of his sentence for the offences committed in 1995, the defendant stopped his vehicle next to the victim, a 20 year old female who was working as a prostitute, and offered her a lift, which she accepted. Whilst en route the victim agreed to have sex with the defendant for $70 and she directed him to a factory car park where, after placing a condom on the defendant's penis, she performed oral sex. The pair then attempted to have consensual penile vaginal intercourse, however the victim was unable to relax. The defendant then removed the condom despite objections. The victim's offer to return the money was rejected by the defendant, who then had penile vaginal intercourse with the victim and ejaculated. He unlocked the car doors, she alighted and he drove off. The victim flagged down a police vehicle and was taken to a nearby hospital where she was examined. The semen tested matched the defendant's DNA. 

Section 9(3)(h1) - views of the sentencing court

12 In sentencing the defendant in respect of his last conviction, Flannery DCJ said ""[i]t is clear from the [defendant's] criminal history that he has a serious psycho-sexual problem. He has been incarcerated as a result of it for approximately seventeen out of the last twenty years."" Her Honour went on to say - 

It appears that, although the [defendant] was eligible for release at the expiration of his six year minimum term in respect of the 1995 matters, he was not in fact released until after he had served the total sentence of nine years. The result was that he had no supervision at all after what was effectively a seventeen year sentence. One cannot help but think if he had been supervised, we might not be here today.


Section 9(3)(f) - compliance with obligations while on parole 

13The defendant committed the offences on 28 February 1995, some two years and nine months prior to the expiry of his parole order on 15 November 1995, having been released on parole on 16 July 1992 in respect of the sentences imposed in May 1988. 

Section 9(3)(e) - previous treatment or rehabilitation programs 

14A Department of Corrective Services Risk Assessment Report dated 7 April 2011 (DCS Report) lists the defendant's history of psychological treatment and involvement in rehabilitation programs. While in custody in 1992 the defendant participated in eight individual sessions with a Department of Corrective Services psychologist regarding his sexual offences. Between 1996 and 1998 he participated in individual sessions with two Departmental psychologists. The risk assessment report indicates that these sessions were directed to addressing ""victim empathy and understanding of offending.""

15Between December 1998 and 16 February 1999 the defendant attended 12 sessions of the Sex offender Psycho-Education program (SOPE). SOPE is not considered a treatment program as it was designed to prepare offenders for undertaking therapeutic programs such as the CUBIT. The defendant participated in CUBIT between February 1999 and February 2000. The report on his progress found that - 

""[w]hile [the defendant] has taken responsibility for his sexual offending behaviour, recognised the elements that led to his decision to offend and made improvements in expressing his feeling and dealing with them, he still needs to devote effort to managing uncomfortable emotional states by himself...[the defendant] also needs to work on challenging his distorted views about relationships and associated self-esteem issues."" 

The report also found that his ""risk of sexual reoffending is in the high range"" and that his ""risk for sexual recidivism is still viewed as high.""

16Between March and July 2000 the defendant participated in the maintenance program for sex offenders while at the Kirkconnell Correctional Centre, the purpose of which was to ""help the [defendant] maintain and consolidate the treatment gains...made in CUBIT"". A report prepared by the Clinical Co-ordinator found that, despite undertaking the program the defendant ""failed to address the issues raised in [the CUBIT] report as requiring further work ... [and concludes] that the his ""risk of reoffending remains high ... [and] could not be managed in the community"".

17The defendant undertook CUBIT between 20 March and 19 November 2009 for a second time while in custody for the offence for which he was sentenced on 8 May 2007. His participation in the program was described as ""varied"", fluctuating between appearing ""motivated to engage in treatment"" and ""when experiencing negative mood states...[appearing]...to experience difficulty challenging these unhelpful thoughts and participating in group processes."" The defendant ""acknowledged and took responsibility for his sexual offences and attempted to explore issues directly relevant to his offending including deviant sexual fantasies and negative attitudes towards women"" however ""[i]t appeared that [he] experienced difficulty identifying personal decisions in his life that contributed to his unhealthy lifestyle and his current offences and, at times, externalised blame for problematic behaviours and life stressors."" The report concluded (inter alia) that the defendant's ""level of understanding of the nature of his offending was sound, as evidenced by his ability to identify the salient factors contributing to his sexual offending behaviour"" although ""at times, [he] appeared to continue experiencing some difficulties intervening in problem behaviours..."" and that he ""should be encouraged to maintain contact with his family, engage in open communication and explore appropriate avenues in which he can develop prosocial adult friendships"".

18Following his completion of CUBIT the defendant participated in the Custodial Maintenance Program between December 2009 and September 2010 and then, commencing in November 2010, the Community Maintenance program which he commenced in November 2010. The case notes indicated that he ""has participated adequately in group"". He denied the ongoing experience of deviant sexual thoughts, but volunteered that his main current risk factors were ""bottling up his emotions"" and ""not talking about issues ... However, there is a lack of depth in [his] participation and he will be encouraged to provide more open insight into his inner thoughts as he adjusts to the new group"".

Section 9(3)(b) - reports from court-appointed psychiatrists 

19On 23 June 2011 MaCallum J made orders appointing Dr Samson Roberts and Dr Andrew Ellis, Forensic Psychiatrists, to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the defendant pursuant to s 7(4) of the Act. They interviewed the defendant on 15 July and 1 August 2011 and produced reports dated 5 and 6 August 2011 respectively, which were tendered before me. In order to avoid unnecessary repetition it is convenient to briefly summarise the factual and historical information provided by both doctors, identifying any material divergences, and then discuss their individual findings. 

20At the time of the interviews, the defendant was 46 years of age, single, unemployed and receiving social security payments. He resided at a Community Offender Support Program Facility in Western Sydney and is subject to electronic and GPS monitoring. He grew up in Newcastle as the eldest of three children and, upon completing his High School Certificate, undertook an apprenticeship in pattern making which he completed. He was unable to find work, was employed as a paper salesman and joined the Army Reserve before enlisting in the Army at age 22. The descriptions offered to both doctors concerning his childhood were consistent. He described his mother as ""pretty strict"" and ""authoritarian"" (giving examples of her extreme and humiliating treatment of him) and his father as ""a quiet distant man"" and his relationship with both as being ""distant"". Both doctors noted that while the defendant denied being the subject of sexual abuse as a child he had previously disclosed being sexually abused by his father. 

21The accounts given to both doctors do not disclose any illicit drug or alcohol dependency, recording that, despite drinking heavily in his early twenties and experimenting with cannabis and speed, he is abstinent from both alcohol and illicit drugs. 

22The defendant gave consistent histories about his early sexual experiences. While he has had a number of sexual partners, Dr Roberts noted that the longest sexual relationship lasted a period of 2 years. Dr Roberts also noted that in respect of his consensual sexual relationships the defendant ""stated that there was no violence involved nor did he consider that there was any sexual conduct of an aberrant nature"". 

23He has a history of depression, which he informed Dr Roberts he first experienced in his early teens, although he was not diagnosed as suffering from the illness until 1995. Between 1987 and 1995 he made a number of attempts at suicide. Between 1995 and 2003 he was prescribed medication for his depression, which Dr Roberts noted was effective in stabilising his mood. Despite being weened off this medication in 2003 the defendant has recommenced taking antidepressant medication as prescribed by his general practitioner and is content with the treatment of his ""depressive condition"". The defendant is also currently taking a number of other medications including Androcur, an antilibidinal medication. The defendant suffers from a number of minor medical conditions for which he is being treated or partially treated. He has reported side effects from the Androcur. 

Findings of Dr Ellis

24Dr Ellis conducted a mental state examination on the defendant. He expressed the view that the defendant satisfied the individual diagnostic criteria for the paraphilia sexual sadism, citing ""a decades long history of sexual urges, fantasy and masturbation to topics of physical and psychological pain or humiliation of others"". He also expressed the view that the defendant would satisfy the criteria for a major depressive and avoidant personality disorders, the former being characterised by ""disturbance of sleep, appetite, energy, concentration, a low mood and typical depressive cognitions"", matters which he said were ""exacerbated by his stressful current predicament"". Dr Ellis noted that at present he is ""subject to stress of public exposure, loss of his job and partner"" and that his ""current circumstances limit his ability to function over and above his personality difficulties. He has difficulty forming and maintaining relationships, and sustaining work or study"".

25Using the Static-99R instrument for assessment of risk, Dr Ellis found the defendant to be ""in the high risk category relative to other male sexual offenders...the rates of sexual recidivism for sexual offenders within the normative samples who had the same total score as [the defendant] were between 14.7-31.2 percent over five years, and 27.6-41.9 percent over ten years. The recidivism rate of individuals convicted/charged with sexual offences with the same score as [the defendant] would be expected to be 2.91 times higher than the ""typical sexual offender"". In addition, he noted that the STATIC-99R ""takes into account the research showing low rates of sexual recidivism for persons over the age of 40. This research reflects the general decrease in aggression and sexual arousal with age, and the general maturing of personality"", concluding that the defendant ""has yet to demonstrate that there has been a decrease in these factors in his personal case, although I note he has not had a significant opportunity to do so, being incarcerated and under supervision"". 

26 So far as any personality factors are concerned, Dr Ellis observed that the defendant had not been diagnosed with an antisocial personality disorder but that he presented with ""personality dysfunction, in terms of an avoidant personality style"" and that while this may interfere with the treatment of the defendant, it is ""not as likely ... as if any antisocial orientation [were] present."" 

27Dr Ellis noted that the defendant has shown a ""propensity"" to mood instability, in particular depressed mood and that relapses to depressed mood have been ""associated with the disinhibition of [the defendant's] sexually deviant urges."" He also noted that substance use had figured in the defendants offending, although more so in earlier offences, and that while substance abuse is not a major factor in re-offending, it ""serves to disinhibit underlying sexual impulses"". In so far as treatment of the defendant is concerned, Dr Ellis stated: 

""[the defendant] has been recorded as improving in his understanding of behaviour by his treating clinicians, but has been regarded as displaying only an intellectual understanding and requiring further intervention...

At this assessment he displayed minimization of personal responsibility for offences, and a desire to avoid scrutiny contrasting with emphatic statements that he would not reoffend. This may be due to ingrained beliefs and attitudes resulting from his sexual arousal pattern, or an inflexible personality style. These attitudes could contribute to ongoing risk by influencing behaviour in at risk situations, (sic) by interfering with treatment progress.""

28Dr Ellis added - 

""In considering actuarial and clinical parameters in the absence of any treatment or supervision, [the defendant] would fall into a group of persons with a risk of reoffending that is high, and greater than a theoretical average offender. Treatment and supervision would likely reduce this risk.""

Findings of Dr Roberts

29Dr Roberts, consistently with Dr Ellis, found that the defendant meets the DSM-IV TR diagnostic criteria for sexual sadism and a major depressive disorder. He said that the defendant's sexual sadism was ""characterised by recurrent sexual arousal in the context of fantasies and acts of violence"" and that it can be ""moderated through treatment"". Dr Roberts concluded that the Static-99R has been ""moderated"" by steps undertaken by the defendant which indicate that the he has ""developed an insight into risk factors associated with his offending behaviour"". Dr Roberts identified those factors as including the defendant's seeking antilibidinal treatment, participation in psychological treatment, gaining full time employment (a matter which appears to be inconsistent with the information provided to Dr Ellis), continuing abstinence from alcohol and illicit drug use and participation in sex offender programs. Dr Roberts therefore concluded that ""[the defendant] represents a person of moderate risk of committing a further serious sex offence in the event that he is not subject to an Extended Supervision Order of the nature proposed.""

Section 9(3)(c) and (i) - assessment as to likelihood of the defendant committing further serious sex offences

30In addition to the reports of Dr Ellis and Dr Roberts, I have before me the DCS Report prepared by Mr Sheehan, psychologist.

31The Report includes an assessment of the defendant's risk of re-offending. In assessing the defendant Mr Sheehan measured static and dynamic risk factors to conclude that ""[t]he overall totality of evidence suggests that [the defendant] remains in the high risk category of sexual offending relative to other adult male offenders"". While noting the limitations in the predictive reliability of the Static-99R and like systems Mr Sheehan concluded that the defendant's score of 6 on the applicable range placed him ""in the high risk category relative to other male sexual offenders"".

32A number of other psychologists who have made assessments of the defendant have referred, in different ways, to the high risk of reoffending presented by the defendant.

33As mentioned above, the defendant has been taking Androcur medication. He commenced in custody and has continued daily while on parole.

34As has been mentioned when dealing with the circumstances of the offences, there is some, though weak, evidence that alcohol was relevant. I note that Dr Roberts supports a condition recommending abstinence from alcoohol and illicit drugs, given their disinhibiting effect. 

Section 9(3)(a) - safety of the community

The defendant has a history of sexual assaults associated with deliberate sadistic violence. In all but the last occasion, the defendant used a knife to force his victim to submit. Some offences were planned to a greater or lesser extent. The last offence appears to have been spontaneous. His psychological makeup plainly disposes him to commit these offences and makes him a real danger if he is not closely supervised. He has complied with his parole conditions, which are similar to those presently proposed for continuing supervision. 

Conclusion 

35Under s 9(1) of the Act, the court is empowered to determine an application for an extended supervision order by either making an order or dismissing the application. Independently of the consent of the defendant, I am satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if ""he... is not kept under supervision"". The defendant disputed the necessity for some of the orders proposed by the applicant. I have made some minor adjustments to the language to give greater specificity. Otherwise, except as to the period of supervision, the orders are as sought. 

36The applicant sought four year's supervision. It is self evident that the time which is needed before supervision can be relaxed or even ended is unknown but must be significant. There is no real basis for assessing what this period will be as a matter of reason based on evidence. I would accept that there is every likelihood that it will be at least four years. However, having regard to the serious character of a supervision order and the extent to which its terms impinge on the defendant's right to be at liberty, it seems to me that the Court's supervisory function requires the matter to be returned to the Court on the expiration of three years for a fresh consideration to be given to continuing or varying the order. I am aware, of course, that the defendant can apply for a variation or even termination of the order at any time. Moreover, regular reports of his functioning and progress are required to be made. At the same time, this process cannot be allowed to assume the appearance of a bureaucratic exercise. Interference with liberty is a very serious matter and, fundamentally, a matter for the independent courts to determine. To my mind, this principle is best vindicated - where the question of the necessity for the order is at all events essentially speculative - by requiring the applicant to justify continuance of the order to a Court after three years has elapsed.

		10 April 2012",2011-09-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709219,State of New South Wales v Scerri [2012] NSWSC 271,"Judgment
Background
1On 9 September 2011 I made an extended supervision order under s 9(1) of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (unless otherwise specified, all legislative references are to this Act) in respect of Mark Anthony Scerri for a period of 3 years commencing on that date.  The order was made by consent, with the exception that the Plaintiff submitted that the order should persist for five years rather than the three years for which the defendant contended.  Although the application was not, in substance, disputed, it seemed to me that I should read the material tendered without objection on the application and form my own view as to the material matters.  At the time, I gave brief reasons why I thought it was appropriate to make the order and said that more detailed reasons would be provided in due course.  The following are those reasons.
Introduction
2The State of New South Wales applied for an extended supervision order for a period of 5 years pursuant to the Act in respect of the defendant.  The original summons was filed in the Court on 6 June 2011 and amended on a number of occasions, ultimately an amended summons was filed in court with leave on 8 September.  A preliminary hearing of the application took place before Hoeben J on 1 July 2011 in accordance with s 7(3).  His Honour made orders under s 7(4) appointing Dr Samuels and Dr O'Dea to prepare psychiatric reports for the Court.  
3At the time of the hearing before me the defendant was on parole, having been sentenced by the District Court on 12 September 2003 on one count of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 to eight years imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years commencing on 12 September 2003 and a balance of term of two years expiring on 11 September 2011. 
4There was no contention by the defendant that the preliminary requirements of s 6 had not been satisfied.  
The statutory criteria
5Section 9(2) prescribes the relevant test which is to be applied when determining whether or not to make an extended supervision order under s 9(1)(a).  Section 9(3) catalogues the matters to be considered in this respect.   These are dealt with in the following paragraphs.   
Section 9(3)(h) - criminal history 
6The defendant was born on 18 October 1964.  His lengthy criminal record is characterised primarily by sexual, personal violence and driving offences.  On 26 September 1989 the defendant was charged with a number of personal violence and sex offences committed between June and September that year against three male victims in the Wollongong area.  In late 1992, he was tried and convicted in this Court of five counts of sexual intercourse without consent contrary s 61D of the Crimes Act 1900, one count of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse contrary to s 61C and one count of stealing from the person contrary to s 94.  James J sentenced the defendant to an aggregate sentence of 16 years imprisonment comprising a minimum term of 12 years commencing on 26 September 1989 with an additional term of 4 years.  The defendant was released to parole on 24 November 2001.  
7On 16 October 2002 the defendant was charged with (inter alia) one count of sexual intercourse without consent in respect of one victim on 12 May 2002.  The defendant pleaded guilty in the Local Court on 26 February 2003 and was subsequently sentenced by Phelan DCJ in the District Court on 12 September 2003, a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm being taken into account on a Form 1.  The defendant was sentenced to an effective term of eight years to commence on 12 September 2003, with a non-parole period of six years.  Despite being eligible for parole on 11 September 2009, the defendant was not released to parole until 10 February 2011.
8The details of the offences for which the defendant has been sentenced can be outlined briefly and are taken from the remarks on sentence made by the sentencing judges.  At approximately three o'clock on the morning of Sunday 11 June 1989 PSM, a male aged 21 years at the time, was walking along a street in Wollongong when he was grabbed by the defendant from behind and knocked over a small boundary fence into vacant property.  The defendant threatened to injure PSM unless he did as he was told.  The defendant pushed him into a shed on the property, pulled PSM's pants down, told him to lie on the ground on his stomach and unsuccessfully attempted anal intercourse.  (This was not the subject of a count on the indictment and the defendant was not sentenced for the offence.)  The defendant then rolled PSM onto his side and fellated him.  After some time, the defendant told PSM to turn towards the wall of the shed and threatened to kill or hit PSM or kill members of his family if he did not do as he was told.  He then had anal intercourse with PSM and ejaculated.  After this assault, the defendant left the shed, telling PSM to remain there.  Several hours passed before PSM reported the offences to the police as he feared that the defendant might kill him or members of his family.  
9Shortly after 2am on 25 June 1989 DWL, a male then aged 22 years, was walking home, having visited a number of nightclubs in Wollongong.   He encountered the defendant who tackled him from behind and hit him three or four times on the back of the head using a rock, causing heavy bleeding.  The defendant pushed DWL into a toilet block and the defendant told DWL to ""shut up and keep your head down"" and take his pants down.  The defendant fellated DWL.  The defendant then directed DWL to get down on his knees and put his chest on the ground and, when he did so, had anal intercourse with him for about five minutes.  The defendant and DWL remained in the toilet block for some time, both falling asleep.  DWL, who continued to bleed from the injuries sustained to his head and who had drunk a large amount of alcohol earlier in the evening, did not move for fear of waking the defendant.  The defendant returned DWL's wallet, having taken it from him when the pair entered the toilet block after removing $20 in cash.  The defendant left the toilet block.  DWL left shortly thereafter and walked across the park and waved down a passing motorist who drove him to the hospital. 
10 In the early hours of the morning of 22 September 1989, heavily affected by alcohol, AEC left a nightclub in Wollongong.  Having refused an offer by the doorman of the club to call him a taxi, AEC remained at the door of the club where he encountered the defendant.  The pair commenced to walk away from the club together.  As they passed a vacant block the defendant punched AEC several times on the nose, ultimately breaking it.  The defendant then struck AEC several times on the side and back of his head with a rock.  He then removed AEC's pants and while AEC was on his hands and knees commenced to have anal intercourse with AEC during the course of which he told the victim to keep quiet or he would keep bashing him.  When he had finished, the defendant left the area and AEC wandered around the site bleeding profusely, ultimately making his way to the Wollongong police station a few hundred metres away.  AEC suffered serious physical injuries amounting to grievous bodily harm.
11At approximately 5am on 12 May 2002 JS, a male aged 26 years at the time, left a licensed premises in Wollongong to return home.  While walking he was grabbed from behind by the defendant who placed him in a ""strangle hold"" and forced him into an isolated grassed area near the platform of Wollongong railway station.  While sitting on JS's torso the defendant undid JS's jeans and pushed them down to his knees.  The defendant then punched JS, who was struggling and screaming for help, to the face and fellated him.  The defendant punched him to the face again.  At some point during the assault, JS gouged the defendant's eyes with his hands and the defendant eventually let go.  He stood up and JS fled the scene, making his way to the Wollongong police station where he reported the attack. He also suffered serious injuries, spending a week in hospital and needing some forty stitches for his head wound. The defendant was on parole for the offences committed in 1989 at the time of this offence, having been released to parole on 24 November 2001, some six months earlier. 
Section 9(3)(h1) - views of the sentencing court at the time of sentencing the defendant 
12James J noted the claim of the defendant that he only had homosexual urges when he was ""totally"" drunk and observed that there was little to suggest that he was in this state when he attacked his victims.  He considered that the assaults were all objectively very serious and the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon AEC with intent to have sexual intercourse with him was ""close to being an example of the worst class of case"".  The defendant's last conviction for a sexual offence was in the District Court on 12 September 2003 before Phelan DCJ in respect of the offence committed against JS on 12 May 2002.  His Honour referred to the report of Dr Greenberg which stated, in short, that the defendant had disclosed that he was sexually aroused by the violence and humiliation inflicted on his victims.  In sentencing the defendant, his Honour noted the ""remarkable similar[ity]"" between the offence committed against JS and those committed in 1989.  His Honour said - 
""The matters which render this particular charge serious refers specifically to the earlier charges of almost identical kind.  The fact that he has undergone substantial rehabilitation but, despite clear warnings, particularly those related to alcohol, in the end result he ignored them to his own cost and that of the innocent victim.
The offence was committed whilst on parole after he had spent a very long period in gaol.""  
Section 9(3)(f) - compliance with obligations while on parole or earlier extended supervision order
13The defendant committed the offences against JS on 12 May 2002, some six months after having been released on parole on 24 November 2001 for the offences committed in 1989.  The Parole Board on 31 October 2002 revoked his parole order.  He committed the offence whilst he had been attending weekly FPS psychological maintenance sessions.  The commission of the offence certainly ""[suggested] some difficulty being open with staff and working through any risk situations effectively"" as submitted  by the CUBIT Treatment Report of 21 April 2010. 
14On 10 February 2011 the defendant was released on parole and taken to reside at Nunyara COSP Centre.  He is being case managed and supervised by the Community Compliance and Monitoring Group (CCMG).  His parole conditions subject him to electronic monitoring and scheduling obligations.
15The defendant has not previously been subject to an extended supervision order.
Section 9(3)(g) - compliance with reporting obligations under Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004
16There is no evidence that the defendant was subject to any reporting obligations under such legislation and it is therefore unnecessary to consider this matter.
Section 9(3)(e) - previous treatment or rehabilitation programs
17Whilst serving the sentences imposed by James J on 19 February 1993, the defendant participated in the Sex Offender Psycho-educational Group Program (SOPE) for two months at the end of 1999.   SOPE is described as an educational group which aims to assist offenders to overcome common misunderstandings about sexually abusing behaviours, to challenge their thinking errors and to motivate them to enter treatment.  He was also counselled by Mr Graham Rendell fortnightly for about a year prior to undertaking CUBIT the first time.  Mr Rendell described the defendant as ""having made significant gains in addressing those issues contributing to his offending"".  From 21 January to 2 November 2001, the defendant undertook the high intensity CUBIT program, which was the subject of a Final Treatment Report on 6 November 2001.  Overall his participation was regarded as satisfactory or better.  However, he failed to complete the sexual self-regulation component and it was recommended that he participate in the maintenance program whether in custody or the community.  Having regard to static and dynamic risk factors, the Report recorded an overall risk of sexual recidivism as ""moderate"".
18On release the defendant attended the Community Maintenance Program weekly except for three sessions.  Mr Rendell was again his therapist and reported on 6 November 2002 in generally positive terms.
19When imprisoned for the last offence, the defendant again undertook the CUBIT program from 23 April 2009 to March 2010, having previously participated in a Custodial Maintenance program.  In the Treatment Report of 21 April 2010 it was said that his participation was positive but a number of ""challenges"" were noted and it was recommended that he undertake a community-based maintenance program until parole was granted and, when released, continue that participation.  Continued psychological work required attention to a number of identified matters, which it is not necessary to detail.  However, they are significant matters that certainly need some resolution to reduce the risk of recidivism.  The Treatment Report expressed concerns about the ability of the defendant to comply with supervision requirements and stated - 
Mr Scerri has a tendency to behave in a compliant manner and can appear to be managing well even at times of extreme distress ... At such times Mr Scerri appears able to detach from his emotional experience and suppress his needs and emotions.  These needs then buid up and are more explosively expressed at a later point.
Following completion of the CUBIT program in March 2010, the defendant attended Custodial Management sessions until his release on parole in February 2011.  He then commenced weekly attendance at the Community Maintenance programme at FPS from 3 May 2011. 
Psychiatric Diagnosis: s 9(3)(c) and (i)
20In a report of 3 September 2003, Professor Greenberg diagnosed the defendant as having a sexually sadistic (paraphilic) disorder as defined in DSM-IV of a chronic and severe nature.  Dr Greenberg explained the term, in substance as a sexually deviant disorder in which the person ""derives sexual excitement from the psychological or physical suffering of the victim"".  I interpolate that, though described as a ""disorder"", I do not infer from the psychiatric or psychological material tendered in this case, that it can or indeed ought to be understood in any sense as an illness.  Of concern is Dr Greenberg's opinion that the disorder is ""chronic and should be regarded as a severe disorder in view of his criminal sexual activity"".
21Professor Greenberg also diagnosed alcohol abuse dependence, a history of PTSD and a dysthymic disorder.
22In a report of 24 August 2010, Dr Sinclair came to the same conclusion as Dr Greenberg about the defendant's condition and added that she thought ""his risk of re-offending to be extremely high"".  Accordingly, further reports on his progress were needed within 6 months.
23In a psychiatric report of 5 October 2010, Dr Jonathon Adams noted that the history given by the defendant about the circumstances of his sexual arousal differed significantly to that given earlier to Dr Greenberg and noted in the CUBIT Treatment Report of 21 April 2010.  In short, they tended to minimise the extent and occasions of arousal.  This is a troubling feature that underlines the need for caution in too readily accepting that the various interventions permit optimism about the risk of recidivism, although I would accept that there has been significant improvement.
24I mention the reports of Dr Samuels and Dr O'Dea but they are largely along the same lines as those I have already mentioned and do not call for further discussion. 
Abuse of alcohol: s 9(3)(i)
25The defendant has a long history of abusing alcohol, probably starting in his early teens.  However, as follows from the comments of James J, the actual role that alcohol played in the applicant's offences may well have been exaggerated by him.  Even so, alcohol is typically a disinhibitor - Dr Greenberg thought that it was imperative that the defendant remain abstinent of alcohol and illicit substances for the remainder of his life.  Drs Samuels and O'Dea also recommend abstinence.
Risk assessment (other than court-appointed psychiatrists): s 9(3)(c) and (d)
26I have already mentioned the assessment of Dr Greenberg in his report of 3 September 2003.  In Dr Sinclair's report of 24 August 2010 she desribed the defendant as having an ""extremely high"" risk of re-offending.  Ms Sutton, senior specialist psychologist with Corrective Services NSW carried out a psychological risk assessment by reference both to actuarial risk assessment (STATIC-99R) and dynamic risk factors.  On the former scale his score was 9, placing him in the high risk category relative to other adult male sex offenders.  She noted that the rates of recidivism for sexual offences within the normative samples with the same score as the defendant were ""between 29.5% and 52.4% over five years and 53.1% and 61.9% over ten years"".  In terms of relative risk, sexual offenders with a score of 9 showed 6.48 times than the recidivism rate of a ""typical"" sex offender.
27As is widely conceded, the STATIC-99R assessment has significant inherent limitations and must be treated with considerable caution.  It is important to consider also the dynamic risk factors.  Ms Sutton used the Risk of Sexual Violence Protocol (RSVP) for this assessment.  Overall, she concluded that the defendant still had a moderate to high level of risk for sexual offending with risk factors present in each of the five marking sub-categories.  So far a stable dynamic risk factors were concerned, Ms Sutton identified access to potential victims, hostility, use of alcohol, emotional collapse, collapse of social supports and rejection of supervision as key risk factors for the defendant.  These needed close supervision. 
28Overall, Ms Sutton assessed the defendant as presenting a high risk of sexual offending relative to other adult male offenders.
Reports received from court appointed psychiatrists: s 9(3)(b)
29Dr Samuels assessed the defendant's risk of sexual recidivism by reference to clinical, static, dynamic and protective factors as being high ""if he is not kept under close supervision and monitoring in the community"".
30Dr Jeremy O'Dea's report was dated 16 August 2011. He concluded - 
... from a full psychiatric risk management perspective and as judged by various actuarial and more so called dynamic risk assessment instruments, in the absence of specific risk management interventions ...Mr Scerri's risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours would be considered significantly high and appropriate for these specific interventions.  In addition, it could be considered that there would be a significantly high degree of probability that Mr Scerri would be likely to commit a further serious sex offence in the community in the long term if these treatment interventions were not successfully provided. 
Safety of the community: s 9(3)(a)
31It is not necessary to dilate upon this factor.  It is obvious that the defendant poses a significant risk to the community if he is permitted to go at large without a high degree of supervision and monitoring.  The conditions that have been imposed reflect this need.
32As I mentioned, the plaintiff contended that the Order should be granted for a period of five years, which is the maximum prescribed term.  Both Drs Samuels and O'Dea consider that the need for supervision is long term and, at least five years is required.  I should state at the outset that, as a lay person, I entirely share this view, viewed from the present vantage point.  The Act provides for constant periodic review and permits the subject of the order to seek revision on his or her own initiative.  With respect, I agree with the observation by Johnson J in State of New South Wales v Tillman [2008] NSWSC 1293 at [61] that it is inappropriate to draw analogies from principles relating to punishment by way of imprisonment.  A supervision order is in no sense punishment.  It is designed, so far as it may reasonably do so bearing in mind the civil rights of all citizens, to protect the community from the risk of further serious offences being committed by those who have demonstrated in the most direct way the tendency to commit such offences.  
33Of course, it cannot be denied that the imposition of a supervision order is a very substantial inroad into the civil rights of a person to go about his or her life freely as long as his or her actions do not impinge criminally on the lives of others.  In our community, such limits on freedom cannot be imposed by the Executive.  They are reserved, for reasons that do not need to be explained, to the independent Courts to decide in accordance with the law.  This fundamental principle, indeed, is reflected in the legislation presently under consideration.  With great respect for those who may differ from me on this matter, I consider that vindicating the essential role of the courts in protecting the liberties of the subject is especially important where, as here, no sentence of punishment is being imposed but, rather, a person's fundamental right of personal freedom is being very substantially qualified in order to protect the community.  
34This is not to express any opinion whatever about the desirability of the legislation.  It is the duty of the Court to undertake conscientiously the task entrusted to it by the Parliament.  However, in my view, the appropriate course is to limit the supervision order, in the first instance to three years.  My expectation is, as indeed the doctors opine, that it will be in all likelihood necessary to extend it.  However, the future is unpredictable and, although an application can always be made if circumstances change, that is not the same as requiring a fresh application to be made in three years time to remind the parties - and the community - that the Court is ultimately responsible, in accordance with the law, for making orders that affect the basic human right to be free from physical restraint.
Conclusion 
35Under s 9(1) of the Act, the court is empowered to determine an application for an extended supervision order by either making an order or dismissing the application.   I am required to be satisfied ""to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he... is not kept under supervision"".  As is obvious, I am so satisfied and, accordingly, made the supervision order as mentioned at the outset of these reasons.

		10 April 2012",2011-09-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709220,R v GOEL (No 2) [2011] NSWDC 144,"SENTENCE 

1HIS HONOUR: Dinker Goel is now to be sentenced for forty-one breaches of s 135.1(3) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code . They are forty-one offences of causing tax returns to be filed with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to the Commonwealth. The maximum penalty for each such offence is five years imprisonment. The offender pleaded guilty to these offences on 4 August 2011. 

2In an earlier judgment I set out the circumstances which led to the offender pleading guilty to each such offence, part-way through his trial, R v Goel (2011) NSWDC 83. As I noted at the time, despite the pleas of guilty, there remained a factual dispute for me to resolve. After the pleas of guilty were entered and the jury was discharged further evidence was called regarding the factual basis on which I would sentence the offender. After hearing that evidence and submissions, at the request of the parties, I indicated the conclusion I had reached in order that remaining aspects of the sentencing submissions could be prepared in the light of that conclusion. I told the parties that I would give reasons for the conclusion I had reached when sentencing Mr Goel. Accordingly, the first part of these remarks on sentence explains the conclusion I reached. 

3As I explained in the earlier judgment there is much that is not in dispute. Briefly, on 19 October 2008 the offender presented himself at the offices of CNR Accounting and Taxation Pty Limited where he met a young taxation consultant by the name of Sharang Sareen. He asked Mr Sareen to prepare and lodge forty-one tax returns. He produced forty-one payment summaries (what used to be called group certificates), together with forty-one handwritten documents, one attached to each payment summary, setting out what purported to be the bank account details of each taxpayer. One of the matters in dispute concerns the circumstances in which Mr Sareen, who prepared the tax returns on some computer software, came to claim deductions for work expenses, although it is common ground that it was the offender who requested that deductions be claimed. 

4Over the next few days the taxation returns were prepared and lodged. As it turns out this was part of an elaborate fraud. Although the taxpayers did exist and the tax file numbers associated with each tax payer were accurate, none of the taxpayers worked for the employers recorded in the payment summaries. Further, the bank account numbers and BSB numbers recorded on the handwritten documents were not accounts held by the nominated taxpayer. The scheme was designed to obtain from the Commonwealth tax refunds which were not legitimately payable. In this regard, the return on the scheme was higher the greater the tax withheld component of each payment summary and the greater the deductions claimed for work expenses. 

5It is the Crown case that the offender well knew that the payment summaries were false, in the sense that the payment summaries recorded income that was not earned by the relevant taxpayer, and more importantly tax which was not withheld by the employer. It is also the Crown case that the offender did what he could to maximise the deductions which would be claimed for work expenses in relation to each taxpayer, knowing full well that because the taxpayer had not earned any of the income recorded on the payment summaries, he or she had not incurred any expenses at all in earning that income. 

6On the other hand it is the case for the offender that whilst he was dishonest in asking Mr Sareen to claim deductions, which he described as ""general deductions"", for expenses incurred in earning income where he had no evidence to justify a claim that those expenses had been incurred, his dishonesty was limited to that act. It was the offender's evidence confirming what he had earlier told an investigator from the Australian Taxation Office, that he knew it was wrong to claim general deductions of about $300 per taxpayer when he had no information to suggest that those deductions were validly claimed. Although the tax returns each claimed much larger deductions than $300 per taxpayer it is the offender's case that it was Mr Sareen who decided to claim much higher deductions, generally in the order of $2,000 per taxpayer, but in two cases in the order of $4,500. 

7As I told the parties on 9 August 2011 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown case as to the extent of the offender's dishonesty should be accepted. This means that the offender was knowingly part of a scheme to defraud more than $180,000 from the Commonwealth. I reject as not being a reasonable possibility, the proposition that the offender believed the payment summaries to be genuine. 

8As might be imagined there are circumstances in the evidence which point both ways. Some factors tend to suggest that Mr Goel was a mere patsy or dupe who was used as an innocent agent by others. But the preponderance of evidence, which I repeat has satisfied me beyond reasonable doubt, establishes that the offender well knew that the taxpayers recorded on each of forty-one payment summaries were not in any way involved in the matter. 

9The offender says he was given the forty-one payment summaries and attached handwritten notes by a man with the name Kieran in Melbourne about a week before he went to see Mr Sareen. The evidence established that the offender, who worked for a company called Accounting First Financial Services Pty Limited (AFFS), would, as part of his regular duties, go to Melbourne, get a hotel room and see clients there. The offender said Kieran came to see him one day and indeed the offender prepared Kieran's 2008 tax return. The offender also said Kieran gave him the forty-one payment summaries and handwritten attachments containing bank account details of the taxpayers. He said that after having been rebuffed by his employer when he suggested that AFFS could do the work of lodging the tax returns he went to Mr Sareen's company. His evidence was that he spoke to Mr Sareen for only a very short time and did nothing much more than hand over the relevant documents and tell Mr Sareen to claim general deductions. 

10Mr Sareen's evidence was that the meeting lasted some two hours and initially he was inputting relevant data into computer software. He said he did this for about thirty-five or thirty-six taxpayers but then when he was running out of time and his next client was waiting to see him, he told the offender he would finish off the remaining five or six returns on a later occasion. The difference between the offender's evidence as to how long the meeting took and Mr Sareen's evidence as to how long the meeting took is explained by their different evidence as to how the subject of deductions was treated. As I have already said on a number of occasions it was the offender's evidence that he told Mr Sareen to claim general deductions for around $300 per taxpayer, but it was Mr Sareen's evidence that for the first thirty-five or thirty-six tax returns the offender supplied him with details regarding their deductions to be claimed. Mr Sareen said that when he ran out of time the offender told him to claim around $2,000 on each of the remaining tax returns. Mr Sareen said that therefore for the last five or six returns he claimed miscellaneous expenditure of around $2,000. 

11There is some significant support for Mr Sareen's evidence when the tax returns themselves are examined. There are a number where deductions are claimed for specific categories of deductions. There are a number where miscellaneous deductions are claimed for amounts much less or more than $2,000 and there are a number where miscellaneous deductions of around $2,000 are claimed. This strongly supports what Mr Sareen said was the nature of the conversation he had with the offender regarding deductions. It is entirely contrary to how Mr Sareen would have behaved if the offender's evidence was true. The offender said he asked Mr Sareen to treat deductions for all tax returns in the same manner. But Mr Sareen clearly treated many of them differently, two claiming deductions in the order of $4,500, four claiming deductions of less than $1,000, many claiming deductions for specific matters such as the cost of managing tax affairs, uniforms, travel, et cetera, and many claiming only miscellaneous expenses of around $2,000, which would include the five or six returns prepared after the offender left. There is no reason that Mr Sareen would go to such elaborate lengths to differentiate the various tax returns if he had been truly asked only to claim ""general deductions"", especially general deductions of around $300. 

12That Mr Sareen gave this evidence is an important aspect in assessing his credibility, beyond the circumstance of the objective evidence supports what he says. Clearly Mr Sareen was admitting to conduct as regards the five or six tax returns which was improper. He was in effect making things up as regards the deductions. As such this was an admission against his interests, a factor which is usually thought to be useful in assessing the reliability of what a person says, and further there was no reason for him to make that admission if it were not true. On the offender's version of what occurred at their meeting there is no reason at all for Mr Sareen to say one thing regarding the first thirty-five or thirty-six tax returns, and a different thing regarding the remainder. Indeed, on the offender's version, Mr Sareen was lying, or at the very least mistaken, when he said the offender provided the details of the deductions for the bulk of the tax returns. If that were the case then there is no explanation as to why Mr Sareen would not lie regarding all of the forty-one tax returns. The fact that he said different things about, on the one hand the first thirty-five or thirty-six tax returns, and on the other hand the remaining five or six returns is strongly supportive of the Crown's case that the details regarding the deductions for most of the tax returns, and the level of deductions for the remaining tax returns came from the offender. 

13Of course, Mr Morris submitted that it was not only Mr Sareen who was making an admission against his interests. He said that his client was similarly making admissions against interest when he admitted that he asked for general deductions to be claimed. However, the nature of the way in which the offender told Mr Anderson from the ATO what he had done very much had the flavour of the offender admitting to something he thought, at least when he made the admission, was relatively benign. And in any case by saying that he'd asked for general deductions to be claimed he was minimising, he hoped, the likelihood that he would have been found to be more deeply involved. 

14The issue of deductions is also important for another reason, because it showed that the offender consistently acted as if the taxpayers' names on the payment summaries had nothing to do with the matters recorded there. Even on the offender's version he acted as if there were no real taxpayers. Even on his version, when the question of deductions came up, the offender made no enquiry with Kieran to ensure the taxpayers were getting the refunds they were entitled to. Although the offender's evidence was that he asked Mr Sareen to claim deductions of around $300, he accepted, of course, that if a taxpayer had incurred expenses higher than that and had the appropriate receipts, then the taxpayer was entitled to get a larger refund - yet he made no enquiry as to whether that was the case. Had the offender genuinely believed that the payment summaries were legitimate, it is inconceivable that he would not have at some stage checked to see whether the taxpayers were entitled to a greater deduction than he was assuming. To repeat for emphasis - when the offender was told by Sareen that there was no information regarding deductions and the offender told him to claim the general deductions (of course this is what the offender says) the offender accepts it was possible that the taxpayers had higher deductions than that and that in fact they could have ended up paying more tax than they were supposed to. 

15This strange behaviour, if what the offender said is true, is explained on the basis that the offender well knew that it was not possible to find out from the taxpayers what their deductions should actually be. He knew that there were no taxpayers to approach. 

16Mr Morris suggested that maybe the offender was blinded by the promise of a quick dollar and so was concerned more with making money for himself than the taxpayers. But if that is the case, it does not explain why the offender claimed any deductions at all. He was going to be paid by Kieran no matter what the level of deductions claimed. So Mr Morris' purported explanation is, upon analysis, not a valid explanation at all. 

17It is thus quite simple to reject beyond reasonable doubt the offender's claim that his conversation with Mr Sareen regarding deductions was limited to the offender asking him to claim general deductions of around $300. This makes it much easier to find beyond reasonable doubt that he asked for Mr Sareen to claim deductions of a much higher level and of course it is very easy to conclude that the reason he did this was, as I explained earlier, that this maximised the return from the criminal scheme. 

18As the Crown Prosecutor submitted, the evidence suggesting that the offender was concerned to get the deductions at such a high level meant that he was ""in on it."" 

19There are other matters strongly supportive of Mr Sareen's evidence where it conflicts with the offender's. It was immediately obvious to Mr Sareen that the ratio of tax purportedly withheld to income purportedly earned, was high. Again, this was part of the workings of the criminal enterprise, to maximise the return from it. Mr Sareen gave evidence that he asked the offender about this and the offender responded that he, as payroll manager, had done that deliberately to maximise the refund that each taxpayer would receive each year. An officer from the ATO gave evidence that he had calculated the amount by which the tax withheld was larger than it should have been for a number of the returns. In each case it was a significant discrepancy, that being confirmed by Mr Sareen's evidence that he noticed it very quickly. But the offender denied that he noticed the discrepancy. I find that difficult to believe, given the size of the variation from what would be expected and the offender's evidence as regards his experience with personal tax returns. 

20It was the offender's evidence that nothing in the nature of his transactions with Kieran suggested that it was other than genuine. But there are a number of factors which should have aroused the offender's suspicion. Kieran paid him in cash and did not supply an authorisation from any of the forty-one taxpayers. The offender said that one of the things which led him to believe that Kieran was aboveboard was that the bank account details were different for each of the forty-one taxpayers, yet he maintained that not once in the period between when he received the documents from Kieran and when he handed them to Mr Sareen, did he check that that was the case - an exercise which took him all of two minutes when he performed it at the Crown's request in the witness box. 

21It is also important to consider the motivations of the various players in this matter, in particular Mr Sareen and the offender. There was no motive for Mr Sareen to do with the offender said he did; that is to claim deductions at a much higher level than Mr Goel asked him to. That made no difference to the payment Mr Sareen received, but it did make a very big difference to the amount that would be realised from this fraudulent operation. The offender had a real motive to claim higher deductions if he was involved in the fraud, and as I have explained above, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that it was he who was responsible for the high level of deductions claimed. 

22Let me move away now from the offender's interaction with Mr Sareen. A search was conducted of the AFFS offices. That search included the company's computers. In the offender's directory on that computer was discovered a list of taxpayers under the heading, ""Melbourne clients, not lodged, 2007."" It appears to have been created from other records held by AFFS. 

23Every one of the names on the forty-one payment summaries appears on that list. That is a remarkable coincidence, given the circumstances in which the offender says the payment summaries were given to him by a man unconnected with AFFS in a hotel room in Melbourne. 

24Each of the forty-one taxpayers appears to have previously had a tax return filed by a company which was a predecessor to AFFS, which would explain why their records would be held on the AFFS computer. At the very least the evidence would suggest that the offender had access to information which enabled him to either prepare the payment summaries or to give information to someone else to prepare those payment summaries. As I have said, that this information from the records of AFFS, somehow found its way into the hands of Kieran in Melbourne, to be given to the offender who worked for AFFS - is something of a remarkable coincidence. 

25A major factor relied on by Mr Morris in this regard concerned an enquiry made on the ATO tax portal regarding one of the forty-one taxpayers. The evidence would suggest that the tax portal had been used by a person within AFFS to make an enquiry about the status of one of the forty-one tax returns. The evidence would also suggest that within AFFS there were only three people who could themselves use the portal, and the offender was not one of those. Mr Morris' submission was that this demonstrated that someone within AFFS other than his client was involved in this criminal scheme and this would explain the link between the forty-one names found in the offender's directory on the company computer, and the names appearing in the payment summaries. 

26However I accept the Crown submission as regards this circumstance. It is clear that the offender could not have been involved in all aspects of the criminal scheme. For example some of the bank accounts were set up before the offender arrived in Australia. And the Crown submission is that it may be that the offender had a co-offender in the ranks of AFFS. Or it may be that whoever made the enquiry through the tax portal did so at the offender's request. It would not be unusual for a tax consultant such as the offender to have to have enquiries made through the tax portal from time to time and this would necessitate the offender approaching one of the three people who was able to access the portal, and so that person may simply have done so at the offender's request, without knowing anything about the fraudulent scheme which was underway. Alternatively said the Crown, it may be that the offender used a person's ID and password without their knowledge. 

27The Crown's submission is there are so many possibilities not inconsistent with the offender's guilt. Of course that is not to cast aside the evidence regarding the access through the tax portal at all. It is important evidence which I have taken into account. There is no evidence that the offender asked anyone to access the tax portal on his behalf, nor is there any evidence that any of the persons authorised to access the tax portal within AFFS allowed their log in details to be used by the offender. But this is just one circumstance which has to be considered in the context of all the evidence that I have heard. 

28Certainly it tends to point in the direction the offender wants me to go in, but it is not a matter of such weight as to overcome the other evidence which is very highly probative of the Crown case as regards the extent of the offender's dishonesty. 

29Another matter relied on by Mr Morris is the offender's use of his correct name, payment through a credit card with his name on it and use of a telephone registered in his correct name. Mr Morris says that by doing these things he was clearly allowing himself to be identified, something which would not occur if he knew that the payment summaries were false. On the other hand in many cases involving the criminal law, it is only when the offenders make a mistake that they can be caught. More relevantly to the present case, it is entirely possible that the offender's use of his genuine credit card was related to the fact that it has the letters CPA on it. Although there is some dispute as to whether the offender actually told Mr Sareen that he was a certified public accountant, it was Mr Sareen's evidence that his belief that the offender was a certified public accountant was a factor in him accepting the legitimacy of the work he was asked to do. It would not be at all surprising if the offender had determined to use his CPA credit card as a means of overcoming any concerns that Mr Sareen might have. 

30It may also be that the offender thought the tax returns would be processed without question. Perhaps he believed, maybe because someone told him, that no genuine returns would be filed by any of the tax payers. If he believed that the scheme would work, then there was no need for him to go to the effort of disguising his appearance and if his efforts at disguise came unstuck, that may of itself have raised suspicions which would cause the scheme to unravel. The fact that the offender allowed himself to be identified is a matter which works in his favour. But again, it is not something which is necessarily inconsistent with his guilt. 

31Much of the resolution of the factual dispute involved a consideration of the credibility of the offender on the one hand and Mr Sareen on the other. Where their evidence conflicts I have no hesitation in accepting Mr Sareen's evidence beyond reasonable doubt. The offender had significant problems with his credibility. Firstly to state the obvious, he has pleaded guilty to forty-one counts of dishonesty. Secondly he admitted lying to Mr Sareen about the nature of his relationship with the tax payers. Thirdly when spoken to by Mr Anderson, he did not tell him the name of the person in Melbourne who had given him the payment summaries, instead telling Mr Anderson that he did not know it, which even on Mr Goel's evidence was untrue. Fourthly, the offender's performance in cross-examination was far less than impressive. On many occasions, he attempted to explain away otherwise incriminating circumstances in a way which was most unimpressive. For example, he could not explain in any rational way why he had lied to Mr Sareen about his relationship with the forty-one tax payers, and it was only after some time that he came up with an explanation as to why he did not provide Kieran with any form of invoice or receipt for the money which Kieran had paid him. 

32In assessing the credibility of the offender and Mr Sareen of course, I bear in mind also that Mr Sareen was also acting in a way which was, at least to my mind, dishonest as regards the deductions claimed for the tax payers when Mr Goel did not give him specific information. Indeed the flavour of his evidence was that he would not put down a round figure of say two hundred dollars, because that might arouse suspicion. 

33So whilst there is evidence tending to suggest that Mr Goel was indeed a patsy and unaware that at the time he handed over the forty-one payment summaries he was participating in a criminal scheme to defraud the Commonwealth of more than one hundred and eighty thousand dollars, there is much evidence to the contrary. 

34As I have explained it above, having considered all the evidence, I have reached the conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was knowingly part of a scheme to defraud approximately one hundred and eighty thousand dollars from the Commonwealth. 

35This is of course a very serious series of offences. The system of personal taxation that is operated in Australia relies to a large extent on self assessment. That is, the ATO largely accepts what tax payers say in their tax returns. To have an officer from the ATO check every tax return file would be both expensive and also time consuming. Tax payers entitled to legitimate tax refunds would find that they had to wait significantly longer than they presently do to receive money owing to them from the Commonwealth. Indeed a fraud on the taxation is in a real sense a fraud on all other law abiding tax payers. 

36The offender is now thirty-two years of age. He lives with his wife and daughter in shared accommodation. He was born and raised in India. He had a stable and what he described as sheltered upbringing where all his needs were met. He has two older brothers who live overseas and he has frequent telephone contact with them and with his parents. He has told them about his offence. They are, not surprisingly disappointed by his behaviour, but nevertheless provide him with ongoing emotional support. 

37Mr Goel is also fortunate to have a strong and loving relationship with his wife, who he said has been by his side since their union. He is a permanent resident in Australia. He applied for citizenship but that was declined due to his current offence. 

38He was educated to a tertiary level in India and received a degree in commerce. One of his brothers worked in an accounting practice and Mr Goel worked for him for about eighteen months before coming to Australia. Once he arrived in Australia, the offender started working in the marketing industry where he worked for twelve months before getting his employment at AFFS. Of course since his arrest, things have gone dramatically downhill. His employment was terminated and he has been unable to get work of a similar standard. Most recently, he has been working in a convenience store for a friend of his who provided a reference to the Court. 

39One of the matters that was exercising Mr Goel's mind at the very time he was committing these offences concerned the impending birth of his first child, she is now three years of age. Mr Morris relied on the circumstances surrounding Mr Goel's wife and daughter, although frankly conceded that he could not say that those circumstances were exceptional. Mr Goel's wife speaks some English but it is not her first language. She is now able to work as a currency exchange officer whilst their child is in day care. Of course once Mr Goel receives a custodial sentence, as Mr Morris all but conceded was inevitable, his wife and child will be deprived of his comfort and support. Mr Goel gave evidence that he might suggest that his wife return to India where she will have family support available to her. 

40Whatever precisely occurs, Mr Goel will do his time in custody harder than would otherwise be the case. If his wife and daughter remain in Australia, he will do his time knowing that he has deprived them of a significant part of the support from which they would benefit at this time. If they go back to India, then he will be deprived of their visits for the period of his custody. 

41I spoke before about matters going dramatically downhill since the offender's arrest. Mr Morris tendered a psychiatric report from Dr Raymond Tint Way. That reveals significant depression and indeed suicidal ideation associated with stress of the current proceedings and Mr Goel's fear of a custodial sentence. Unfortunately I have to say such circumstances are very common, especially those of otherwise good character facing a custodial sentence for the first time. Despite their relatively common occurrence, I will take them into account in assessing the sentence to impose on Mr Goel. He is not a hardened criminal used to mixing with the sort of characters he will find in custody. 

42As I have mentioned the offender is of otherwise good character. References tendered on his behalf speak highly of him and refer to acts of kindness performed by him to his friends. 

43Mr Goel pleaded guilty part way through his jury trial. His willingness to facilitate the course of justice by that plea of guilty is limited indeed. The history of this matter, as was explained to me, involved other Court proceedings and even if I ignore those, I do note that Mr Goel's plea of guilty was entered many days after the trial had commenced and was followed by a disputed facts hearing which, as I have just indicated, was resolved against the offender. Given the extremely limited indication of a willingness to facilitate the course of justice, I do not propose to specify a particular discount that I have allowed for it. 

44One of the factors that Mr Morris relies on is that there is no evidence that the proceeds of the tax refunds made their way to the offender. Although Mr Morris concedes that the offence was clearly committed for financial gain, he says that the only evidence of financial gain is the payment that the offender received for doing what he did. On the other hand, it has to be noted that if the offender had received proceeds of the tax refunds or any part of them, he would have been guilty of a more serious offence, one which carried double the maximum penalty. It is not a matter of mitigation in the offender's case that a more serious offence was not committed. 

45I should have said before that the Crown asked me to discount the benefit that the offender can obtain from his good character. I do not propose to do that. His good character was a very small part of his ability to commit these offences and I see no good reason why the offender should not be fully entitled to have me consider his otherwise good character in determining the appropriate sentence. 

46Mr Morris relied on what he said was assistance given by the offender in his interviews with officers from the ATO. I find that there was no relevant assistance given. 

47Mr Morris relied on comparative cases but freely admitted that the assistance they could provide was limited. In particular, some of them involved other and various forms of offending and the maximum penalty for the taxation fraud matters referred to in those other cases was not the same as the maximum penalty faced by this offender. 

48It is important that when I look at those as comparative cases I identify the precise offence that the offender is to be sentenced for as I did at the outset of these remarks. 

49Mr Morris made a submission that I would impose concurrent sentences saying that these offences were all committed as the one course of conduct. Indeed there were forty-one offences because in the one act the offender had handed over details of forty-one separate tax payers. However, it would be wrong to think that the offender should receive the same punishment as if he had committed only one offence, which was, in effect, what Mr Morris was submitting. 

50It is clear that there needs to be some accumulation of sentence. The offender should not receive a sentence appropriate to an offender who had made an approach to Mr Sareen regarding a single tax payer, claiming deductions of around four, five or six thousand dollars. The offender's overall misconduct is much, much more serious than that. There needs to be some level of accumulation and in doing so I have divided the offences up into what I freely admit is an arbitrary way. I have grouped them into four groups and will make the sentences in each group concurrent with each other but the sentences in other groups partially accumulative. 

51One of the interesting issues that has arisen since the High Court decision of Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 concerns the ratio of non-parole period to head sentence which is appropriate in the present case. The attitude by the Crown on the sentence proceedings here has obviated the need for me to go into great detail in explaining why I have chosen a non-parole period which is forty per cent of the overall head sentence. If it were necessary for me to explain what I have done in detail I would refer to the matters that I referred to in submissions from the Crown relating to the absence of any norm for commonwealth offenders following Hili and Jones and the absence of any statutory ratio as would apply in the case of State offences. Mr Crown quite properly conceded that a ratio of non-parole period to head sentence of around forty per cent would be appropriate in the circumstances of this particular case (I gather he was saying that there may be other cases where that ratio would not be appropriate so we can leave for a future time an examination of the effect of Hili and Jones on what ratio of non-parole period to head sentence will be imposed in those other cases). 

52I impose sentence as follows: for counts one to ten on the indictment, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of two years, to date from 9 September 2011. 

53For counts eleven to twenty on the indictment, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of two years, to date from 9 September 2012. 

54For counts twenty-one to thirty on the indictment, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for two years, to date from 9 September 2013. 

55And for counts thirty-one to forty-one on the indictment, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for two years, to date from 9 September 2014. 

56Thus the overall head sentence is one of five years. The non-parole period I set is two years, to date from 9 September 2011, which will mean that the offender is eligible to be released to parole on 8 September 2013. 

57Mr Goel, I need to explain to you what I have done. I have sentenced you to imprisonment. Your imprisonment will start today. You will serve at least two years in gaol. That means that you will be eligible to be released to parole on 8 September 2013. If you are released to parole, then you will be serving your sentence in the community for a further three years and any misbehaviour by you could see your parole revoked and you returned to custody. Do you understand what I have done Mr Goel? Right, thank you. 

58Mr Crown, I consider it appropriate, it is a matter for you and the ATO, that at least investigations be made into Mr Sareen's culpability for any offences he may have committed, as regards to his decision to claim deductions on the tax returns but that is a matter for you and the ATO to decide.

2709231,R v Robert Francis Agius [2011] NSWSC 982,"Judgment 

1By notice of motion filed on 11 August 2011 the applicant, Robert Francis Agius, seeks an order for a separate trial of two counts of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth, in respect of which he is jointly indicted with three others (Kevin Zerafa, Carol Abibadra and Deborah Jandagi). No evidence was filed in support of the application. What follows as factual background is drawn from what I have gleaned over the past six months in dealing with this case, and what is asserted in written submissions filed on behalf of Mr Agius. No issue has been taken as to the accuracy of the factual substratum of the application. 

Background 

2The proceedings have already a lengthy history. Mr Agius was, I was told, arrested on 28 April 2008 in Perth. An order was made that he be taken to Sydney. Bail was then refused, but was granted on 6 May 2008 on specified conditions, including the lodging of a substantial security and, importantly for the present application, that he remain in Australia. (He is said to be a resident of Vanuatu.) He was released on bail on 28 May 2008. 

3Since August 2008, a succession of orders has been made concerning service of the prosecution brief. The written submissions suggest that this process was very recently completed. A vast amount of documentary material has been served. The parties, I understand, are negotiating with a view to reducing the amount of documentary material it will be necessary to introduce into evidence. 

4On 18 May 2010, Mr Agius was committed for trial in this Court. On 3 October 2010 he and the three co-accused were arraigned in this Court and the trial fixed to commence on 27 April 2011. It had then an estimated duration of 12 weeks. (It had previously been given an estimated duration of 6-12 months.) It is a trial of very considerable complexity, involving alleged taxation fraud on a large scale. 

5By early 2011, it was plain that the matter was not ready to proceed. On 27 April 2011 each accused objected to the indictment, seeking a stay of one of the counts. I refused to make that order: R v Agius & Ors [2011] NSWSC 367. Pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, each accused sought leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Leave was granted, but the appeal was dismissed: R v Agius & Ors [2011] NSWCCA 119. Each applicant applied for special leave to appeal to the High Court; on 15 June 2011 special leave was refused: Abibadra v The Queen ; Jandagi v The Queen ; Zerafa v The Queen ; Agius v The Queen [2011] HCA Trans 171. 

6Since April this year, I have been given, from time to time, reports on the progress of preparation, and the time estimated, first, for the matter to be ready for trial, and, second, of the trial itself. The latter estimate has never been less than 12 weeks. 

7During this time I was informed (without evidence, but without challenge) that one of the co-accused (Ms Abibadra) is pregnant, and is due to give birth in early November. She will be unable to participate in a trial after mid-September. 

8Initially, the application for separate trials was made on three grounds. They were: 

""Ground 1: The injustice that will result from further delay not of [Mr Agius'] making. 

Ground 2: The case and the evidence to be led against Mr Agius and the [co-accused] is different, and will lead to difficult questions of admissibility. 

Ground 3: The possibility of different verdicts as between Mr Agius and the [co-accused] already exists due to the differences in the case against them. Different verdicts would not be inconsistent."" 

9Written submissions were provided in support of all three grounds. 

10On the hearing of the application, Ground 3 and much of Ground 2 were abandoned. Senior counsel addressed briefly. The principal basis advanced in support of the order was the delay that has occurred to date, and that will occur in the future. In this context, it is relevant to note that the trial of Ms Abibadra may not now proceed this year. It is not, however, impossible that, should a trial of the remaining accused, including Mr Agius, be feasible (especially given time constraints), the trial of Ms Abibadra could be separated. 

11As argument progressed, it became apparent that, even at this stage, the preparation for a trial, whether for Mr Agius alone, or of three or four accused, has not yet reached the stage at which one could confidently empanel a jury. It must also be remembered that, for a trial estimated to last three months or more, a significantly larger than usual jury panel will need to be summoned. That involves considerable lead time. I say this because, on the information available to me, there is no reason to believe that a trial of Mr Agius alone would be of materially shorter duration than a trial of all four accused. 

12I understand further that Mr Agius' legal representatives have notified some objections to the evidence proposed to be led against him, but these are not ready to be argued or determined. 

13In written submissions, counsel for Mr Agius, drawing on the decision of Whealy J (as his Honour then was) in R v Baladjan & Ors [2008] NSWSC 1471, identified various circumstances in which it would be appropriate to make an order separating the trial of co-accused. The starting point is that persons alleged to be co-offenders ought to be trial jointly: Webb v The Queen [1994] HCA 30; 181 CLR 41; Domican v R (1989) 43 A Crim R 24. A number of exceptions follow. None of the exceptions is here applicable. 

14I appreciate the point made on behalf of Mr Agius concerning the continuing bail condition requiring him to remain in Australia, not the country of his residence. However, senior counsel was unable to suggest that, even if he were granted a separate trial, it could begin earlier than mid-October. No estimate less than 12 weeks for such a trial has been provided. Because of the nature of the prosecution case, even in a trial of Mr Agius alone, virtually all of the evidence to be tendered against the co-accused would be tendered against Mr Agius. There would be no, or little, reduction in the hearing time, at least so far as the prosecution case is concerned. 

15Because this is a Commonwealth prosecution, the trial must be by jury. I would not be prepared to empanel a jury of 12 citizens in a trial that had a probability, or even a real possibility, of extending over the Christmas season. Jurors are drawn from the community, and this community is accustomed to spending time with family and friends at that time of the year. Many are able to take their annual leave only at that time of the year. Apart from imposing unfairness on those unfortunate citizens selected for such an onerous duty, there would also be a real risk that less than optimum attention was paid to the evidence, which will, in any event, be complex and difficult. 

16If a trial of all accused (or all accused except Ms Abibadra) cannot proceed this year, then, in my opinion, neither can a single trial of one accused only. As is clear, such a trial would not be noticeably shorter than a joint trial. 

17The basis for a separate trial has not been made out. The application is dismissed.

2709238,R v Hawi & ors (No 27) [2011] NSWSC 1673,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: This judgment is concerned with a number of issues raised on behalf of the accused Kisacanin relating to certain video evidence. It concerns what has been referred to in the trial as the ""Deng footage"" and the ""Watermark footage"". 


Submissions re the Deng footage on 15 August 2011 

2On 15 August 2011 Mr Gordon of counsel made submissions to the effect that there was no case to answer in respect of his client, the accused Kisacanin. In the course of dealing with that issue the Crown Prosecutor outlined the evidence upon which the Crown relied in support of its contention that there was a case to answer. 

3Reference was made by the Crown Prosecutor to the evidence of a Qantas staff member (Redford) who claimed to have seen a man pick up a bollard and swing it (T948.8). She said that this man was wearing a grey singlet and that he had tattoos. In cross-examination by Mr Gordon, the witness said that there were tattoos on both arms (T956.37). Mr Kisacanin was wearing such a singlet but he did not have tattoos. The Crown Prosecutor indicated that she proposed to submit to the jury that the witness may have been mistaken about the tattoos but correct about the singlet. It is possible that the jury might accept such a submission: as to this issue, see R v Hawi & ors (No 19) at [44] - [45]. 

4There is other evidence which could support the proposition that Mr Kisacanin used a bollard in the course of the fighting in the departure hall. Footage from security camera 404 shows him coming into view from the left side of the screen carrying a bollard and putting it down. 

5It was in the context of referring to this evidence on 15 August 2011 that the Crown Prosecutor also submitted that there was support for the proposition that Mr Kisacanin used a bollard. This was said to be found in the video footage recorded by a tourist (Deng). This is what I referred to earlier as ""the Deng footage"". (Exhibit FE is a disc containing the moving footage in its original and various enhanced forms; Exhibit GB contains still images from the footage). 

6It was submitted that a still image recorded 2.36 seconds into the footage is capable of having discerned within it Mr Kisacanin. This is not said to be because facial or body features can be made out. Rather, it is because the figure can be seen to be wearing a white cap and dark shoes. For my part, the image at 2.36 seconds does not show a figure with such features, but an image at 2.56 seconds does (see also the images immediately before (2.52 seconds) and after (2.60 seconds)). 

7In my judgment refusing an application for directed verdicts of acquittal ( R v Hawi & ors (No 19)) , I referred (at [52]) to my own perception of the still images (from 1.88 seconds to 2.88 seconds) as showing a bollard being picked up by a man who is very difficult to make out, probably because he is wearing dark clothing. That man then moves towards the front of the terminal (towards what was likely then to have been the central area of the fighting), very closely followed by the man, who the Crown asserts is Mr Kisacanin, who is also carrying a bollard. This person comes into view with the bollard already held, at an angle that is close to horizontal. 

8On that occasion, Mr Gordon submitted in relation to this evidence that the person depicted was Mr Padovan. However, I was of the view that the image, whilst not very clear, was clear enough for the jury to make a distinction between a person wearing a white hat, grey singlet and dark coloured shoes (Mr Kisacanin) and a person wearing a white hat, no shirt and light coloured shoes (Mr Padovan). This is particularly so in relation to the hat and shoes. 

Submissions made on 29 August 2011 

9On 29 August 2011, after the evidence in the trial had closed and before closing addresses commenced, I heard submissions on a variety of issues. Mr Gordon made a number of submissions concerning the Deng footage. It was submitted that I should limit the use which could be made of this evidence pursuant to s 136 of the Evidence Act 1995. 

10A number of matters were put that were said to amount to unfair prejudice. Reference was made to the fact that the Crown had said nothing about any proposed use of the ""Deng footage"" in the case against Mr Kisacanin until 15 August 2011. Accordingly, Mr Gordon was not aware until that time of any need to deal with it in the defence of his client. Two matters were said to flow from that. 

11First, Mr Gordon did not cross-examine Professor Wu, the expert who analysed and attempted to provide enhanced versions of the footage, in any way that dealt with the ability to discern from the footage what the Crown now contends is an image of Mr Kisacanin (T4098 - 4100). In this respect, reference was made to some evidence given by Professor Wu that "" the human visual system has a delay effect"" (T2354.14). By this, he meant that the human brain is unable to process what can be seen in moving footage for a short period of time after its commencement. 

12The submission by Mr Gordon on 29 August 2011 that he did not cross-examine Professor Wu as to the extent of this phenomenon is not borne out. Mr Gordon questioned Professor Wu about whether this delay was measurable. He replied that it had been measured as being about 157 milliseconds (T2371.39). Given that the image of the person who the Crown asserts is Mr Kisacanin does not appear until about 2 seconds into the footage, this issue of delay in the ""human visual system"" is not presently relevant. 

13Mr Gordon also submitted that there was prejudice to the presentation of his client's defence in that if he had been on notice that the Crown were to make the assertion concerning his client being discernible in the Deng footage, he would have taken steps ""to try and improve, enhance or enlarge upon the section of the images now said to represent Mr Kisacanin"" (T4098.30). In theory, that might be a matter of real concern. In reality, it would only be of real concern if there was a reasonable prospect that taking such steps would achieve something useful. It is apparent from the evidence of Professor Wu, and that given on 29 August 2011 by an expert in forensic photography (Mr Porter) who was called in the case for the accused Abounader, that the quality of the footage is such that it is virtually impossible to achieve anything useful through any process of enhancement or the like. 

14It is of some note that 14 days elapsed between the issue being raised on 15 August 2011 and when evidence was presented in the case for Mr Kisacanin on 29 August 2011. There was no suggestion that Mr Kisacanin's solicitors were frustrated by insufficient time in any attempt to obtain an expert opinion as to the matters to which Mr Gordon referred. In fact, there was no suggestion that any such attempt had been made at all. 

15It is also of some note that following the conclusion of the case for the accused Menzies on Wednesday, 24 August 2011, there was a discussion concerning the future course of the trial (T4025 - 4027). Mr Gordon indicated that he had witnesses to call, but it was resolved to accommodate certain difficulties with their availability by deferring that until the following Monday, 29 August 2011. There was no suggestion on that occasion that there was a need for any further time to be allowed to obtain advice from an expert in relation to the present issue. No application was made then, or since, for further adjournment. 

16The next submission made by Mr Gordon involved a contention that the Deng footage had ""very low probative value as to the question of whether Mr Kisacanin used unlawful violence"" (T4098.26). I have acknowledged that the quality of the footage, both in moving and still image form, is not good. However, I have also come to the view that it is possible for certain things to be discerned, sufficient for this to be a matter left to the jury. It will, of course, be necessary to give directions to the jury about the care with which they should approach the task of viewing and interpreting this footage (and still images) as well as all of the other security camera footage that is in evidence. 

17When the issue was revisited on 30 August 2011, Mr Gordon foreshadowed a possible application for the jury to be discharged in respect of his client in the event that the jury was going to be permitted to entertain the Crown's submissions concerning Mr Kisacanin and the Deng footage (T4118). He reiterated that he would have wanted to have had ""the opportunity of having that examined and blown up and explored to the full, if that's going to be used by the Crown"" (T4118.43). In relation to this, I refer to what I have said above about such a course not appearing to be something that would have had a realistic prospect of achieving anything useful, and not something about which it would seem that any attempt has been made to pursue in any event. 

18Later, Mr Gordon made a submission that s 135 and s 137 of the Evidence Act were engaged (T4133.30). No further submission was made as to how that was so, but I assume that reliance was placed upon what had been said previously. Section 137 is the most apt to consider in relation to the contention concerning unfair prejudice. It only requires that the probative value be ""outweighed"" by the danger of unfair prejudice, rather than be ""substantially outweighed"". Further, s 137 requires mandatory exclusion of evidence if the conditions are met, whereas it remains a matter of discretion under s 135. 

19I am not persuaded that there is unfair prejudice in the issue being raised so late in the trial for the reasons I have given above. In short, I am not persuaded that anything would be different if the matter had been raised earlier. 

20In relation to the other points raised by Mr Gordon, I do not accept that there is unfair prejudice (ss 135 and 137), or anything misleading or confusing (s 135) that would require the evidence to be excluded. Mr Gordon submitted that the jury would engage in ""guesswork"" if they were invited to conclude that Mr Kisacanin could be seen in the Deng footage. I do not accept that this is a realistic concern. I have indicated that I will be giving the jury directions about the care with which they must approach evidence of this type. Moreover, it is a matter of commonsense. It would be completely illogical if the jury were to view some footage, or still images, be unconvinced, or doubtful, about the identity of persons depicted, but then make a ""guess"" as to identity. 

21A final matter to mention in relation to the Deng footage is a proposal by Mr Gordon that the footage could be edited in such a way as to remove the portions upon which the Crown relies in relation to Mr Kisacanin. At one point, Mr Gordon said that ""it's the first half second of the CCTV footage that I find offensive"" (T4134.32). This gives rise in my mind to the possibility that the difficulty Mr Gordon said he was having in making out from the footage what the Crown contends can be seen was because he had been looking at the wrong portion. 

22The Crown Prosecutor has made it quite clear that she was referring to an image that appears 2.36 seconds from the commencement of the footage (T3680.18). I indicated in my judgment on the no case to answer issue that I thought there was relevant footage (I interpolate that it is best seen in viewing the series of still images) from about 1.88 seconds to 2.88 seconds: R v Hawi & ors (No 19) at [52]. I have since viewed a number of times the footage from 0.0 seconds to 0.5 seconds. It does not appear that there is anything of particular interest in that portion. If Mr Gordon has been troubled about the prospect of the jury seeing the image of a person who is asserted by the Crown to be Mr Kisacanin in the first half second of the footage, then it would appear that he has proceeded upon a mistaken understanding of what the Crown has asserted. 

The Watermark footage 

23The Watermark footage concerns material recorded by a security camera installed within the Watermark bookstore in the vicinity of Gate 5. After fighting broke out in that area, some of the participants can be seen to be moving down the terminal concourse past the bookstore. The images are not entirely clear. It is, however, possible to identify certain persons, primarily from their clothing. For example, a man of somewhat portly build who is wearing a rather bright blue shirt can be concluded to have been the prosecution witness Arnold Loto. Mr Loto was wearing a bright blue Hawaiian shirt on the day in question. It seems that the identification of Mr Loto in this footage is common ground. 

24The Crown accepts that Mr Loto is seen in this footage to be pursuing the accused Padovan. There is evidence from a number of witnesses to the effect that the man, who is accepted to be Mr Padovan, was assaulted by a number of men from the Comanchero group in the vicinity of Gate 5. 

25The Crown contends that a man who is seen to be fairly close behind Mr Loto in this pursuit is the accused Kisacanin. It is not suggested that the man can be identified by facial or body features but rather by his clothing and footwear. I indicated in my judgment in relation to the no case to answer issue that I was satisfied that it was open to the jury to draw this conclusion: R v Hawi & ors (No 19) at [23]. 

26Mr Gordon's submission in relation to this footage was that it would be ""dangerous"" to invite the jury to make an identification of Mr Kisacanin from it. He contended that it might very well be unfairly prejudicial, misleading and confusing, or both (T4100.38). One of the distinctive features which the Crown relies upon for the assertion that the man behind Mr Loto was Mr Kisacanin is that the man can be clearly seen to be wearing a white hat. However, as Mr Gordon pointed out, so too was Mr Padovan. There was a danger of the jury confusing the two men and proceeding upon the basis that the man is Mr Kisacanin, whereas there is also the possibility that the man is Mr Padovan (T4100.44). 

27This point can be dealt with briefly. The Watermark footage is not entirely clear, but it is clear enough for the jury to be able to see that Mr Loto is running after a man who must be Mr Padovan. Accordingly, the man wearing a white hat who is seen to be running behind Mr Loto cannot be Mr Padovan. There is other evidence to which I was referred by the Crown Prosecutor which serves to confirm the safety of such a conclusion. 

28I do not see any reason to exclude this material from the jury's consideration, or limit in any way their consideration of the Crown's assertion that this footage shows a man who can be deduced to be Mr Kisacanin involved, with others, in the pursuit of Mr Padovan. 

Conclusion 

29I do not propose to exclude any of the evidence in the Deng and Watermark footage. 

30I do not propose to impose any limit upon the jury's consideration of the evidence in the manner suggested. 

31I reiterate that I propose to give the jury directions about the care with which they must approach the task of viewing, analysing and drawing conclusions from all of the video footage that is in evidence.

2709242,R v Hawi & ors (No 28) [2011] NSWSC 1674,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: From a very early stage of these proceedings, the Crown Prosecutor has indicated that she would be inviting the jury to consider finding the Comanchero accused guilty of manslaughter if there was a reasonable doubt about their guilt of the primary charge of murder. The issue did not receive much prominence in the Crown Prosecutor's opening address. There are understandable reasons for that which I do not need to address. 

2The Crown Prosecutor has now indicated the bases upon which the jury will be invited to return a verdict on manslaughter: 

The basis would be, firstly, straight-forward joint criminal enterprise manslaughter which would be these elements, but if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that an accused, one, was part of a joint criminal enterprise to commit a dangerous and unlawful act, namely, to assault one or more of the Hells Angels and that that assault carried with it an appreciable risk of jury, and satisfied that he participated in an agreement to assault the Hells Angels in some way, he could be guilty of manslaughter. That would be the straight-forward joint criminal enterprise. 

But alternatively, your Honour, if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that an accused was part of a joint criminal enterprise to intimidate one or more members of the Hells Angels as they approached them and contemplated the possibility that one of them would assault one or more of the Hells Angels, which is a dangerous and unlawful act carrying with it the appreciable risk of serious injury, and they participated in that intimidation in some way, they could be guilty of manslaughter. 

Your Honour, the second one is partially taken from the basis upon which Mr Aouli was dealt with, although the significant difference is Mr Aouli didn't agree that he was present ready and willing to assist, whereas in this trial we say all of the six accused on trial did actually physically do something in that, but they'd be the two alternative bases on which we'd be putting manslaughter to the jury. (T4127 - 4128) 

3Mr Dunn QC, on behalf of the accused Hawi (T4128.12), and Mr Young SC, on behalf of the accused Eken (T4130.5), and Mr Driels, on behalf of the accused Potrus (T4130.28), took no objection to the course proposed by the Crown. 

4Mr Stratton SC, on behalf of the accused Menzies, had no objection to a case of manslaughter going to the jury upon the first of the bases indicated by the Crown Prosecutor, but objected to a case on the second. His submission is encapsulated in the following passage: 

[I]n relation to the second basis, the foundational and incidental crimes are so different it would be like saying someone committing a fraud and one of his fellows unexpectedly punches out a passer-by. There's no relationship between the foundational and the incidental crime. (T4128.28). 

5Mr Stratton also submitted that the first basis was apt in the context of the evidence that is before the jury, while the second is not and that it would only serve to confuse the jury (T4128.45). 

6Mr Gordon, on behalf of the accused Kisacanin, supported the submissions of Mr Stratton, and stressed a concern about the potential for confusion of the jury (T4129). Mr Trevallion, on behalf of the accused Abounader, also supported the objection (T4130.14). 

7I indicated in short ex tempore reasons that it seemed that if a case was put to the jury that there was a joint criminal enterprise that had as its object the intimidation by the Comancheros of the Hells Angels, it would be well open to the jury to conclude, although clearly it is a matter for them, that there was contemplation that this could escalate into a physical assault which was of such a nature that it amounted to an unlawful and dangerous act that, objectively, carried with it an appreciable risk of someone sustaining serious injury. For these reasons, it seemed to me that it was a viable and appropriate basis upon which manslaughter could go to the jury. 

8I also indicated at the time that I was concerned about the prospect of this additional basis for manslaughter adding unnecessary complication when there is already a multiplicity of issues that the jury will be called upon to consider. I said that I would take the opportunity to reflect further upon that aspect. Having done so overnight, I have concluded that, in the overall context of the trial, there is no cause to be concerned about this prospect.

		14 February 2012",2011-08-31 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709262,R v Abbas CHOUKEIR [2011] NSWDC 123,"SENTENCE 


1. On Sunday 19 May 2009 the El Chami family were all in a car together. They were going to Mrs El Chami's parents' place. They were going along Kennedy Avenue Belmore and reached the intersection of Burwood Road where the driver, Mr Nicholas El Chami, stopped and looked both ways. What happened next changed the course of life for that family forever. 
2. Abbas Choukeir was driving his car at at least 30 kilometres per hour over the speed limit of 50 kilometres per hour in Burwood Road. Mr El Chami had proceeded into Burwood Road and Mr Choukeir collided with his car. Mr Nicholas El Chami was killed in the accident. Two of his four children, Sarah El Chami and James El Chami, were seriously injured. Fortunately Mrs Rhonda El Chami and the two other children in the car, Elias and Joanne, were not seriously injured. 
3. As a result Abbas Choukeir was charged by the police with three serious offences. One was driving in a manner dangerous causing Mr Nicholas El Chami's death. The other two were driving in a manner dangerous causing grievous bodily harm to Sarah and James El Chami. The crime involving Mr El Chami's death carries a maximum of ten years imprisonment. Each of the crimes involving the serious injuries to Sarah and James El Chami carry a maximum of seven years imprisonment. 
4. The Director of Public Prosecutions conducted the case against Mr Choukeir who pleaded not guilty to these three crimes. On 6 July 2011 a jury in a trial, presided over by me, found Mr Choukeir guilty of all three offences. 
5. If I have not done so already, I formally convict Mr Abbas Choukeir of all three of those offences. 
6. It is now for me to sentence Mr Choukeir for the three crimes. I have heard evidence from the prosecution and the defence and from Mr P Skinner of counsel who conducted the trial and the sentence proceedings as Crown Prosecutor and from Mr M Coroneos of counsel who conducted the trial and the sentence proceedings on behalf of Mr Choukeir. I have briefly described what happened in the accident. I will add a little more detail. 
7. Mr Choukeir obviously realised, as he was driving the car along Burwood Road, that he was about to collide with Mr El Chami because the evidence indicated that he braked his car before the collision. He at least had the idea that the collision might occur rather than colliding without any anticipation whatsoever. His skidding was heard by a witness. There was detected in Mr Choukeir's blood some cannabis. It was a very low reading and I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it impaired his driving. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his speed was at least 80 kilometres per hour. There is evidence suggesting that it was much faster, up to 95 kilometres per hour, but I am content to proceed on the basis that his speed was at least 80 kilometres per hour. Mr Choukeir himself received some injuries and was taken to hospital. 
8. Mr Choukeir was arrested and charged some time after this accident. That occurred on 6 November 2009. After he was charged he was on bail until the trial and I accept his bail conditions were quite stringent. He was on bail until last Friday 19 August 2011 when the sentence proceedings were conducted and his sentence will commence on that date. 
9. Mrs Rhonda El Chami provided a victim impact statement regarding the impact which these three crimes had on her and her family. She and Mr El Chami had been married for almost 22 years. They were obviously very much in love and she described her husband as a wonderful husband and father who was very responsible and always thought before he acted. As Mrs El Chami said- 
""In a split second my life changed, I no longer had a husband, a father for my children. Nicholas will no longer be around to see his children grow up. He never saw Sarah start school and she will never get any more hugs and kisses from her father, from the father that she loved."" 

All the normal things which the children would do with their father they will have to do without the presence of their father in their lives. There has been a financial impact on the family because one of the main sources of income has been lost as a result of Mr El Chami's death. Mrs El Chami describes the injuries which were sustained to James and Sarah. 
10. It is important to say two things about the victim impact statement. First it is difficult for courts to acknowledge but it is very important to acknowledge that a victim impact statement about the death of a family member - such as Mrs El Chami's statement about the death of Mr El Chami - does not affect the sentence which I pass on Mr Choukeir. As the Court of Criminal Appeal said in the case of R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 the "" law already recognises, without specific evidence, the value which the community places upon human life ."" The court went on to say that it would be "" wholly inappropriate to impose a harsher sentence upon an offender because the value of the life lost is perceived to be greater in the one case than it is in the other."" Therefore I acknowledge the impact which the death of her husband has had tragically upon Mrs El Chami and her family. The significant maximum sentence which Parliament has fixed to the crime involving her husband's death already takes into account that a member of the community has been killed as a result of this crime. 
11. The second thing to say about the victim impact statement is by reference to what Mrs El Chami had to say about the injuries to her two children. The evidence which I take into account in sentencing Mr Choukeir regarding the two crimes involving Sarah and James El Chami is the evidence which was tendered in the trial, namely exhibits L and M. When she was admitted to hospital Sarah El Chami was suffering from decreased air entry, pulmonary contusion, a fractured pelvis and a closed head injury. The report in exhibit L confirms that she had multiple fractures in her pelvis and that there was a suspected pulmonary contusion. So far as James El Chami was concerned, he sustained a closed fracture of his left tibia. He had a hematoma on the forehead and a small haemorrhage in his brain. These were indeed serious injuries to be sustained by children who were under eighteen. 
12. It is important in sentencing an offender for the judge to have regard to features which are personal to that offender. That includes an offender's criminal record. In this case Mr Choukeir has a criminal record. He is now twenty-one and was nineteen when he committed these three crimes. He committed minor crimes as a child and then as an adult he was convicted of contravening a domestic apprehended violence order and an assault. He was dealt with for those two offences by a suspended sentence and a bond respectively. He was called up for the breach of those and received intensive correction orders. 
13. He had also been convicted of possessing a prohibited drug and - after this offence - convicted of driving whilst his licence was suspended. His licence had been issued in 2006. In 2007 on the same day it appears he attracted two traffic notices for not complying with the conditions of his licence. In 2008 he got two more driving tickets for negligent driving and disobeying a sign. In 2009 he received no fewer than four traffic infringement notices. They were offences such as not giving a signal, overtaking on the left and disobeying signs as well as failing to give way. It appears that the offence of failing to give way, which attracted a fine of over $200, was committed on 14 May 2009 some four days before this accident. Mr Skinner fairly and appropriately described his record as ""not that good"" but as involving young person's offences. 
14. I need to make a number of observations about Mr Choukeir's previous offences. The first is that they do not aggravate the offences themselves. The second is that he does not have a completely clean record so that in my opinion the absence of a clean record means that he cannot claim that in his favour for leniency. The third is that they are, as Mr Skinner said, a young man's offences. He has not committed serious driving offences such as drink driving or offences which have attracted the court's attention, but on the other hand his driving has displayed a degree of carelessness and inattention to the need to be responsible in controlling a car. To my mind this means that to some extent, not a great extent, there should be taken into account by me as the High Court said in Veen v The Queen No 2 (1988) 164 CLR 465 a need to protect the community and some element of personal deterrence for Mr Choukeir. 
15. There are two sources of information about Mr Choukeir's personality. One is a presentence report which was prepared on 15 August 2011 by a Probation and Parole officer. Mr Choukeir comes from a close and loving family and has had a good upbringing. He spent some time in his earlier teenage years in Lebanon because of an illness which his mother was suffering. On his return to Australia he began, as the report said, "" mixing with unsuitable peers, binge drinking and smoking cannabis. "" Mr Choukeir acknowledged to the Probation and Parole officer "" the impact of his offending behaviour on the victims, their family and on his own family. He stated that he took responsibility for his behaviour and would accept whatever punishment was handed down by the Court ."" The Probation and Parole officer summarised her conclusions as follows - 

"" Mr Choukeir presents as an intense young man whose formative years were disrupted by his mother's serious illness, subsequent treatments and the relocation of the family to another country and another culture. It would appear that he failed to adjust to the changes imposed on him and sought escape through risk taking behaviour, alcohol and drug use. He nevertheless appears to continue to benefit from the strong support of his family and has reportedly matured and taken responsibility for his offending behaviour ."" 

16. There has also been tendered by Mr Coroneos on behalf of Mr Choukeir a report from a consultant forensic psychologist, Tim Watson-Munro. Mr Watson-Munro found that there was a "" high level of psychological distress "" which Mr Choukeir was suffering. Mr Watson-Munro said it was clear that Mr Choukeir was "" suffering severe depression, ongoing anxiety, hypervigilance to danger, very low self esteem, sleep disturbance, diurnal variation of mood and a sense of despair regarding the future ."" Mr Watson-Munro was of the opinion that treatment was warranted. He thought that "" Mr Choukeir had been severely traumatised as a child when he was sent to Lebanon at the age of ten years ."" It was associated with a serious condition which his mother was then suffering. Mr Watson-Munro concluded that "" with appropriate treatment, supervision and structure in his life his overall prognosis from a forensic perspective is positive ."" Mr Watson-Munro was more guarded in terms of his clinical situation in the setting of the magnitude of what has occurred. 
17. I have taken into account a series of character references which Mr Coroneos has tendered which indicate that Mr Choukeir is well regarded by his friends, family and within the community. Some of them noted the impact which the crimes have had on Mr Choukeir pointing out that he was genuinely remorseful or incredibly remorseful. I accept this as evidence of Mr Choukeir's remorse along with the references to that in the other reports. As Mr Coroneos realistically acknowledged it is not also supported by sworn or affirmed evidence from Mr Choukeir. Nevertheless it is clear that he is remorseful for what has happened and accepts responsibility for his actions and for the impact which it has had on others. He is keen to develop his education and training and has been in employment. 
18. One thing which is important to observe is that when Mr Choukeir committed these crimes he had been to Court about a week earlier where he had received the suspended sentence and the bond for contravening the apprehended violence order and for the common assault. These had been committed on 3 May 2009, about two weeks before the crimes I am sentencing him for. The significance of this is that when Mr Choukeir committed the crimes that I am sentencing him for he was on conditional liberty. That means that a Court instead of sending him to gaol for contravening the apprehended domestic violence order and for the assault had let him free into the community on the condition that he behave himself. Despite that it would appear that on 14 May 2009 he had failed to give way and then on 17 May 2009 he committed these crimes. 
19. I accept, as Mr Coroneos correctly pointed out, that the crimes that he was on conditional liberty for are not of the same type as this serious offending. Nevertheless he was at large in the community on the promise to the Court that he would behave himself. Despite that promise he had obviously taken some cannabis - I repeat I do not accept it impaired his driving - and was driving at 30 kilometres per hour above the speed limit along a suburban road which had intersections where other cars were entering such as the El Chami's car. 
20. Mr Coroneos provided detailed and very helpful written submissions. He addressed the factors contained in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I have already indicated what my position is so far as Mr Choukeir's previous record. 
21. I agree with Mr Coroneos that here the emotional harm loss or damage caused by the offence could not be described as substantial. I immediately add that it was obviously substantial so far as the family and the victims were concerned. The word "" substantial "" used in the legislation that I am referring to means significantly over and above the normal tragic results which follow from crimes such as the ones which Mr Choukeir committed. Those results are encompassed by the maximum sentences which Parliament fixes and are therefore taken into account when I fix the sentences. I agree with him that there is also encompassed in the penalties fixed by Parliament the fact that the offences were committed without regard for public safety and that is not an additional aggravating feature. I agree with him that there are here three offences that I am sentencing him for so I do not take into account the aggravating factor which the legislation encompasses that an offence involved multiple victims or a series of criminal acts. 
22. Mr Choukeir was regarded well as I have said amongst his friends, family and within the community so he can be regarded as a person of good character qualified as that is by his driving record. 
23. I regard his prospects of rehabilitation as good although I regard whether or not he is likely to re-offend as guarded. 
24. General deterrence is obviously very important so far as these crimes are concerned and I have particular regard to what the Court of Criminal Appeal said in Regina v Musumeci (NSWCCA unreported 30 October 1997). As Hunt CJ at CL said in that case there is a need for public deterrence in this type of case. Such is that need that "" the youth of any offender is given less weight as a subjective factor than in other types of cases ."" Courts must "" tread wearily in showing leniency for good character in such cases."" 
25. Both Mr Skinner and Mr Coroneos devoted some time to the guideline judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252. In Whyte , the Court of Criminal Appeal referred to a frequently recurring case of an offence under s 52A of the Crimes Act 1900 which, if I have not mentioned, these offences were committed under. The death of Mr El Chami was an offence against s 52A(1)(c) of the Crimes Act and the offences involving Sarah and James El Chami were against s 52A(3)(c) of the Crimes Act . Returning to the frequently recurring cases, they involve a young offender as Mr Choukeir is and they involve a person of good character with no or limited prior convictions. 
26. I accept that he is of good character but he is not a person with no prior convictions. His prior convictions are limited to traffic infringements and I have already made my observations about those. The offences obviously involve the death of Mr El Chami and serious injuries to two of his children. The El Chami family was not known to Mr Choukeir. There was limited injury to Mr Choukeir himself and I accept that he was genuinely remorseful. However he did not plead guilty. He defended the trial. It is very important for judges to make clear that an offender does not have their sentence increased because they choose to defend a charge. What they lose is the discount which a judge will allow in a sentence for an offender saving the Court system, the community and the victims of crimes what is involved in a defended trial. Mr Choukeir will not have the benefit of that discount. Mr Coroneos argued that the issues in the trial were limited. He is right but the issue was a very important and significant one, namely whether the manner of his driving involving the speed alleged, amounted to dangerous driving. The trial involved some days and required Mrs El Chami and one of her daughters to give evidence as well as police and experts. 
27. There are certain factors referred to in Whyte's case by the Court at [216], which Mr Skinner and Mr Coroneos addressed. Here the degree of speed was at least thirty kilometres per hour above the fixed limit of fifty kilometres per hour. It was a busy suburban street. There were other streets that came on to Burwood Road. The sort of accident which Mr Choukeir caused was just the kind of tragic result which can happen when people drive at the sort of speed he was doing along a busy suburban road such as where the accident happened. 
28. He was driving with cannabis in his blood. Mr Skinner fairly acknowledged, it did not involve any impairment and I accept that. It is relevant to take into account that Mr Choukeir was choosing to drive at the time when he must have known that he had been taking cannabis. I would not describe his driving as erratic, although it was clearly dangerous. Nor was the driving competitive nor did it involve showing off. He was not ignoring warnings and the distance was relatively short. 
29. Mr Coroneos argued that the seriousness of the offence could be regarded as low to medium range and Mr Skinner argued that it was more like medium. Mr Coroneos acknowledged that the offence was more likely in the medium range for offences of this kind. 
30. I should say that it is clear to me that no other sentence than imprisonment would be appropriate for these crimes. 
31. There are expressions used in Whyte such as "" abandonment of responsibility "" and "" high moral culpability "". As the authorities say these are useful expressions but they are necessarily flexible and they are not meant to be terms of art. I regard the way in which Mr Skinner and Mr Coroneos expressed the level of seriousness of the offences - as being medium kinds of offences for this crime - as appropriate. The speed was significant, as I have said and the place where the driving occurred was likely to put people at risk. I must also take into account - but not as it affects the seriousness of the offence itself - that Mr El Choukeir was on conditional liberty at the time that the crimes were committed. 
32. Taking all those factors into account I regard an overall sentence of five years imprisonment as appropriate and a non-parole period of three years as appropriate. The individual sentences will be accumulated by some six months to take into account the different crimes that Mr Choukeir has committed. I am going to sentence you now Mr Choukeir. 
33. For charge number 2 of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm to Sarah El Chami, I sentence you to two and a half years imprisonment. That will commence on 19 August 2011 and expire on 18 February 2014. That is a fixed term. 
34. For the offence of driving dangerous causing grievous bodily harm to James El Chami, I sentence you to two and a half years imprisonment. That will commence on 19 February 2012 and expire on 18 August 2014. That is also a fixed term. 
35. For the offence of dangerous driving causing the death of Nicholas El Chami, I sentence you to four years imprisonment. That will commence on 19 August 2012. The non-parole period will be two years commencing on 19 August 2012. That will expire on 18 August 2014. The balance of the term will be two years commencing on 19 August 2014 and expiring on 18 August 2016. 
36. I find special circumstances for the non-parole period, which would normally be seventy-five per cent of the overall sentence, being less than seventy-five per cent. Those special circumstances are your age, the fact that you are for the first time in prison and the fact of the effects of the accumulation of the sentences. The first date on which it appears to me that you are eligible for parole will be 18 August 2014. 
HIS HONOUR: Have a seat, Mr Choukeir. Ms Gerber and Mr Zahr, first, have I got the figures right and secondly, are there any other matters of fact or law which could be dealt with under s 43 correcting any errors? There's an additional charge or something, so we'll deal with that separately. First the figures and secondly any corrections or errors. Take your time. 

ZAHR: Would your Honour repeat sequence 2 in relation to the dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm in relation to Sarah El Chami? 

HIS HONOUR: The sentence regarding count 2, Sarah El Chami, two and a half years commencing last Friday 19 August 2011, expiring on 18 February 2014. That's a fixed term. The sentence count 3 for James El Chami, two and a half years commencing six months from now so to speak or from last Friday, commencing 19 February 12, expiring 18 August 14. That's a fixed term. The sentence regarding the death of Mr Nicholas El Chami, four years with a non-parole commencing - and that commences 19 August 2012, one year from last Friday and it overall expires 18 August 2016. Non-parole period expires 18 August 2014, which is the first date it seems to me Mr Choukeir is eligible for parole. 

GERBER: There is just the matter of the 166 certificate. 

HIS HONOUR: We'll come to that, I just want to first be sure that the figures are right. 

ZAHR: They seem to be correct. 

GERBER: Yes your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Are there any matters of fact or law that I should deal with under s 43? 

GERBER: No your Honour. 

ZAHR: No your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: It's a related offence, is that right, that's what we thought. 

GERBER: Yes your Honour, it's sequence 6. 

HIS HONOUR: It's count 006 and driving with illicit drug, is that right? 

GERBER: Correct your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: I heard submissions. Maximum ten penalty units and I can deal with it under s 10A or a fine. I have in mind a fine of $100. Does either of you wish to be heard on that Ms Gerber or Mr Zahr? 

GERBER: I don't wish to be heard. 

ZAHR: No, your Honour. 

37. In respect of the related offence of driving with the prescribed illicit drug present contrary to the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 s 11B(1)(a), Mr Choukeir is convicted and fined $100. 
HIS HONOUR: In a moment I'll just make sure that Mr Choukeir understands the sentences. I'll just provide the exhibits back to my associate, the trial exhibits and the sentence exhibits and the indictments. Mr Zahr, the Corrective Services people say that it is very helpful for a person who is going into custody if Corrective Services have any psychological material. In this case you can assume they have the presentence report. In this case we have Mr Watson-Munro's report and I'd normally arrange for my associate to email or fax such material to the relevant officer. Do you want me to do that in this case? Do you want to get instructions? That's fine if you like. 

ZAHR: I can get some instructions, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Go ahead, I've got things to do here. The idea is it helps in his classification. Now that he's sentenced he has to be classified and when they're classifying people, if they've got material from a psychologist or a psychiatrist or a doctor which indicates any conditions that they have or particular needs that they have, the classification people that assists them, gives them a lot of background. 

ZAHR: My instructions are that he does not wish to proceed with that course of action. 

38. Your overall sentence is five years. There is a minimum of three years that you must serve. It commenced last Friday when you went into custody and therefore it expires on 18 August 2014 and the first date that you'll be eligible for parole is 18 August 2014 and that's a matter for the Parole Authority whether or not your get parole. Do you understand that? 
OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Do you want some time with your family? The Corrective Services are in charge of you, not me, but if you want some time with your family they may allow you just a minute or two after I go off the bench. 
I'll now adjourn. **************

		08 September 2011",2011-08-23 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709271,R v Perish; R v Lawton; R v Perish [2011] NSWSC 1135,"EX TEMPORE Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: Mr Terracini SC for the accused, Andrew Perish, makes an application that there is no prima facie case against Andrew Perish and that a verdict of not guilty should be directed. 

2I will deal immediately with the principal submissions made on behalf of Andrew Perish as the jury is in waiting and the trial should proceed without delay. 

3Andrew Perish has pleaded not guilty to the charge that he, with Anthony John Perish and Matthew Robert Lawton, between 1 January 2001 and 17 November 2001, did conspire to murder Terrence Falconer. In order for the jury to find the accused guilty of that charge the Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt each of the following legal elements: 

(1)that there was in fact an agreement between two or more persons to kill Terrence Falconer; and, 

(2)that Andrew Perish participated in that agreement in the sense that: 

(a)he agreed with one or more of Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton that the unlawful objective of the conspiracy, that is the killing of Terrence Falconer, should be carried out; and, 

(b)at the time of agreeing to this, he intended that unlawful objective, the killing of Terrence Falconer, should be carried into effect. 

4Mr Terracini submits that there are, in fact, two conspiracies; the initial conspiracy involving Witness A, he ceasing to be part of the conspiracy. He submitted that there was no evidence of Andrew Perish saying anything to Witness A at the dinner or during the trips in the motor vehicle, which subsequently followed. Mr Terracini argued that there appears to have been a further conspiracy with Witness E to which Andrew Perish was not a participant. 

5The test to be applied in a no prima facie case submission is that referred to in Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; (1990) 171 CLR 207 in the joint judgment of the High Court of Australia where it was said at 212 [11]: 

""The question whether a trial judge may direct a jury to return a verdict of not guilty if, in his or her opinion, a guilty verdict would be unsafe or unsatisfactory was adverted to but left unanswered in Whitehorn v. The Queen . There is no doubt that it is a trial judge's duty to direct such a verdict if the evidence cannot sustain a guilty verdict or, as is commonly said, if there is no evidence upon which a jury could convict: see, for example, Plomp ; Reg. v. Prasad ; Reg. v. R. "" 

Further at 21 4 [17]: 

""It follows that, if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty."" 

6The Crown case must be taken at its highest and it is for the jury, not the judge, to resolve conflicts of evidence: Doney at 215 [18]. 

7The Crown case against Andrew Perish is a circumstantial one. The circumstances include: 


The evidence of Witness A that when Denise Lawton gave him $1 , 000 she said, ""Andrew will come and see you in a couple of days"" (T415.45-48). Between two and four days later, just before lunch, Andrew Perish went to see Witness A at his house in Bringelly. He said he would come back at 7 pm and Witness A should be ready because they would have dinner with ""our mate"" (T416.31-44). He returned around 7 pm and drove Witness A to Newtown where they met Anthony Perish. 

According to Witness A, Andrew Perish was present during the whole of the conversations that he had with Anthony Perish at the restaurant at Newtown. Those conversations included Anthony Perish offering Witness A money to enable him to repair his boat. Witness A testified that Anthony Perish turned to Andrew Perish and asked him if he could give Witness A a couple of grand on the way home. Witness A said Anthony Perish told him where he wanted the boat to be taken. He recounted that Anthony Perish said: 

""I want you to put the boat in. Come up the Karuah River to Bulahdelah. There's a wharf up there, come up to the wharf and I'll be waiting for you just like a fisherman with an esky."" 


Anthony Perish then added: 
""Might be a couple of eskies."" 



Witness A testified that Anthony Perish said something like: 
""...because the cunt might be in a few pieces."" 


Witness A said that there was a discussion at the dinner that a mobile 'phone would be dropped off. On the way home from the dinner Andrew Perish stopped at his place in Eagle Vale and gave Witness A $2 , 000 to commence repairs on the boat. 

Witness A said at some point he would have spoken to Andrew Perish about the quote he had received from Marine Scene for the repairs to the boat (T427.37-428.2). Witness A told him additional work would cost $4 , 000 and Andrew said, ""Just get it done"". 

Witness A gave evidence that the 'phone delivered by Matthew Lawton was not to be used to contact anyone other than Andrew and Anthony Perish (T431.21-24). 

After the dinner at Newtown, Witness A said Andrew Perish visited him at home more than three times. About a week after the dinner at Newtown, Andrew Perish picked up Witness A at his home in Bringelly and drove him to Daniel Perish's home at Rossmore. At Daniel Perish's house he received $3 , 000, which was for the balance of the cost of the boat. Witness A confirmed that Andrew Perish was present when he received that money. Andrew Perish then dropped him back home. 

Prior to receiving the $3,000 , Witness A received $1,500 from Andrew Perish at his home in Greendale Road, Bringelly. Andrew Perish handed him the cash and no one else was present. Witness A recalled that Andrew Perish asked him if he was right for money. Witness A said ""no"". Andrew Perish said he had a couple of grand on him but needed to keep $500. Witness A then received $1,800 from Andrew Perish at his home in Bringelly for his expenses relating to travelling to Newcastle. 

Elizabeth Falconer gave evidence that in March/April 2001 she showed a document, Exhibit F, to Andrew Perish at a hotel in Penrith. The document identified Mr Falconer as being prepared to assist police as an informer in respect of the activities of the Rebels Motor Cycle Club at Dubbo. At the meeting Mrs Falconer and Andrew Perish had a conversation about the death of his grandparents before she showed him the document. She said that she put it on the table and he looked at it. She could not remember if he read the document or not. 

Detective Inspector Ruse gave evidence that he met Andrew Perish on 9 July 2001 during which he recorded that Terry Falconer or Faulkner had admitted to the murder of Anthony and Frances Perish, the grandparents of Andrew Perish. He had a further meeting with Andrew Perish on 30 July 2001 during which Andrew Perish had concerns about the past police investigation and asserted that there may be a cover-up by police and he was genuinely dissatisfied. 

On 26 November 2001, six packages wrapped in blue coloured plastic and bound with wire and duct tape were found floating in various places along the Hastings River and found to contain human remains. Nine months later another package containing human remains was found. It is not an issue in the trial that those remains were that of Terrence Falconer. 

There is evidence from Witness E given during his electronically recorded interview (ERISP) that Mr Falconer's body was cut into pieces at Girvan. 

Witness A gave evidence that during the recorded conversation on 16 October 2002 (exhibit V), Andrew Perish said to him: 

""Nosey, Nosey, nobody knows we done it."" 



Witness B gave evidence that in October 2006 he received a summons to appear before the New South Wale s Crime Commission in respect of their inquiry into the murder of Terrence Falconer. He met with Andrew and Anthony Perish at a time after he received the summons and after he had appeared at the Crime Commission. Anthony's mother and his brother Matthew were present. Witness B said Anthony Perish said to Andrew ""This cunt's been talking"" and Anthony touched his nose at the time. It is the Crown case that the only rational inference to be drawn from Anthony Perish's action of touching his nose was that he was referring to Witness A whose nickname was Nosey. 

According to Witness B he said that Anthony and Andrew stood up and walked across to the other side of the room. He said that after they spoke amongst themselves they returned to the table. Anthony said to him ""And you don't know anything about those police uniforms"" (T178.20). Witness H, at the time of the abduction of Terrence Falconer, was wearing a police shirt. 

8There is ample evidence in my view, taking the Crown case at its highest and in combination, from which the jury could capably conclude that Andrew Perish had the motive to participate in a conspiracy to kill Terrence Falconer and took steps that were aimed at ensuring that its unlawful object, the killing of Terrence Falconer, would be carried into effect. 

9The jury could capably conclude, viewing the evidence as a whole and at its highest, that there was one conspiracy. The jury could also capably conclude that Andrew Perish was a participant in the conspiracy to kill Mr Falconer from its outset. Witness E's evidence of the acts done by Andrew Perish and Matthew Lawton following the abduction of Mr Falconer is admissible to establish that Andrew Perish participated in the conspiracy and the object of the conspiracy was achieved even though Andrew Perish was not present at that time. 

10The jury could also find that during the recorded conversation with Witness A, Andrew Perish admitted that he had participated in the agreement to kill the deceased. 

11Viewing the circumstances that I have outlined in combination and taking the Crown case at its highest, the evidence is capable of satisfying the jury, properly instructed, beyond reasonable doubt that Andrew Perish is guilty of the offence of conspiracy to murder Terrence Falconer.

		22 September 2011",2011-08-24 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709275,R v KJS [2011] NSWSC 1690,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1The offender was found guilty at trial of the murder of his wife. The offence occurred against the background of allegations that he had sexually assaulted his daughter, and it is to protect his daughter's anonymity that his name is not to be published. 

2In the morning of Tuesday, 14 April 2009, he killed his wife in the bedroom of their home at Fairfield West by beating her about the head with a plumber's tool known as a leadbeater. That was not in issue at the trial. It was his case that he was acting under provocation, as the law understands that term, so that he was guilty of manslaughter rather than murder. Indeed, he pleaded guilty to manslaughter when he was arraigned at the beginning of the trial, but the Crown did not accept that plea in discharge of the indictment. Provocation was the only live issue left to the jury. 

Facts

3It is not necessary to refer to the evidence at the trial in any detail, although the parties are in dispute about the facts I should find for the purpose of sentence.

4The offender and the deceased began a relationship in 1990. Their daughter, the subject of the sexual assault allegations, was born in the following year. By then the relationship had broken up, but they got together again about 4 years later and married in 1996. They had two more children, a boy and a girl. I shall refer to their first born child as the offender's daughter, and to the others as the younger children.

5The evidence of family members and friends was that the offender was a quiet, reserved person, whereas the deceased was a strong personality, outgoing and feisty. Their relationship appeared to be normal. However, in evidence the offender gave a different account of their interaction in the privacy of their home. He said that the deceased was very much the dominant party in the relationship, and that she was controlling of him and sometimes aggressive towards him. She did not get on with his family and, out of loyalty to her, he limited his contact with them. He said that he did not disclose any of this to others because it would have been wounding to his ego to do so. 

6His evidence, broadly supported by other witnesses, was that he was never violent towards her. There was an occasion in 2005 when he was very angry with her, and ""trashed"" the bedroom of the house in which they were then living and destroyed items of her property and personal effects. This appears to have been an isolated incident. There was also evidence that she told a friend of hers that he could be violent towards her. That, of course, is hearsay material which is difficult to assess, and I would not place any weight upon it.

7Importantly, his daughter gave evidence that he had sexually abused her between 2003 and 2008. Without going to the detail of her evidence, she alleged a pattern of sexual interference which began with indecent touching and progressed to sexual intercourse, attempted or completed. She told no one about this behaviour until after she had left the family home in 2008. For a considerable period of time thereafter the deceased refused to believe her allegations, and strongly supported the offender in his denial of any such conduct. However, her position changed in the early months of 2009 leading up to the killing. 

8This change was at the heart of the circumstances giving rise to the murder, and was central to the offender's case on provocation. As will be seen, his evidence was that on the morning in question the deceased said something to convey to him that she no longer believed him and accepted their daughter's allegations, and that it was this in particular which caused him to lose his self-control. The jury were invited to assess the daughter's evidence because whether or not she was telling the truth was relevant to the gravity of the provocation occasioned by what he alleged the deceased said. Obviously, if he were innocent of any sexual wrongdoing, what she said to him would be more hurtful than if he were not. 

9However, it is not necessary for me to assess the reliability of the daughter's evidence for present purposes, and I do not propose to do so. The offender has been charged with offences arising from her allegations, and is yet to face trial for them in the District Court.

10The Tuesday on which the killing occurred was the day after the 2009 Easter break. It is apparent that over that break the marriage was in serious trouble. Quite apart from the deceased's growing suspicion about the offender's sexual assault of their daughter, she came to believe, perhaps wrongly, that he was having an affair. This arose from his contact with an old girlfriend on Facebook on Thursday, 9 April. They argued about the matter and he denied having an affair. 

11There was talk of divorce, certainly on his part. The atmosphere in the home was tense. The family had planned to spend the Easter weekend with friends on the central coast. In the event, he did not go and the deceased travelled to the central coast with the younger children. However, they returned on the Sunday night, 12 April, because she was unwell.

12The offender's evidence was that on the Monday, 13 April, there was further talk of divorce and the atmosphere between them remained tense, but otherwise nothing of note occurred. In particular, there was no confrontation between them. However, in the early evening he sent a text to the proprietor of a plumbing business where he was employed, saying that he had ""bad family problems"" and would be off work for the rest of the week. Later in the evening, the deceased sent a text message to one of the friends with whom she had been staying on the central coast, saying ""the shit hit the fan."" However, later again that evening, she called the same friend and spoke to him about the offender wanting a divorce. According to the friend, they spoke for about 10 minutes and she did not sound frightened or upset.

13Let me turn, then, to the evidence of the events of Tuesday, 14 April. According to the offender, he had slept downstairs in the loungeroom on the night of the Monday. On the Tuesday morning he went upstairs to the bedroom he shared with the deceased. The atmosphere had not improved, and they argued. He said that he wanted to go away, so that they could try to sort things out. She said that she hated the way he treated her, and that he did not care about her or the children. 

14He said, ""Don't forget I picked you over my parents, over my family."" By that he meant that he had put up with the fact that she resented his family and, even though that resentment was unjustified, he had supported her. She retorted that she had picked him over their daughter. He took that to mean that she no longer supported him in his denial of their daughter's allegations and, in fact, believed that she was telling the truth. He pleaded his innocence of the allegations, but she said, ""That's it, I am taking you for everything."" She said that she would be taking the house, the children, the car, ""the whole lot."" She pushed him, he tripped over something and fell. He got up and, as he put it, he ""saw red.""

15In his evidence, he accepted that it was then that he seized the leadbeater and attacked her with it, although he professed to have no memory of doing so. The leadbeater was a tool which he had had for some time in his trade as a plumber, although it was not used in the course of his employment at the time. His evidence was that, before they moved to the home at Fairfield West, the deceased used to keep a baseball bat in their bedroom for protection, presumably against intruders, but that was misplaced when they moved houses and he gave her the leadbeater to replace it.

16The deceased had died by the time police arrived at the house later in the day. She was lying on the floor of the bedroom near the ensuite, and the bloodstained leadbeater was lying next to her. Underneath her upper body was a doona, which was bloodstained. A physical evidence officer noted that there was no sign of spatter from projected blood in the area, as might have been expected. He thought it likely that this was because her head was covered by the doona either before the attack or, at least, after the initial blow. The offender accepted that he had done that, although again he said that he could not remember it and he could offer no explanation for it. 

17The younger children were present in the house at the time. They did not give evidence at the trial, but videotaped police interviews with them were played to the jury. The effect of their evidence, particularly that of the young girl, was that the offender walked up the stairs to the main bedroom, and returned quite shortly thereafter, looking shocked and ""rushed."" They did not hear anything suggesting a violent incident, such as raised voices or the sound of fighting. The offender said that their mother had ""gone back to sleep."" He put them into the family car, drove to the home of an aunt, and asked her to look after them for a few hours.

18In the early afternoon he spoke to members of his family by mobile phone. The effect of what he told them was that he had killed the deceased, and that he was going to burn the house down and kill himself. His sister contacted police, who went to the home. When they arrived, he said, ""My life is over. You might as well arrest me now."" He said that he had killed the deceased, and that she was upstairs in the bedroom. He was conveyed to Fairfield Police Station, where he admitted having struck her with the leadbeater. In evidence, yet again, he did not deny that he made that admission but claimed to have no memory of it.

19Consistently with his phone conversation with members of his family in the afternoon, police found a jerry can of petrol in the house. They also found a torn up handwritten note in the house and, in the car, two further handwritten notes, one of them addressed to the younger children. The torn up note was later able to be reconstructed. Put shortly, the effect of these documents was an expression of his intention to commit suicide, and an explanation of his actions by reference to his daughter's allegations, which he denied, and the deceased's domination of him in their relationship. In the torn up note he wrote that he had ""no remorse"" for the deceased. The three documents were written in very emotive terms. 

20The offender gave evidence in the sentence proceedings, maintaining his account at the trial. The Crown prosecutor also maintained his stance at the trial. He accepted that the offence was committed in anger and was occasioned by the background disclosed in the evidence, in particular, the daughter's allegations of sexual abuse and the deceased's change of heart about them. Nevertheless, he submitted that I should conclude that the killing was planned. 

21He argued that there had been a confrontation between the offender and the deceased on the Monday night and, in all probability, it was then that he decided to kill her. He relied on the text message from the deceased to her friend, saying ""the shit hit the fan."" He also said that it was consistent with the offender's text message to his employer that he would be off work for the rest of the week.

22The Crown prosecutor also relied upon the evidence of the younger children that on the Tuesday morning the offender was upstairs in the bedroom only for a short time, and that they did not hear anything suggestive of an altercation or a fight. This evidence, he said, was inconsistent with the offender's account of what happened in the bedroom. He argued that I would reject the offender's evidence that the leadbeater was kept in the walk-in wardrobe, and would conclude that he had taken it with him to the bedroom for use as a weapon. Finally, he argued that the offender placed the doona over the deceased's head to contain blood spatter, and that this showed that he had given some thought to the method of killing.

23In response, Mr Button SC, for the offender, noted that late on the Monday night the deceased had a phone conversation with her friend about the marital situation and did not appear to be frightened or upset. This, he said, was not consistent with there having been a confrontation with the offender. The evidence of the younger children that on the Tuesday morning the offender was in the upstairs bedroom only for a short time should be approached with caution, given their ages. That they did not hear anything could be explained by the fact that, on their own evidence, they were downstairs watching television at the time. Mr Button argued that there was no reason not to accept the offender's evidence about the leadbeater being kept in the bedroom. 

24As to placing the doona over the head of the deceased, he pointed out that the multiplicity and nature of her injuries identified at a post-mortem examination suggested a frenzied attack, during which the offender was likely to have acted irrationally. He suggested that he might have covered her head so as not to see her face as he attacked her. However that may be, he argued, the offender did nothing to conceal his crime. Police observations suggested that he had made an attempt to wipe up some blood deposited in the ensuite area, but that was far from successful. The bloodstained leadbeater was left in the bedroom, and the offender made no attempt to flee from the area. These features, he submitted, were not the indicia of a planned killing. He added that the handwritten notes demonstrated that the offender was in a highly emotional state.

25I have given this important issue careful consideration. I could not sentence the offender on the basis that the killing was planned unless I was satisfied of that fact beyond reasonable doubt. For the reasons identified by Mr Button, I am not. This is not to deny that I have reservations about aspects of the offender's account and about the extent of his professed lack of memory of the killing and of his later admission at the police station. As to that matter, however, I am mindful of the observation of Ms Anna Robilliard, psychologist, who prepared a report for the sentence proceedings, that his ""stated inability to recall the exact details and sequence of events of the assault is plausible given his highly emotionally aroused condition as it is well recognised that memories are not well laid down or consolidated when the brain is in a highly emotionally aroused condition."" 

26The offender will be sentenced upon the basis that the killing was spontaneous and was the product of a loss of self-control. This is not inconsistent with the jury's verdict, which necessarily rejected provocation. To have found the offender guilty of manslaughter on that basis, the jury would have to have found it reasonably possible that, having regard to all the circumstances, an ordinary person in his position could have lost self-control so far as to have formed the intent requisite for murder. It was well open to the jury to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that objective test had not been met. 

Subjective case

27The offender was 36 years old at the time of the offence, and is now 38. He has no prior convictions. The psychological report discloses a normal upbringing. He completed the Higher School Certificate, obtained his qualification as a plumber, and was in consistent employment thereafter. There was a body of character evidence at the trial, which portrayed him as a decent man, quiet, reserved and industrious. He had no history of violence. Indeed, personality testing conducted by Ms Robilliard led her to conclude that he was of a ""dependant, avoidant predisposition.""

28His account of the offence and its background to Ms Robilliard led her to conclude that his ""remorse and distress over killing his wife appeared to be genuine and heartfelt."" She added that he said that he ""misses her and recognises his children and her extended family have also lost a loved one."" In his evidence in the sentence proceedings he expressed remorse in similar terms, and I also accept it as genuine. 

29Since being in custody he has worked consistently in building maintenance, sometimes using his skills as a plumber. He also wishes to undertake further education and training through TAFE as it becomes available. His family visit him regularly and remain supportive of him. He has also had visits from the younger children, although these have been infrequent and under supervision. He would appear to have good prospects of rehabilitation.

Victim impact statements

30I received victim impact statements from both of the offender's daughters, who read them to the court through a videolink. I also received statements by the deceased's sister and brother, which were read in court by her niece.

31These statements were a moving testament to the grief and outrage the deceased's family has experienced as a result of her violent and untimely death, and of the enduring effects this dreadful crime has had upon their lives. They all have my deepest sympathy. I can only hope that the conclusion of these proceedings will be a step towards their coming to terms with this tragedy, but I am well aware that nothing this court can do could assuage their pain. 

Sentence

32This was, of course, a serious crime. The facts speak for themselves. Spontaneous as the attack was, it was a brutal assault. I am satisfied that the offender intended to kill the deceased but, given his emotionally charged state and his loss of self-control, that finding does not have quite the significance it might have in other cases. In all the circumstances, I find the objective gravity of the offence to be significantly below the mid-range. For that reason, and in the light of the offender's favourable subjective case, I would not impose the standard non-parole period for this crime. 

33I take into account the offender's remorse. Consistently with that remorse, I also take into account the fact that he has never denied criminal responsibility for the death of his wife, that he pleaded guilty to manslaughter (and, as I understand it, was always prepared to do so), and that the trial was conducted on the basis that provocation was the only issue. 

34I have regard to his prior good character. In so doing, I put aside his daughter's allegations of sexual abuse, which he denies and for which he is yet to be tried. This offence of murder was the product of a combination of circumstances at the relevant time, and was clearly out of character. I do not believe that the offender is a danger to the community, and I think that he is unlikely to re-offend.

35The Crown prosecutor provided me with statistics for sentence for murder over the years since the introduction of the standard non-parole period. Mr Button provided me with a Public Defenders' schedule of sentences in broadly comparable cases, extending from 1991 to 2010. I have had regard to this material but it is not necessary to refer to it in these remarks. 

36I have determined that the appropriate sentence is imprisonment for 20 years, with a non-parole period of 15 years. I do not find special circumstances warranting a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. Any lesser non-parole period would fail to reflect the offender's criminality, and the sentence I propose leaves a substantial period of parole eligibility to foster his rehabilitation. He has been in custody since his arrest on 14 April 2009, and the sentence will date from that day.

37The offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 15 years, commencing on 14 April 2009 and expiring on 13 April 2024, and a balance of term of 5 years, commencing on 14 April 2024 and expiring on 13 April 2029.

2709294,Regina v Andrew Dean MCINTOSH [2011] NSWDC 160,"Judgment

Introduction:


	
	The offender, who is now aged 53 years is a persistent and dangerous paedophile. He first came before a court on 29 June 1988 when he was charged with 11 offences which included allegations of homosexual intercourse with a boy and offences of indecent assault. These offences were committed in 1985 and 1986 on the boys who was nine. At the time of the trial the boy was 12 years old. The offender was convicted of indecent assault offences and acquitted of offences of homosexual intercourse.
	
	
	The facts on which he was convicted established that he was engaging in acts of simulated homosexual intercourse with the boy. What he was doing was in fact similar to what he had done to child victims in Inverell, before he went to live in Grafton.
	
	
	The majority of the offences of which he was convicted were committed in a converted bus in which he was living. At the time he committed these offences, he was, at the request of the parents of the boy, caring for the boy whom he assaulted. He had insinuated himself into the family of this boy and had become so trusted by them, that he was managing their family business as well as caring for the boy whom he abused sexually.
	
	
	These offences were committed in Grafton, a town to which he had gone to live when he decided to leave the town of Inverell at the end of 1984 or early in 1985. It is significant, in my opinion that these offences were committed relatively soon after he had moved to Grafton because during the period he lived in Inverell from 1977 till the end of 1983, he had committed similar offences against three boys. Those offences were the subject of his most recent trial before me.
	
	
	This most recent trial resulted in his conviction on 18 counts, being six counts of buggery, eight counts of indecent assault and four counts of common assault. These offences were committed between November 1977 and March 1983.
	
	
	At his first trial before me, a trial concerning offences committed while he had an association with Barker College, he was convicted of 24 offences, being two counts of gross indecency with a male under the age of 18 years, two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, 13 counts of aggravated indecent assault, three counts of indecent assault and four counts of homosexual intercourse with a male aged between 10 years and under 18 years. These offences were committed between April 1991 and 28 January 1992. These offences were also committed whilst he was on parole for the offences that he committed in Grafton in 1985 and 1986.
	
	
	A fair summation of what occurred was that he committed child sex offences in Inverell, left the town, going to Grafton and then within a short period committed further child sex offences in Grafton. Following his conviction in 1988 he served a non-parole period which was in fact less than two years and within a short time of his release, he committed further child sex offences against Sascha Chandler whilst he was a pupil at Barker College. He also committed sexual assault and assault offences against two other boys at Barker College in this period. These offences were not separately charged against him, but these two former pupils were called to give evidence against the offender with a view to establishing that he had a tendency to commit sexual assault and assault offences against boys.
	
	
	The offences in all three periods had similar features. He gave gifts to the boys, he brought excitement to their lives, he ingratiated himself with their families, he told the boys to trust him, he assaulted them, he anally penetrated some of them and he indecently assaulted all of them. He told all of them not to tell anyone and he made threats to some of them.
	
	
	He was a man of considerable talent. He had qualifications as a mechanic, in electronics, agriculture and photography. He could shoot a rifle, he had experience and training in the use of explosives, he was capable of carrying out building work, he could ride a motor bike, he could abseil, he could scuba dive. He had a strong personality and he achieved dominance over each of his victims.
	
	
	In my opinion he presents a continuing threat to society because he is an unrepentant paedophile, who has spent a lifetime committing paedophile offences against boys. He is also someone who enjoys as part of his sexual activity, the infliction of physical pain on his victms.
	
	
	When he first came to trial before Maxwell J in the Supreme Court, he presented as a young man who was likely to rehabilitate himself. A probation officer spoke well of him as did a number of people who were called to give evidence on his behalf. The Judge sentenced him on the basis that he was likely to rehabilitate himself and a short period in custody would be a sufficient punishment. It is perfectly obvious, in my opinion, that he had no intention at all of rehabilitating. Indeed, he demonstrated by his conduct in commencing to commit further child sex offences whilst on parole that he did not intend at all to rehabilitate himself and I see no evidence that there is any likelihood of his doing this at any time.
	
	
	He gave evidence in each trial before me, denying that he had committed any offences at all. The jury rejected his claims and in my opinion they were correct to do so. His evidence in each case was clearly false. His continuing refusal to accept that he did anything wrong makes him a continuing danger to our society.
	


Details of the offences he committed

Offences at Inverell


	
	There were three victims at Inverell. Because it is important to give them continuing anonymity, they will be known as M, S and P. I prohibit any publication of their real identities.
	


(M)


	
	Relationship with M (aged 15 or 16) M first met offender at a mini motorbike club for children. The offender frequented this venue and struck up friendships with numerous children there. The offender would also frequent and hang around a small shopping area called ""Wade Street shops"", and a park across the road, where the victim and other children would congregate after school.
	
	
	The offender would buy the victim cigarettes and drinks from the shop. The offender would also have children over to his property, ""Lorraine"", where they went shooting and rode motorcycles. The victim attended such events on numerous occasions. The offender also took the victim jet skiing at Copeton Dam.
	
	
	When the victim was 15 or 16, the offender took him to Sydney where they stayed in Manly at the offender's parents house and attended Luna Park.
	
	
	When the victim was 18 he purchased an XC utility motor vehicle off the offender.
	


Offender's Relationship with Victim's Family


	
	The offender met the victim's parents through the mini motorbike club. The victim's father also helped the offender chop wood on the offender's property ""Lorraine"". On one or two occasions the offender attended the victim's house for tea and lunch at the invitation of the victim's parents.
	


Circumstances of the Offences

Offence at Lorraine #1


	
	When the victim was 15 or 16, the offender invited him out to his property, ""Lorraine"". The offender drove the victim out there. The victim was by himself and there was no one other than the offender living at ""Lorraine"". In the bedroom of the offender, the offender told the victim that he was going to show him how to put a condom on. The offender masturbated the victim (Count 4), put the condom on the victim and read the instructions from the packet. The offender justified such actions by saying that he ""was a friend"" and doing the victim a favour by teaching and making the victim ""feel comfortable"" using a condom.
	


Offence at Lorraine #2


	
	On a return visit to Lorraine (a couple of months later) when the victim was 16, the offender was aware that the victim had a girlfriend .The offender told the victim that he wanted to show him ""how to do safe sex"". The offender was still living alone on Lorraine. Upon arrival they went to the offender's bedroom and the offender enquired into how the victim ""went"" with his girlfriend having been aware that the victim and his girlfriend had sexual intercourse. The offender wanted to know ""how long [the victim] lasted."" The offender greased the inside of his own legs up with Vaseline. The offender, who was naked and lying face down on the pillow, made the victim, also naked, climb onto the back of him and pretend that he was the victim's girlfriend. The offender said ""just think it's K (the victim's girlfriend)"". The victim was made to simulate intercourse between the offender's legs (Count 5).
	
	
	The offender then wanted the victim ""to return the favour"". The offender was made to grease his own legs up with Vaseline and lay face down on the bed. The offender simulated intercourse between the victim's legs until the offender ejaculated (Count 6). The offender then cuddled the victim. The victim made up an excuse to leave. The offender drove the victim home. The victim continued to visit Lorraine for approximately a year after this offence.
	


Offence at Dog Track Lane


	
	On a later occasion the offender picked the victim up from his house in a car and drove him to Dog Track Lane. At Dog Track Lane the offender got out of the driver's side and went around and placed the victim over his knee on the passenger's seat side. The victim was facing the inner console of the car over the offender's knee. The offender pulled down the victim's pants and repeatedly smacked the victim on his naked backside with his hand (Count 7). While doing this, the offender said, ""this is what you get for lying"". The victim believed that he got the flogging ""because he [the offender] didn't like people lying to him. You always had to promise not to lie to him"". The victim resisted the smacking by the offender by kicking his legs out. This resulted in the victim breaking the front windscreen of the offender's car. The offender wanted the victim to pay to repair the windscreen. When the victim said he would tell his mother about the incident, the offender responded ""Oh, you can't do that to me"". The victim did not tell anyone because ""he had that power over you...you just didn't know what he was capable of next. He would give you one flogging or he could give you two. You just didn't know what he did to ya. I was scared of him"".
	
	
	The offender made the victim buy a new windscreen and go out and fit it on his Lorraine property. During this time the offender got upset and, in his anger, walked over to the house saying ""I'm going to teach you a lesson"". The victim believed that the offender was going into the house to get something to harm him with (the victim stated in examination ""you have got no idea what he could get out of that house""). Fearing for his safety the victim ran into the bushes, found a house and asked the occupants for a lift back to Inverell.
	
	
	When the complainant, M, gave evidence, it was clear to me that these events distressed him and all these years later he is still distressed by them
	


(S)

Relationship with S


	
	The offender met the victim outside a cafe in Otho Street called ""Uncle Georges'"". This is a place where children and the offender often congregated after school. The offender would give the children money to buy milkshakes. The offender would also take photographs of the victim and other children racing BMX bikes at a local bike track.
	
	
	The offender took the victim to a property in Tingha to go shooting. The offender also took children from the Inverell BMX Club to Coffs Harbour and Newcastle (2 night visit) for the purpose of participating in races. The offender would take the victim jet skiing on Copeton Dam. In May 1981 the offender took the victim to Sydney with him (2 night visit). The purpose of the trip was so that the offender could settle his father's will. The victim was excited because it would be his first time on a plane. In Sydney the offender took the victim on the ferry to Manly Fun Pier (an entertainment arcade for children). In Manly the offender purchased an Australian Rugby League 1981 badge for the victim.
	
	
	The offender took both the victim and the victim's sister on a trip up to Ballina in his converted bus. During this trip the sister slept on the single bed on the bus and the victim slept in the double bed at the back of the bus that was divided off with a curtain from the rest of the bus.
	
	
	The offender also took the victim on work related trips to Armidale, Tamworth and Narrabri.
	
	
	Eventually, the offender required the victim to go to his house every day after school or meet him at a pre-arranged meeting point. S: ""I had to go straight to his place and wait for him"". The offender would cuddle, kiss and make the victim put his head in the offender's lap. Evidence was also given by the victim of non-consensual intercourse that are not the subject of these charges.
	
	
	The offender stopped his offences against the victim in 1983. The victim still saw the offender because his bus was still at the family home. The offender left the Inverell area in Christmas 1984.
	
	
	The offender had given gifts to the victim. They included a Casio watch, bike helmet, Ruger 223 semi-automatic rifle, Ruger 22 calibre semi-automatic rifle and a motorbike. The offender took back the bike and the rifles when he stopped his offending. The victim gave the offender $121 to ensure the offender had enough money to leave Inverell in 1984: ""I just wanted him out of my life.""
	


Offender's Relationship with Victim's Parents


	
	The offender kept all the photo negatives of the victim on a proof sheet and took them around to show the victim's parents. He would also give photos he took of the victim racing BMX bikes to the victim's parents. The offender and the parents of the victim became quite friendly and the offender would regularly visit them at the victim's home. The offender gained the consent of the parents to take the victim on a trip to Sydney with him.
	
	
	Throughout the period in which the offences occurred the offender would regularly attend the victim's house for tea with the victim's parents.
	
	
	The victim's parents allowed the offender to park a bus on their property while the offender fitted the bus out with a bed, a double bed and cupboards.
	


Circumstances of the Offences

Trip to Sydney


	
	In the hotel room on the trip to Sydney the offender asked the victim whether he ""touched or played with himself"". The offender persistently asked the victim whether he masturbated. The offender then wanted to perform fellatio on the victim, telling the victim, ""that it is alright for blokes to do that, it's called petting, it's fine"". When the victim declined, the offender got angry telling the victim that he was a bad person because he didn't trust the offender. The offender went and got an electric jug cord, took the offender's pants off, bent the victim over the bed and proceeded to whip the victim 8-10 times on his naked buttocks (Count 8). Following the event the victim felt powerless to do anything because he was in an unfamiliar city and knew no one in Sydney.
	
	
	After the assault, the offender then went and got soapy towels and proceeded to lubricate between the victim's legs. He then made the victim lay face down on the bed naked with his legs together while the offender simulated sex between his thighs until the offender ejaculated (Count 9). The victim was too embarrassed to tell anyone of the event upon arriving back at Inverell. His mother noticed he had bruises on his buttocks from the whipping, but he told her a story about hitting himself with a stockwhip to cover up what had happened, because he was too embarrassed to tell her.
	


Work Trip to Armidale


	
	The offender installed washing machines and dryers for Hartman Electrics. On one work related trip to Armidale in late 1981 or early 1982 the victim accompanied the offender. On this trip reference was made by the offender to a water cock to which the victim laughed. This upset the offender and he became ""really aggro"". He took the victim back to the motel room they were sharing and made the victim take off all his clothes. The offender then produced a feather duster (with all the feathers taken off it) which he carried with him and proceeded to strike the victim (assault not the subject of an offence). The offender then performed non-consensual anal sex on the offender (Count 10). The offender was crying and felt as if ""he was going to split me in half"". The offender removed his penis from the victim's anus and ejaculated.
	
	
	The offender threatened the victim that if he told anyone about what occurred he would blow up the family home with his family in it. The victim believed this threat because he knew that the offender had access to cordite, gelignite, fuses, guns and knives. The victim had seen the offender use cordite and gelignite explosives (the victim had on a separate occasion seen the offender purchase gelignite).
	


Work Trip to Narrabri


	
	While working in Narrabri, the offender made the victim go to the chemist to buy a jar of Vaseline. Then the offender took the victim back to the motel room and made him take his clothes off. The offender then laid the victim down on the bed on his back and placed his penis in the victim's anus and had sex until the offender ejaculated (Count 14). The Vaseline was placed on the offender's penis and victim's anus as lubrication.
	


Under Bridge at Gibraltar Range


	
	Driving home from Coffs Harbour, the offender pulled the car over somewhere near Jackadgery. The offender then drove down and parked under a bridge at the bottom of the Gibraltar Range. The offender produced a jar of Vaseline. The offender then placed his penis in the victim's anus and had sex until the offender ejaculated (Count 17). Another car came along and the victim raced off to wash his anus in a creek.
	


Feather Duster Assaults (plus Buggery)


	
	While on a jet skiing excursion to Copeton Dam, the victim accidentally crashed a jet ski into a trailer. The damage was a chip to one of the handle bars. The victim acted as if he hurt himself to prevent the offender from becoming angry. A couple of days later the offender blamed the victim for a crack in the body of the jet ski. The offender proceeded to flog the victim with the featherless feather duster eight times on the bare buttocks (Count 12). The offender then proceeded to have non-consensual anal sex with the victim (Count 13). This occurred in the bedroom of the offender's house at 8 Jacaranda Street. The offender shared this house in Inverell with a Mr. Don McBean.
	
	
	The victim's mother saw the bruising on the victim's buttocks that was the result of the feather duster assault. The victim told his mother that the bruising was caused by a stock whip accident. The victim said he lied because he was fearful about what the offender said about blowing up his family.
	
	
	When the offender heard about the mother's discovery, he flogged the victim again across his backside and legs with the featherless feather duster the offender kept behind the bedroom door of his 8 Jacaranda Street house (Count 18).
	


Trade Show at Warialda


	
	In a parking area near a trade show at Warialda the offender had non-consensual anal sex with the victim (Count 11).
	


Coming Home from Jet Skiing (Motor Oil used a Lubricant)


	
	When coming home from jet skiing at Copeton Dam the offender pulled the vehicle over and insisted on the victim giving him oral sex. The victim could not do and kept dry retching. The offender then used Valvoline Two-Stroke Motor Oil to lubricate his penis and the victim's anus. The offender then proceeded to have non-consensual anal sex with the victim (Count 16).
	
	
	The offences against S were the worst offences the offender committed at Inverell. They were repeated buggery offences and offences of violent assaults. S was still visibly affected by what had happened to him when he was a small boy. The repeated cruelty and violence to this victim was hard to comprehend.
	


(P)

Relationship with Victim


	
	The victim met the offender when the offender regularly started attending the family home for dinner as a friend of the victim's older brother and sister. The victim also regularly saw the offender at the Wade Street shops, local swimming pool and roller skating rink.
	
	
	The offender bought the victim a CB radio so that they could talk at night.
	
	
	On a number of occasions the offender struck the victim on the bottom for doing things that upset him.
	
	
	After the offences took place the victim noticed that the offender was spending a lot of time with S.
	


Offender's Relationship with Victim's Parents


	
	The victim lived with his mother and three siblings. The victim's parents had separated 1-2 years prior to the offences. The offender regularly visited the victim at the victim's home. On these visits he would cuddle the victim and have the victim sit on his lap. The offender continued to visit after the offences took place. The victim's mother maintained a very open door policy with respect to visitors coming to the home.
	
	
	At the time of the offences the victim did not have much to do with his biological father. He looked to the offender as a father figure.
	


Circumstances of the Offences

Kiss at Roller Skating Rink


	
	The victim aged 9 attended the local roller skating rink. At the time of the offence, the victim was seated watching the roller skaters on the rink. The offender was sitting next to him. By this stage they were familiar with each other, due to the dinners at the family home, and the offender asked the victim to kiss him (Count 1). The victim thought it strange but still kissed the offender on the lips. Shortly afterwards the offender engaged in a heated argument with a man who witnessed the offence.
	


Offences at Lorraine


	
	The offender took the victim to his property at Lorraine. The victim was excited to go because his brother and cousin had already visited the property to go shooting. At Lorraine the offender told the victim that he would be sleeping in his bed with him. When in bed the offender asked the victim if he had ever slept naked. The offender and victim ended up naked and the offender started tickling and joking around with the victim. The victim then found himself lying on his stomach, face down on the bed, with the offender on top of him. The offender then started rubbing his penis between the legs of the victim, near his buttocks (Count 2). This lasted about 5 minutes before the victim had a shower.
	
	
	After having a shower, the offender returned to the bed naked and started tickling the victim again. This time with his back lying on the bed, the offender pulled the victim up onto him and parted his legs and started rubbing his penis between the victim's legs close to his bottom (Count 3). The victim asked the offender for a drink in order to be allowed off the offender. The victim went to the bathroom to get a drink and returned to the bedroom, put his pyjamas back on and returned to the bed.
	
	
	These offences also were disgusting and embarrassing. They were not as serious as the offences committed against S or M, but they were degrading and caused the victim to be upset still all these years later.
	


Offences against Sascha Chandler

Relationship with Victim


	
	The victim knew the offender through his participation in the Barker College Cadet Unit. The victim was a student of the school and the offender assisted the school in the running of cadet activities. The victim (15 years old) met the offender in the Easter holidays of 1990 at the school's annual cadet camp at The Grange (a property owned by Barker College in the Blue Mountains). At this camp the victim signed up to a new platoon run by the offender that specialised in medics and radios. The victim joined this specialised platoon because he had ambitions to reach the rank of SUO (the top student rank in the school).
	
	
	Before joining this unit the offender would occasionally give the victim a lift home from school and encourage him to join his new platoon. The drives home started to get longer as conversation between the two moved beyond the topic of cadets. On these occasions the offender would tell the victim to tell his parents that he caught the train and home (rather than tell them that he had been driven home by the offender): ""Mr Chandler, I'll drop you at the top of the street. You tell your parents that you caught the bus and train home, is that clear?"" On a drive home the offender asked the victim to pull his penis out of his pants. When the victim initially declined, the offender responded ""Don't you trust me Mr Chandler? I've got nothing to - I'm not going to hurt you, I just want you to learn to trust me"". The victim eventually complied. This happened on several occasions.
	
	
	The offender would often single the victim out from the rest of the cadet group to assist the offender with various cadet related tasks. This caused the victim to be ridiculed by the other cadets. The offender would often excessively abuse and ridicule the victim for trivial reasons such as unpolished boots. This would cause the victim to cry upon which time the offender would embrace him and tell him ""It's alright Mr Chandler, you know you can trust me, I'm your friend, I'm going to help you"". This occurred nearly every Monday.
	
	
	In early 1991, the offender told the victim to quit his after school job at McDonalds and come work for him installing car stereos, CB radios and phones into cars. The victim spent his weekends with the offender doing this.
	
	
	From June/July 1991 to mid 1992 the offender regularly assaulted (approximately once a month) the victim in the same manner at the offender's house at Towlers Bay. The events were that the victim was ordered to take off his clothes and lay face down on the offender's bed. The offender placed KY Jelly between the victim's legs and then lay on top of the victim's back and simulated intercourse between the victim's legs. During the assaults, the offender would momentarily penetrate the victim's anus with the head of his penis. After the offender ejaculated, the offender would lay face down on the bed and make the victim simulate intercourse between the offender's legs. Following this, the offender would make the victim shower with him. In the shower the offender would touch the victim's body and genitalia.
	
	
	The victim wrote two, what could be best described as ""love letters"", to the offender. Both letters were written on occasions after the victim had been subjected to a series of torment from the offender. The first, was written in 1991 and the second in 1992.
	
	
	The victim explained that he complied with the offender's requests because he was afraid of the offender and his temper (the victim had been beaten on numerous time when the offender had become upset). The offender would also constantly reiterate the need to trust and that if the victim trusted him then there would be rewards. The main reward was that the offender would assist the victim in achieving the high rank of SUO within the Barker College Cadet Unit.
	
	
	After the offender stopped assaulting the victim, the victim still remained in close contact with the victim and the victim's family. Shortly after finishing the High School, the victim moved into the house of the offender, which was located down the road from the victim's family home.
	
	
	The offender gave the victim a character reference when the victim got charged with possession of a small quantity of marijuana. The victim used this in court.
	
	
	Shortly after meeting his current wife, the victim phoned the offender and asked him why he assaulted him as a boy. The offender replied, ""I loved you, I love you, I have always loved you. I never meant to hurt you"". The victim and his wife left the country, and went to the UK, shortly after this phone call was made.
	


Relationship between Offender and Victim's Family


	
	The victim's parents knew of the offender through his involvement with cadet activities at Barker College. The victim often spoke of the offender to his parents and his involvement with the specialist platoon the victim joined. The victim's parents eventually insisted on meeting the offender as a result of their son spending an increasing amount of time with him. The victim's parents met the offender at Barker College for the first time in July 1990.
	
	
	On one occasion the offender invited the victim's parents to his property at Towlers Bay. At this time the victim was spending a lot of time at the offender's home. The parents accepted and the offender gave them a tour around the property.
	
	
	Before the offender knew the victim's parents, he would always drop the victim off at the top of the victim's street when dropping the victim home. As the offender got to know the victim's parents more, the offender would drop the victim off at the house.
	
	
	Towards the end of 1991 and early 1992, the victim's mother would regularly invite the offender into the house for dinner. The offender regularly accepted these invitations. The offender spent Christmas at the victim's home on two consecutive years (1991 and 1992). At the end of 1991 or early 1992 the offender moved into a house at the bottom of the victim's street. He regularly attended dinner at the victim's house (at least once a week, if not several times a week). The victim's mother felt sorry for the offender because the offender lived by himself.
	


Circumstances of Offences

Annual Camp at Singleton (April 1991)


	
	At this stage the victim lived in dread of the offender. The offender made the victim follow him around for the weeklong camp. The instruction was for the victim ""to walk no further than five paces behind him [the offender] at all times"".
	
	
	On the fourth day of the camp the offender became aware that the victim had not been to the toilet. The victim told him that this was because he did not want to use the portaloos. The offender refuted this saying that he must be constipated and insisted on administering the victim a glycerine suppository. The victim protested. The offender told the victim to pull down his pants and made him bend over. After lubricating his latex glove and suppository, the offender inserted the suppository into the victim's anus (Count 1). After doing this, with the victim's pants still down, the offender gave the victim a hug. The offender later joked to other senior cadets about administering the victim a suppository.
	
	
	At the same cadet camp the offender would make the victim shower naked with him in the same cubicle in a remote shower block accessed by the offender's vehicle.
	
	
	The offender also injected vitamin C into the victim's buttocks after having been told that the victim was afraid of needles. After the event the offender cuddled the offender stating, ""you don't need to fear me. You can trust me.""
	
	
	The victim was in fear of the offender throughout the course of the camp.
	


Punishment for Break-In at Rugby Club


	
	While working for the offender a job request was made to install a security system into a Wahroonga Rugby Club. The victim had, in the school holidays, broken into this rugby club with friends and stolen beer and soft drinks. The victim informed the offender of this, to which the offender replied ""I'm going to need to punish you for doing this"". The offender told the victim that next weekend he was going to give him a hiding for what he did. All week the offender kept reminding the victim that he was going to get a hiding on the weekend.
	
	
	The following weekend the offender told the victim that there was going to be a cadet abseiling day on the Sunday and to tell his parents that he was going on a camp for the weekend. The offender drove the victim to his property at Towlers Bay on the Saturday. Once at Towlers Bay, the offenders property was only accessible by boat so they had to take a aluminium runabout out to the property.
	
	
	Once on the property and in the house, the victim pleaded with the offender not to punish him. The offender got angry and demanded the victim take his clothes off. He said ""you told me you trusted me. Now prove that you trust me"" at which point he told the victim to go into the bedroom and get the offender's leather belt off the bed. Upon retrieving the belt for the offender, the offender demanded that the victim get down onto the floor and put his nose on the straw matting. He said ""you are going to get cop ten, ten of the best"". The offender also informed the victim that if he flinched he would get an extra striking. The offender then proceeded to hit the victim ten times with the leather belt. He then told the victim that he had flinched twice and proceeded to hit him two more times (Count 2). The strikes left red welts on the victim's buttocks.
	
	
	After the assault the offender showed the victim some firearms that included a SKK rifle with scope and bipod, 22 calibres pump action rifle and an air gun. He showed the victim how to use the pump action rifle and allowed him to fire it out the window into the ocean.
	
	
	Later that night, after renting two pornographic, the offender placed a spare mattress in the lounge room and played one of the pornographic movies. During the movie, the offender touched the crotch of the victim (Count 3). 30 seconds to 1 minute later the offender told the victim to take off his clothes. The offender went into the master bedroom and came back naked with a small tube of lubricant. The offender then lay down next to the victim and grabbed the victim's penis and his own and started to masturbate both himself and the victim (Count 4). The offender then instructed the victim to take a shower with him. In the shower the offender made the victim wash him down, including the genitals, with soap. The offender then proceeded to wash the victim down with soap, including the genitals (Count 5). The offender then asked the victim to sing ""Stand by Me"" with the offender while still in the shower.
	
	
	The victim then went to bed in the spare room. Sometime during the night the offender grabbed the victim by the arm and made him go sleep with him in the master bedroom. Nothing else happened that night.
	


Four-Night Camp at Pittwater (June/July 1991)


	
	Upon the offender's suggestion and encouragement, the victim (not 16 years old) helped the offender organise a four-night cadet camp during the June/July 1991 school holidays. The camp was set up at Towlers Bay opposite the offender's house on the other side of the water. For every night of the camp, the offender would insist on taking the victim across the water to spend the night at the offender's house.
	


1st Night of Camp


	
	On the first night the offender told the victim to go into the master bedroom, get undressed and get into bed. The offender then produced lubricant and told the victim to lie face down on the bed. The offender then lay on top of the victim and rubbed his penis between the victim's legs (Count 7). During this assault, the offender also momentarily penetrated the victim's anus with the head of his penis: ""one penetration and then out, because I'd flinch and jump and he'd apologise and say it was an accident, and then laugh"" (Count 6). This lasted for 10 minutes until the offender ejaculated. The offender then insisted that they shower together during which time the offender touched the victim's genitals (Count 8). After the shower the victim and offender went back to the same bed. The victim was returned to the cadet camp the next morning.
	


2nd Night of Camp


	
	During the second day of the camp the offender informed the victim that they had to do a mobile phone installation that afternoon at Church Point. Under that pretence, the offender told the victim to get into the boat but instead of going to Church Point the offender took the victim back to his house at Towlers Bay.
	
	
	Upon arriving at the offender's house on the second day, similar events unfolded that had occurred on the first night. Namely, the victim was ordered to take off his clothes and lay face down on the offender's bed. The offender placed KY Jelly between the victim's legs and then lay on top of the victim's back and simulated intercourse between the victim's legs (Count 10). Again, during this assault, the offender also momentarily penetrated the victim's anus. The head of the penis was momentarily inserted into the victim's anus. Again the victim flinched and the offender laughed saying that it was an accident (Count 9).
	
	
	After the offender ejaculated, the offender lay face down on the bed and made the victim simulate intercourse between the offender's legs. After this occurred, the offender made the victim shower with him. In the shower the offender touched the victim's genitalia (Count 11). After the shower, the offender inserted an enema hose into the victim's anus and pumped saline solution into the anus of the victim (Count 18). The victim protested but the offender ignored the protests responding, ""Do you trust me, Mr Chandler?"" After this incident the offender wanted the victim to sleep with him in his bed, but recognising the emotional state of the victim (""I was at the end of my tether""), the offender allowed the victim to sleep alone in the spare bedroom. The victim was returned to the cadet camp the next morning.
	


3rd Night of Camp


	
	After the cadets struck camp on the third day, the offender demanded that the victim get back into the boat to take them back to the offender's house. Upon arriving at the offender's house on the third night, similar events unfolded to that which had occurred on the first two nights of the camp. The victim was ordered to take off his clothes and lay face down on the offender's bed. The offender placed KY Jelly between the victim's legs and then lay on top of the victim's back and simulated intercourse between the victim's legs (Count 13). Again, during this assault, the offender momentarily penetrated the victim's anus with the head of his penis (Count 12). This time the victim screamed and pushed the offender off. The offender assured him that it was an accident. After the offender ejaculated, the offender lay face down on the bed and made the victim simulate intercourse between the offender's legs. After this occurred, the offender made the victim shower with him. In the shower the offender touched the victim's genitalia (Count 14). The victim slept with the offender in the master bedroom. The victim was returned to the cadet camp the next morning.
	


4th Night of Camp


	
	On the fourth day, the victim received a silver Zippo cigarette lighter from the cadet unit in recognition of his efforts in organising the camp (exhibit C2). Again on the fourth day, the offender demanded that the victim get back into the boat to take them back to the offender's house for the night. Upon arriving at the offender's house on the fourth night, similar events unfolded to that which had occurred on the first three nights of the camp. The victim was ordered to take off his clothes and lay face down on the offender's bed. The offender placed KY Jelly between the victim's legs and then lay on top of the victim's back and simulated intercourse between the victim's legs (Count 16). Again, during this assault, the offender momentarily penetrated the victim's anus with the head of his penis (Count 15). Once again the offender assured him that it was an accident. After the offender ejaculated, the offender lay face down on the bed and made the victim simulate intercourse between the offender's legs. After this occurred, the offender made the victim shower with him. In the shower the offender touched the victim's genitalia (Count 17). The victim slept with the offender in the master bedroom. The victim was returned to the cadet camp the next morning.
	


Hawkesbury River (October/November 1991)


	
	In late October/early November 1991 the victim rang the offender up from school using a mobile phone that the offender had bought him. The victim told the offender that he was going to tell his parents, the police and the school about what the offender was doing to him. This enraged the offender, who picked the victim up from school and drove towards Newcastle, to an area around the Hawkesbury River. As the offender started to calm down, the offender explained to the victim that because the victim had been lying to his parents for so long, no one would believe any accusations he made about the offender. At this stage the offender had stopped at a picnic area overlooking the river. They were sitting under a picnic pergola. The victim believed he was going to receive a beating from the offender, instead the offender made the victim masturbate him under the pergola (Count 20). After the offence, the offender drove the victim back home, dropping the victim off at the top of the victim's street.
	


Beating for Conversation with a fellow student


	
	At the request of the offender, Barker College had permitted a storage unit on number 3 oval be used to store the equipment of the specialist platoon. It was called the Bunker and was located away from the Q Store in the school's main campus block. Shortly after the Pittwater camp, the victim and a fellow student were down at the bunker when the fellow student started asking the victim questions about the behaviour of the offender. The fellow student particularly wanted to know why the offender carried around paddles and a ""stinger"" in the back of his car. The victim informed the offender of this conversation. This enraged the offender. The offender got both the fellow student and the victim together and told them that they would both be punished for having broken his trust. The offender told the boys that they were going to get a ""hiding"".
	
	
	The next Saturday the offender took both the victim and the fellow student to his property at Towlers Bay. He had informed the boys to tell their parents that they were staying on a over night camp with other cadets. When they arrived at Towlers Bay, the victim was told to sit on the jetty, while the offender took the other boy up to the house. The victim could hear him being beaten from the jetty. He heard approximately ten cracking sounds. About 10 minutes later the boy came out of the house crying and the offender informed the victim that it was ""now his turn"". At the house the offender told the victim that he was going to get ""ten of the best"". The offender then asked the victim he wanted to be beaten with. The victim chose a wooden paddle. The offender told the victim to pull down his pants. The offender laid the victim over his knee and struck the victim on the bare buttocks with the paddle ten times (Count 19). After the assault the victim sat on the offenders lap crying while the offender cuddled him. The strikes caused red welts ton the victims buttocks.
	
	
	Later on in the day the offender made the other boy and the victim watch an animated video about ""penises and dildos"". That night the victim fell asleep in the spare bedroom but during the night the offender woke up the victim and made the victim sleep with him in the main bedroom.
	


Council Depot (November 1991)


	
	On another occasion the victim rang the offender up on his mobile from school threatening to expose the offender for his actions. Once again, the offender was enraged and picked the victim up from school in his van. The offender drove the victim to a council depot just near Normanhurst Railway Station where he stopped. He told the victim again that no one would believe what he was saying if he tried to expose the actions of the offender and that there would be serious repercussions if he told anyone. The offender then made the victim masturbate him in the front seat of the van (Count 21).
	


Bunker at Barker College (Christmas School Holidays 1991/92)


	
	The victim and the offender regularly spent time alone at the specialist platoon's bunker. During the Christmas school holidays of 1991/92, the victim and offender attended the Bunker together. On this occasion the offender jokingly chased the victim around with a cattle prod. After doing this, the offender insisted that the victim masturbate him. The victim complied to this demand (Count 22).
	


Gardening at McCredie House (December 1991/early 1992)


	
	The victim set up his own weekend gardening business. He was working alone one day during the school holidays at a house owned by Mr and Mrs McCredie when the offender turned up at the property. The offender was angry and upset that the victim was doing independent work, rather than working for him. The offender approached the victim swinging a piece of car tyre. The offender set down the piece of car tyre, took off his clothes and got into a spa bath that was located next to a swimming pool on the property. Once in the spa bath, the offender pulled his board shorts down to his ankles and asked the victim to masturbate him. The victim complied with the request (Count 23). The victim was concerned that the owners of the house would come home and witness the events. The assault lasted approximately five minutes.
	


Australia Day Cadet Camp (January 1992)


	
	The victim and offender attended a two night, Australia Day long weekend cadet camp at a property in Woy Woy. At this camp, the offender parked his van close behind a tent that slept approximately 15 cadets. On the last night of the camp the offender demanded that the victim enter the van and informed the victim that he would be sleeping with him that night in the van. There was a double sleeping bag in the van. The offender got into the sleeping bag and told the victim to do the same so that they were lying face to face. The offender proceeded to masturbate both himself and the victim (Count 24). The victim was very worried about others witnessing this event given the close proximity of the van to the cadets' tent. That night the victim slept with the offender. In the morning another cadet (Andrew Smith) witnessed the victim get out from the back of the offender's van.

	There are many similarities in the offender's pattern of conduct with his victims. At times he showed affection towards his victims. For example the first offence against P involved kissing him on the lips at ice skating rink and at times he would cuddle other victims.
	
	
	The indecent assaults against P, with the exception of the kissing at the skating rink, involved simulated sexual intercourse, the first such offence involving the offender lying on top of the victim who was face down and placing his penis between his legs and the second one involving P and being on top of McIntosh who placed his penis between his legs.
	
	
	Counts five and six, being offences against M also involved simulated sexual intercourse with the additional element that the offender used vaseline.
	
	
	Count four involved an indecent assault on M where the offender masturbated him and used a condom. Similarly, Count 15 involved an attempt to masturbate S.
	
	
	The Grafton trial in 1988 resulted in the offender being convicted of indecent assaults. Three of those indecent assaults, which were alternative counts to homosexual intercourse and attempted homosexual intercourse involving the offender placing his penis between the legs of the victim.
	
	
	During the Inverell trial, evidence was given of assaults on the naked backside of M and S. The assault on Mwas a hand on the bare backside, whilst the assaults on M were firstly with a jug cord and then with a feather duster. All these assaults caused pain and physical and mental damage.
	
	
	The assaults on Sascha Chandler were particularly violent, were on his bare backside and involved the use of a wooden paddle.
	
	
	What made these violent assaults even worse, in my opinion, was that they all had a sexual element to them and were part of the gratification of the offender. This conduct can truly be described as sadistic and humiliating.
	
	
	The offences of buggery and homosexual intercourse were factually identical. They involved in each instance the penetration of the anus of the victim by the penis of the offender. The two victims who received this treatment were S and Sascha Chandler. Each of these offences was carried out in a manner calculated to humiliate the victim and to cause him physical and mental pain. It must be doubtful if the victims will ever recover from the effects of this penetration.
	
	
	The offender managed to gain the confidence of S's mother and father. He was able to live in a bus at the family home and to be present in that home on many occasions. He also gained the confidence of the parents of the other victims. In the case of Sascha Chandler's family, he became a family friend and someone who was invited to attend for Christmas dinner. All the parents of the boys whom he abused, trusted him and permitted him to have access to the boys, believing that he was caring for them. He abused the trust given to him by those parents and in the case of Sascha Chandler, given to him by the headmaster and staff of Barker College. He told lies to the parents and the boys, he manipulated the parents of boys and the teachers at Barker College and at his various trials before me he told lies about his activities.
	
	
	When he was arrested for the offences he committed at Barker College, he was placed in custody, but eventually obtained bail by order of a Supreme Court judge. It was a term of that bail that he reside in a flat in Chatswood and report daily to police. During the course of that bail he absconded by boat, sailing to Queensland and hiding in Moreton Bay until he was eventually discovered and returned to New South Wales in custody. He remained in custody from the date of his arrest in Queensland until the present time.
	
	
	He gave false explanations about that flight at his trial for the Barker College offences. I mention this because it is a further demonstration of the fact that he is a man whose word cannot be accepted.
	
	
	Sentencing him poses many problems, since all of the offences were committed some time ago, and in the case of the offences at Inverell, were committed in the early 1980's.
	
	
	When he was sentenced by Maxwell J in 1988, the sentence seems to have been influenced by a number of factors:
	


Various witnesses spoke well of him.

- A psychiatrist gave evidence about him that was favourable to his rehabilitation.

- A probation officer gave evidence through a report that he was likely to rehabilitate himself

- He was quite young at the time, being about 25 years old at the time of sentence.


	
	Although he was convicted after a trial at which he gave no evidence, and he said and did nothing to indicate that he had any remorse or contrition, Maxwell J formed a favourable impression of him.
	
	
	The sentence he received in 1988 in my opinion, was a very lenient one. Its effect was that he was released after spending 16 months in custody. This was because at that time, remissions were given on sentences and non parole periods, usually of one third, if the particular offender was a first offender.
	
	
	Within a short time of his release, he went to live and work near the upper North Shore area of Sydney, where he was working in an electronics shop. Whilst there, he met some men who were associated with the Barker College cadet unit, who were inquiring about the possibility of setting up an electronics platooon in the Cadet Unit.He told them that he was an old boy of the College. (Apparently he spent a term or two at Barker College as a Boarder, but deliberately behaved badly so that he would be expelled.)
	
	
	As a result of this conversation and representation, he managed to get himself accepted as a Cadet Officer in the Barker College Cadet Unit. Barker College prides itself on its Cadet Unit, one of the largest school cadet units in Australia, with 300 or so cadets, all of whom during the time the offender was a Cadet Officer at the school, were boys.
	
	
	His role in the Cadet Unit was to take charge of a platoon of boys who wanted to specialise in electronics and first aid. He had skills in both of these areas. He could also shoot a rifle, abseil, scuba dive, drive a boat and he had other practical skills. He was charming, dressed well, knew how to get the confidence of parents and teachers and was prepared to assist Sascha Chandler to realise his ambition to become the Senior Cadet Under Officer in the Cadet Unit.
	
	
	Sascha Chandler was a boy of 15 when he met the offender and immediately became captivated by him. I feel that I must congratulate Mr Chandler for his courage in coming forward and telling the police more than 10 years after he had left Australia for England, about what the offender did to him and to others at Barker College.
	
	
	His determination to expose the offender led to the offender being arrested and charged with the offences that led to his trial before me and a jury of 12. Unless he had been prepared to do this, the offender's activities at Barker College would never have come to light.
	
	
	Following the conviction of the offender, Mr Chandler took the most unusual step of insisting that his name be published and of encouraging the media to publish photos of him and personal details.
	
	
	His aim was to encourage others who had been sexually and physically abused by the offender to come forward and there can be no doubt that the complainants in the second trial before me and a jury of 12 came about because the complainants who came forward saw what Mr Chandler had done and decided that they too should come forward. This second trial led to evidence being given of the offender's criminal activities in Inverell, before he went to live in Grafton. I have no doubt that if these events had been known of at the time he faced trial before Maxwell J and a jury of 12 in 1988, he would have been given a more stern sentence than the one he received.
	
	
	In some ways, however, what he did at Inverell was far worse than what he did to Mr Chandler, because two of his victims were very young and the third a very vulnerable teenager. All came from homes where there was a degree of poverty and social dislocation. He photographed them, he dominated their lives, he threatened to kill their families if they said what he had done, he sexually and physically abused them.
	
	
	Part of his sexual gratification stemmed from humiliating them.
	


The Offender- what can be said about him?


	
	He is now 53 years old and will be 54 on 7th December. He was the youngest of 3 children. His father was a successful chartered accountant with some wealth, who owned a home in Sydney and a number of farms in the Inverell area. The picture presented of him is that of a cold man, who spent much time away from his family, dying in Scotland away from them.
	
	
	His mother is now dead, but his brother and sister have continued to support him in many ways. At one point, he lived with his brother in a flat at Chatswood, when he was on bail after his first arrest in Queensland before his first trial before me. His brother put up a surety in a considerable sum for his bail. His brother and his sister were both present on most days of his first and his second trial.
	
	
	I mention these facts because he has made claims to psychologists that he was not close to his brother and sister and yet they clearly have given him much support.
	
	
	He apparently suffered from some form of dyslexia, that made learning a burden to him. He had unhappy years at school and when his parents sent him to Barker College, he contrived to get expelled.
	
	
	Whilst his childhood may have had lonely moments and disappointments, there is nothing that explains his abnormal interest in boys and in particular, his interest in buggery and violence against boys.
	
	
	He then went off to learn about the pastoral industry, working in various jobs until he took over the management of Lorraine, the family farm at Inverell. He appears to have been quite clever, because he learnt to be a mechanic, a farmer, a photographer, a supervisor of building works, a scuba diver, an electronics expert, a first aid expert, an abseiler, a shooter and a trained user of explosives.
	
	
	He could ride motor bikes and drive cars and buses.
	
	
	He claimed in evidence that when he left the Barker College cadet unit, he continued to be involved in cadets with the Australian Army at Victoria Barracks, Sydney.
	
	
	He was 21 or 22 when he first became involved in paedophile crime in Inverell, 27 to 31 in Grafton and 33 to 35 whilst he was at Barker College.
	
	
	Thereafter, until his arrest in Cairns, it is not at all clear what he was doing, but there is evidence that he was charged in 2005 with serious sexual offences allegedly committed in Australia and elsewhere in the world, but those proceedings resulted in verdicts by direction in his favour. I can draw no conclusions against him arising from this, but at his sentencing proceedings, he has given no evidence to show that he has ceased to be interested sexually in boys.
	
	
	He has told psychologists that he has no interest in boys and has never had any interest in boys. I do not believe these claims because his convictions in three separate trials show them not to be true.
	
	
	Two psychologists' reports were presented on behalf of the offender, but he gave no evidence to support the facts stated in the reports and I view them with considerable reservations. Some of the claims made by him in the reports are at odds with the evidence in the trials, particularly his claims that he has never committed any offences of a sexual nature at all. He has expressed a guarded agreement to go to appropriate programmes.
	
	
	The psychologists detected no signs of mental illness nor any other abnormal psychological condition.
	
	
	I have also had regard to a pre-sentence report provided on 30th September 2010. He told the Probation and Parole officer that on legal advice he would not discuss the offences, since he was appealing.
	
	
	The Report recounted information about his childhood and upbringing and that prison records established that his brother and his sister had been regular visitors. He is regarded as a compliant prisoner who is co-operative with the prison authorities.
	
	
	He was assessed for suitability for and access to sex offender treatment programmes and has been assessed as being in the high risk category relative to other male sexual offenders. He would have access to the Custody Based Intensive Treatement Programme ( CUBIT) because he will receive a sentence of more than 18 months imprisonment.
	
	
	The assessment of his having a high risk of re-offending is an actuarial risk assessment, based on a consideration of material known about the offender. He was not interviewed. He had claimed to have be a heterosexual and to have had two relationships of a sexual nature with women, each of less than two years duration. The evidence at both trials over which I presided showed little to support either claim. I would regard his claims that he is a heterosexual as being improbable and contradicted by the facts of both trials.
	
	
	His assessment as having a high risk of re-offending, gives added weight to the need to protect society from him for a significant period.
	
	
	I sought another report in 2011, but the Probation and Parole Service saw no point in providing one because he refused to acknowledge that he had committed any offences.
	
	
	In my view, it is extremely improbable that he has changed his interests. I am of the opinion that he presents a continuing threat to boys and that will change only if he takes some action to make it change.
	
	
	His prior criminal history shows the committing of relatively minor offences of dishonesty as a juvenile, the indecent assault offences on a male child, for which he was sentenced in 1988 by Maxwell J, the possession of a crossbow in 1987, and offences in 2005 of possessing ammunition without holding a licence and having goods in his possession reasonably suspected of being stolen. Prosecutions were also launched against him in 2005 for possession of child pornography and committing indecent assaults outside Australia. Those prosecutions concluded unsuccessfully when the trial judge directed the jury to acquit.
	
	
	His previous convictions in 1988 are relevant to the sentence and I have taken them into account in determining that he presents a continuing danger to society. The other convictions are of little consequence and I do not take them into account. The fact that he came to trial for sex offences in 2005 is of relevance only to explain what he has been doing in and around that period, ie he has been involved in court proceedings. However, whilst that explains, at least in part, how his time has been occupied, it does not provide any material of relevance to the length of the sentences.
	
	
	I want to make it clear that my sentences are in no way aimed at preventive detention. He cannot receive a larger sentence than is appropriate to ensure some form of preventive detention.
	
	
	In Veen (no 2), the High Court of Australia said:
	


""The principle of proportionality is now firmly established in this country. It was the unanimous view of the Court in Veen (No.1) that a sentence should not be increased beyond what is proportionate to the crime in order merely to extend the period of protection of society from the risk of recidivism on the part of the offender: see pp 467,468,482-483,495. And cf. Walden v. Hensler [1987] HCA 54; (1987) 61 ALJR 646, at p 650; [1987] HCA 54; 75 ALR 173, at p 179,.

It is one thing to say that the principle of proportionality precludes the imposition of a sentence extended beyond what is appropriate to the crime merely to protect society; it is another thing to say that the protection of society is not a material factor in fixing an appropriate sentence. The distinction in principle is clear between an extension merely by way of preventive detention, which is impermissible, and an exercise of the sentencing discretion having regard to the protection of society among other factors, which is permissible. The distinction between what is impermissible and what is permissible is at the heart of an illuminating controversy to be found in (1953) 6 Res Judicatae between Mr C.S. Lewis (""The Humanitarian Theory of Punishment"", at p 224) on the one hand and Drs Norval Morris and Donald Buckle (""A Reply to C.S. Lewis"", at p 231) and Professor J.J.C. Smart (""Comment"", at p 368) on the other. The thesis advanced by Mr Lewis was that the retributive theory of punishment - punishing an offender ""because he deserves it"" - prevents the injustices which may be involved in detaining an offender in order, for example, to protect society or to reform the offender. The controversy, the light of which has not been dimmed by later literature, ended with C.S. Lewis' ""On Punishment: A Reply"" (at p 519) in which he acknowledged the importance of protecting society but in this way (at pp 522-523):"" (See Veen v R ( No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465)

Sentencing considerations


	
	I have imposed sentences and an aggregate sentence that reflect the very serious criminality of a persistent, recalcitrant offender who has no remorse for what he has done. At the same time, I have allowed a significant allowance for special circumstances to make it possible for him to leave custody 12 years before the expiry of the aggregate sentence. There must always be some hope that he will change his ways and rehabilitate and he must be offered some inducement to do this.
	
	
	The sentence is obviously a very serious one and appropriate only for a very serious offender, but in my view it is appropriate because the damage done by the offender has been great and his criminality is great. He has blighted directly 4 lives and indirectly the lives of others connected with those 4 men. Their victim impact statements make that clear.
	
	
	The sentences also serve to protect the community for a considerable period and that is an important objective.
	
	
	Over the past 11 years of my life as a Judge, I have frequently encountered evidence by persons addicted to drugs and alcohol that they were the victims of paedophiles when they were young. They have then spent lives feeling worthless, humiliated and inferior. Offenders like the present offender cause immeasurable damage and when apprehended must expect to receive severe punishments.
	
	
	The sentences I impose are designed to protect society. As well as this, the sentences must accord with the usual sentencing principles of general deterrence, specific deterrence, retribution and rehabilitation.
	
	
	It is also necessary that the sentences be proportional to the seriousness of the offences and that careful consideration is given to ensure that there be compliance with the principle of totality.
	
	
	The number of offences is unusually large, the offences are very serious and the time gap between the offences at Inverell and the offences at Barker College make it appropriate that there be some considerable cumulation of sentences. The aggregate sentence reflects that, but it also reflects the principle of proportionality spoken of by the High Court in Veen No 2( supra) and the principle of totality.
	
	
	It must be made clear to all persons contemplating or engaging in predatory sexual behaviour with children that they will receive very severe sentences.
	
	
	Finally, I should make it clear that because the offences of which he was convicted occurred some time ago, the earliest occurring in 1979 or so and the latest in 1992, I have had regard to sentences imposed by courts in those times for these sorts of offences and I have had regard to decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal about sentencing for offences occurring many years ago.
	
	
	I have also had regard to the sentences imposed by Maxwell J on this offender in 1988.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal cases to which I have had regard are contained in a schedule to this Judgment.
	
	
	I have examined those cases carefully. In my opinion, while some of the facts in some of the cases are similar to individual offences in the current trials against the offender, there is no case that could be directly compared, because the offender is a predator who moved from place to place and from time to time carried out these offences. He also behaved with a violence towards some of his victims that was unusually cruel. Nevertheless, I have taken the sentences into account to the extent that I can.
	
	
	None of the offences of which the offender is convicted carry standard non-parole periods, because they all occurred before the introduction into sentencing legislation of standard non parole periods.
	


The Sentences


	
	I formally convict the offender of all offences of which he was found guilty by the juries at the trials before me on 6th July 2009 and 27th May 2011.
	
	
	I have decided to impose an aggregate sentence of 32 years and a non parole period of 20 years.
	
	
	I find special circumstances arising from the length of the overall sentences and the non- parole period and the need to give some incentive to the offender to undertake rehabilitation courses designed to stop sexual offending. He should be offered appropriate courses dealing with sexual offending. If he does these courses and shows convincing signs that he is prepared to do something about his unnatural interest in boys, he should be considered for a lesser degree of custody than maximum security.
	
	
	The sentence and the non parole period will have a deduction from each of 41 days to give allowance to him for a period of time he spent in custody after his first arrest for the offences against Sascha Chandler before a Supreme Court Judge granted him bail.
	
	
	The sentences will date from his second arrest.
	
	
	The individual sentences are as follows:
	


Trial 1- verdicts on 6th July 2009 - offences against Sascha Chandler

Counts 1 and 18 concern gross acts of indecency each of which occurred in a cadet camp. Count 1 involved the offender insisting that Mr Chandler take his pants off and then he inserted a suppository into his anus; Count 7 concerned the insertion of an anal enema during a shower. Mr Chandler was 16 years old

Sentences for each - 1 year imprisonment

Counts 3,4,5,8,11,14,17,21,22,23,24: These were all aggravated indecent assaults involving touching the complainant in the area of his genitalia or engaging in masturbation. The aggravating circumstances were that the complainant was under the authority of the offender. All were unpleasant and unwanted assaults

Sentence for each - 4 years

Counts 7,10,13 and 16: These were all aggravated indecent assaults involving simulating homosexual intercourse. In my opinion, these were worse offences than the other aggravated sexual assaults. The aggravating circumstances were that the complainant was under the authority of the offender. All were unpleasant and unwanted assaults and alarmed the complainant.

Sentence for each offence 6 years

Counts 2 and 19: These were assaults occasioning actual bodily harm, which involved requiring the complainant to remove his pants, bend over and submit to a beating with a piece of wood on his bare backside. The beatings caused severe bruising and soreness and great pain and humiliation.They had an obvious element of sadistic sexual gratification

Sentences for each offence 5 years

Homosexual intercourse - Counts 6,9,12 and 15: These were objectively the worst offences committed by the offender on Mr Chandler. They involved putting his penis in the anus of Mr Chandler. Each offence caused pain, embarrassment and humiliation and each was a crime of the worst type, because of the obvious possibilities of the transmission of disease and the causing of permanent damage to the anus.

Each offence warrants a sentence of 10 years.

Trial 2- offences against 3 boys at Inverell

Count 1- kiss at a skating rink: The offender invited the victim, P, whilst in a public area of a skating rink, to kiss him on the lips. This was his first step into seducing the complainant, it was done deliberately.

Sentence 1 year

Counts 2,3,5,6 and 9 indecent assaults involving the simulation of buggery: These offences involved requiring the victim to take his clothes off and then pretending to penetrate his anus with the penis of the offender. Vaseline was applied to the thighs of the boys and the legs of the offender. These offences were degrading and humiliating.

Sentence for each 5 years

Counts 4 and 15 indecent assaults involving masturbation: In my opinion, whilst these offences are serious and degrading, they are not as serious as the acts of simulated buggery

Sentences: 3 years for each

Counts 7,8,12 and 18 assaults: These were acts of beating the bare backside of the victims, variously with a hand, an electric jug cord and a feather duster. All of the assaults were cruel, inflicted pain and humiliation on the victim and had an element of sadistic sexual cruelty.

Sentences for each offence 2 years

Buggery - counts 10,11,13,14 16 and 17:These were the worst offences committed by the offender on the one victim he chose. They were humiliating, damaging painful and were crimes of the worst type.

		30 November 2015",2011-08-21 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709297,R v Reyniel HERRERA MARCIAL [2011] NSWDC 119,"SENTENCE 

1. Reyniel Herrera Marcial is a very popular entertainer. He specialises in Latin music called Reggaeton. He went to a party on 6 December 2009. He had a lot to drink before and at the party. At 7 o'clock in the morning of 7 December 2009 he came into a room at the house where the party was and found a young woman who was asleep. 

2. What Mr Herrera did then turned him from a popular, well regarded and respected musician into a criminal. He decided that he wanted to have sex with the woman who was asleep in the room. He penetrated her vagina from behind with his unprotected penis and had sex with her until he ejaculated. He did not ask her whether she agreed or not, he simply went ahead and did it. 

3. The woman immediately complained to others at the party and a few days later Mr Herrera was arrested and charged with a crime commonly known as rape. Its technical legal expression is sexual intercourse without consent. It is a crime against s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament regards this crime as so serious that it has fixed a maximum sentence of fourteen years imprisonment for anyone who commits that crime. Not only that, Parliament has fixed to that crime a standard non-parole period of seven years imprisonment. 

4. It is my job now to sentence Mr Herrera. It is important for a judge in sentencing a person to set out their reasons for the sentence so that the offender, the parties to the case and the public know the reasons for imposing the sentence. 

5. Mr Herrera denied that the sexual encounter he had with the young woman was without her agreement. He claimed that she consented. He was interviewed by the police and maintained that claim. He was prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions in a trial before me earlier this year. On 12 May 2011, I convicted him of the offence after a jury had found him guilty of the crime. 

6. One of the important things which a judge has to do in sentencing an offender for a crime that Parliament has fixed a standard non-parole period to is to determine and find where in the range of seriousness this particular crime lies. Is it one of the worst kinds of rapes, or is it in the middle of the range of rape crimes, or is it in the lower part of the range for rape crimes? In this case Mr Ken Gilson of counsel - who appeared as Crown Prosecutor in the trial and in the sentence proceedings - correctly, in my opinion, submitted that the crime committed by Mr Herrera fell below the middle of the range of objective seriousness which is the expression used by Parliament for crimes carrying a standard non-parole period. 

7. Ms Dymphna Hawkins of counsel - who appeared at the trial and in the sentence proceedings for Mr Herrera - argued that this rape, too, fell below the middle of the range of objective seriousness but she said it fell at the very lowest in that range. She said that the offence when it was committed was of short duration and was spontaneous. Both of those assertions must be right. She also correctly pointed out that there was no additional violence over and above the very serious violence which is, by definition, part of a rape. 

8. On the other hand I must take into account what I regard as three serious features of this crime. First is that Mr Herrera gave his victim absolutely no opportunity to prepare herself for this crime. The first she knew about the crime was when she felt his presence behind her and his penis inside her vagina. The second aspect is that the intercourse was unprotected; he did not wear any form of condom. The third thing which perhaps is the most serious is that he completed the intercourse by ejaculating into her vagina. The last two features obviously make the crime more serious because it must raise the possibility of sexually transmitted disease through unprotected sex or a pregnancy. 

9. In my opinion this crime does fall below the middle range of objective seriousness for rapes but it falls just below the middle of the range. To be more precise it falls within the upper half of the lowest range of objective seriousness. 

10. Mr Gilson did not suggest that there were any factors of particular aggravation in this case which fell within the terms of section 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and I accept that submission. 

11. The impact of a crime such as this is graphically described in the victim impact statement prepared by the victim in this case. 

12. I should say I am deliberately not naming her because this sentence may be published in due course and the law prohibits the public identification of the victims of sex crimes. 

13. The victim of the crime was herself only about nineteen when this offence occurred. So far as she was concerned, she was at a party which was being hosted by a work friend of hers. As she pointed out in her victim impact statement, the crime is "" not something you want to have to go through as a teenage female "". She had a partner of some four years and it was understandably particularly difficulty telling her partner about this because she was worried about his reaction. She was worried about telling her family as well. She found it hard to deal with. She never thought this would happen to her. 

14. She went to counselling for up to eight weeks to help with her feelings and the obvious anxiety which the offence brought about but, as she, said the counselling "" seemed to just bring up the events in my head again."" 

15. She found it very hard attending court. She was scared about seeing Mr Herrera. She was, as she said, "" strong for myself and got through it thinking I could then move on with my life ."" She then, unfortunately, had to come back to give evidence again because the first trial of Mr Herrera resulted in a hung jury. I presided over the second trial. This caused her more anxiety. 

16. As a result of the incident she finds that she is "" now a more scared and anxious person and I have a lot of trouble trusting people."" She becomes very closed in public and tries not to interact with people or make eye contact. She is reluctant to go out on her own. 

17. She was not able to go to work for several weeks and that had a financial impact because her partner was on an apprentice's wage. The job she had when this occurred involved her travelling a lot. She discontinued that employment because the travel involved public transport at early hours and she felt a lack of trust for people. It affected her sleep. She commenced new employment and became so stressed about the second court hearing that she had to be corrected about her performance. Luckily she did not lose her job. It affected her exams which she was undertaking. She had to repeat a twelve week course. This drew the attention of her employer. 

18. It affected her appetite and she had to have sleeping tablets. Her social life was affected. She did not maintain contact with her friends. It affected her intimate life with her partner, as well as creating a lot of stress and strain between them. 

19. The victim made reference at the commencement to "" scratches on my lower back."" I refer to that because there is an issue as to whether certain scratches which were on her back were caused in the incident or not. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they were so caused because, as Ms Hawkins pointed out, the victim was carried once or twice during the course of the evening . Nevertheless the other observation which the victim made namely that ""my intimate parts (vagina) was extremely sore for several days after the incident "", I do obviously accept. 

20. It is important to make clear, as Ms Hawkins submits and Mr Gilson accepts, that none of the factors which I have read out which are contained in the victim impact statement are aggravating factors so far as s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act are concerned. It is not at all surprising that a victim of a rape such as this particular victim suffered the kinds of consequences which she so graphically described in her victim impact statement. A number of those consequences are sadly the sorts of things which judges come across regularly in victim impacts statements after sexual offences. One way of looking at that description is that it explains why Parliament regards such a crime as so serious that it fixes a maximum of fourteen years imprisonment to the crime. 

21. It is important for a judge to make reference to personal features of an offender before sentencing the person so that they can be taken into account. Mr Herrera is twenty-nine. He is from Cuba and has been in Australia since 2007. He is applying for citizenship. He was married to an Australian woman but they have separated. He was brought up in Havana, one of nearly thirty brothers and sisters. He had a good upbringing. One feature of his early childhood however is that his first sexual encounter was at the age of twelve and as the helpful pre sentence report from the Probation and Parole officer says, "" he enjoyed relationships of various lengths of time from then onwards ."" 

22. He has since separated from his Australian wife. He is a trained classical musician and a very accomplished performer in Latin music with a particular focus, as I have said, on Reggaeton. Indeed I have seen as one of the exhibits a video clip of one his performances. His lifestyle in Australia as a performer was characterised by casual relationships in an atmosphere of drugs and alcohol. That is a remark by the Probation and Parole officer, although it appears that Mr Herrera's drug use may have occurred later. 

23. The alcohol intake became a serious problem in 2009 when his father died in Cuba. He lost another relative around about the same time. This affected him very seriously. He started to drink a lot more. He was drinking up to two bottles of rum a day. It obviously became an addiction. To his credit he took himself off to a detoxification unit at St Vincent's Hospital for three days and then attended a psychologist for four sessions. 

24. However then in December 2009 he committed this crime and was charged. It is important to note that Mr Herrera maintains his innocence of this offence. 

25. The Pre Sentence Report concludes that the offence "" appears to have occurred within a context where casual relationships with women and abuse of alcohol and drugs was commonplace ."" The author thought that the "" confluence of his unresolved emotional issues and his lifestyle may have contributed to his attitude and actions in this matter ."" The author thought that he would benefit from medical and psychological assessment to see whether these issues could be addressed. He was regarded as unsuitable for a community service order. 

26. His legal advisers arranged for Mr Herrera to attend a psychologist, Dr John Jacmon. Dr Jacmon saw Mr Herrera on 5 July this year. Despite Dr Jacmon saying that he had "" gathered considerable information "" on Mr Herrera's "" state of mind currently and at the time of the incident "", Dr Jacmon concluded that there were no disorders identified prior to the incident. This was despite the alcohol problem which I have described resulting from a combination of the performing lifestyle and his father's death, his attendance at a detoxification unit and seeing another psychologist. In addition, Dr Jacmon diagnosed, correctly I think, that Mr Herrera's daily "" functioning is being impaired by depression, anxiety and substance abuse (alcohol and drugs) at clinically significant levels. "" The psychologist thought that his depression and anxiety appear to have developed as aftermaths of the crime - that is my expression - which he had committed. He diagnosed him with a major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. 

27. The psychologist whom Mr Herrera saw in late 2009 was a Mr Alfredo Goldbach. In a short report Mr Goldbach confirmed that he offered him psychotherapeutic support between September and November 2009. He had presented with "" severe depression and extremely severe anxiety."" He had ""low mood, relationship problems and strong feelings of isolation "". The psychologist assessed Mr Herrera as having been "" deeply affected by the loss of two family members and a friend during the previous three years and by the difficulties in the process of settling in Australia ."" 

28. Mr Herrera's success as a performer is demonstrated by a letter from a fellow performer known as "" C Major "", whose full name is Carlo Velazquez. 

29. Mr Herrera has previous convictions for driving an unregistered car and midrange PCA. Those offences have no bearing on my sentence to do with this case. 

30. Ms Hawkins called her client to give evidence. He confirmed that the death of his father affected him tremendously. He was very close to him. He is not able to return to Cuba because he made a documentary containing his views about the conditions of the people in the country and he is therefore regarded as a counter-revolutionary. He acknowledged his drinking problem and that he had even started on drugs and the fact that he was very close to his father. He is prepared to undertake the counselling regime which Dr Jacmon suggested. He did not pursue his counselling with Mr Goldbach because of his travelling entertaining commitments. He has a lot of friends in his industry and in the community who provide him with a lot of advice and support. 

31. He confirmed that his first sexual encounter was from the age of twelve when he was, as he described, raped by a fifteen year old girl. As a teenager he had relationships with older women, including two women in their thirties. He acknowledged in cross-examination that he realised that sex without consent was wrong and maintained his innocence of this crime. He said that the effect of the conviction and a gaol term would, he thought, destroy his future. Work had been going really well previously. 

32. Ms Hawkins also called a friend of Mr Herrera, a Michael Hemmings Jones, a fellow Cuban who grew up with Mr Herrera in Havana. Mr Hemmings-Jones said Mr Herrera was the most outstanding Reggaeton singer in Australia at the moment and had performed with world leaders in that kind of music. They are very good friends and have worked together. Mr Hemmings-Jones helps Mr Herrera in the management of his performances and noticed his reaction to being charged with this offence. He also provides personal support for Mr Herrera as a friend. Mr Herrera is normally a very happy person and a very talented and professional musician. The effect of the conviction and gaol term would be the worst thing that could happen to him. Mr Hemmings-Jones also believes that his friend is innocent. He confirmed in cross-examination that Mr Herrera was very popular with women, particular his followers, and agreed that many threw themselves at him. 

33. Mr Herrera spent some six days in custody after he was arrested. I accept that at the time that this offence occurred Mr Herrera was suffering from depression and anxiety and had also been drinking. Those observations point to the context and explanation of the circumstances in which the crime occurred. They do not excuse the crime. I accept Mr Gilson's submission that there is no demonstrated causal relationship between his condition and the crime. 

34. Ms Hawkins in her written and oral submissions made reference to her client being probably the subject of child sexual abuse. That was based upon the evidence that her client had sexual relations from his early years. That may well be right but the only information that I have is that which I have set out. There is no clinical support or development of the proposition that Mr Herrera was the victim of childhood sexual abuse, nor is there any evidence about the impact which it had on him. 

35. Ms Hawkins emphasised the need for her client having to have long term counselling for his depression and anxiety. She referred to his evidence which I have not yet mentioned that there are times when he thought about self harm and suicide. 

36. The thrust of many of Ms Hawkins' submissions was to the effect that I should consider a suspended sentence. It was agreed that a intensive correction order was not available for this crime. Ms Hawkins pointed to the findings from a research paper which became MFI 26 about comparing the deterrent effect of imprisonment with non-custodial sentences. She pointed out correctly that the provision of s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to the effect that I must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless I am satisfied, "" having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate ."" Ms Hawkins argued that her client and the community are going to be much better served by him undertaking a period of intensive therapy outside the prison environment. He is likely to be the subject of abuse in the prison system because he would be regarded as a sex offender. 

37. My options in sentencing Mr Herrera are very limited. Clearly the crime is so serious that a sentence other than a prison sentence would be inappropriate. The only available way that a prison sentence could be imposed which does not involve immediate full time custody is to suspend that sentence. What, with respect, Ms Hawkins' submissions overlooked is that I cannot suspend a sentence which is more than two years. In my opinion a sentence of imprisonment of two years or less would be inappropriate for this crime. It therefore follows - despite all of the advantages for her client that a suspended sentence may have - that it cannot be imposed in a case such as this, given the findings which I have made. 

38. I have been referred by Ms Hawkins and Mr Gilson to a number of cases which involve men raping women who are asleep or partly unconscious. I have been referred to Dean v The Queen (2006) 166 A Crim R 341, Sabapathy v the Queen [2008] NSWCCA 82 and Sudath v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 207. In addition I have been referred to Da Silva v The Queen (NSWCCA, unreported, 30 November 1995) and JRB v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 371. 

39. Mr Gilson emphasised the seriousness of the offence in his submissions and argued that a non-parole period between two and a half and four years would be appropriate. 

40. There is, I accept, some prospect of rehabilitation . This was a one off opportunistic offence and Mr Herrera has no record of such previous offending. His prospects of rehabilitation are guarded, given the complexity of the treatment required and his significant depression and anxiety. Naturally he cannot be accorded any benefit of contrition or remorse because his clear position is that he regards himself as not guilty of these offences. 

41. As I say, I have made the finding as to where this offence lies in the range of objective seriousness. Taking into account that finding and the matters personal to Mr Herrera, I regard an appropriate overall sentence as one of four years imprisonment. Because it is his first time in custody and he will need some extended period in the community for his treatment to be undertaken I would regard there being special circumstances for departing from the normal relationship between a head sentence and the non parole period. Normally it is some seventy-five per cent so that Mr Herrera could expect to have a non-parole period of three years in this case. However I propose to reduce his non-parole period to two and a half years in this case. 

42. I will backdate the sentence by some seven days to clearly take into account the period which he has spent in custody. The sentence will therefore commence on 10 August 2011. 

43. Mr Herrera I am going to sentence you now, if you would stand up please. I set a non-parole period for your sentence of two and one half years which will commence on 10 August 2011 and expire on 9 February 2014. The balance of the term is one and a half years commencing on 10 February 2014 and expiring on 9 August 2015. Mr Herrera your sentence commenced on 10 August 2011. Your non-parole period - the time that you must be in gaol - expires on 9 February 2014. After that your sentence runs for another one and a half years in the community when you will be subject to parole and that will expire on 9 August 2015. The first date that you are eligible for parole is 9 February 2014. Whether or not you get parole will be a matter for the Parole Authority. Have a seat Mr Herrera. 

HIS HONOUR: Now Ms Hawkins, Mr Gilson, two things: one the mathematics, I think I've got it right, the dates and periods and secondly whether there are any legal or factual matters which you want to draw to my attention which might be errors and which could be fixed at this time under s 43, or corrected under s 43. So first the mathematics, that I've got the dates and periods right. 

GILSON: My part seems to-- 

HIS HONOUR: Thanks Mr Gilson. 

HAWKINS: I've added it up, it appears to be correct your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Thank you. Now any matters of fact or law that might be the subject of s 43. I don't mean further submissions but any factual errors or legal errors that I may have made. 

HAWKINS: Your Honour the only thing that I can see is that your Honour made a reference to guarded prospects, giving the significant depression and anxiety. Did your Honour wish to say anything about his prospects regarding his, not family support but community support with respect to his rehabilitation. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes, look I said guarded, no that I won't affect the sentence but thank you for drawing it to my attention. I use guarded because of the severity of the condition which Dr Jacmon had diagnosed and I acknowledge that he has a good deal of support in the community. I'll leave it at that. 

HAWKINS: The other issue is your Honour, I have contacted the Probation and Parole Service, I took the liberty the other day, I spoke to the supervisor at Wentworth Avenue and told her with respect to the issues of possible self harm and she has already noted the file in case he comes into the system but I don't know whether your Honour wished to note that for the file from your Honour's viewpoint that this is something that they could possibly look out for. 

HIS HONOUR: That's a good idea Ms Hawkins. The other thing I do in cases such as this - which the Corrective Services authorities encourage - is to provide any psychological material. I won't do it without your permission but if you agree I'll arrange for my associate to send Dr Jacmon's report and Mr Goldbach's report. I just have to ask her to rub out my pencil marks and then the sensible thing for her to do is probably to fax those. There's a person we know in Corrective Services who's in charge of the assessment process and we send them direct to him. Now what I will do - and she will do this later on today - is when we send the fax or email with those two reports I will ask her in the covering note to say that there has been evidence from Mr Herrera of ideas of self harm at various stages. I think that would cover it, so that they're alerted to it. 

HAWKINS: They've already been alerted. 

HIS HONOUR: I'll add it to. I'll ask my associate. 

HAWKINS: He has given his own evidence of it. 

HIS HONOUR: Exactly right, that's why I say, that he's given evidence of it. That's right, that's the point, he's given evidence. Thank you Ms Hawkins, anything else? 

HAWKINS: No I don't think so your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Gilson? 

GILSON: Your Honour there's only one, I must say, very slight slip of the tongue that someone might misconstrue, your Honour said, ""When I sentence for these offences"", in case somebody thought that there was a Form 1 or related or back up charges, there are no other charges related, back up or on a Form 1 and it was obviously just a slip of the tongue. Your Honour has sentenced for only one offence. 

HIS HONOUR: What Mr Gilson says is correct. There are no back up charges, there's no charge to be taken into account under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . The only crime that I sentenced Mr Herrera for is the s 61I charge.

		01 September 2011",2011-08-16 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709298,"Sharari v Director General, Transport NSW [2011] NSWADT 196","reasons for decision  1GENERAL DIVISION (S FROST (JUDICIAL MEMBER)):  Mr Sharari's taxi driver authority was cancelled by Transport NSW (TNSW) in March this year, when TNSW became aware of a number of criminal convictions recorded against Mr Sharari in November 2010.  Mr Sharari sought internal review of the cancellation decision but the original decision was affirmed.  He has applied to the Tribunal to have the cancellation overturned.  2The question for the Tribunal is whether Mr Sharari is a person ""of good repute and in all other respects a fit and proper person to be the driver of a taxi-cab"": s 33(3) of the Passenger Transport Act 1990 (the Act).  Background  3Mr Sharari first started driving taxis in January 2009 shortly after being granted his driver authority, for which he had applied in November 2008.  Upon receipt of his application TNSW sent Mr Sharari a letter headed ""Warning - Driver Authority"" which noted as follows:  Your traffic record indicates that you have a number of traffic related driving offences.  It is also noted that you had been convicted previously of criminal offences.  Although the Ministry does not condone your behaviour in the past, the Ministry has approved your application to commence training.  The driver of a public passenger vehicle is required to have sufficient responsibility and aptitude to drive the vehicle or vehicles to which the authority relates.  The offences recorded are of concern to the Ministry and may jeopardise your continuation to be the holder of an authority to drive public passenger vehicles in New South Wales.  4The letter then noted Mr Sharari's convictions on 22 November 2005 for ""assault officer in execution of duty"", ""common assault"", and ""behave in an offensive manner in/near public place/school"" (the 2005 events).  The letter explained:  Action  The criminal and traffic offences recorded on your proven offence record are of concern to the Ministry, however, after careful consideration, it has been determined not to take action in respect of your public passenger authority at the present time.  Warning  In determining any future action against your authority, you are warned that the Ministry will take into consideration any known complaints, arrests, convictions, proven offences and traffic history; including those on the attached extract.  This may result in the variation, suspension or cancellation of your authorisation as a public passenger vehicle driver authority holder.  5Mr Wozniak for the Respondent described this as a case of Mr Sharari ""just scraping through"" at the initial driver authority approval process.  That description seems apt.  6Mr Sharari's taxi-driving activities seem to have been incident-free from January 2009 to July 2009.  However, in July 2009 he was involved in a serious accident while driving a taxi, which resulted in serious injuries (including the dislocation and fracture of his right hip, and nerve damage to his right leg), an extended period of hospitalisation, and subsequent rehabilitation and psychological counselling.  He has recovered from his injuries to some extent, although he says that he can now drive a car for no more than about half an hour at a time before the pain forces him to take a rest.  7He has not driven taxis at all since the accident.  8In July 2010 he was involved in the incident that led, eventually, to the cancellation of his driver authority.  The cancellation did not occur until March 2011, eight months after the incident.  One of the reasons for the delay is that Mr Sharari did not notify TNSW that he had been charged with a number of offences, even though he was required by clause 44 of the Passenger Transport Regulation 2007 to do so.  9It is not necessary to detail the particular circumstances of the 2010 incident; it is sufficient to note that in November 2010 he was convicted of the following offences:  a)not keep left of dividing line (traffic offence);  b)refuse to produce licence and state name;  c)assault police officer in execution of duty;  d)resist or hinder police officer in execution of duty;  e)destroy or damage property value up to $2,000.  10He was fined a total of $3410, ordered to pay court costs plus compensation of $445.50 for the property damage, and put on a 12-month bond for the ""resist or hinder"" conviction and a concurrent two-year bond for the assault.  Neither bond has yet run its course.  11The Tribunal has before it a copy of a report dated 6 October 2010, prepared by Dr Bruce Westmore, a forensic psychiatrist, most likely in support of sentencing submissions for Mr Sharari's trial in October/November 2010.  According to the report, Mr Sharari told Dr Westmore that he had almost no recollection of the July 2010 incident.  Dr Westmore opined as follows:  He was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident in July 2009.  He suffered significant orthopaedic and neurological injuries.  He continues to suffer symptoms of pain and associated disability and rehabilitation is continuing.  In addition, he developed a depressed mood following the accident.  He has received counselling and that continues and he has also been prescribed a wide range of medication including antidepressants, Schedule 8 analgesics and medication to treat nerve pain.  It is likely he has developed a medically induced dependency on the Schedule 8 drugs and his general practitioner has talked to him about this particular problem and the doctor is attempting to reduce that medication.  He has however been advised that he can increase the dose again should he suffer breakthrough symptoms of pain.  This probably reflects the doctor's understanding that he continues to suffer serious pain associated with the injuries at times.  The matters currently before the court arose after he had taken, he said, two spirit drinks combined with a range of medication.  The medication including Digesic, the antidepressant Endep, Endone and Lyrica.  All of these medications potentially interact with alcohol but in particular the antidepressant and the Endone.  Mr Sharari reports memory difficulties in relation to the alleged offending behaviour and I have diagnosed him as having suffered a substance induced amnesic disorder.  He also has an adjustment disorder with depressed mood, this as a result of the accident.  The court could consider him under section 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.  He has a number of mental conditions including persistent amnesiac in relation to the alleged offending behaviour, medically induced substance dependence for which he will eventually require specialised treatment and a persistent adjustment disorder with depressed mood.  It is unlikely that he will regain memory for the incident itself but the substance dependence and the adjustment disorder are both conditions which can be effectively treated.  He would have been suffering both of these conditions at the time of the alleged offending behaviour and he continues to suffer from these difficulties.  I would recommend the following treatment plan:  1)That he continue to attend his general practitioner, [...] who practices at [...].  2)That he continue attending the psychologist [...] who is also helping him with pain management and relaxation techniques.  3)That he remain incomplete sobriety from alcohol, particularly while he continues to take prescribed medication.  4)That his general practitioner continues to attempt to reduce the opiate analgesics he is currently prescribed.  An increase in the antidepressant medication might also be recommended.  5)That he be referred to a pain management centre and in that setting he will see a psychiatrist on three or four occasions.  I would suggest that occur so alternative strategies to managing pain might be considered.  These strategies will include reducing his reliance upon analgesics.  This man's forensic prognosis should be extremely good, provided he does not mix alcohol with prescribed medication.  ...  12Dr Michael Garvan, occupational physician, has written, at the request of TNSW, a brief report commenting on Dr Westmore's report.  Dr Garvan states:  Regarding Mr Sharari's psychiatric status, I agree with Dr Westmore's advice regarding management of his adjustment disorder and substance dependence.  His fitness to hold a Driver Authority would depend on confirmation by his GP, pain management specialist, and psychiatrist, that his condition was controlled and that he was compliant with treatment and was abstaining from alcohol.  Confirmation would require completion of the DoT Medical Specialist Assessment Report, including advice that Mr Sharari met the criteria for a conditional DA with regards his psychiatric condition and substance dependence.  Regarding Mr Sharari's physical status, further advice would also be required regarding his ability to drive a taxi safely and effectively.  This could be clarified by a practical driving test performed by an accredited taxi driving instructor/assessor.  It might also be necessary to obtain a report from any surgeon or other specialist involved in the treatment of his back and right lower limb injuries.  13Mr Sharari has also provided to the Tribunal a character reference on which, together with further references provided to TNSW in relation to the internal review, he relies in support of his application.  Consideration  14The Macquarie Dictionary defines ""repute"" as:  1) estimation in the view of others; reputation.  2) favourable reputation; good name; credit or note.  15The references before the Tribunal have evidently been provided so as to support a contention that Mr Sharari is a person of good repute.  However, it is noteworthy that none of the three references makes any specific reference to the 2005 events.  Two of them assert that Mr Sharari has been heavily punished for the events of 2010 and, expressly or by implication, argue that he should not be punished further.  The third states that ""the convictions that have been recorded against him are completely out of character ..."" but it is not clear that this referee was even aware of the 2005 events.  16In the circumstances of this case, references which do not acknowledge, let alone address, the 2005 events are not helpful.  17Mr Sharari's behaviour in relation to the events of 2005 and 2010, involving as they do offences against officers of the NSW Police Force, is of an extremely serious nature.  I cannot comfortably conclude on the material before me that Mr Sharari is a person of good repute and I am certainly not prepared to ""attest"" to the existence of that state of affairs (which would be the effect of setting aside the decision under review: see s 33(3) of the Act).  18As to the question of his fitness and propriety to be a taxi driver, I am not satisfied that he meets the standard, for the following reasons:  a) he was involved in two series of events , in 2005 and 2010, involving aggression and violent behaviour, and he has not demonstrated that the risk of a recurrence of that type of behaviour is low;  b) the fact that the concurrent bonds imposed by the Local Court in November 2010, requiring that Mr Sharari be subject to the supervision of the NSW Probation Service until November 2012, have not yet expired;  c) the absence of any indication that Mr Sharari has taken the steps that Dr Westmore recommended in 2010 and with which recommendation Dr Garvan has agreed as recently as 8 August 2011;  d) Mr Sharari's continuing impaired physical condition which renders it impossible to drive a car with any degree of comfort for more than half an hour at a time.  Conclusion  19On the material before the Tribunal I am not satisfied that Mr Sharari is a person of good repute and in all other respects a fit and proper person to be the driver of a taxi-cab.  20The decision under review is affirmed.  I hereby certify that this is a true and accurate record of the reasons for decision of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal.  Registrar  **********

2709308,Dao v R [2011] NSWCCA 183,"Judgment 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL : I agree with Fullerton J. 

2SIMPSON J : I agree with Fullerton J. 

3FULLERTON J : The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by Morgan DCJ in the District Court on 31 July 2009 after adhering to a plea of guilty entered in the Local Court for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of an unlawfully imported border controlled drug, namely 22.3 kilograms of pure methamphetamine (commonly known as ""ice""). The commercial threshold of the drug is fixed at 750 grams under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The wholesale value of the consignment was between $4 M and $5 M with its street value between $10 M and $22 M. 

4Against a maximum of life imprisonment and/or a fine of $825,000 the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years to date from 17 December 2007, the date of his arrest. 

5The sole ground of appeal concerns whether the applicant has been left with a justifiable sense of grievance after two co-offenders, Manh Hung Ha and Duc Phuong Nguyen, were sentenced by Frearson DCJ following a trial in the District Court in June 2009. On 5 February 2010 his Honour sentenced Ha to imprisonment for 12 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 7 years and 8 months and Nguyen to imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of 7 years and 4 months. 

6In summary, the applicant submitted that the different and greater levels of involvement of both Ha and Nguyen relative to his role is such that even accepting that his criminal record denied him any leniency, an undiscounted term of imprisonment of 13 years and 4 months is significantly and disproportionately higher than the terms of imprisonment imposed on his co-offenders and that he should be re-sentenced to redress the disparity. 

7The Crown submitted that to the extent that there is any ascertainable difference between the roles the three offenders performed in their attempt to possess the drug (each being lower level participants in a criminal enterprise to import and distribute the drug), it is only slight and not such as to distinguish one offender from any other for sentencing purposes. 

8The Crown submitted that the real point of distinction for sentencing purposes was their respective criminal records (or in the case of Ha the absence of any criminal record). The applicant's record was more significant than that of Nguyen including two offences of supplying a prohibited drug in 2000 and 2005, each of sufficient seriousness to attract full-time imprisonment. In 2001 Nguyen was convicted of supplying a prohibited drug for which he was given a suspended sentence. In the Crown's analysis, the applicant's criminal record had the effect of offsetting the discount that applied by reason of his plea of guilty such that when the sentences of all three offenders are considered there is no marked and unjustifiable discrepancy between them which warrants the intervention of this Court. 

9There was a considerable body of common evidence in the two sentencing exercises. The drugs were detected in a shipment of candles from Vietnam. After the drugs were removed the cartons were reconstructed and released for a controlled delivery. Nguyen arranged for and collected the consignment under an assumed name in Ha's van which he then drove to a rendezvous with Ha and another man. The applicant drove Ha to the rendezvous in a car. Nguyen then handed control of the van containing the drugs to Ha and left with the other man. Nguyen was arrested soon after. 

10Ha drove the van to his premises and parked it in the rear yard. The applicant drove the car to Ha's premises. Both men entered the premises from which a banging or tapping sound was heard consistent with the consignment being unpacked. This was followed by swearing, doubtless associated with the discovery that the drugs had been removed. After securing the premises Ha and the applicant drove away in convoy but in separate vehicles. They were arrested by police a short time later. 

11Importantly, although Morgan DCJ sentenced the applicant by reference to agreed facts and Frearson DCJ sentenced Ha and Nugyen after a trial, save for the fact that in the trial Nguyen was positively identified as the person who negotiated for clearance of the consignment under an assumed name and the person who ultimately collected the consignment, it does not appear that his Honour had any greater insight into the roles Ha and Nguyen actually performed in attempting to possess the drugs than what her Honour was invited to accept was their role when sentencing the applicant. This aspect of the evidence at trial did however enable the Crown to submit on sentence that Nguyen's involvement was for a longer period of time than that of Ha, namely over days. It also grounded his Honour's finding that Nguyen played a pivotal role in securing access to the drugs after importation and that he acted in combination with others for that purpose. It did not however alter the fact that his Honour found Ha's role as the trusted custodian of the drugs was slightly higher than that of Nguyen. 

12Although it is not material to the issue of parity, Frearson DCJ assessed the seriousness of the criminality of both Ha and Nguyen as within the low to middle end of the mid range of objective gravity. While this may have been a practical way of approaching the issue of sentence, it was not necessary to position the offenders relative to mid range offending for the purposes of the imposition of sentence for a Commonwealth offence under s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). I do not intend, however, to suggest by that observation that error has infected the sentences his Honour imposed. 

13Morgan DCJ did appoint the applicant to a position within a notional range of offending although she did find he was a low level participant. Relative to the agreed facts, and subject to acknowledging that a sentencing court is sometimes required to sentence upon incomplete evidence, her Honour focused upon what the applicant did in committing the offence, rather than attempting to identify with any precision his particular role, function or position in any hierarchy of offending relative to other offenders. This is consistent with the approach in R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270. In the result her Honour accepted that the evidence indicated that the applicant's role was at the lower end of the criminal organisation consistent with the fact that his involvement extended only for a matter of hours and was limited to driving Ha to the rendezvous and joining with him thereafter to assist in unpacking the cartons at his premises, clearly intended to be the first point from which the drugs would be distributed. She was satisfied that there was nothing in the evidence to suggest that the applicant was involved otherwise than in that capacity. She accepted that there was no evidence or suggestion that the applicant was involved in the importation of the drugs. His long-standing drug addiction confirmed her view that he was not a person who would occupy an important role in an organisation involved in the supply of drugs. 

14The applicant submitted on the appeal that on the basis of those findings, and what was submitted to be the much greater level of criminal involvement of Nguyen and Ha, what is revealed is not simply an arguable or mere disparity between his sentence and that of his co-offenders but a serious disparity such that an impartial observer would genuinely feel that justice had not been done. 

15On the appeal the Crown submitted that Ha's role was closer to that of the applicant than that of Nugyen given his physical actions on the day that the drugs were collected and his shared or joint custody of the drugs with Ha for the purposes of making them available for distribution. While this may be so it fails to grapple with her Honour's findings which, at least implicitly, distinguish Ha's role from that of the applicant on the basis that he was the person who had control of the drugs in the unpacking phase (given that it was his vehicle and his premises that were used for that purpose) and that the applicant was involved simply to assist him. That said, neither sentencing judge made any overt findings about differences in the objective criminality as between Nguyen and Ha on the one hand and the applicant on the other. In so far as the sentence imposed by Morgan DCJ is concerned this is hardly surprising given that the trial of the other offenders was pending at the time of sentence. Similarly, when sentencing Ha and Nugyen after trial, although Frearson DCJ referred to the applicant's sentence and acknowledged the operation of the parity principle, his primary focus was to sentence the offenders consistent with the evidence led at trial and to do so relative to each other. 

16The marginal difference in the sentences imposed by his Honour appear to reflect his finding that Ha's role was slighter higher than that of Nguyen but that Nguyen had a criminal record where Ha had none. In other respects their subjective cases were not relevantly dissimilar from each other or from that of the applicant, aside from the applicant's criminal record which was more serious given his repeated drug offending. Both judges found that there was no satisfactory evidence of remorse or any acceptance of responsibility from any offender and only a marginal difference in their prospects of rehabilitation. Frearson DCJ found Nugyen's prospects to be fair to moderate in light of his criminal record and Ha's prospects reasonable. Morgan DCJ made no positive finding as to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation preferring to regard them as guarded in light of his criminal record and his long-standing addiction to heroin. Both judges did however make express reference to the need for the sentences of the applicant and Nguyen to reflect specific deterrence, again because of their drug related antecedents. I note that Nguyen also had a heroin addiction. 

17Given the differences in the parts played by the applicant and Ha in attempting to possess the imported drugs, and the fact that the applicant was found by Morgan DCJ, implicitly at least, to have occupied a lesser role than that of Ha (albeit an important role), the question starkly presented for the purposes of the appeal is whether the applicant's criminal record relative to that of Ha (and perhaps of Nguyen) is such as to have justified what would otherwise be manifest disparity in the applicant's sentence. 

18Her Honour dealt with his record entirely appropriately citing Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465. She noted that whilst his criminal convictions did not operate to increase the objective seriousness of his offending it may serve to indicate a more severe sentence is warranted to address the joint objectives of retribution, deterrence and the protection of society. While it is not entirely clear whether her Honour in fact increased the applicant's sentence for this reason it is certainly open to be viewed in this way. Consistent with the Crown's submission, if the sentence is viewed in this way the applicant's undiscounted term of imprisonment of 13 years and 4 months relative to the 12 years and 6 months Frearson DCJ imposed on Ha is justified or explained. By the same process of reasoning so is the sentence of Nguyen given his quite different contribution to the criminal enterprise and his criminal record which his Honour expressly treated solely as denying him any leniency. 

19In applying the principles of appellate intervention where disparity is asserted by an applicant for leave to appeal against sentence, recently reviewed by Howie J in England v R ; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [61]-[69] (a judgment with which both McClellan CJ at CL and I agreed), I am not persuaded that the applicant's sentence can be fairly described as ""markedly"" or ""glaringly"" or ""seriously"" disproportionate to that of Ha or Nguyen, or that viewed objectively his sentence could be said to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance relative to that of his co-offenders. As Kirby J said in Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 338: 
...Mere disparity is not enough. What is needed is that the disparity engenders a ""justifiable sense of grievance"" on the part of the prisoner or ""give the appearance that justice has not been done""108. It has been stated many times that the fact that the prisoner feels a sense of grievance is not determinative. Say what they may, appellate courts cannot ""prevent an unjustified sense of grievance from arising in the minds of sentenced persons""109. But the object of the language chosen is to make it plain that some disparities, being inevitable, must be tolerated out of respect for the discretion of sentencing judges and a modest appreciation of the capacity of appellate courts to rectify discrepancies without causing new or different problems... 

20In this case due acknowledgment should be afforded the careful and considered decision of both sentencing judges and due allowance for the exercise of their sentencing discretion which has resulted in sentences that are different but, in my view, not such as to result in unequal justice. 

21The orders I propose are: 
1. Leave to appeal is granted. 
2. The appeal is dismissed.

		22 August 2011",2011-08-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2709313,R v Hawi & ors (No 18) [2011] NSWSC 1664,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: After the close of the Crown case and in the course of consideration of no case to answer submissions made on behalf of the accused Kisacanin and the accused Padovan, the Crown Prosecutor has made an application for leave to amend the indictment in respect of the counts alleging the offence of riot. 

2In relation to the accused Hawi, Menzies, Abounader, Eken, Potrus and Kisacanin, count 2 of the indictment is in the following terms: 

Further for that they, in the alternative, on 22 March 2009 at Mascot in the State of New South Wales, together with at least six other persons assembled together, used or threatened unlawful violence for a common purpose and the conduct of them taken together was such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness then being present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety. (Emphasis added) 

3In relation to the accused Padovan, count 4 is in these terms: 

For that he, on 22 March 2009 at Mascot in the State of New South Wales, together with at least 11 other persons assembled together, used or threatened unlawful violence for a common purpose and the conduct of them taken together was such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness then being present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety. (Emphasis added) 

4Mr Gordon, on behalf of the accused Kisacanin, has raised a point that a person can only be guilty of the offence of riot if it is established that the person used unlawful violence and not if it is only established that the person threatened such violence. The Crown now accepts that to be the case and proposes to amend counts 2 and 4 of the indictment to remedy the defective averment. 

5The statutory offence of riot was enacted in 1988 by the insertion of s 93B in the Crimes Act 1900. The section is in the following terms: 

93B Riot 

(1) Where 12 or more persons who are present together use or threaten unlawful violence for a common purpose and the conduct of them (taken together) is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety, each of the persons using unlawful violence for the common purpose is guilty of riot and liable to imprisonment for 15 years. 

(2) It is immaterial whether or not the 12 or more persons use or threaten unlawful violence simultaneously. 

(3) The common purpose may be inferred from conduct. 

(4) No person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene. 

(5) Riot may be committed in private as well as in public places. (Emphasis added) 

6My initial view was that the first part of s 93B(1) simply states the context in which the conduct must occur. The words I have italicised that immediately follow state the conduct that renders a person liable for the offence. 

7If ""threatening unlawful violence"" was sufficient for riot, then it would have been a simple matter for that to be stated, just as it was only a few months earlier when the offence of violent disorder was inserted in the Summary Offences Act 1988 (now in s 11A). That provision, relevantly, is: 

11A Violent disorder 

(1) If 3 or more persons who are present together use or threaten unlawful violence and the conduct of them (taken together) is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety, each of the persons using or threatening unlawful violence is guilty of an offence. 

Maximum penalty: 10 penalty units or imprisonment for 6 months. (Emphasis added) 

8I had cause to question my initial view when I considered statements as to the elements of the offence from some very respectable sources. 

9In Regina v Asquith (1994) 72 A Crim R 250, Hunt CJ at CL said at 251: 

The first of the grounds of appeal argued by the appellant is that the judge misdirected the jury as to the elements of the offence of the riot. The offence is enacted by s 93B(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The Crown has to establish: 

(1) that the appellant was one of 12 or more persons - 

(a) who were present together, and 

(b) who did use or threaten unlawful violence for a common purpose, and 

(2) that the conduct of those persons would cause a person of reasonable firmness at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety. (Emphasis added) 

10This, however, is obiter dictum, because the Crown in that case alleged only the ""use"" of unlawful violence. The issue on appeal was whether the trial judge misdirected the jury by failing to direct that they must find that 12 or more people used such violence. The trial had been conducted on the sole issue of whether the appellant was one of those who did. No issue was taken with respect to whether there was in fact a riot. Leave pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules was refused. 

11In Howie and Johnson, Criminal Practice and Procedure NSW , Butterworths, it is said at [27-20,005] that the elements of the offence of riot in s 93B are: 

(1) 12 or more persons were present together; and 
(2) used or threatened to use unlawful violence for a common purpose; and 
(3) their conduct taken together was such that it would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his/her personal safety; and 
(4) the accused was one of those present who used or threatened to use the unlawful violence for a common purpose. (Emphasis added) 

12The suggested form of the indictment in Howie and Johnson is: 

[27-20,000] Form of indictment 

That [ name of accused ] on [ date of alleged offence ] at [ locality/suburb ] in the State of New South Wales, together with [ name of other rioters - if names not known, aver ""and other persons not known"" ] being [ x or at least 12 ]* in number assembled together and used/threatened to use unlawful violence for a common purpose, namely [ describe briefly the facts relied upon eg to obtain the release of Joe Green from police custody ] such as to cause a person of reasonable firmness then being present at the scene to fear for his/her personal safety. (Emphasis added) 

13Regina v Aaron John Lee Maher; Regina v Dwayne Eric Welsh; Regina v Craig Vincent Lardner; Regina v Ronald Priestly [2005] NSWCCA 16; (2005) 154 A Crim R 457 , involved a two judge bench of the Court of Criminal Appeal dealing with an appeal against the severity of sentence. Dunford J (Kirby J agreeing) referred, again obiter, to the elements of the offence of riot as being: 

[32] ... Section 93B (riot) involves: 

(a) 12 or more persons present together, 
(b) the use or threat of unlawful violence, 
(c) a common purpose, and 
(d) conduct such as to cause a person of reasonable firmness to fear for his personal safety ... 

14However, against those statements that the elements of the offence may include that the accused threatened unlawful violence, there is the following. 

15In Watson, Blackmore and Hosking, Criminal Law New South Wales , LBC Information Services, 2 nd ed, Vol 2, the elements of the offence are said to be: 

[2.15070] Elements of riot 

The prosecution must prove that: 
(1) the accused was one of 12 or more people - 
(a) who were present together at a place (public or private), and 
(b)who used or threatened unlawful violence for a common purpose, and 
(2) that the conduct of these people (taken together) was such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety, and 
(3) that the accused in fact used unlawful violence for the common purpose. (Emphasis added) 

16The suggested form of indictment is: 

[2.15050] Indictment for riot 

That AB [CD and EF] on the day of [date] at [place] in the State of New South Wales being one of 12 or more persons present together in a riotous assembly, using [and threatening] unlawful violence for a common purpose namely, [particulars], did use unlawful violence for the said common purpose by [eg assaulting members of the public] and the said conduct of all such said persons (taken together) was such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety. (Emphasis added) 

17Section 93B was inserted in the principal Act by the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1988. The common law offence of riot was abolished. Section 93B has been in the same form since then (apart from an increase in the maximum penalty from 10 years to 15 years in 2005). 

18In respect of the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1988, reference was made in the second reading speech of the then Attorney General to the position in the United Kingdom where the common law offence of riot had been abolished and replaced by a statutory offence in s 1 of the Public Order Act 1986 (UK): New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 19 October 1988 at 2600. Section 93B is in identical terms to that provision (apart from s 93B using gender neutral language and including within it a statement of the maximum penalty). 

19In Colosimo and Ors v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2005] NSWSC 854, Johnson J was concerned with the history and construction of the statutory offence of affray in s 93C. It was inserted in the principal Act also by the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1988. Johnson J referred to the second reading speech before observing: 

[14] The Attorney-General's reference to the United Kingdom reforms contained in the Public Order Act 1986 (UK) is significant. As will be seen, the statutory offence of affray created in New South Wales in 1988 follows very closely the equivalent provisions in the Public Order Act 1986 (UK) . In these circumstances, authorities concerning the proper construction of the United Kingdom provisions will assist in the construction of the New South Wales provisions. 

20For the same reason, authorities concerning the proper construction of the riot provisions in the Public Order Act (UK) may assist in the construction of s 93B. 

21In R v Jefferson [1994] 1 All ER 270, two appellants had been convicted on a count of riot which was particularised as follows: 

[The named defendants] on the 21 st day of June 1990 being present together and with other persons unknown, the total number of whom were twelve or more, used or threatened unlawful violence for a common purpose and the conduct of them (taken together) was such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety. 

22The wording of this count is virtually identical to the wording of the counts of riot in the indictment presented by the Crown in the present trial insofar as the essential elements of the offence are concerned. 

23It was accepted in Jefferson that the indictment was badly framed. It averred the context in which criminal liability might arise, but omitted the act by which the accused was said to be criminally liable. Notwithstanding this, the appeal was dismissed. Auld J accepted a Crown submission (at 277) that the trial judge had nonetheless ""directed the jury properly on the essential issues that they had to decide"". It was, however, noted (at 275): 

As this court has recently observed in R v Tyler (1992) 96 Cr App R 332, this provision has two parts. The first specifies the context, namely 'Where 12 or more persons who are present together use or threaten unlawful violence for a common purpose ...' The context of the offence thus provides, as an alternative to the use of unlawful violence, a threat of such violence. The second part of the section specifies the actual offence, namely 'each of the persons using unlawful violence for the common purpose is guilty of riot'. The offence, so described, thus does not include the threat of unlawful violence as an alternative to its use. 

An indictment charging an offence under s 1(1) of the 1986 Act should reflect the two parts of the provision, first stating the statutory context and second the commission, within that context, of the offence as defined. 

24The trial judge in Jefferson had the defect drawn to his attention but declined a bipartisan application to permit amendment. In R v Tyler (1993) 96 Cr App R 332, there was an indictment particularising the offence in the same terms but the trial judge did permit amendment. The contention on appeal that the indictment was fundamentally defective and incapable of amendment, because it alleged an offence unknown to the law and was therefore a nullity, was rejected. 

25These English authorities reflect, in my respectful view, the correct construction of a provision in the identical statutory expression as that of the offence of riot in s 93B of the Crimes Act 1900. It is now common ground that the indictment in the present case is defective in the same manner as the indictments in Tyler and Jefferson were held to be. 

26Amendment of the indictment to rectify such a defect is permitted by ss 20 and 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Leave of the court is required unless the accused consent: s 20(1). 

27Leave should be granted unless the accused would be irreparably prejudiced in meeting the charge as amended. In James Borodin v R; Irene Borodin v R; ED v R; Bogomiagkou v R [2006] NSWCCA 83, Howie J stated: 

[25] Section 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act permits the court to make orders for amendment of an indictment where to do so would not result in injustice. Relevant injustice does not arise simply because the amendment of the charge deprives the accused of taking a technical point based upon an inconsistency between the statement of the charge and the evidence in support of it. Tactical decisions may have been made by the defence upon the basis of the wording of the charge, but it does not follow that the trial judge should refuse leave to amend the indictment simply because those tactical decisions will be rendered fruitless. It will only be in a case where the accused would be irreparably prejudiced in meeting the charge as amended that leave should be refused. 

28No counsel has objected to the proposed amendment and it has not been suggested that prejudice would be occasioned to any of the accused. 

29In the circumstances it is appropriate to grant leave for the indictment to be amended as proposed.

		13 February 2012",2011-08-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709316,Chong v R [2011] NSWCCA 182,"Judgment 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL : I agree with Simpson J. 

2SIMPSON J : The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon her in the District Court on 17 December 2009, following her plea of guilty to a single charge of importing not less than the marketable quantity of a border controlled drug (cocaine), committed on 10 May 2009. 

3Pursuant to s 307.2 of the Criminal Code (Cth) the offence carries a maximum custodial penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. Williams DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 6 years, commencing on 10 May 2009, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months, expiring on 9 November 2012. 

The Facts 

4The circumstances relevant to the offence were put before the court by way of an agreed statement of facts. On 10 May 2009, the applicant flew into Sydney from Los Angeles. Concealed in her underclothing were two bags containing cocaine of a total quantity of 420.5 grams, but yielding cocaine in its pure form of 151.1 grams. Also in her possession was small vial containing traces of crystal amphetamine. By s 314.4 of the Criminal Code , for the purposes of Div 307 (of which s 307.2 is a part) a marketable quantity of cocaine is two grams. (This is not to be confused with s 314.1, which prescribes, for the purposes of Div 302, concerning ""controlled drugs"" as distinct from ""border controlled drugs"", 250 grams as a marketable quantity.) 

5The street value of the cocaine was between $86,343 and $135,990. The wholesale value was between $25,498 and $31,059. 

6At the airport the applicant was selected by customs officers for luggage examination and questioning. This occurred at about 6.50 am. She gave a number of answers that subsequently proved to be false. On a search of the applicant's handbag, the vial with the crystal amphetamine residue was discovered. Over the next three hours, on as many as five occasions, the applicant told customs officers that she wanted to use the toilet. On each occasion she was told that she would be required to use a ""controlled toilet"", under observation. On each occasion she changed her mind and declined to use the controlled toilet. 

7She refused an ""external search"", saying she did not want to take her clothes off, and that she had nothing, although conceding ""maybe just a little bit of that"", pointing to the vial containing the crystal amphetamine. At 8.05 am she consented to a ""frisk search"" which exposed some suspicious items in her clothing. She said that she was not concealing narcotics. Thirty minutes later, she said to a customs officer: 

""What if I just gave you a little bit? Could we just forget about the rest of the stuff?"" 

8The customs officer advised her not to say anything more. The applicant said: 

""I know, I know, I just want to know what is easiest."" 

9Eventually, the applicant produced one of the bags of cocaine from her groin area. She told the customs officer that that was all she had. Later, having been told that an external examination could be conducted under compulsion, she consented, and the second bag was located concealed in her underwear. 

The applicant's personal circumstances 

10The applicant gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. Also available to the sentencing judge was a pre-sentence report, a psychiatric report prepared by Dr Christopher Canaris, a reference from a friend, and a letter written by the applicant to the sentencing judge, and a medical certificate concerning the applicant's mother. From there the following information emerged. 

11The applicant was born in August 1983, in Texas, USA, of Korean migrant parents. She grew up in Los Angeles. She is a US citizen. She was not quite 26 when she committed the offence. Contrary to what she told the customs officers, she has some criminal record in the United States, particularly for drug offences, and some offences of dishonesty. It will be necessary to return to the detail of the criminal history when considering the grounds of the application. 

12The applicant began using drugs at age 15, beginning with what she called ""uppers"" (ecstasy and marijuana) and quickly graduated to amphetamines, which became her drug of choice. 

13She told Dr Canaris that, in 2005 (she would have been 22) her boyfriend was shot in the stomach and died. It is reasonably clear that this was a drug related event, and both her relationships and social activities have largely revolved around a drug culture. 

14At about the ages of 17 and 18 she lived in Korea for a year and a half, and did not use drugs during that time. The purpose of this was to separate herself from the drug culture in which he had become heavily involved. After her return to America, however, she resumed her drug use, influenced by a boyfriend who was a drug user. Her parents attempted to have her participate in a rehabilitation programme, but she refused and ran away. In 2001 (age 18) she gave birth to a daughter, who lives with her (the child's) father in California. 

15Dr Canaris considered that the applicant ""may well"" have suffered Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder of the impulsive and inattentive type. Individuals who suffer that disorder are at substantially greater risk of becoming involved in substance abuse and dependence, and are more likely to develop mood and anxiety disorders in later life. Since being in custody the applicant has in fact been diagnosed with and treated for depression. 

16Approximately three days before she flew to Australia, she entered into an arranged marriage. 

17The applicant's mother had suffered from breast cancer, which was initially treated, but recurred. (She has died since the applicant was sentenced.) In the letter she wrote to the sentencing judge, the applicant expressed her contrition for attempting to bring drugs into Australia, and said that she now understands the severity of her conduct, and the reasons for the prohibition on illicit drugs. 

The remarks on sentence 

18Williams DCJ recounted the facts and the applicant's personal history in a way that generally is not challenged (subject to what appears below). He quoted at some length from the psychiatric report. Relevantly to the grounds of the application, he said: 

Ms Chong is not the usual type of drug courier. Indeed it is somewhat surprising that she was entrusted with the shipment given her obvious heavy addiction to a severely mind-altering substance. Whilst it could not be said that she offended out of need, it also seems to be the case that she did not offend out of greed. However, I cannot overlook the factors operating on her offending, such as her own addiction, her clouded judgment and the emotional pressure placed on a vulnerable personality. I am not satisfied that she fully understood what she was doing or that she was fully able to rationalise her choices. That is reflected in the lack of substantial planning, lack of a cover story, the lack of sophistication about the whole operation, and also carrying drugs in her own handbag. 

... 

In the scheme of things her past record does not entitle her to any particular leniency, even though prior good character is not much of consideration in this type of offending. Her previous record is merely indicative of her lowly status in the importation and helps explain why she offended , a realistic explanation being something that is often lacking with other offenders in similar circumstances. 

... 

There is not a great deal of latitude in these matters, barring exceptional circumstances or the provision of significant assistance. Whilst the amount of drug imported is not of overwhelming relevance, it does need to be taken into account, as does of course, the issue of general deterrence."" (italics added) 

19He noted the plea of guilty and that it was evidence that the applicant was prepared to facilitate the legal process: The Queen v Cameron [2002] HCA 6; 209 CLR 339. He did not identify numerically the reduction which he plainly allowed as a result of the plea of guilty. 

The grounds of appeal 

20The grounds of appeal are pleaded as follows: 

""1. His Honour erred by finding that the applicant's record does not entitle her to any particularly leniency. 

2. His Honour erred by finding that he did not have a great deal of latitude in these matters barring exceptional circumstances. 

3. The sentence is manifestly excessive given all of the relevant circumstances."" 

Ground 1: the applicant's criminal record 

21Obviously, the applicant has no Australian criminal record. Evidence of her criminal history was put before the court by way of what appears to be an email sent by Interpol Washington to Interpol Canberra. It is in a form not familiar to this Court. I do not propose to reproduce it in full, but extract, by way of example, the following: 

""14 June 1997 - charged by Los Angeles Police Department for shoplifting as a juvenile. Disposition: released to parent/guardian 

... 

21 January 2001 - charged by Azusa Police Department with: (1) possession of controlled substance; (2) possession of controlled substance paraphernalia. 

Disposition: UNKNOWN 

22 December 2001 - charged by Glendale Police Department with the possession of controlled substance paraphernalia. 

Disposition: UNKNOWN 

23 September 2002 - charged by state court at Glendale with the possession of controlled substance paraphernalia. 

Disposition: Bench warrant issued; convicted later and sentenced to 7 days in jail. 

... 

12 August 2005 - charged by Burbank Police Department with: (1) burglary; (2) possession of controlled substance paraphernalia; (3) bench warrant - theft; (4) warrant - possession of controlled substance. 

Disposition: UNKNOWN 

..."" 

22There are other entries to the same effect. Others showed periods of probation and imprisonment for short terms (3 days, 30 days). 

23It was this record to which the sentencing judge was referring when he said: 

"" ... Her past record does not entitle her to any particular leniency ... "" 

24The point that was made on behalf of the applicant was that in only a few instances was the disposition of the charges identified. It is not possible to be sure that she was found guilty or convicted of the offences. Moreover, where the disposition is identified, the penalties appear to have been quite minor, even insignificant. 

25Accordingly, senior counsel for the applicant contended that the correct characterisation of her criminal history is as: 

""mostly juvenile, street related and personal drug use offences, consistent with her history of chronic drug abuse difficulties."" 

He adopted the comments of Williams DCJ that the applicant's record was merely indicative of her lowly status in the importation, but challenged the conclusion that her past record: 

"" ... disentitled her to any particular leniency."" 

The point was reiterated in oral submissions. Senior counsel argued that: 

"" ... there was really no proof of what her record was."" 

26If the only evidence of the applicant's criminal history was the Interpol document there may be some force in the latter submission. But the evidence was not so confined. The agreed statement of facts contained the following: 

""The Accused is a US Citizen with extensive criminal history including narcotic offences."" 

27And Dr Canaris recounted, from the history he took from the applicant, that she had been sentenced to a year in gaol for a robbery, but had only served a short time because of remissions given to her. 

28Further, in her evidence in chief, the applicant was asked: 

""Q: Now you've got a very extensive criminal record for someone so young Ms Chong?"", 

to which she assented. Her counsel then asked her to explain the offences she had committed. She said that she was ""pretty reckless"" and assented to the proposition that she was taking drugs and was involved with ""a bad crowd"". She said she was involved with ""heavy drug users"". 

29There is, in the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), no equivalent of s 21A(2)(d) or s 21A(3)(e) and (f) of the Crimes ( Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which, respectively, require courts sentencing in respect of state offences to take into account as aggravating or mitigating circumstances the existence or absence of a previous record of criminal offences. Section 16A of the Crimes Act specifies matters (where relevant and known) that must be taken into account on sentencing. Sub-para (2)(m) requires, inter alia, that the character and antecedents of an offender must be taken into account. 

30Traditionally, of course, courts do extend some leniency to first offenders, although there are some offences in respect of which the absence of a previous criminal history is less relevant than others. Drug importation and drug supply are such offences. 

31Williams DCJ did not take into account the applicant's record as an aggravating factor. She was not entitled to have taken into account as a mitigating factor the absence of previous convictions. In accordance with the requirements of s 16A(2)(n) his Honour had appropriate regard to the applicant's character and antecedents, to the extent that the information before him permitted him to do so. He merely observed, correctly, that her record did not entitle her to any ""particular leniency"". As an observation that is, in my opinion, plainly correct. His Honour treated the record, essentially, as neutral. I would reject this ground of the application. 

Ground 2: ""exceptional circumstances"" 

32By this ground the applicant complains of the observation in the remarks on sentence, extracted above, that: 

""There is not a great deal of latitude in these matters, barring exceptional circumstances or the provision of significant assistance."" 

The argument advanced on behalf of the applicant was that the introduction of the notion of ""exceptional circumstances"" went beyond what is established in the authorities. It was acknowledged that: 

""There is a particularly circumscribed range of appropriate sentences for people who import drugs, no matter how insignificant the quantities might be and no matter what lowly role the person might have played"". 

It was then argued: 

""But it is not correct to say that there is a requirement for exceptional circumstances or the demonstration of significant assistance before a particular degree of leniency can be extended to an offender."" 

33In my opinion, the acknowledgement contained in the final paragraph is correct. Courts have repeatedly stressed the need for sentencing in respect of drug importations to reflect the serious view the legislature, and the community, take of such activity, and the damage successful importations cause. The cases were most recently comprehensively collected by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 273 ALR 324. It is true that on the facts of any individual case, there exists a range within which a sentence will properly fall. But each case must be treated individually; s 16A(1) of the Crimes Act directs a court sentencing federal offenders to: 

"" ... impose a sentence ... of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence."" 

Against that must be balanced the direction in s 16A(2)(k) to pay adequate regard to: 

"" ... the need to ensure that the [offender] is adequately punished for the offence."" 

34That, in my opinion, leaves no room for the super-imposition of an ""exceptional circumstances"" test: see Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 84 ALJR 195 at [25], [54]. It is correct to say that, in the interests of consistency in sentencing, sentencing judges must have regard to what has been done in other cases: Hili at [53]. What has been done in other cases may give way to the particular circumstances of the case in question. I have come to the conclusion that, in speaking as he did, the sentencing judge introduced into the exercise of his discretion a barrier that was not warranted: the need to establish exceptional circumstances before he could depart from some (unspecified) range of sentences. It is true, of course, that there does exist a point below which a sentence would be manifestly inadequate, and a point above which a sentence would be manifestly excessive. But, within that range, there is no call for a requirement that exceptional circumstances be established. It is not entirely clear what his Honour meant, but it does seem to me that he may have removed the flexibility in his approach to which the applicant was entitled. 

35That somewhat tentative view receives some reinforcement from the length of the sentence, something that I will explain when I turn to ground 3. 

36The argument on behalf of the applicant went further, and contended that, even if exceptional circumstances were required, they exist in the present case. It is not quite clear on what basis this was put. The reference was a most general reference to: 

""the rest of his Honour's judgment."" 

The assertion was made that this was: 

"" ... quite an exceptional case of importing a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug."" 

But just what made it exceptional was not spelled out. 

37I do not accept that this case was exceptional. True, it had some significant features, but, in reality, the applicant is not unlike the numerous couriers of drugs who are apprehended importing their narcotics into this country. It is only necessary to refer to cases such as Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 54; 207 CLR 584 and De La Rosa to be exposed to multiple instances of cases with facts substantially similar. 

Ground 3: Manifestly excessive? 

38The basis on which it was contended that the sentence was manifestly excessive is to be found in De La Rosa , in which McClellan CJ at CL collated groups of cases, the groups based on specified characteristics. At [222] - [223] appears a group of cases of a category into which it could be asserted that the applicant's case falls. In that group the longest sentence imposed was a head sentence of 6 years, the shortest of 3 years and 9 months. The longest non-parole period was 4 years and 3 months, the shortest 2 years. It will be seen that the applicant's head sentence equates to the longest there mentioned. That was because that sentence was in fact the sentence imposed upon the applicant. It is not clear from the report whether there were others of equivalent length. 

39That fact alone would not persuade me that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Put together, however, with the reference to ""exceptional circumstances"" with which I have dealt above, I have come to the conclusion that the erroneous reference is the explanation for the sentence selected. 

40The error, together with the length of the sentence, persuade me that, within the terms of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, another sentence (less severe) is warranted in law and should have been passed. Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 

1. Leave to appeal granted; 

2. Appeal allowed, sentence quashed; 

3. In lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years and 3 months to commence on 10 May 2009 and expire on 9 August 2014, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, the applicant to be released on parole on 9 February 2012. 

41FULLERTON J: I agree with Simpson J.

2709319,R v Perish; R v Lawton; R v Perish [2011] NSWSC 1112,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown asks that the grant of leave pursuant to s 38 (1) Evidence Act 1995 be extended to permit him to cross-examine Witness E upon his recollection of meetings with Witness B at a cafe at McMahon's Point and at the St George Rowing Club. The effect of Witness E 's evidence-in-chief was that he had no recollection of the meeting at the ca fe and despite the photographs (e xhibit H) and the tape (e xhibit J) being played to him, he had little recollection of a meeting with Witness B at the St George Rowing Club. 

2During yesterday's argument on the voir dire, I found that the triggering events in s 38 (1) (a) and (b) Evidence Act applied. I was satisfied that Witness E 's evidence was unfavourable to the Crown: s 38 (1) (a), and it appeared to the court that Witness E was not, in his evidence-in-chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence of matters of which he may reasonably be su pposed to have knowledge: s 38 (1) (b) . 

3I am further satisfied, so far as a meeting at McMahon's Point is concerned, that Witness E 's testimony was inconsistent with evidence given by him during the committal hearing when he said during cross-examinatio n by Ms Davenport (T447.15-18): 

""I recall that Anthony was having a conversation with [Witness B] and did make reference to the Falconer abduction. I don't remember the exact content of what was said. I really didn't want to get i nvolved in the conversation."" 

4Ms Davenport argued that leave should not be granted. She submitted that the Crown is, in essence, choosing to accept the version of one Crown witness over another and that during cross-examination at the committal proceedings Witness E denied that he forced Witness B to admit that he murdered Terry Falconer during the conversation at the cafe and the issue was, in reality, the credit of two witnesses. Ms Davenport pointed out that Witness E had made many statements to police during which the police had not obtained a statement from him about his recollection of the two meetings deposed to by Witness B . 

5It is convenient to mention here that Mr Crown conceded that Witness E had not made a statement to the police about the events the subject of the present controversy. Accordingly, any finding of a prior inconsistent statement must be confined to the passage in Witness E 's testimony during the committal proceedings that I have quoted. 

6Ms Davenport put to me that as Witness E had either no memory or purported to have no memory of almost everything, the Crown was in a better position than it was during the committal proceedings. Ms Davenport pointed out that she now had the task in cross-examination of obtaining from the witness what he had said in evidence in the proceedings before the magistrate, which had been rendered more difficult by his apparent lack of memory. She submitted that to permit the Crown to cross-examine Witness E upon Witness B 's evidence would create unfairness to Anthony Perish and should not be allowed. 

7Mr Crown told me that he intended taking Witness E directly to Witness B 's evidence of these meetings and that Witness E 's evidence of the possession of a hand held recorder and such a recorder being located at Girvan provided a factual foundation for the Crown to put its case in the way sought. Furthermore, Mr Crown cited R v Teasdale [2004] NSWCCA 91 ; (2004) 145 A Crim R 345 and submitted that he was endeavouring to lay the ground work to enable criticism to be made by the Crown of Witness E 's evidence in the Crown's closing address. 

8During further argument, Ms Davenport told me that she did not object to leave being granted to enable the Crown to cross-examine the witness upon the identified prior inconsistent statement during the committal proceedings. Ms Davenport maintained the opposition to Witness E being cross-examined upon Witness B 's evidence. She submitted that the probative value of the evidence would be outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to Anthony Perish and the application must be rejected: s 137 Evidence Act . 

9Witness B 's testimony given in this trial on 11 August 2011 of meetings at McMahon's Point and the St George Rowing Club with Anthony Perish and Witness E are previous representations made by a person other than the witness. The barrier imposed by s 44 Evidence Act to cross-examination upon previous representations of other persons does not apply as the evidence of the representati ons has been admitted: s 44 (2) (a) Evidence Act. 

10In my view, however, the present controversy may be readily resolved by a close consideration of s 137 Evidence Act which is as follows: 

""In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant."" 

11The term ""probative value"" is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act to mean: 
"" ... the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue."" 

12The facts in issue are an admission said by Witness B to have been made by Anthony Perish in the presence of Witness E at the McMahon's Point cafe that they killed Mr Falconer and the intimidating conduct by Anthony Perish and Witness E at McMahon's Point and at the St George Rowing Club. 

13The previous representations made by Witness B undoubtedly have significant probative value, but that is not the evidence which is to be assessed. The evidence will be Witness E 's answers when Witness B 's testimony is put to him in cross-examination by the Crown. He says he has no recollection of the content of those meetings and, save for the inconsistency in the identified passage of evidence in the committal proceedings, that is not elsewhere stated otherwise. 

14The extent to which his answers could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the facts in issue appears to be, at best, modest. 

15On the other hand, the Crown's use of Witness B 's evidence in cross-examination of Witness E brings with it the very real risk that Witness B 's evidence will be elevated in the minds of the jurors and the jury will misuse the Crown's cross-examination to infer that Witness B 's evidence is to be accepted as reliable. I do not think that this risk will be eliminated by a direction to the jury. 

16Carrying out the weighing exercise required, I conclude that the probative value of the proposed evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to Anthony Perish: s 137 Evidence Act. 

17For these reasons , I do not grant leave to the Crown to cross-examine Witness E upon the previous representations made by Witness B . 

18I do, however, grant leave to the Crown to cross-examine the witness upon the identified prior inconsistent statement made during the committal proceedings. 

19In granting leave, I have taken into account Ms Davenport's lack of objection to leave being granted and that: 

i.t he grant of leave will not be likely to add unduly to t he length of the hearing: s 192 (2) (a) Evidence Act , and; 

ii.there is no unfairness either to Anthony Peri sh or the witness: s 192 (2) (b) Evidence Act , and; 

iii.Witness E 's prior testimony that the Falconer abduction was referred to in a conversation with Witness B at McMahon's Point has some importance in the proceedings and the Crown should be permitted to explore that top ic in cross-examination: s 192 (2) (c) Evidence Act , and; 

iv.the proceedings concern charges of murder a nd conspiracy to murder: s 192(2) (d) Evidence Act , and; 

v.the court intends to direct the jury about the grant of leave under s 38 Evidence Act .

		16 September 2011",2011-08-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709324,Sowaid v R [2011] NSWCCA 177,"Judgment 

1BASTEN JA : This matter was heard on 28 July 2011. The applicant required an extension of time within which to file her application for leave to appeal against sentence. At the completion of the hearing, the Court made orders in the terms set out by Simpson J at [3] below. I agree with her Honour's reasons. 

2SIMPSON J : The applicant sought an extension of time in which to file an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon her in the District Court, following her conviction, after jury trial, of two counts of doing an act with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to a Commonwealth entity. By s 135.1(3) of the Criminal Code each offence exposed the applicant to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years. 

3At the conclusion of the hearing of the application on 28 July 2011, the court made the following orders: 

1. Grants the applicant an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal against her sentence. 

2. Grants leave to appeal. 

3. Dismiss the appeal. 

4. The Court reserves it reasons. 

4What follows are my reasons for joining in those orders. 

5On 3 September 2010, King DCJ sentenced the applicant to two terms of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months, specifying that the first was to commence on 3 September 2010, the second on 3 March 2011. The aggregate sentence was therefore of 3 years. His Honour directed that the applicant be released on 2 July 2012, after serving 1 year and 10 months, on certain conditions (giving security of $5,000, and entering into a recognizance to be of good behaviour). 

The facts 

6As part of the sentencing process following the applicant's conviction, King DCJ stated the facts he found to have been proved in the trial, consistent with the jury's verdict. The facts found are not in issue. Both offences were committed between 20 October 2008 and 22 January 2009 in Sydney. 

7The applicant was the sole director and shareholder of a company called Haz Management Pty Limited, the business of which was to import and distribute molasses tobacco and charcoal. These were substances used in water pipes (hookahs) for smoking. The applicant and her husband also had an interest in a cafe in Auburn, where hookahs were used by customers. The applicant supplied molasses tobacco for the their use. She also proposed to supply, by wholesale, to other retailers. 

8In the period covered by the charges, the applicant imported from Dubai two containers containing both molasses tobacco and charcoal. Customs duty is payable to the Australia Customs and Border Protection Service (""ACBPS"") on molasses tobacco. ACBPS is a Commonwealth entity. No duty is payable on charcoal. 

9The applicant falsely declared to the ACBPS that the containers contained only charcoal, and did not declare the molasses tobacco content. Each container in fact held, besides a quantity of charcoal, 9,000 kilograms of molasses tobacco, concealed between layers of charcoal. The customs duty payable on that quantity was $2.95 million. The total loss of customs duty to ACBPS was $5,960,034.76. 

10Prior to the importation the applicant dealt with the Dubai firm from whom she purchased the goods. She gave instructions to that firm concerning labelling and health warnings necessary to be included on the packaging. 

11The applicant was the contact person representing Haz Management in the importation, and the liaison with the ACBPS. She took a number of steps in the process of the importation. In respect of each shipment, she created a false document, a ""manufacturers declaration"", stating (falsely) that each shipment contained only charcoal. She lodged the false document with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (""AQIS"") and, using the document, applied for an import permit. She liaised with a customs clearance agency and AQIS for delivery of the container. The applicant's husband took delivery of the content of the containers. The applicant intended to use the molasses tobacco in the cafe business, for sale to customers, and by wholesale to others. 

12Although the applicant gave evidence in the trial (which was plainly rejected by the jury, and largely rejected by the trial judge) she did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. The trial judge was satisfied that she was aware that duty was payable on the importation of molasses tobacco. That finding of fact is not in issue. She had given evidence to that effect in the trial. She was also aware, at least in September 2008, that a significant increase in the rate at which duty was payable had come into effect from 24 June 2008. 

The applicant's personal circumstances 

13Before the court were a pre-sentence report, two medical reports concerning the applicant's (then) three year old son, dated November and December 2009, a number of character references, and an accountant's report showing the applicant's taxable income for the 2009-10 financial year was expected to be $30,780. 

14The applicant was born in May 1977 and was 30 and 31 years of age during the offending period. She has no prior criminal record. She has six siblings to whom she is close. Her mother and sister receive support from her. She married her husband in 1995, and they have three children, ranging in age (at date of sentencing) from 13 to three years of age. She and her husband have operated the cafe to which I have referred above for many years, and this is their principal source of income. She is reported to have told the author of the pre-sentence report that she had little to do with Haz Management, and did not know of its activities. This history must be treated with scepticism, given the findings of fact made by King DCJ. 

15The author of the pre-sentence report considered the applicant to be: 

"" ... a loyal wife, mother and extended family member"", 

whose focus in life appears to be her children and cafe business to the exclusion of any other enterprise. 

16The medical evidence concerning the applicant's three year old son indicates that he has suffered from a condition called immune thrombocytopenic purpura (""ITP""). The reports suggest only modest cause for concern. The disorder is apparently one that causes bleeding and bruising, but is usually self-limiting, with spontaneous resolution within six months. By the time of the December report, the condition had indeed resolved. At that time there was small (1-2%) chance of recurrence, with the likelihood of spontaneous resolution again. These reports go no way towards providing a basis for moderating the sentence imposed. 

17The references spoke unanimously of a loving, hard-working woman, who is a protective mother. They are consistent with character evidence called in the trial. 

The remarks on sentence 

18As I have mentioned above, King DCJ made the necessary factual findings. These are not contested. Under the heading ""Seriousness of the offences and role"", his Honour said: 

27. Objectively, the offences are each a very serious instance of offences contrary to s 135.1(3) of the Code as each involved a very substantial amount of duty, that is, more than $2.95 million. 

28. The amount involved is not the only factor to be considered in establishing the seriousness of each offence. The seriousness may have been further elevated by any increase in the amount of intended loss, but the amounts actually involved are already very substantial. 

29. ... Had the importation not been detected the tobacco could have been distributed at a price reflecting the costs and the duty, although unpaid, or at an unfair advantage to other competitors by reducing the price to reflect in part that the duty had not been paid. In either event the financial advantage to be obtained would have been very substantial. 

30. The offender's motive for the offence could only have been pure financial greed. 

31. The offender could not have had a more significant role in the commission of the offences ... "" 

19His Honour considered the medical reports concerning the applicant's son and said: 

42. Hardship to the family or dependants of a person being sentenced should only reduce the sentence being imposed in circumstances where they are extreme and go beyond the sort of hardship that occurs when an offender is imprisoned in the ordinary course. There is no evidence to establish that the personal circumstances of the offender or her family are exceptional such as to render a custodial sentence inappropriate, if a custodial sentence is otherwise appropriate. A custodial sentence would of necessity impact on the family but such an impact would not be outside the range of the impact to be normally expected. 

20He referred then the character evidence in the trial, and to the references. Of these he said: 

44. ... They confirm that the offender is well regarded in the community. The value of the references is partly diminished in that, in general, they do not indicate that the offender has acknowledged guilt rather than informed the referees that she has been convicted. 


21He accepted that the applicant had no prior convictions and is a person of prior good character. 

22He found that the offences were premeditated and engaged in over a period of months during which they were planned and carried out by a series of acts to achieve the anticipated end result. 

23He rejected (as irrelevant) a submission that the applicant had lost money invested in the purchase of the molasses tobacco. That is not the subject of challenge. It is plainly correct. He then determined that full time custodial sentences were appropriate, and gave the following reasons: 

""75. ... 

1) The offences are of a serious nature, involving the importation of a total of 18,734 kilograms of molasses tobacco falsely declared as 'charcoal' in two separate shipments to avoid payment of duty in total of $5.96 million; 

2) General deterrence is also of particular importance in view of the serious nature of the offence, and the difficulty of detection without very high levels of individual scrutiny of container imports; 

3) The importation of tobacco and tobacco products is required to be regulated and controlled by the ACBPS in the public interest; 

4) The offender, by committing the two offences, deliberately sought to subvert that control in a calculated and covert manner; 

5) The offender's motive for the offences was financial gain; and that, 

6) The offender's moral culpability is very high."" 

24He concluded that wholly concurrent sentences would, in all the circumstances, be inappropriate, and imposed two identical sentences with a modest (6 months) accumulation. 

The grounds of the application 

25The grounds of the application are pleaded as follows: 

""1. The learned sentencing judge erred by overstating the objective gravity of the offence. 

2. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to have proper regard to the personal circumstances of the appellant and the impact of imprisonment on her and her family."" 

Ground 1: objective gravity 

26Under ground 1, an attack was made on his Honour's observation, at [29] to the effect that, had the importation succeeded, the applicant would have stood to gain financially. This was because she could have sold the tobacco at the normal market price, even though the cost to her of the importation did not include the very substantial duty that ought to have been paid (thus enhancing her profit margin) or because she could have sold it at a reduced price, producing to her a competitive advantage over honest importers who had paid the appropriate duty. 

27The submission made on behalf of the applicant was that: 

""This finding fails to acknowledge the very significant change in the amount of duty payable in respect of molasses tobacco."" 

28The point is obscure. The point sought to be made, as stated in written submissions, was that the applicant ""could equally be seen"" as supplying this tobacco in competition with other importers or distributors who had imported prior to the significant increase in duty, in which case she would, by reason of the increase, have been at a competitive disadvantage had she paid the full duty. Seen in that light, so the argument ran, the applicant's criminality could be more properly seen as an attempt to remain competitive against wholesalers or retailers of molasses tobacco imported prior to the increase. 

29The argument is untenable. Whenever a change in duty is made, whether by increase or decrease, there will be some who, by good fortune or good management (if the changes have, unusually, been signalled) reap a short term advantage over others whose timing is less impeccable. Of course, any importer who succeeds in completing an importation before a duty increase comes into effect will have a brief, short term, advantage over those who import subsequently. The true comparators are the competitors who import under the same duty regime, not those who import under different duty regimes. 

30I observe in passing, that the argument is, in any event, purely speculative. The applicant did not give any evidence to suggest that her motivation had been to restore herself to a position in which she would have been prior to the duty increase; her defence at the trial was that she was unaware of the molasses tobacco in the shipments. 

31I would reject this argument. 

32In any event, the observation by his Honour was not intended as an independent aspect of sentencing, or as an indicator of itself, of objective gravity: it was a precursor to a conclusion (relevant and thoroughly warranted) that the applicant's motive was purely financial greed. Even if (contrary to the view I have expressed above) the applicant was merely attempting to regain a competitive edge, her motivation was financial. The finding would not make any difference to that conclusion, nor to the objective seriousness of the offence. 

33The objective gravity was determined by a number of matters, including the amount of revenue put at risk (which was, it was conceded, very large), the role played by the applicant (which his Honour found to have been as the principal), and the applicant's motivation (financial). 

34In my opinion his Honour was correct in his assessment of objective gravity. I rejected this ground of the application. 

Ground 2: Personal circumstances 

35The complaint made under this ground is that the sentencing judge gave inadequate regard to the applicant's personal circumstances and the impact of imprisonment upon her and her family. 

36The first observation to make is that there was no evidence whatever as to what effect imprisonment might have upon her or upon any member of her family. 

37The sentencing judge recounted, at some length, the applicant's personal circumstances. It is apparent that she is a devoted mother to her three children. But there is no evidence of any impact upon her, or her children that would be thought to arise as a result of her incarceration. 

38The matters which a sentencing court is required to take into account when sentencing for Commonwealth offences are set out in s16A of the Crimes Act 1914. By s 16A(2)(p), the court is required to take into account: 

""The probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person's family or dependents"". 

39In R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522; 128 Crim R 23, Spigelman CJ held that common law principles apply to the interpretation of this sub-paragraph. If hardship to a child is to be given substantial weight, it must be classified as ""exceptional"". 

40It was accepted by senior counsel for the applicant that no error could be attributed to the sentencing judge in his finding that any hardship to the applicant's family would not come within that classification. However, it was submitted: 

""Quite apart from the effect of the applicant's imprisonment on members of her family, however, the applicant's imprisonment was likely to be more burdensome as a consequence of her obvious distress at being absent from her family, unable to assist with their care, or alleviate the distress resulting from her absence. This was a matter that was entitled to some consideration ..."". 

41A number of authorities were cited for that proposition: see Mokhaiver v R [2011] NSWCCA 10 at [31]; Markovic v R ; Pantelic v R [2010] VSCA 105 at [20]; R v Luong [2000] NSW CCA 139 at [19]; R v Tiki (CCA, NSW, 24 August 1994, unreported). 

42In Markovic; Pantelic the Victorian Court of Appeal, constituted by a bench of five, concluded, as had Spigelman CJ in Togias, that the ""exceptional circumstances"" test continues to apply. The paragraph upon which the applicant placed reliance was a statement of general principle, to the effect that the impact on an offender of the distress caused to family members is a matter that may properly be taken into account as a mitigating factor. 

43This was, as I have said, a statement of general principle; there is nothing in the paragraph, or in the judgment that would permit a reduction in sentence for this reason in an evidentiary vacuum as here exists. Indeed, in that case, the court rejected the exceptional circumstances ground. 

44In Mokhaiver , in which this Court determined that ""modest weight"" would be given to the applicant's distress by reason of family circumstances, there was very strong evidence indeed concerning a medical condition suffered by a three year old daughter of the applicant. That evidence in no way compares with the limited evidence concerning the present applicant's son. 

45It is obvious, in any case where a parent is sentenced, that some hardship will be occasioned to the family, and it would be normal to expect that this would be the occasion of some distress to the offender. I see no reason to think that King DCJ was not conscious of this in sentencing. Indeed, he mentioned it in the closing sentence of paragraph [42] (extracted above at [16*]). There is no reason he should have gone further and speculated that imprisonment was likely to be more burdensome upon her than any other parent. The evidence was simply not there. 

46Nor was there any evidence that the applicant's incarceration would be more burdensome upon her than would incarceration of any parent of young children: there is simply no evidentiary foundation for the ground. 

47I rejected this ground of the application. 

48While I concluded that this was an appropriate case in which to extend time for filing the application, and for a grant of leave to appeal, it follows from what I have said above that I concluded that the appeal should be dismissed. For those reasons I joined in the orders set out above. 

49GARLING J : On 28 July 2011, I joined in the orders which the Court made on that day. 

50I did so, for the reasons expressed by Simpson J in her judgment, with which I entirely agree.

2709326,Police v Christopher James TURNER [2011] NSWLC 27,"JUDGMENT 

Remarks on sentence 

1Christopher James Turner stands for sentence having entered pleas of guilty to the following charges: 

""(That he) on 4 th July, 2010, at Boorowa, did drive a motor vehicle when it was involved in an impact causing grievous bodily harm to Joseph Banks, and at the time of the impact, Christopher Turner was driving the vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public."" 
Section 52A(3)(c), Crimes Act 1900. 
 
""(That he) on 4 th July, 2010, at Boorowa, did drive a motor vehicle upon Lachlan Valley Way, whilst there was present in his breath the special range prescribed concentration of alcohol, namely 0.040, being a special category driver, namely, a P1 Provisional licence holder, 
Section 9(1)(a), Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 

2A charge of Negligent Driving causing grievous bodily harm has been withdrawn. 

3The penalty provided upon conviction on indictment for section 52(3)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 is imprisonment for 7 years. There is a jurisdictional limit in the Local Court of imprisonment for 2 years. Section 188(2)(d) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005, provides that if the Offender has not been convicted of any major previous offence as defined within section 3 of the Act within the preceding 5 years (as is the case here), he is automatically disqualified from holding a driver's licence for 3 years and, if the Court thinks fit, it can either impose a longer period of disqualification or a shorter period but to not less than 12 months. 

4The second charge is contrary to section 9(1)(a) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999, and provides for a maximum penalty of a fine of 10 penalty units ($1,100). There is an automatic period of licence disqualification of 6 months, which the Court can reduce but to not less than 3 months. 

5The paragraphs above are a worthwhile exercise to rehearse because the maximum penalties thus illustrated (and the manner in which they come about) are indicative of the way in which Parliament regards the offences and thus they represent the public's view of the seriousness of the crime: R v H (1980) 3 A Crim R 53. The maximum penalty is fundamental to an understanding and determination of the seriousness of the type of offence before the court and hence to the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the particular offender: R v Oliver (1980) 7 A Crim R 174. This is part of the necessary process of assessing the objective gravity of the offence: see, for example, R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354 . See also R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594; Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59. 

Salient Facts 

6A set of Facts the content of which is the subject of agreement between the parties has been tendered and I proceed to deal with the case on that basis. This document is admitted on Sentence and marked Exhibit 1. That done, I set out my own briefer summary. 

7About 7.55am on Sunday 4 July 2010, Police, Ambulance and Fire Brigade responded to a report of a motor vehicle accident with a person trapped inside. Upon arrival, Police saw a vehicle in a table drain on the western side of Lachlan Valley Way and facing in the incorrect direction. The Offender was spoken to at the scene and advised that he was the driver of the vehicle. 

8Emergency Service personnel commenced medical treatment of the front seat passenger, Joseph Banks who was trapped and pinned inside. It was apparent that the front passenger side of the vehicle bore the brunt of the collision. 

9While Mr Banks was being treated and removed from the vehicle, the Offender was subject to a roadside breath test, returning a positive result. He told Police he had fallen asleep at the wheel. He was arrested and taken to Boorowa Police Station where a breath analysis showed a reading of 0.040 grammes of alcohol. The Offender is the holder of a New South Wales P1 provisional licence that has a restriction of zero blood alcohol whilst driving a motor vehicle. 

10At the time of the impact, the weather was described as inclement with a heavy fog restricting visibility to about 100 metres in most areas along Lachlan Valley Way. At the scene, Police identified tyre marks from the Offender's vehicle leaving the roadway and heading alongside a large gum tree resulting in an impact with the passenger's side front door. This is the type of impact called for in section 52A(5)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 . 

11The Offender was taken to Young Police Station. He declined the services of a legal practitioner although his father did attend as a support person. He took part in a recorded interview. In summary, the Offender said he drove from Boorowa for a football game in Canberra. He returned to Boorowa, going to the Top Pub about 7.00pm and drinking beer with Joseph Banks and Ben Corkhill. He said he remained at the hotel until just prior to closing time of midnight. He estimates he had something in the order of 6 to 7 middies of XXXX Gold during his stay. 

12Having left the hotel, the three young men drove to Canberra to attend ""Mooseheads Nite Club"". Ben Corkhill drove the Offender's vehicle to Canberra while the Offender slept in the car. The Offender said he drank about 5 Vodka Cruisers at Mooseheads. 

13The Offender said he had a sleep in his car before commencing the drive back to Boorowa. Corkhill was dropped off at his home along the way. The Offender was driving and Banks was asleep. 

14The Offender said he parked his vehicle on the Lachlan Valley Way and slept for about 30 minutes as he felt drowsy. He said he travelled about 20 minutes from the rest point when he believes he fell asleep. He woke up after the vehicle collided with the tree. He said he was driving in reduced visibility and it is agreed between the parties he was driving under the posted speed limit of 100 kilometres per hour. The Offender said he was ""pushing it"" as he just wanted to get home to bed. After the recorded interview the Offender was released. 

15As it turned out, there were 3 witnesses to the collision. Jyl Thompson was travelling behind the Offender prior to the collision and said the Offender's vehicle was weaving over the road and crossed the centre white line and then back to the left. Thompson thought of overtaking but felt the conditions were too dangerous. A passenger in Thompson's car, Paul Mutton, was concerned the Offender's vehicle would cross the centre line into the path of an incoming vehicle. The third witness, Robert Clark, was travelling in a vehicle following that driven by Thompson. He said he could see the Offender's vehicle weaving and crossing the centre line. 

16The injuries to Joseph Banks are described as being a compound spiral fracture to the mid shaft of the humerus of the left forearm. The left ankle was dislocated with a fracture at the base of the 5 th metacarpal. The left elbow was dislocated. Banks underwent surgery to affix external fixtures to his left forearm. Two screws were internally fixed to repair a fracture to the head and neck of the talus in the left ankle. 

17Internal fixtures were also applied to the left ankle. A right common femoral artery puncture was closed. Banks suffered numerous post-operative infections and his elbow and forearm were grafted under a flap of his stomach to assist in fighting the infection. He also underwent numerous skin grafts. Photographs tendered to the Court when the pleas were entered provide a graphic illustration. 

18As to further effects to Mr Banks, he had several returns to Canberra Hospital for further treatment for infections. He has lost movement and strength in his arm and it is likely he will have some form of permanent disability - although the full nature and extent is not known at this time. 

19The Offender has no previous criminal history. He obtained his Learner Licence in May 2008 and a Provisional Licence (P1) in May 2009. In 2009 he received infringement notices for Negligent Driving and Not Keep Left, attracting demerit points and a Roads and Traffic Authority suspension. An appeal against that suspension was dismissed at Queanbeyan Local Court. A traffic infringement for Exceed Speed led to a further demerit suspension in 2010. The Offender was born in 1992 and is presently aged 19 years. 

Pre-Sentence Report 

20A Pre-Sentence Report courtesy of ACT Corrective Services notes the Offender was raised in Boorowa, the younger of two children. His parents divorced when he was 16 years and his childhood was for the most part unremarkable. Since leaving the family home aged 17 years, the Offender said he has lived in 'group shared accommodation' in Canberra. He completed Year 12 and has commenced a mechanic's apprenticeship. The Offender is described as a good worker and his employer foresees future employment for him. He earns approximately $750 per fortnight. 

21The Offender reported first consuming alcohol at age 16 years. He drinks socially most weekends. He said he regularly binge drinks consuming on average 12 x 375ml bottles of full-strength beer at a sitting. He does not believe he has an issue with alcohol. The Offender is quite well physically and mentally, however, he is currently suffering from stress resulting from the motor vehicle accident and his current legal matters. He said he did not think of the potential consequences at the time but, in hindsight, regards his actions as stupid and wrong. He added that the accident has had a significant impact on his life both financially and with the loss of a number of friends who blame him for the injuries to the victim. 

22When asked about the victim, the Offender showed some insight stating the victim suffered potential 'life time effects' with the possibility of suffering permanent damage to his arm. He said he visited the victim in hospital and has apologised to him and his family. 

23The Offender is suitable for a low level of intervention by the Service in such areas as drink driving, binge drinking and trauma issues from grief from injuries to the victim. He is suitable for a Community Service Order and has completed the necessary paper work. The Offender is said to be aware the Court may impose a custodial sentence. 

Matters of General Principle 

24It is necessary for the Court to decide the relevant facts because everything else flows from that. The High Court said in R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 at 274: 

""The process by which a court arrives at the sentence to be imposed on an offender has just as much significance for the offender as the process by which guilt or innocence is determined. Unless the legislature has limited the sentencing discretion, a judge passing sentence on an offender must decide not only what type of penalty will be exacted but also how large that penalty should be. Those decisions will be very much affected by the factual basis from which the judge proceeds. In particular, the judge's conclusions about what the offender did and about the history and other personal circumstances of the offender will be very important."" 

25Findings of fact about matters such as motive or the degree of an offender's involvement have a significant effect on the assessment of an offender's moral culpability. There are many cases involving either a plea of guilty, or a conviction following a plea of not guilty, where the task of assessing an offender's culpability is more difficult than that of determining his or her guilt: Cheung v The Queen (2001) 209 CLR 1 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ at [8]. 

26Each factual matter found at sentence need not fit into the extremes of aggravating and mitigating factors. In Weininger v The Queen (2003) 212 CLR 629 at [22], the High Court said: 

""Many matters that must be taken into account in fixing a sentence are matters whose proper characterisation may lie somewhere along a line between two extremes. That is inevitably so. The matters that must be taken into account in sentencing an offender include many matters of, and concerning, human behaviour. It is, therefore, to invite error to present every question for a sentencer who is assessing a matter which is to be taken into account as a choice between extremes, one classified as aggravating and the opposite extreme classified as mitigating. Neither human behaviour, nor fixing of sentences is so simple."" 

27A plea of guilty admits those matters which are the essence of the charge. It does not admit the non-essential ingredients an offence: O'Neill v R [1979] 2 NSWLR 582 at 588; Duffy v R; Mangan v R [2009] NSWCCA 304 at [21]. 

28The offence of culpable driving was repealed in 1994 and replaced with various 'dangerous driving' offences under section 52A Crimes Act 1900 . In 1998, as a result of what the court described as ""a pattern of inadequacy"" of sentences, a guideline was promulgated: R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 229-230. The guideline was subsequently reformulated in R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252. 

29The guideline judgment in R v Whyte (supra) provides for a typical case as follows: 
A frequently recurring case of an offence under s 52A has the following characteristics: 

(i) young offender 
(ii) of good character with no or limited prior convictions 
(iii) death or permanent injury to a single person 
(iv) the victim is a stranger 
(v) no or limited injury to the driver or the driver's intimates 
(vi) genuine remorse 
(vii) plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value. 

aGuideline with respect to custodial sentences 
""A custodial sentence will usually be appropriate unless the offender has a low level of moral culpability, as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgment."": at [214]. 

bAggravating factors 
(i) extent and nature of the injuries inflicted 
(ii) number of people put at risk 
(iii) degree of speed 
(iv) degree of intoxication or of substance abuse 
(v) erratic or aggressive driving 
(vi) competitive driving or showing off 
(vii) length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk 
(viii) ignoring of warnings 
(ix) escaping police pursuit 
(x) degree of sleep deprivation 
(xi) failing to stop. 

Items (iii) to (xi) relate to the moral culpability of an offender. 

cGuideline with respect to length of custodial sentences 
For offences against s 52A(1) and (3) for the typical case: 
""Where the offender's moral culpability is high, a full-time custodial head sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) and two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate"": at [229]. 

30Spigelman CJ said at [228]: 

""In the above list of aggravating factors, items (iii)-(xi) are frequently recurring elements which directly impinge on the moral culpability of the offender at the time of the offence. Individually, but more often in some combination, they may indicate that the moral culpability is high. One way of expressing such a conclusion is to ask whether the combination of circumstances are such that it can be said that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct. That is not the only way of expressing such a conclusion."" 

31In R v Jurisic (supra), Spigelman CJ at CL at 228 quoted the following passage from the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Musumeci (Unrep., 30/10/97, NSWCCA) describing it as being in many respects a guideline judgment relating to the approach to be taken in sentencing for offences under s 52A Crimes Act 1900 : 
"" This court has held that a number of considerations which had to be taken into account when sentencing for culpable driving must also be taken into account when sentencing for this new offence of dangerous driving "": (My emphasis) 
1. The legislature has always placed a premium upon human life, and the taking of a human life by driving a motor vehicle dangerously is to be regarded as a crime of some seriousness. 
2. The real substance of the offence is not just the dangerous driving; it is the dangerous driving in association with the taking of a human life. 
3. Such is the need for public deterrence in this type of case, the youth of any offender is given less weight as a subjective matter than in other types of cases. 
4. The courts must tread warily in showing leniency for good character in such cases. 
5. So far as youthful offenders of good character who are guilty of dangerous driving, therefore, the sentence must be seen to have a reasonable proportionality to the objective circumstances of the crime, and persuasive subjective circumstances must not lead to inadequate weight being given to those objective circumstances. 
6. Periodic detention has a strong element of leniency built into it and, as presently administered, it is usually no more punitive than a community service order. 
7. The statement made by this court in relation to the previous offence of culpable driving - that it cannot be said that a full-time custodial sentence is required in every case - continues to apply in relation to the new offence of dangerous driving. As that offence is committed even though the offender has had no more than a momentary or casual lapse of attention, there must always be room for a non-custodial sentence (although that does not mean that a non-custodial sentence is ordinarily appropriate in such a case), but the case in which a sentence other than one involving full-time custody is appropriate must be rarer for this new offence."" 

32Spigelman CJ added that although these observations were made in the context of dangerous driving causing death, the comments can be readily adapted to the cognate offence of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm - such as the present case: R v Jurisic (supra) at 228. 

33I make the following findings of fact - 


The Offender was: 


suffering from sleep deprivation during his driving; 

feeling drowsy to the point he had to pull over and rest; 

""pushing"" himself to get home to bed; 

observed driving in an erratic manner leading up to collision; 

falling asleep at the wheel resulting in collision. 

Given an estimate of a blood alcohol reading of between 0.04 and 0.07 at the time of the collision and Doctor Perl's opinion that the Offender's ability to drive was impaired, he was under the influence of intoxicating liquor but at the lower end of the scale of intoxication. 

The Offender was sufficiently affected by fatigue and residual effects of alcohol that the driving was objectively dangerous to the extent the Offender posed a significant risk to the public. 

34I note straightaway that there is a combination of factors going to make up the factual findings, that is, manner of driving, sleep deprivation and the presence of alcohol. While the guideline has been described as a ""check"" and an ""indicator"", in R v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300, Howie J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Wood CJ at CL agreed) said at [21] that the factors in the list set out in Whyte as indicative of a typical case do not operate as a checklist with the presence or absence of characteristics having some mathematical relationship with the sentence to be imposed. They merely describe the typical case and were not intended to circumscribe the sentencing judge's discretion. 

35It is not an error to take into account other circumstances of aggravation different from the circumstances supporting the charge. The offence of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm under section 52A (3) has three variations: (1) driving under the influence, (2) driving at a speed dangerous, and (3) driving in a manner dangerous, and each variation carries the same penalty. 

36The De Simoni principle can have no application in a case where the so-called matters of aggravation are merely variations of the same offence and do not render the offender to a greater penalty: R v Douglas (1998) 29 MVR 316. 

Moral culpability and abandonment of responsibility. 

37The guideline indicates that an assessment of the offender's moral culpability is relevant to determining whether a custodial sentence should be imposed, as well as to determining the appropriate length of the sentence: R v Whyte at [ 214 ] and [ 229 ]. It is the ""central inquiry with regard to the objective circumstances of the particular offence"": R v Errington (2005) 157 A Crim R 553 at [ 26 ]. Although a full-time custodial sentence may be inevitable where it is determined that the offender has abandoned responsibility, it does not follow that where the offender has not abandoned responsibility that a full-time custodial sentence can be avoided: R v Dutton [2005] NSWCCA 248 at [ 29 ]. 

38The expressions ""abandonment of responsibility"", ""low level of culpability"" and ""the offender's moral culpability is high"", employed in the guideline judgment, are useful but necessarily flexible and ""it was not intended that they become terms of art in this branch of sentencing law"": Markham v R [2007] NSWCCA 295 per Hidden J at [ 25 ]. According to Rosenthal v R [2008] NSWCCA 149 at [16], abandonment of responsibility: 

""... is directed to the objective gravity of the offence. It is concerned, where relevant, with the extent to which the driver was affected by alcohol or a drug and, generally, with the course of driving and the danger posed by it in its attendant circumstances"". 

39As Howie J said in Gonzalez v R [2006] NSWCCA 4 at [ 13 ]: 

""There is a high degree of moral culpability displayed where there is present to a material degree one or more of the aggravating factors numbered (iii) to (ix) set out in Whyte . However, there may be other factors that reflect on the degree of moral culpability involved in a particular case and the factors identified in Whyte can vary in intensity: R v Tzanis (2005) 44 MVR 160 at [25]. The list of factors is illustrative only and not definitive: Errington (supra) at [36]."" 

40I appreciate that the question of whether an Offender has abandoned responsibility for their conduct, "" ... involves an element of judgment on which sentencing judges could reasonably differ"": see Whyte (supra) at [220]. But the facts when taken together make it difficult, in my view, to argue against a finding that the threshold of abandoning responsibility has been reached by the Offender - given the speed at which the vehicle was driven in the conditions (albeit within the applicable limit) for the prevailing foggy conditions; the observed erratic driving leading up to the collision; the acknowledgement of sleep deprivation and the need to hurry home to get to bed; the further acknowledgement of sleep deprivation in pulling over for a short rest period; the length of the journey undertaken; the consequent placing at risk of other users of the roadway (including those not only there but those who could reasonably be expected to be there); the presence of alcohol in his blood; and, of course, the actual grievous bodily harm caused to the victim. It is certainly not the worst of cases but I would place it on the middle range of the scale of offending, 

41This was not a case of momentary inattention of misjudgement. The Offender's conduct on this night was both wicked and reprehensible. It is a miracle people (including himself) were not killed. It occurs to me that Ben Corkhill is thankful on a daily basis that he was dropped off at home before the collision. He is the only fortunate one in all of this. 

42The Offender gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. It was not something he was in any way obliged to do. I formed a favourable impression of him. I do not propose to rehearse his evidence in any detail. I accept his candid admission that he knew he should not have been driving on this night. I accept his expressions of remorse and contrition, particularly insofar as his conduct impacted upon the condition of Mr Banks. He has apologised to Mr Banks and the parents and I accept he was and is genuine in this regard. I appreciate the effect of any disqualification of licence upon his job prospects. He says he has learnt a salutary lesson out of all this. 

43Mr Thorley of Counsel presented a detailed outline of his submissions and proceeded to address them. He referred to the authority of R v Townsend [2010] NSWCCA 336 - a Crown appeal relating to a charge of dangerous driving causing death. He urged upon the Court not to impose a full-time custodial penalty and took me to the alternatives. He submitted the Court must take into account the youth and good character of the Offender. I have read the character testimonials tendered on the Offender's behalf and all speak well of him. That is a proper submission to make, and, of course, I will do so. However, the common law is that, while generally speaking, deterrence is given less weight in cases involving young offenders and there is a greater emphasis on rehabilitation, this is often not the case for dangerous driving offences. 

44The usual rule that general deterrence applies with less force to the sentencing of young offenders does not apply to dangerous driving offences because there is a prevalence of these offences among young drivers, and the Courts have a duty to seek to deter this behaviour: see R v Smith (1997) 95 A Crim R 373. The courts have acknowledged that it is a difficult thing to send a young person of good character to gaol, but where appropriate, it must be done as a deterrent to others: R v Slattery (1996) 90 A Crim R 519 at 523. As Howie J noted in TG v R [2010] NSWCCA 28, if a young male is old enough to be licensed to drive a motor vehicle, he is to be assumed to be mature enough to comply with its conditions and the traffic rules. 

45I was also asked to take into account an aspect of extra-curial suffering. The Offender has been shunned by several former acquaintances who blame him for the parlous state of the victim's condition post-collision. The authorities recognise that this has its place in the sentencing equation. In R v Dutton (supra) it was noted that the impact of the crime upon the Offender's mental health where the victim has not died may also be a matter in mitigation on the same basis as if a physical injury had been suffered: In that case it was also relevant that the victim was the Offender's friend and the Offender had given assistance and support following the accident. Mr Thorley asks the Court to take into account the broken sleep patterns still being suffered by the Offender and his emotional state manifesting itself into bouts of physical sickness 

46Mr Thorley also submitted that the Offender's moral culpability was relatively low and that any punishment should reflect the lower range of punishment available. From what I have earlier said, it should be apparent that I do not share Mr Thorley's view. 

47The Court expresses its appreciation to Mr Thorley for his comprehensive submissions. He said all that could possibly be said for the Offender. I would not want it thought, given the comparative brevity of my summary of his submissions, that I have not given them full weight. 

Penalties 

48I turn now, and perhaps not before time, to the penalties the Court is to impose. The applicable sentencing principles are found in sections 3A and 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: see R v MA (2004) 145 A Crim R 434; R v King (2004) 150 A Crim R 409 per McColl JA . I am also required to consider the mandatory requirements of section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I am satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. In arriving at that conclusion I have regard to the nature of the offences committed, the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the need for general and specific deterrence and the subjective circumstances of the offender. 

49Taken together, along with a proper consideration of decisions of binding authority, I am of the view that this is not an appropriate case for sentences designed to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender at the expense of deterrence, retribution and denunciation. It follows from what I have just said that it is not appropriate for the sentences to be suspended: R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17; Blundell v R [2008] NSWCCA 92 per Simpson J. 

50I allow the full discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of the pleas in accordance with the principles in R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 . See also section 22(1), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

51For the charge of Dangerous Driving causing Grievous Bodily Harm the Offender is convicted and sentenced to an original term of 2 years. After applying a discount of 25% the term of the actual sentence is 1 year and 6 months with a non-parole period of 6 months commencing on 18 August 2011 and expiring on 17 February 2012. There is a balance of 1 year commencing on 18 February 2012 and expiring on 17 February 2013. 

52I find ""special circumstances"". The finding of special circumstances is a discretionary finding of fact (see R v El-Hayek (2004) 144 A Crim R 90 at [103]) and, even if special circumstances are found, the court is not obliged to vary the statutory ratio. The non-parole period must reflect the criminality involved in the offence, including its objective gravity and the need for general deterrence: see R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at 718. I will allow special circumstances principally on the basis of the Offender's age, this is his first time in custody and the need for extended supervision on release. 

53Pursuant to section 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I recommend the release of the Offender to parole, if otherwise appropriate, at the end of the non-parole period. Pursuant to section 51, I direct as a condition of parole that the Offender be subject to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service for such period as that Service deems necessary and undertake any program or treatment recommended by the Service. Any failure to comply with this direction may be regarded as a breach of parole. 

54As a separate order, the Offender is disqualified from holding any drivers or riders licence for a period of 18 months to date from 18 August 2011. The Offender must surrender his current drivers and/or riders licence immediately if it is in his present possession: see section 189, Road Transport (General) Act 2005 . If the Offender fails to surrender his licence to the Court or surrender it to the Roads and Traffic Authority as soon as possible after being convicted, he may be liable to prosecution and a potential maximum penalty of a fine of $2,200. 

55For the charge of Special Range PCA, the Offender is convicted and fined $500 plus $81 court costs. As a separate order the Offender is disqualified from holding any drivers or riders licence for a period of 6 months to date from 18 August 2011. 

56I am fully aware that I have just sentenced a 19 year old with no prior criminal history to a period of imprisonment for an act of criminally dangerous driving. I take the unusual step of recommending to the Department of Corrective Services that the Offender be classified as soon as possible after his reception into custody so as to permit him to serve his sentence at the Manus Correctional Centre, Tumbarumba, or a similar institution if at all possible. I direct the Registrar of the Local Court to endorse the Warrant of Commitment accordingly. I further direct that a copy of these Remarks on Sentence be attached to the Warrant of Commitment for the information of the Department of Corrective Services.

		29 August 2011",2011-08-17 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2709329,New South Wales Crime Commission v Jason Lee [2011] NSWSC 1037,"Judgment (Ex tempore) 

1HIS HONOUR: This is an application brought by an amended notice of motion by the New South Wales Crime Commission seeking orders pursuant to s 31D(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 for the examination on oath of the first defendant, Jason Lee and the fourth defendant, Seong Won Lee concerning the affairs of Mr Jason Lee, including the nature and location of any property in which he has an interest. 

2The Commission does not read any affidavit or other evidence in support of the motion but has usefully and helpfully provided to the Court a bundle of documents which has become Exhibit A which includes the previous orders, the pleadings, transcripts and judgments of various hearings of this Court and of the Court of Appeal. 

3As well, the evidence read by the defendants provides some background, to which I will come, of the criminal proceedings which have taken place. 

Existing Criminal Proceedings 

4Before proceeding to the issues raised by the amended notice of motion, it is necessary I give a little of the background to the present criminal proceedings. 

5In May 2010, Jason Lee and Seong Won Lee, to whom I will without meaning any disrespect refer to as the Lees, were charged in relation to the location by police of $1.147 million in cash at the residential address of Seong Won Lee, and also their alleged involvement in the supply of a large commercial quantity of drugs and the possession of various prohibited firearms which were also located at the premises of Seong Won Lee. 

6In November 2010, his Honour Judge Solomon of the District Court of New South Wales ordered that there be a separate trial of the money laundering offence relating to the $1.147 million in cash found at the premises of Seong Won Lee and the remaining drug and firearm offences. 

7In January 2011, a trial commenced before Judge Solomon in respect of the drug and firearm offences. On 16 March 2011, the Lees were each found guilty of the offences by a jury and convictions were entered. They are yet to be sentenced. I am told that sentencing proceedings have been adjourned to a date in October 2011. The money laundering charge I am told is likely to be heard by a jury towards the end of 2011. 

8As well, Mr Jason Lee has been charged with a series of offences relating to possession of drugs, goods in custody and knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime. These offences have been fixed to be heard by a trial with a jury which is due to commence on 8 October 2011. 

9It is clear from this short recitation that some, but not all, of the criminal charges with which the Lees were concerned have been disposed of. As well, until the Lees are sentenced in respect of the drug and firearm offences, consideration of any appeal against either conviction or sentence has not arisen. 

History of the Commission's Applications 

10It is necessary now to give some history of the proceedings before this Court brought by the Commission. 

11On 13 May 2010, Buddin J, after an ex parte hearing, made a series of orders which restrained Mr Jason Lee from, putting it shortly, dealing with or disposing of specified property. He also made an order in the following terms: 

""Pursuant to s 12(1) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 there shall be an examination on oath of the following persons before a Registrar concerning their own affairs and the affairs of each other including the nature and location of any property in which any of them have an interest:- 

(a) Jason Lee (also known as Do Young Lee; and 

(b) Elizabeth Pak"". 

12On that day, Buddin J also made an order under s 12(1) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act providing for an examination of the fourth defendant, Seong Won Lee, before a Registrar concerning the affairs of Jason Lee and Elizabeth Park. The precise terms of that order mirror those which were made with respect to Jason Lee. 

13On 11 June 2010, the Lees filed a summons in the Court of Appeal seeking leave to appeal against the examination orders. The effect of filing that summons is that the examination orders are held in abeyance pending the outcome of that summons and any appeal, if leave is granted. I do not know whether that summons has been listed for hearing or not. 

14On 10 June 2010, the Commission filed a notice of motion which sought orders with respect to the Lees in identical terms. It is sufficient if I set out the first of those orders, being the one which affects Jason Lee. It is in these terms: 

""Pursuant to s 31D(1)(a) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990, Jason Lee (also known as Do Young Lee) shall be examined on oath before a Registrar concerning his own affairs and including the nature and location of any property in which he has an interest, such examination to take place at 11:00am on 1 July 2010"". 

15As I have said, an order effectively in identical form, was sought with respect to the fourth defendant, Seong Won Lee, although the order for examination was intended to deal with the nature and location of any property in which Mr Jason Lee or Ms Elizabeth Pak had an interest. 

16The orders sought in that notice of motion which included orders against two other individuals came on for hearing before R S Hulme J in the Common Law Division of this Court on Monday 28 June 2010. At that time, the Commission was represented by counsel as were each of the respondents to the motion, namely the four individuals including the Lees. 

17Evidence was tendered to his Honour in support of that motion. At the end of the evidence and submissions, his Honour reserved his decision. 

18On 28 February 2011, R S Hulme J delivered his judgment with respect to the orders sought in the notice of motion. He granted the orders which were sought in respect of two individuals, Ms Elizabeth Pak and Mr Brendan Pak. But he refused to grant the orders sought with respect to the Lees. 

19His Honour's judgment is the subject of a summons seeking leave to appeal filed by the Commission on 30 May 2011. The orders sought in that summons are in the following form: 

""Leave to appeal from that part of the decision below in relation to the finding of his Honour, Justice R. S. Hulme, that: 

(a) the examinations of Jason Lee (also known as Do Young Lee) and Seong Won Lee pursuant to section 31D of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 would prejudice the fair trial of either or both of Jason Lee (also known as Do Young Lee) and Seong Won Lee; and 

(b) orders for the examination of Jason Lee (also known as Do Young Lee) or Seong Won Lee pursuant to section 31D of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 should not be made."" 

20In support of that summons, the Commission has filed a summary of argument and a supplementary summary of argument. It will be necessary to return to those documents in due course. 

21The amended notice of motion filed by the Crime Commission today seeks orders as I have said for the examination pursuant to s 31D(1)(a)(i) of the Lees with respect to the affairs, nature, location of property and the like of Mr Jason Lee. It also includes an application for the following order: 

""Pursuant to s 7(b) and the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010, any evidence given by the first defendant or the fourth defendant at an examination conducted pursuant to Orders 1 to 4 above is not to be published as defined in section 3 of that Act, or disclosed by any person other than: 

(a) for the purposes of these proceedings; or 

(b) for the purposes of proceeds in respect of any false or misleading evidence given at such an examination, 

until further order of the Court upon the ground that this order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice in relation to criminal proceedings against the first defendant and/or the fourth defendant that are pending or under appeal."" 

Submissions on the Amended Notice of Motion 

22The Commission submits that this Court is concerned on the present application with the effective maintenance of the right of silence by the Lees in relation to outstanding criminal charges. It submits that where there is an order of the kind sought under s 7(b) of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 to which I will refer for convenience only and without intending to decide any legal issue as a non-publication order, there can be no risk or no real risk of prejudice to existing or incomplete, and future criminal proceedings. 

23It is to be observed from the history which I have recounted that the actual orders sought by this amended notice of motion with respect to the examination of the Lees are in effectively identical form to those orders sought from R S Hulme J and which R S Hulme J refused. The only difference between the two motions is that a non-publication order is sought contemporaneously with the orders for examination. 

24It is because of this difference, that the Commission submits that it is not seeking to revisit the judgment of R S Hulme J which dismissed the applications. Nor is it seeking to visit and engage in any of the issues which are before the Court of Appeal. It submits, candidly, that by this device of including an order for non-publication in the summons, it is attempting to side step the judgment of R S Hulme J and that this Court should take the view that it is entirely free to consider the issues raised. I do not agree. 

25It has long been held in this and other Courts, that a Court may regard the revisiting of orders which had formerly been sought by a motion in a second notice of motion, as an abuse of process. I do not say that the authorities suggest that this is an absolute rule of law, it is nevertheless a relevant matter for consideration. 

26Hayne JA when sitting as a member of the Court of Appeal in the Supreme Court of Victoria in D A Christie Pty Ltd v Baker [1996] 2 VR 582 at 602 said the following with respect to an application dealing with a limitation issue in a civil suit: 

""The prospects of there being successive applications ... suggests not only the possibility that there may be conflicting decisions given with the inevitable harm that follows from that but also that a respondent to such an application may be vexed by successive applications until the applicant either produces sufficient material to warrant the grant of an extension of time or tires of the task. It is not fanciful to conclude that the making of successive applications may well engender a belief in the respondent that the applicant had, in effect, hawked the application from judge to judge until a judge had been found who was willing to accede to the applicant's arguments. The vice of such a result is apparent. 

Further, although it may be said that the awarding of costs on an indemnity basis may prove a sufficient deterrent to the making of repeated applications and may offer considerable protection to a respondent, I am of the view that it is not a complete protection."" 

27His Honour then went on to say at 603 the following: 

""It is clear that a court may stay its proceedings for abuse of process. There can be an abuse of process if proceedings are initiated for an ulterior and improper purpose ... But it is also clear that there can be an abuse if 'notwithstanding that the circumstances do not give rise to an estoppel, their continuance would be unjustifiably vexatious and oppressive for the reason that it is sought to litigate anew a case which had already been disposed of by earlier proceedings'."" 

28The Court of Appeal in a decision of National Parks and Wildlife Service v Pierson (2002) 55 NSWLR 315 said at [17] in the judgment of Palmer J with whom Mason P and Santo JA agreed, this: 

""It should be remembered that the majority in Nominal Defendant v Manning differed from the President only to the extent that they would not, without more, hold it an abuse of process for an applicant to make a second interlocutory application on the basis of evidence which could reasonably have been adduced in the first application."" 

29Nothing said by their Honours could be construed as indicating a permissive or relaxed attitude of the Court to the bringing of more than one interlocutory application for the same order. Indeed quite the contrary. 

30The decision to which the Court referred, namely Nominal Defendant v Manning is reported in [2000] 50 NSWLR 139. What Justice Heydon said there at [72] was this: 

""Nothing in the above reasoning rejecting the Nominal Defendant's submission is intended to encourage litigants to avoid putting their best cases forward in any interlocutory application. The deliberate non-tender of evidence for use in a second interlocutory application should the first fail, or for use in an interlocutory appeal from the interlocutory application, might of itself be fatal to success; and even the non-deliberate failure to tender evidence is extremely risky. The Nominal Defendant's proposition that no second interlocutory application can be entertained unless there is a change of circumstances or unless evidence is relied on which could not reasonably have been obtained earlier is too extreme, but a litigant bringing a second application where circumstances have not changed on evidence available earlier is facing serious and self-created risks of an adverse exercise of judicial discretion. The real evils to which Hayne JA referred in D A Christie Pty Ltd v Baker ... the risk of conflicting decisions, the unnecessary vexing of respondents, judge-shopping and the diminution of certainty in the conduct by respondents of their affairs - and others - damaging public confidence in the integrity of judicial decisions, expending time and money on litigation unnecessarily - are evils which each court in its individual discretion will rightly strain to avoid"". 

31At the time that the orders were sought from R S Hulme J in this Court, a non-publication order with respect to an examination was available under s 62 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act . Section 62 as it then existed permitted this Court to make 

""such orders as it thinks fit with respect to the publication of any matter arising under this Act"". 

Whilst there were two pre-conditions for the making of such an order, the Commission accepts that those two pre-conditions were fulfilled in the circumstances of this case. 

32Since the decision of R S Hulme J, a new Act of Parliament entitled the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 has come into effect. It commenced on 1 July 2011. It provides that this Court has the power to make a suppression order or a non-publication order where, amongst other things, it is necessary in order to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice. 

33It is the availability of this order and the fact that it is being sought at the time the examination order is sought which the Commission relies upon as constituting a sufficient change in circumstances from the order sought from R S Hulme J, so as to mean that this notice of motion is not an attempt to re-litigate the issues before R S Hulme J. 

34It is worthwhile examining the summary of argument which the Crime Commission has placed before the Court of Appeal in support of its appeal. At [17] of its principal summary of argument, the Crime Commission said this: 

""The examinations sought were and are solely directed to the confiscation proceedings and have nothing whatever to do with the criminal proceedings against either proposed examinee. This is a position expressly contemplated by s 63 of the Act, which denies any right to a stay of confiscation proceedings by reason of incomplete criminal proceedings. Section 63 is supported by ss 13 and 13A which require any self incrimination answers to be given, but renders such answers inadmissible in criminal proceedings. It is also supported by s 62 of the Act in providing wide and unfettered scope for non-publication orders in the circumstances prevailing in this case"". 

35The submissions go on to say in [18] that the non-publication power in s 62 of the Act gives the Supreme Court an unfettered discretion to make such orders as it thinks fit with respect to the publication of any matter arising under the Act and it argues in [19], that s 62 enables the Supreme Court to give the full range of protection necessary to ensure that the separation between proceedings under the Act of any criminal proceedings is not just legal and evidentiary but practical as well. 

36That summary of argument was filed before the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 commenced. Subsequent to the commencement of that Act, the Commission filed a supplementary summary of argument. It drew the Court's attention to the new legislation and it said this at [6]: 

""This legislative change does not adversely affect the substance of the applicant's ( the Commission's ) argument. It is apparent that s 7(b) ... is relevantly the same as the former s 62 in that it too is a provision giving a court a discretion to make a non-publication order."" 

It then identified differences in the application of s 7(b) but submitted to the Court of Appeal that those differences were immaterial in this case. 

37It then went on to submit this in [10]: 

""On the reasoning of the judge below, an examination order for the respondents would still most likely have been refused by his Honour even if s 7(b), rather than the former s 62 had been the source of power to grant a non-publication order. The appeal point therefore remains for the determination by this Court"". 

38It seems to me that the arguments placed by the Commission before the Court of Appeal in support of a direct challenge to the exercise of discretion by R S Hulme J to decline to make the orders for examination of the Lees, challenges the adequate and proper exercise of his Honour's discretion. It does so by arguing that there is no real risk to the administration of justice. Inherent in that argument, as I read it, is that nonpublication orders are relevantly identical under s 62 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act and s 7 of the Court Suppression and Nonpublication Orders Act . 

39There is no merit in my view in the submission of the Commission to this Court on this motion that there is a difference of substance in the orders now being sought when compared with the orders being sought from R S Hulme J. It would be, and I regard it as, an abuse of process for this Court to entertain this application at this time. 

40Accordingly I dismiss the application. 

41I order that the plaintiff, the New South Wales Crime Commission, pay the costs of the defendants Jason Lee and Seong Won Lee of the motion

		07 September 2011",2011-08-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709334,R v Hawi & ors (No 16) [2011] NSWSC 1662,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: This judgment relates to an issue that was first ventilated on 8 August 2011 (T3392-3396); again on 9 August (T3398-3401); and finally on 10 August (T3519-3529). At the conclusion of submissions on the latter occasion I gave brief reasons for ruling that the evidence that is the subject of the issue was not admissible. I have amplified my reasoning in this revised judgment. 

2Mr Trevallion, on behalf of the accused Abounader, adduced in evidence in the course of the cross-examination of Detective Spelling a previous representation made by Mr Abounader upon his arrest on 3 July 2009 (T3238). The Crown did not lead much evidence as to the circumstances pertaining to that arrest as it was mindful of the potential for prejudice (for example, Mr Abounader was arrested at gunpoint). However, in cross-examination Mr Trevallion had Detective Spelling confirm that Mr Abounader was arrested while driving his car; that he was asked to get out of the car; that when he got out of the car he was placed under arrest; and that he said words to the effect of, ""Do you think I'm a murderer or Ivan Milat?"". The detective agreed to those propositions put by Mr Trevallion. 

3Mr Trevallion then had the detective confirm that Mr Abounader was informed as to his right of silence and that Mr Abounader responded, ""I have nothing to say to you. I didn't do anything, just do what you have to do"" . (Evidence that was not before the jury but is available to be led that this response followed Mr Abounader having been informed he was under arrest for a charge of riot). 

4That being evidence of a previous representation made by Mr Abounader, Mr Trevallion now seeks to have admitted certain credibility evidence about the maker of that representation. Reliance was placed upon s 108A of the Evidence Act 1995 which is in the following terms: 

108A Admissibility of evidence of credibility of person who has made a previous representation 

(1) If: 

(a) evidence of a previous representation has been admitted in a proceeding, and 

(b) the person who made the representation has not been called, and will not be called, to give evidence in the proceeding, 

credibility evidence about the person who made the representation is not admissible unless the evidence could substantially affect the assessment of the person's credibility. 

(2) Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purposes of subsection (1), it is to have regard to: 

(a) whether the evidence tends to prove that the person who made the representation knowingly or recklessly made a false representation when the person was under an obligation to tell the truth, and 

(b) the period that elapsed between the doing of the acts or the occurrence of the events to which the representation related and the making of the representation. 

5There are a number of components of the provision to be noted. It is the case, as I have observed above, that ""evidence of a previous representation has been admitted"". It is certainly the case that Mr Abounader ""has not been called"" and Mr Trevallion informed me that he ""will not be called"", to give evidence. 

6The section authorises, in the circumstances described, the admission of ""credibility evidence about"" Mr Abounader. ""Credibility evidence"" is concerned with evidence which is ""relevant to the credibility of"" Mr Abounader: Evidence Act , s 101A . ""Credibility of a person who has made a representation that has been admitted in evidence"" is defined in Pt 1 of the Dictionary as meaning ""the credibility of the representation"". Having regard to these provisions, the evidence that is now sought to be adduced must be relevant to the credibility of Mr Abounader's statements to Detective Spelling on 3 July 2009 that he ""didn't do anything"" and, in effect, that he was not a murderer. 

7Finally, and most importantly, it should be noted that the evidence is not admissible ""unless [it] could substantially affect the assessment of [Mr Abounader's] credibility"". 

8Putting the last two matters together, the evidence must be relevant to the credibility of the statements made on 3 July 2009 and must be capable of substantially affecting the assessment of Mr Abounader's credibility. 

9There are two matters mentioned in s 108A(2) that a court must have regard to. No submissions were made in respect of either of them. They do not appear to be of any present significance so they may be put to one side. 

10The evidence that is sought to be adduced is as follows. A Detective Heagney is shortly to be called. He had some involvement, apparently, in relation to some intercepted telephone conversations recorded by the New South Wales Crime Commission. That interception operation had nothing to do with the investigation into the events at the airport on 22 March 2009 with which this trial is concerned. 

11There was a telephone conversation recorded on 23 March 2009 which commenced at 6:49:38pm, which primarily involved discussion between Mr Abounader and an unknown male. In the course of that discussion, Mr Abounader said, ""Ah, nothing man, they can't do nothing it's self-defence man"" . The unknown male responded, ""Defence"" . Mr Abounader responded, ""Self-defence"" . Mr Trevallion indicated that he proposed to simply lead evidence from Detective Heagney that this passage appears in that intercepted telephone conversation. It is not intended to adduce any other portion of the conversation. I note that the passage comprises three lines in a seven page transcript. 

12Mr Trevallion made reference to Regina v Rymer [2005] NSWCCA 310; (2005) 156 A Crim R 84 in which Grove J gave consideration to the Crown adducing evidence of prior exculpatory statements made by an accused. I need not refer to the detail of that judgment, but it is notable that there is reference there to it being regarded as a long held practice adopted by the Crown, usually, but not only, applied in circumstances where exculpatory statements are made when an accused is confronted with an allegation by a police officer. Note was taken of the possibility of an accused bringing forward a ""contrived 'hearsay case'"" (at [58]). Reference was also made (at [62]) to the fact that in the modern era, video recording of police questioning enables a jury to assess the credibility of a prior representation made to police officers. 

13In any consideration of Regina v Rymer , regard must be had to subsequent changes in the statutory landscape. It has been observed in Stephen Odgers, Uniform Evidence Law, 9 th ed (2010) Lawbook Co at [1.3.7618] that ""since the amendments to the [ Evidence Act ] following on ALRC 102 have effectively reversed [ Adam v The Queen [2001] HCA 57; (2001) 207 CLR 96], Rymer can no longer be regarded as good law"". There is no need for present purposes to explore the detail of the amendments referred to. 

14The present question is really whether the statements within the short extract of the intercepted telephone conversation that Mr Trevallion relies upon could substantially affect the assessment of Mr Abounader's credibility in terms of the responses he made to Detective Spelling upon arrest. Those responses, taking a rather broad view of them, could be regarded as a denial of an allegation that he was criminally responsible in respect of a riot at the airport on 22 March 2009. Taking an even broader view, they could be regarded as a denial of criminal responsibility for the death of the deceased. 

15A statement that was recorded, unbeknown to Mr Abounader, that ""it was self defence"" could be regarded as a prior consistent statement which could affect the assessment of the credibility of Mr Abounader and the statements he made to Detective Spelling just over three months later. But to view it in that way would be to take a very limited view and to ignore reality. 

16The Crown has referred me to the entirety of the conversation to which Mr Trevallion has referred. My attention has also been invited to an intercepted telephone conversation which immediately preceded it. 

17At 6:37:34pm on 23 March 2009 there was a telephone call which, in part, involved conversation between Tiago Costa and Mr Abounader. (Mr Costa was a fellow member of the Comanchero who has pleaded guilty and been sentenced for his involvement in the events at the airport). It includes some discussion concerning the events at the airport the previous day. From the content of the conversation, and particularly from the tone of that conversation, it appears that a rather light-hearted view of the incident was taken by Mr Abounader. There is a significant level of bravado apparent. That seems to continue in the conversation that almost immediately follows with the unknown male which commenced at 6:49:38pm. A lot of the latter conversation is in Arabic, but even with the limitations that imposes, there is sufficient in the recording to make the tone of the conversation apparent and there is sufficient English within the conversation that aids that assessment. 

18In my view, looking at the two conversations together, it is very clear that the tone adopted by Mr Abounader is one which makes it very likely that the short passage in which he refers to ""self-defence"" is not a serious and genuine assertion. It is highly unlikely to be regarded as such by the jury. I acknowledge that it is a matter for the jury whether the evidence does substantially affect the assessment of a person's credibility. The question for me is whether this evidence could affect that assessment. 

19While the passage relied upon by Mr Trevallion, on its own, divorced from its context, might affect the assessment of Mr Abounader's credibility and the credibility of the assertions made upon his arrest on 3 July 2009, I am not persuaded that it could substantially affect that assessment. Further, however, I am of the view that it would be positively misleading to place that passage before the jury divorced from its context. When seen in the light of the context, I am even more convinced that it could not substantially affect the assessment of Mr Abounder's credibility. Indeed, there is a potential that it would more likely reflect adversely upon Mr Abounader. 

20For these reasons, the evidence is not admissible.

		10 February 2012",2011-08-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709338,Miller v R [2011] NSWCCA 195,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave from this Court to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The application is out of time. Furthermore in my opinion there is no jurisdiction in this Court to entertain the application and in any event is otherwise an application in respect of which leave should be denied.

2The ""decision"" which the applicant seeks to challenge was made by the magistrate in committal proceedings with respect to the applicant on 1 April 2011. The application before this Court was dated 27 April 2011. The Criminal Appeal Rules provide that notice of an application for leave to appeal must be filed within 14 days of the date of the judgment or order (reg 5B). Accordingly the application was twelve days out of time.

3The applicant has been charged with 21 offences contrary to s 300(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (use false instrument) and one charge contrary to s 178BA(1) of the Act (obtain benefit by deception). The offences allegedly occurred in 2005 and 2006. The applicant first appeared in the Local Court in relation to these matters in January 2009.

4The magistrate who heard the committal proceedings was assisted by a statement of facts outlining the Crown's allegations. He also had the benefit of oral evidence from nine witnesses. They gave evidence pursuant to an order to which both parties consented under s 91 of Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).

5The history of the matter in the Local Court is lengthy. On the final day of the committal hearing, 1 April 2011, counsel who appeared for the applicant made an application in which he sought orders pursuant to s 91, both widening the scope of the cross-examination of the witnesses and also seeking the attendance of further witnesses to give evidence at the committal hearing.

6Following discussion in which the magistrate indicated he would decline the application, counsel made an application for an adjournment. That application was refused. The applicant was subsequently committed for trial in the District Court. That trial has been listed to commence on 26 September 2011.

7As I understand the position, the relief which the applicant seeks in this Court is confined to an application for leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3)(a) against the decision of the magistrate declining to exercise the jurisdiction available under s 91.

8The applicant appears today in person. He has filed written submissions in support of his application. The Crown has responded to those submissions. We were informed this morning that the applicant sought legal aid for representation in relation to this application. His application to Legal Aid was denied. He informed the court that he had lodged an appeal in relation to the denial of legal aid, that appeal having been filed with the commission on one day last week. He now seeks an adjournment of the hearing of this application pending the resolution of that appeal.

9The applicant has disclosed to us this morning the advice which was received by the Commission in relation to this application for legal aid in support of this application. That advice is plain. The Commission has been advised that there is no jurisdiction in this Court to entertain the application. No doubt in light of that advice the Commission has refused legal aid. As that advice would be considered in support of any appeal I am satisfied that such an appeal must fail. Although the applicant does not concede that it will fail the submissions which he has made to this Court this morning makes plain in my opinion that he does not have a genuine belief in the likelihood of that appeal succeeding.

10In those circumstances, s 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act 1979 (NSW) must be considered by this Court. That section provides that a court shall adjourn proceedings in the event of an appeal having been made with respect to the denial of legal aid provided that the court is satisfied that ""the appeal or intention to appeal is bona fide and not frivolous or vexatious or otherwise intended to improperly hinder or improperly delay the conduct of the proceedings"" (s 57(b)).

11Bearing in mind that the applicant is aware of the advice which the Commission has received in relation to the prospects of success and having regard to the submissions which he made to the court this morning, I am not satisfied that the appeal is bona fide.

12I should add that I pass no judgment or indeed comment upon the complaint which the applicant makes in relation to the conduct of the committal proceedings. However, as I understand that complaint it is one which could be adequately addressed by the trial judge who, if persuaded that it is in the interests of justice to do so, could provide a Basha enquiry ((1989) 39 A Crim R 337) so that any prospective witness can be examined before the trial commences. As I understand it, it is the fact that various witnesses were not called before the magistrate which lies at the heart of the applicant's complaint.

13With respect to the substantive application before this Court I should indicate that in R v Colby (1995) 84 A Crim R 125 this Court considered whether an appeal was available with respect to a decision made pursuant to s 48EA of the Justices Act, the predecessor to s 91 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). In that case the court (Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Dowd J) decided that the decision was not amenable to appeal because it was not an interlocutory judgment or order within the meaning of s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. It was a ruling or decision in relation to an application for a direction under the relevant section. Accordingly, if I had to resolve the matter I am satisfied this Court does not have jurisdiction to consider the present application.

14Apart from this Court lacking jurisdiction I am satisfied that if jurisdiction was available the application should nevertheless be refused. If in the interests of justice it is appropriate for persons who did not give evidence before the magistrate to be examined before the trial in the District Court, as I have already indicated, a Basha enquiry may be appropriate.

15In all the circumstances, I am not persuaded that in the relevant sense the applicant's appeal against the denial of legal aid to the Legal Aid Commission is bona fide. Further, I am not persuaded that in the dismissing of this application the applicant will suffer an injustice that cannot be appropriately dealt within the course of the management of his prospective trial.

16In all of the circumstances, in my opinion leave, to appeal should be refused and the application dismissed.

17ADAMS J: I agree with the Chief Judge at Common Law in respect of the application of s 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act 1979 to the circumstances of this case.

18So far as the principal matter is concerned, I agree also with what has been said by his Honour but I would add that, as the transcript of the committal proceedings makes clear, the only application made by counsel for the applicant was for an adjournment in order to make an application to cross-examine further witnesses and widen the scope of cross-examination of witnesses called. Counsel did not give any ground or basis for seeking that adjournment except that he had been instructed to seek it. The learned Magistrate's refusal of the adjournment was both proper and inevitable.

19I agree with the order proposed by the Chief Judge.

20FULLERTON J: I also agree.

21McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The orders of the court are as I have indicated.

2709343,Clayton Matthew KEAN v R [2011] NSWCCA 136,"JUDGMENT 

1CAMPBELL JA : I have had the advantage of reading the judgments of RS Hulme J and Adams J. As they reveal a difference of opinion between two judges each of whom is highly experienced in the criminal law, and there is one conclusion with which I do not agree, I should state briefly my own views.

3The differing sentences proposed respectively by the trial judge, RS Hulme J and Adams J can be represented as follows: 


Ground 2 

4I agree with Adams J, for the reasons he gives, that the sentences are manifestly excessive and that resentencing is required. 

Ground 1 

5The CAN offence related to a contravention of s 112(1) Crimes Act 1900. If that offence had been prosecuted in the Local Court, s 267(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 would have had the effect that the maximum sentence able to be imposed was 2 years. I agree with Adams J that the applicant's history made that maximum sentence inappropriate. However, in circumstances where the trial judge imposed a sentence of 5 years and a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months for the CAN offence, together with the Form 1 offence, and where the judge erred in failing to take into account that the CAN offence could have been dealt with in the Local Court, I am unable to reach a positive conclusion that this error did not prejudice the applicant. 

6When there has been an error of principle by the trial judge in the course of sentencing, and I am unable to reach a positive conclusion that that error has not affected the sentence the judge imposed, the proper course, in my view, would be to uphold the appeal concerning ground 1. However, the only effect of my reaching that conclusion is that ground 1 and ground 2 each provide an independent reason for re-sentencing the applicant. 

Resentencing 

7The only difference of substance between Adams J and RS Hulme J concerns the manner in which a total sentence of 3 years for count 1 (on which they agree) should be divided between the non-parole period and the balance of term. I agree with both of them concerning that total sentence. A term of 3 years bears an appropriate relationship to the maximum term that is permissible, bearing in mind the objective seriousness of this instance of offending by comparison with the total range of offending that could fall within the particular offence charged, the offender's subjective circumstances, and the objectives of sentencing. 

8I agree with RS Hulme J concerning the length of the non-parole period that is appropriate for count 1. The non-parole period that his Honour proposes, of 2 years 3 months is well below the standard non-parole period of 5 years. It reflects the extent to which the objective seriousness of the crime is well below the mid-range for contraventions of s 112(2) Crimes Act . It reflects both the aspects of the subjective circumstances of the applicant that tend to a lesser sentence, and the aspects of his subjective circumstances (such as his record) that tend against a lesser sentence. It is in my view consistent with the objectives of sentencing. While the ways in which those considerations were exhibited in the present case would need to be articulated if this were a principal judgment in the appeal, I do not think that is necessary when I am agreeing with a judgment already written. 

9The remaining differences between the sentences proposed by their Honours are consequential on their difference of view about the appropriate length of the non-parole period for count 1. 

10It was not suggested, and could not have been suggested, that the 12 months fixed term sentence that the judge imposed for count 3 was greater than the term that this Court should impose in resentencing. 

11Each of their Honours arranges the 12 months fixed term sentence for count 3 to run so that the first 6 months of that 12 month fixed term is concurrent with the last 6 months of the non-parole period for count 1, and the remaining 6 months of the 12 month fixed term for count 3 is not concurrent with any other sentence. This is, with respect, a correct application of a principle that had been overlooked by the primary judge. That principle is that when several sentences are imposed on an offender they should usually be arranged so that it is possible for both the offender and the community to see, concerning each offence, that there is an identifiable period of time when the offender is serving a non-parole period attributable only to that offence. This principle might need to be departed from in circumstances such as when considerations of totality make it impossible for the sentences to be arranged in that way, or if a very large number of offences are being sentenced for, but the present is not such a case. 

12Adams J and RS Hulme J agree concerning both the appropriate non-parole period and the appropriate balance of term for the CAN offence together with the Form 1 offence. Both Adams J and RS Hulme J propose that the sentence for those offences should commence only at the end of the fixed term imposed for the count 3 offence. Their Honours have, in these respects, acted in a way with which I agree in composing an overall sentence. 

13For these reasons, I agree with the orders proposed by RS Hulme J. 

14RS HULME J : In this matter I have the advantage of reading the Reasons for Judgment of Adams J. Subject to the following remarks, I agree with his Honour. 

15For the reasons stated by Adams J the sentencing Judge, to adapt the words of ground 1, ""erred in failing to have any... regard to the fact that counts 2 and 3 [a mistake respectively for count 3 and the CAN offence] could have been dealt with in the Local Court"". It follows that he failed to have ""proper regard"". 

16However, for the reasons given by Adams J, proper regard would have involved his Honour in concluding that the jurisdiction of the Local Court was inadequate, that that court was an inappropriate forum, and that the possibility that it could have been dealt with there, a matter of no weight. 

17Thus, essentially for the reasons given by Adams J, but contrary to his Honour's conclusion, it seems to me that this ground, in the precise language in which it is expressed, should be upheld. That said, while the sentencing Judge erred, the error the subject of this ground was of no consequence. 

18In R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130 the Court, of which I was a member, considered at some length the seriousness of offences of breaking, entering and stealing and car stealing. I see no reason to depart from anything said there and my approach to the Applicant's offending reflects those remarks. 

19Immediately prior to committing the offence, the subject of Count 1, the Applicant was on premises that were not his, it is to be inferred, for the purposes of offending. He then tried to break in. His failure to do so would not seem due to any pangs of conscience but in consequence of finding some other, presumably more convenient, way of obtaining possession of the handbag he stole. 

20The Applicant is to be sentenced for what he did and it is relevant that he did not extend his activities to causing his whole body to enter the premises, the subject of the first charge. However, that he made no more extensive efforts than he did to obtain access to the property stolen, is not a matter for which he is entitled to much credit. His return visit on the following day to steal the motor vehicle confirms that view. 

21It may well be as Adams J has suggested that incarceration has little value as a deterrent to the Applicant. However, there remain considerations of general deterrence, retribution, and protection of the community. While I do not suggest this last mentioned factor should lead to imprisonment of the Applicant for longer than his offence otherwise merits, his appalling history to date indicates that this is not a matter to be treated lightly. 

22I agree with Adams J that an appropriate head sentence for the Count 1 offence is 3 years. However, I can see no reason why the non-parole period should be any less than the proportion envisaged by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , viz. three-quarters of the head sentence. 

23Accordingly I propose the following orders:- 

(i) Grant leave to appeal. 

(ii) Allow the appeal. 

(iii) Quash the sentences imposed on the Applicant by Berman DCJ on 12 February 2010. 

(iv) In respect of Count 1, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 1 December 2008 together with a further term of 9 months commencing on 1 March 2011. 

(v) In respect of Count 3, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year commencing on 1 September 2010. 

(vi) In respect of the CAN offence, and taking into account the Form 1 offence, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 9 months commencing on 1 September 2011 together with a further term of 2 years commencing on 1 June 2012. 

(vii) Record as the date upon which it appears that the Applicant is entitled to release on parole, 1 June 2012. 

24ADAMS J: 

Introduction 

25On 16 November 2009 the applicant was convicted in the District Court of the offence of breaking and entering a dwelling house and stealing an item from it, knowing that a person was inside the premises, the latter being a circumstance of aggravation (count 1). He had pleaded guilty to an alternative count which did not allege the aggravating circumstance but the Crown declined to accept this plea in discharge of the indictment. The applicant was tried (by judge alone) and convicted of the principal count. On the same date, he pleaded guilty to an offence of stealing a motor vehicle from the occupier of the premises (count 3). In addition, the applicant pleaded guilty to breaking, entering and stealing from commercial premises, this being before the Court by virtue of a court attendance notice, to which he had pleaded guilty in the Local Court (CAN offence). He asked that the theft of another motor vehicle should be taken into account on a Form 1. The offences were committed respectively on 29 and 30 September and 11 and 6 December 2008. 

26The count 1 offence carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years with a standard non-parole period of five years. The CAN offence carries a maximum term of imprisonment of fourteen years whilst count 3 carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. 

27On count 1 he was sentenced to imprisonment for four years commencing on 1 December 2008 with a non-parole period of two years and six months. On count 3 he was sentenced (allowing a discount of 25% for the plea) to imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months commencing on 1 December 2010. On the CAN offence (taking into account the Form 1 offence and allowing a discount of 25% for the plea) the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for five years commencing on 1 June 2010 with a non-parole period of two years and six months. The effective aggregate sentence was therefore imprisonment for six years and six months commencing on 1 December 2008 with a non-parole period of four years. The commencement date reflected backdating accounting for the time spent in custody of one year, two months and 12 days. 

28The applicant seeks leave to appeal upon the following grounds - 

Ground 1 - The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to have any or proper regard to the fact that counts 2 and 3 [a mistake respectively for count 3 and the CAN offence] could have been dealt with in the Local Court and failed to have any or proper regard to the maximum penalty in such a case. 

Ground 2 - The individual sentences imposed on counts 1 and 3 [this being an error for the CAN offence] were manifestly excessive and the overall sentence was manifestly excessive. 

The facts 

29For the purpose of the sentencing proceedings, the facts were not controversial. The following is taken largely from the sentencing judge's reasons. 

30On 29 September 2008 the female victim and her husband were at home in the afternoon, the latter leaving at about 5.30pm, his wife then in a study on the third storey of their home. The applicant, seeing the male victim leave the house, looked through one of the windows and saw a bag on a chest of drawers. He removed a flyscreen in order to enter the house through a window but could not open it because it was deadlocked. Seeing a dog door in a set of doors on the ground floor, he got a garden stake and, putting part of his body through, lifted the bag off the chest of drawers using the stake. He escaped with the bag. Whilst he was doing this, the female victim heard noises from downstairs and called out. Receiving no answer, she ignored the noise and went back to work. The sentencing judge found that the applicant knew that it was likely that a person was home when the offence was committed but that, although the offence was aggravated because the premises were occupied, the female victim did not realise she had been burgled until some time later and, of course, it was not a case where there was any confrontation with an offender. The bag contained a wallet, housekeys, miscellaneous personal papers and the key to the victim's motor vehicle. There is no evidence, one way or another, as to whether the bag and its contents were recovered or what happened to the motor vehicle. 

31So far as count 3 is concerned, on the day following the break-in, the applicant returned to the premises and stole the motor vehicle using the keys that were in the bag. 

32The CAN offence committed on 11 December 2008 involved the applicant entering commercial premises through an unlocked steel security gate. People who were inside heard the door being opened and went to investigate, finding the applicant standing next to the safe. They panicked, ran out the front of the store and used a bystander's phone to call police. In the meantime, the applicant opened the safe, removed about $200 in cash from it and ran away. When police attended they discovered his fingerprint. The Form 1 offence involved the theft of a motor vehicle on 6 December 2008. 

Prior offences 

33The applicant had a very lengthy criminal history and, as his Honour observed, had spent a great deal of his life in custody. He was 32 years of age at the time of the offences. His first conviction occurred in June 1993 when he was 16 years of age. This conviction was followed by further convictions of stealing and burglary in 1995, forgery, uttering, obtaining goods by false pretences, stealing and burglary, attempted armed robbery in 1999, burglary and stealing offences in 2002, possessing firearms in 2003, stealing, aggravated robbery and burglary and other offences of dishonesty in 2003, burglary and stealing in 2004 and 2005 in which year he was also convicted of further firearm offences. He has also been convicted of a large number of traffic offences and offences involving the use and possession of drugs. He had been released on parole in March 2008 and the count 1 offence was committed only 11 days and the count 2 offence 12 days after the expiry of that period. 

Ground of appeal 1 

34It is not disputed that count 3 and the CAN offence could have been dealt with in the Local Court as a matter of jurisdiction. It is not clear why, apart from convenience, these counts were dealt with in the District Court. In written submissions counsel for the Crown drew the sentencing judge's attention to the maximum penalty in the Local Court for the count 3 offence in the context of the application of the guideline judgment of R v Ponfield & Others (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 in which Grove J (with whom the other members of the bench agreed) pointed out that it was a matter of ""particular significance"" that statutory provision was made for disposing of offences contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 summarily in the Local Court and noting ""the vast proportion of offences under ... [this provision] are, and every indication is that they will continue to be, dealt with in the Local Courts"". However, as it happened, no oral submissions were made to the sentencing judge by counsel either for the prosecution or the defence on the possible significance of the concurrent Local Court jurisdiction in respect of these counts and the sentencing judge did not refer to the matter. 

35The relevant principles were distilled by Hall J (the other judges agreeing) in R v Palmer [2005] NSWCCA 349 as follows - 

(a) The first is that a judge in the District Court is not bound by the jurisdictional limit imposed on the Local Court when dealing with an offence on indictment which was capable of summary disposal, but may have regard to that limit when the case is one which could appropriately have been disposed of in the Local Court: Regina v. Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297 at [16]; Regina v. LPY (2002) 136 A. Crim. R. 237 at 240 and Regina v. El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [30]. 

(b) Secondly, the fact that a matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court, had the prosecuting authority not elected otherwise, remains a relevant consideration in the exercise of the discretion reserved to the sentencing judge: Crombie ( supra ) at [15]. 

(c) Thirdly, however, the relevant decisions that establish that principle do not go so far as to require the sentencing judge to proceed upon the basis that the maximum available sentence is that which could have been imposed in the Local Court. At most they establish that the circumstance identified is to be taken into account. Depending upon the objective and the subjective criminality of the offender, it may properly be regarded as calling for some mitigation of the sentence that would otherwise be imposed in the District Court for an offence prosecuted upon indictment. Where it appears that that circumstance has been entirely overlooked by the sentencing judge, it may properly justify the granting of leave to appeal: Crombie (supra) at [16]. 

(d) Fourthly, the significance of the loss of the chance of the matter being dealt with in the Local Court varies from case to case. In some cases it would contribute to mitigation of sentence. It is a matter to be taken into account, but is not a universal factor for the reduction of sentence: Regina v. Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115. 

(e) Fifthly, the failure by a sentencing judge to mention the matter in his or her remarks on sentence and the length of the sentence does not necessarily establish that the sentencing judge failed to have regard to the matter. In some circumstances the length of the sentence may not suggest that the matter was overlooked: Regina v. Depoma [2003] NSWCCA 382 at [17]. 

(f) Finally, in circumstances where a sentencing judge has made no reference to the summary disposal argument in his or her remarks on sentence, it is necessary to consider whether that omission is indicative of error. One way of testing that proposition is to consider whether the sentence itself appears manifestly excessive in all the circumstances of the case - if the factor had been taken into account and given appropriate weight, a substantially lesser sentence was appropriate in the case: El Masri (supra) at [45] per Johnson, J. (with whom Hunt, AJA. and Hulme, J. agreed). 

36It is submitted on behalf of the Crown that the applicant's criminal history, together with the fact that the CAN offence was committed whilst on bail (granted 26 November 2008) meant that considerations of personal deterrence required a sentence beyond the jurisdictional limit of the Local Court and, hence, the mere fact that the Local Court might otherwise have appropriately exercised its jurisdiction was immaterial. On the other hand, it is contended by Mr Averre of counsel for the applicant that, although these were material factors, the actual criminality involved in the offence itself was not such as would have required a removal of the count into the District Court were it not for the incidental fact that he was to be sentenced for count 1. 

37The first question to be determined is whether the sentencing judge overlooked the matter. Certainly, as I have mentioned, his Honour did not mention it in his reasons. It seems clear that, if the matter had come before the District Court as an administrative convenience, the fact that it could have been dealt with in the Local Court and, in the normal course, is a matter of significance. Here, the fact that this issue was not raised by counsel and not referred to by the sentencing judge persuades me that it was overlooked. This would not matter very much, of course, were the submission of the Crown in this Court correct that, at all events, counts 2 and 3 were appropriately removed to the District Court because of the requirement to impose a more serious penalty than would have been otherwise available. 

38So far as the criminality of the offences were concerned, the Crown prosecutor submitted that count 3 was a fairly standard example of offences of this kind, a submission which I would accept. However, as he pointed out, the applicant was not in the result punished for this offence because the fixed term in respect of it was wholly subsumed in the sentence for the housebreaking. So far as the CAN offence is concerned, it is submitted that it ""was a serious example of offences of its kind, given the presence of people in the premises at the time of the breaking and entering"". Although certainly the applicant's theft from the safe after he had been seen by the person in the premises was brazen, I do not see how it adds significantly to the criminality either of the breaking and entering or the theft. It was no part of the prosecution case that the applicant knew or had reason to believe that persons were present. This is not only evident from the agreed facts on sentence but also, of course, that he was not charged with the aggravated form of the offence. Although the objective fact that persons were frightened by the criminal act of an accused is a material factor which renders it, to a greater or lesser degree, more objectively serious, in the circumstances here, it was to my mind of only minor significance. 

39In respect of the applicant's prior offences, the Crown points out that this offence was the applicant's thirty-third conviction for a burglary offence in addition to his numerous other convictions for offences involving dishonesty. 

40Were it not for the applicant's criminal record, it would in my view have been necessary, in respect of count 3 and the CAN offence, to give significant weight to the fact that they could have been dealt with in the Local Court. However, the need to impose a sentence which, though not involving any element of preventive detention, would protect the community from the applicant's continuing depredations meant that the jurisdictional limit in the Local Court was inadequate. Although the learned sentencing judge, with respect, erred in failing to consider the fact that count 3 and the CAN offence could have been dealt with in the Local Court, this did not prejudice the applicant. It follows that this ground of appeal must be dismissed. 

Ground of appeal 2 

41Neither the offence in count 1 and the CAN offence were serious examples of their kind. The count 1 offence, of course, attracted a standard non-parole period of five years for an offence in the middle of the range of objective circumstances. The only damage to the premises, if it can be so termed, was the removal of a fly screen. It is clear that , following the thwarted attempt to enter through the window from which the flyscreen was removed, the applicant made no further attempt to entirely enter the home and limited his actions to taking the victim's handbag by use of the garden stake. It may be, of course, that he did so because he was aware that someone was or might be at home and did not wish to raise a hue and cry but, whatever his motives, the way in which he committed this offence, the fact that the victim, although initially disturbed, did not know of his intrusion and the relatively small value of what was stolen, places it at or close to the bottom of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind. I do not suggest, with respect, that the applicant is entitled to any credit for the limited extent of his break-in but simply that this is an objective fact of substantial significance in assessing the objective criminality involved in the offence. 

42In respect of the CAN offence on 11 December 2008, as the sentencing judge observed, objectively this was a more serious offence than count 1, though the latter carried a much higher maximum sentence and also a standard non-parole period. The premises were commercial premises and the theft was, as I have mentioned, a brazen one. The applicant gained entry by opening the steel security door but it is not suggested that he caused any damage. Nor, it appears, did he search the premises for items to steal but confined his attentions to the safe. The amount stolen was $200, which is a relatively small sum. In my view this offence also was very much at the lower end of objective seriousness, bearing in mind particularly the range of serious indictable offences to which the maximum sentence of 14 years applies. The theft of the car added considerably to the property taken by the applicant from the victim and, to my mind, necessitated a significant degree of accumulation of the sentence. 

43With respect, I do not disagree with the observations in R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130 concerning the seriousness of the offences committed by the applicant. It suffices to say that the sentences that I propose in my view reflect that very view. 

44Subjectively, as I have already pointed out, the applicant had only recently completed a period on parole when he committed the offences in counts one and three. He was on bail when he committed the CAN offence and that on the Form 1. 

45A clinical psychologist's report, which was not controversial, was tendered on the sentencing proceedings. In brief, the applicant was some 32 years of age as at the date of these offences. He was born in Tasmania where he lived for most of his life. He gave a history of a traumatic childhood and of poly substance abuse from an early age, with what the psychologist describes as ""addiction/dependency and mental state impacts"". He did not complete his high school education and, although he worked in his teens as a labourer in the forestry industry, essentially he had not worked since he was 17 or 18 years of age because of substance abuse and the series of prison sentences. Test results did not indicate any development disability or global limitation in intelligence. So far as his drug use is concerned, he reported using cannabis from 11 years of age, sniffing petrol when he was 13 to 14 years of age and also using hallucinogenic mushrooms in adolescence, commencing amphetamine use when he was 16 or 17 years of age. There were some approaches to rehabilitation but these were ineffectual. At times his abuse of amphetamines and, latterly, cocaine produced episodes of drug induced psychosis with paranoid delusions and hallucinations with significant personality distortion. The psychologist described the applicant's history as ""suggestive of institutionalisation"", a scarcely surprising opinion. The applicant acknowledged that the best way he could effect a change in his conduct was to be taken to a residential rehabilitation program with a view to being provided with treatment and socialisation and a gradual return to the community. The psychologist opined that, if the applicant could not control his substance abuse and make a more effective return to the community than hitherto, his ""prognosis is very poor"". It seems to me that this conclusion is entirely justified. 

46Also tendered on the sentencing proceedings was a letter from the applicant in which he acknowledged his problem with drug abuse and accepted his need for the assistance of a rehabilitation program to enable him to avoid committing further offences in the community. 

47The sentencing judge found that the objective criminality of the count 1 offence was lower than the middle of the range of seriousness though, as I apprehend it, not at or near the bottom of the range. In respect of the CAN offence, his Honour accepted the submission of applicant's counsel that ""in objective gravity terms, [the] non-aggravated offence is probably more serious than the aggravated offence, involving as it did [the applicant] entering the premises completely and stealing from a safe there after he had been seen by people working on the premises"". However, these factors could not, in my respectful view, increase the seriousness of the criminality significantly above the bottom of the range, nor could they significantly affect the distinction implied by the much lower applicable maximum penalty. 

48Of course, reasonable minds might well differ on the seriousness of the criminality involved in an offence and the degree to which, where it is relevant, it departs from the middle of the range and an appellate court cannot substitute a merely different opinion: in the absence of error, the appeal must fail. The sentence imposed on the count 1 offence was four years imprisonment and the starting point for the CAN offence, taking into account the Form 1 offence, before discounting for the plea, was six years and eight months imprisonment. I have concluded, with respect, that although there is no patent error, both the sentences were manifestly excessive, such as to require intervention. Noting that the sentence for count three was entirely (though, in my view, wrongly) concurrent, I have nevertheless formed the opinion that, with respect, the overall sentence of six years and six months imprisonment was manifestly greater than the totality of the criminality involved in the offences. It follows that the applicant must be resentenced. 

Resentencing 

49The relevant objective and subjective matters have been sufficiently set out above. I am prepared to accept that the applicant's desire for rehabilitation is sincere and, in that sense, is evidence of contrition but it is impossible to avoid substantial scepticism as to whether he can make this intention good when he is eventually released into the community. Certainly, only a close and continuous supervision, such as that provided by a residential rehabilitation program, appears to have any chance of success in this regard. Whether he seeks entry into such a program will be a matter for him in due course. 

50An additional point is that, as the psychologist points out, it is questionable whether incarceration has much deterrent value at this stage as the applicant seems well able to cope with any sentence he receives, having been effectively institutionalised. In short, an increase in punishment for the purpose of personal deterrence beyond what would otherwise be appropriate would not seem to be useful. 

51The statutory ratio between sentence and parole period as provided in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 will need to be adjusted because of the accumulation of the sentences. A further adjustment is, in my view, appropriate because of the considerable difficulties that this applicant will have in carrying through his intentions for rehabilitation. 

52So far as the non-parole period is concerned, this case does not call for an examination of the statistics as to the rates of departure from the statutory calculus prescribed by s44 of the Sentencing (Criminal Procedure) Act 1999 in cases involving the present offences, but I would respectfully point out, a propos the observation in para [67] of the Court's judgment in Harris ( supra ) about the number of cases in which ""special circumstances"" are found, that the statistics do not provide a sound basis for criticism of the sentencing practices of the District Court in this respect. Such a matter is very much determined by the particular facts of each case, details which were not available to the Court. 

53The discount of 25% on the sentence for the CAN offence has been continued. 

Proposed orders 

54I propose the following orders - 

1. Leave to appeal is granted. 

2. The sentence on count 1 is quashed and in lieu thereof the appellant is sentenced to a non-parole period of one year and six months commencing on 1 December 2008 and expiring on 31 May 2010 with a balance of term of one year and six months. 

3. The sentence of a 12 months fixed term on count 3 is varied to commence on 1 December 2009. 

4. On the offence contained in the CAN, the sentence is quashed and in lieu thereof, taking into account the Form 1 offence, the appellant is sentenced to a non-parole period of nine months commencing on 1 December 2010 and ending on 31 August 2011 and a balance of term of two years commencing on 1 September 2011 and expiring on 31 August 2013. 

55The dates of the fixed one year term for count 3 were varied because of the variation to the sentence on count 1. 

56The effective sentence is therefore four years and nine months with a non-parole period of two years nine months.

		17 August 2011",2011-08-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2709344,New South Wales Crime Commission v Jason Lee [2011] NSWSC 854,"Judgment 

1GARLING J : On 13 May 2010, upon the application of the New South Wales Crime Commission, this Court made a restraining order under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 with respect to property identified in that Order, which was owned or controlled by Jason Lee. 

2On 9 December 2010, this Court made a further order which varied the original restraining order for the purpose of providing reasonable legal expenses for the appellants, Jason Lee and Seong Won Lee. 

3At the time the variation was made, the applicants gave an undertaking, the terms of which will be fully set out below. 

4The Crime Commission and the applicants are now in dispute as to proper meaning of that undertaking. 

5The dispute centres upon whether the reasonable legal expenses of the preparation for and hearing of submissions on sentence which are listed on 12 August 2011 in the District Court at Sydney before Solomon DCJ were or were not, covered by the order of the Court of 9 December 2010, and the undertakings which the defendants gave, at that time. 

6For the following reasons I am of the view that the reasonable legal expenses of the applicants which will be incurred for the sentence proceedings were included within the order made by the Court on 9 December 2010. I am also of the view that this application is precluded by the undertakings proffered by the applicants. 

The present proceedings in this Court 

7The applicants move on a Notice of Motion filed on 6 July 2011 for orders in these terms: 

""1. That the existing restraining order be varied to permit the payment of the reasonable legal expenses for the following matters: 

(i)Sentence proceedings of the First Defendant listed in the Sydney District Court before Solomon DCJ on 29 July 2011; 

(ii)Sentence proceedings of the Fourth Defendant listed in the Sydney District Court before Solomon DCJ on 12 August 2011; 

2. Costs; and 

3. Any other orders as the Court may see fit."" 

8The Notice of Motion was not accompanied by any affidavit evidence. 

9The parties informed the Court that they had reached agreement on all issues arising from the Notices of Motion, except for the question of whether the terms of the Order of 9 December 2010 precluded the applicants bringing the Notice of Motion, and precluded the relief sought. 

10The parties indicated that once the Court had expressed a view about the proper interpretation of the Order, they would bring in short minutes to reflect the appropriate final orders. 

11Accordingly, on that basis, I have proceeded to deal with the real issue in dispute namely, the proper interpretation of the Order of 9 December 2010 including the undertakings offered. 

12This approach by the parties is a practical demonstration of the application of s 56 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005, and the need for all litigants in proceedings in the Court to concentrate on the real issues in dispute. 

13Hence, the parties were content to proceed solely upon the basis of the Court interpreting the Order of 9 December 2010, and the undertaking. 

Order of 9 December 2010 

14It is necessary, so as to understand the dispute between the parties to set out the relevant parts of the Order of 9 December 2010, which are as follows: 

""The Court Orders: 

1. ... 

2. Pursuant to sections 10B(3)(b) and 12(1) of the Act, the restraining order made in relation to the interests in property of the first defendant on 13 May 2010 make provision for meeting the reasonable legal expenses of the first defendant and fourth defendant, agreed at $375,000 (plus GST) out of the interest in property of the first defendant in the property specified in the Schedule hereto, such sum to be paid to Nyman Gibson Stewart solicitors. 

The Court notes: 

3. The first defendant undertakes to the Court and the plaintiff not to make any further applications for reasonable legal expenses under either sections 10B(3)(b) or 12(1) of the Act or otherwise, with respect of the trial of drug charges presently scheduled to commence on 17 January 2011. 

4. ... 

5. The fourth defendant undertakes to the Court and the plaintiff not to make any further applications for reasonable legal expenses under either sections 10B(3)(b) or 12(1) of the Act, or otherwise, with respect of the trial of drug charges presently scheduled to commence on 17 January 2011. 

SCHEDULE 

1. The amount of approximately $298,000 held in the Nyman Gibson Stewart trust account on behalf of Jason Lee (also known as Do Young Lee). 

2. The amount of approximately $95,000 cash seized by police during the search of motor vehicle registration number BFT28G driven by Jason Lee (also known as Do Young Lee) on 25 February 2009."" 

15It can be seen that the terms of the order referred to provisions of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act . It will be of assistance to set out s 10B, which relevantly, is as follows: 

'"" 10B Contents and effect of restraining orders 

1. ... 

3. A restraining order may, at the time it is made or a later time, provide for meeting out of the property, or a specified part of the property, to which the order applies all or any of the following: 

(a)...; 

(b)subject to section 16A, the reasonable legal expenses of any person whose interests in property are subject to the restraining order, being expenses incurred in connection with the application for the restraining order or an application for a confiscation order, or incurred in defending a criminal charge."" 

16Section 16A provides for restrictions on any restraining order which makes provision for the payment of legal expenses. Section 16A(1) is in these terms: 

"" 16A Restrictions on payment of legal expenses from restrained property 

1. The following restrictions apply to a restraining order making provision for the payment of any legal expenses of a person: 

(a)no provision is to be made except to the extent (if any) that the Supreme Court is satisfied that the person cannot meet the expenses concerned out of the person's unrestrained property, 

(b)no provision is to be made in relation to any particular interest in property if the Supreme Court is satisfied that the interest is illegally acquired property, 

(c)no provision is to be made unless a Statement of Affairs disclosing all the person's interests in property and liabilities and verified on oath by the person has been filed in the Supreme Court, 

(d)no provision is to be made unless the Supreme Court is satisfied that the person has taken all reasonable steps to bring all of the person's interests in property within the jurisdiction of the Court, 

(e)any such provision must specify the particular interest in property out of which the expenses concerned may be met."" 

Factual context 

17The Commission and the applicants agreed on these relevant facts: 

(a)The trial before Solomon DCJ and a jury of the various drug and other charges against the applicants commenced on 24 January 2011; 

(b)On 16 March 2011 the jury returned verdicts of guilty for both of the applicants; 

(c)The applicants are to be sentenced by Solomon DCJ on 12 August 2011, when submissions will also be made. 

Applicants' submissions 

18The applicants, submit that the phrase "" with the respect of the trial of drug charges "" which appears in the undertakings in paragraphs 3 and 5 of the Order of 9 December 2010 ought be interpreted as being limited to the trial proceedings before the jury which concluded in March 2011, when the jury returned its verdict and not to include the further hearing before Solomon DCJ dealing with sentence. 

19It is then submitted that if the undertaking is so construed, there is no bar to the applicants making an application for further reasonable legal expenses. 

20The submissions call in aid a number of statutory uses of the word ""trial"" or the phrase ""sentence proceedings"". In particular the applicants rely upon: 

(a)The Criminal Procedure Act 1986 which differentiates in definitions between proceedings relating to a trial and proceedings relating to sentencing; 

(b)The Jury Act 1977 which defines a trial as meaning a trial by or with a jury; 

(c)The scheme for sentencing under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which the defendants submit demonstrate that their sentencing proceedings are not ordinarily part of the trial process. 

21As well, the applicants submit that the decision of the Court of Appeal in DPP (Cth) v Saxon (1992) 28 NSWLR 263 at 270 ff is authority for the proposition that the phrase "" defending a criminal charge "" encompasses sentencing proceedings, and so the applicants are within the statute but outside the undertakings because a different phrase - "" trial of drug charges "" is used. 

Position of the Crime Commission of New South Wales 

22The Crime Commission submits that the phrase "" the trial of drug charges "" includes the whole of the trial process, which it submits, includes any sentencing hearing. 

23It submits, in the alternative, that the phrase "" with respect of "" is a phrase of wide import and would be sufficient, if the phrase "" trial of drug charges "" does not include the sentencing process, to include it within the undertaking because the sentencing process is a necessary incident of the trial process. 

24As well, the Crime Commission calls attention to the whole of the undertaking and its terms and in particular the undertaking that the defendants would not "" ...make any further applications for reasonable legal expenses under either s 10B(3)(b) or 12(1) of the Act "". 

25The Crime Commission submits that the terms of s 10B(3)(b) namely "" incurred in defending a criminal charge "" includes that part of the defence of a criminal charge whereby an accused is sentenced by a judge after conviction by a jury (or a judge). 

Resolution 

26The Order of 9 December 2010 was not made after a contested hearing before the Court. Accordingly, there is no transcript or reasons for judgment that might assist in understanding what was intended by the parties when the words in the undertaking were used. 

27Neither of the parties has sought to put before the Court any evidence of antecedent negotiations between the parties which led up to the terms of the order which was made by the Court on 9 December 2010. 

28In other words, there is no extraneous material to which regard may be had to understand what the parties intended. 

29The Court is simply left with the task of construing the terms of the order in light of the statute that permitted the order to be made. 

30I note that it is not part of the present debate before the Court that either of the applicants seek to be released from their undertakings on any basis, including that circumstances had significantly changed since the undertaking was proffered or alternatively, that the interests of justice would be served by a partial release from their undertaking so as to fund the sentencing proceedings. On the contrary, the applicants assert an entitlement to make the application, because it stands outside the terms of their undertaking. 

31It is necessary therefore to construe the Order on the undertakings. 

32There is no reason to depart from settled principles about contractual and statutory interpretation. In my view, the principled approach requires that the words in the undertaking be given their ordinary meaning, having regard to the context in which they are to be found. 

33The commencing point for the context is the legislation. Section 10(3)(b) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act permits a restraining order to be varied so as to permit the payment of, relevantly: 

""...reasonable legal expenses of any person ...incurred in defending a criminal charge."" 

34The phrase "" incurred in defending a criminal charge "" is apt to include all steps, which may arise in the course of the defence of a criminal charge. Both parties agree with this interpretation. 

35It would, in my opinion, be straining the interpretation of that phrase, to exclude from it the sentencing of an offender once convicted. 

36If one was to interpret it in this way, then the statute would not provide any exception to a restraint order which permitted the funding of reasonable legal expenses from restrained property where those expenses were to be incurred for a sentence hearing. 

37Given the words that the statute uses, and the proper interpretation of ""... the phrase incurred in defending a criminal charge ..."", then the agreement to be found in the undertakings in Orders 3 and 5 has a context. That is because the applicants agreed not to make any further applications for reasonable legal expenses under the statute. 

38The ordinary interpretation of that phrase in the undertakings would without more indicate that no further application would be made for reasonable legal expenses "" incurred in defending a criminal charge "" which would include sentencing proceedings. 

39The next step is to consider whether the additional phrase in the undertaking namely, "" ...with respect to the trial of the drug charges presently scheduled to commence on 17 January 2011 "", compels any different meaning. 

40I do not think that it does. There are a number of reasons for this: 

(a)The phrase serves to identify the particular proceedings to which the undertaking relates, namely the proceedings due to commence on 17 January. This does no more than identify the proceedings. It does not qualify the nature of the undertaking; 

(b)The phrase "" with respect of the trial "" is ordinarily regarded as using words of wide import and ought not to be read down without a clear indication of some limitation; 

(c)Lastly, I do not think that in this context, a trial is any different from sentencing proceedings. In my view, it included all of the proceedings, the result of which would ordinarily be recorded on the indictment. This means all stays up to and including, the imposition of sentence by the presiding judge. 

41In all of these circumstances, it is my view that this application is precluded by the terms of the undertakings given by the applicants on 9 December 2010. 

42I make the following orders: 

(1)Order that the Notice of Motion dated 6 July 2011 be dismissed. 

(2)Order that the applicants pay the respondent's costs.

		11 August 2011",2011-08-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709347,RAAD v R [2011] NSWCCA 138,"Judgment  1McCLELLAN CJ at CL :  I agree with Buddin J.  2ADAMS J :  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on 20 August 2009 in this Court for offences of armed robbery and murder committed on 3 September 2001.  For the latter offence he was sentenced to a term of 14 years imprisonment commencing 7 February 2008 with a non-parole period of ten years and six months and, for the former, to a concurrent fixed term of five years imprisonment.  The applicant had pleaded guilty to both offences.  The applicant's commission of the offences was not suspected and only came to light when, on 7 February 2008, he voluntarily handed himself in to police and made a full confession.  This unusual factor rendered the sentencing exercise a most difficult one.  He seeks leave to appeal only from the sentence imposed for murder.  3The applicant's grounds of appeal are that the learned sentencing judge did not give sufficient weight to the evidence of the applicant's voluntary disclosure of guilt and erred in failing to find special circumstances (warranting adjustment of the ratio between the overall sentence and the parole period).  The offences  4Aside from the issue as to the applicant's intention, the basic facts were not in dispute at the sentence hearing and it is not submitted here that the learned sentencing judge's findings were mistaken.  The following account is taken from his Honour's reasons for sentence.  5At about 12.45 pm on 3 September 2001 Mr Rashid, a security guard, had collected cash and cheques totalling approximately $55,000 from a club in Punchbowl and had returned to his vehicle when he was approached by the applicant who was armed with a firearm.  The applicant told him that he was armed and to get out of the vehicle.  It appears that Mr Rashid disputed that the applicant was armed and a struggle ensued, in the course of which the applicant took the weapon from his belt.  He pulled Mr Rashid from the vehicle, the latter holding onto his hand or arm.  At this point, a number of bullets were fired which were later recovered from the vehicle.  The two men wrestled and at one stage it appeared that the applicant had Mr Rashid in a headlock.  Mr Rashid was shot twice during the   struggle.  (The sentencing judge briefly summarised evidence from witnesses to the struggle but it is not presently necessary to refer to this material.)  The autopsy revealed that Mr Rashid died from a gunshot wound to the left upper back, which his Honour found was consistent equally with a deliberate shot fired down the body whilst the deceased was in a headlock and with the gun having discharged during the course of a struggle while the deceased was in a similar position.  His Honour was not satisfied, however, that the applicant had deliberately done this.  The second gunshot wound that, of itself, may not have been fatal, entered the deceased's left lower back and, passing through the muscle, fractured the vertebrae.  Again, that wound was consistent both with being deliberately inflicted and as a result of the struggle.  There was also evidence of lacerations and bruising consistent with the struggle.  6After shooting the guard, the applicant took the money and escaped in the guard's car which was driven a short distance and abandoned.  He then used his own vehicle to go to his mother's house, which was nearby.  7The applicant had worn a wig.  None of the witnesses were able to identify him.  He had also been wearing gloves and left no fingerprints at the scene and no traceable DNA.  Consequently, the law enforcement authorities were unable to identify him as the perpetrator of the armed robbery and murder.  The applicant was not a suspect and was not questioned.  The applicant surrenders himself  8On 7 February 2008 the applicant, entirely voluntarily, went to the Green Valley Police Station and informed police that he had committed the murder and robbery, saying that he could not live with it any more.  The officers, who were unaware of the offences, made enquiries and discovered that, as the applicant had said, a robbery had been committed and the security guard shot.  He was arrested immediately and has been in custody since then.  9The sentencing judge found, as was not controversial, that the information concerning the offence came almost entirely from the applicant and that it was ""absolutely clear"" that but for his confession, he would never have been apprehended.  Evaluation of Objective Seriousness  10As the sentencing judge noted, the standard non-parole period does not apply.  11Dealing with the potentially aggravating features of the offence, the sentencing judge concluded that, although there was some planning involved, it related to the armed robbery and not the murder.  This planning comprised the use of a disguise, and obtaining and using a radio scanner to listen to the police radio network before, during and after the robbery.  His Honour noted that there was a deal of debate concerning the applicant's state of mind in relation to the shooting of the deceased.  The Crown contended that he intended to kill Mr Rashid or, at least, cause him grievous bodily harm, whilst it was contended for the applicant that this was a case of felony murder without any such intention.  His Honour was not satisfied that the applicant had the intention of killing the deceased or causing him grievous bodily harm, but noted (with respect, correctly) that this did not necessarily mean that the crime was not a relatively serious one within the category of murder offences.  12In respect of the seriousness of the crime, his Honour said -  ""16 The relative seriousness of any crime depends on its own facts and does not depend on some general categorisation.  While it is difficult to imagine a murder that involves the requisite intention being less serious than the least serious felony murder, this is not in the category of least serious felony murder.  Mr Raad intended to commit an armed robbery.  He did so with a loaded gun. He had loaded the gun shortly before the robbery and had his finger on the trigger when he pulled the gun out from his belt.  17 Even though I am not satisfied that he intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, he must have understood that committing an armed robbery with a loaded gun, having the safety catch off the weapon and having his finger on the trigger could foreseeably result in serious injury, if not death.  The seriousness of the offence, including the armed robbery, must be measured against the regime that existed at the time of the commission of the offence, namely, in 2001.""  13His Honour added it could not be disputed that the circumstances were not only dangerous to Mr Rashid but also to bystanders and constituted a threat to public safety.  14As I understand it, it is not submitted on the applicant's behalf by Ms Manuell SC in this Court that these findings were not open.  15The sentencing judge noted that the maximum sentence for an aggravated offence under s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (the aggravating feature being that the applicant was armed with a dangerous weapon) is twenty-five years and that for murder is life imprisonment.  Subjective Features  16It is obvious that the most significant subjective feature here is the unusual way in which the applicant's involvement in the offences came to light. The sentencing judge said in this regard -  ""21 No account of the history of Mr Raad can adequately describe the transformation that has occurred in him.  The person to be sentenced is a very different person to the one who committed the offences.  Nevertheless, and taking into account his subjective circumstances, Mr Raad must be sentenced to a term of imprisonment that reflects the seriousness of the offences with which he is charged and to which he has pleaded.  His history is a sorry one and unfortunately not an unusual one.  22 He had an early dysfunctional family environment, his parents having separated when he was 7 years' of age.  He came to Australia at the age of 10 and did not see his mother again until he was about 18 years' of age.  He did not have a good relationship with his stepmother and was not particularly close to his father.  This early environment, according to Mr Taylor, Clinical Forensic Psychologist, in his report of 3 April 2009, impacted on his social and emotional development.  From about the age of 13 years, he was having significant behavioural problems and ran away from home at the age of 15.  He lived on the streets with his friends and as a consequence engaged in substance abuse and criminal behaviour.  23 Mr Raad has a criminal history of some length, which reflects his street life and substance abuse.  His first offence was for stealing a motor vehicle, when he was approximately 15 years' of age.  Most of the offences with which he has been charged, and for which he has been convicted, have been property offences such as stealing, break, enter and steal, and the like, and drug offences including supply of hemp, possession and supply of heroin and related offences such as goods in custody.  Mr Raad continued over a 10-year period with these kinds of offences and received more and more serious punishment.  In 1985 he escaped from lawful custody and in 1988 and 1992 committed armed robberies.  These were the last offences before the offences for which he now stands to be sentenced.  The gap in offending between 1992 and 2001 related to various issues associated with his attempts to cease his drug abuse and with his custody.  24 He had tried, partly successfully, on a number of occasions to cease using drugs, but relapsed shortly before the date of the offence.  He has been in his current relationship for approximately 10 years and that relationship has provided some significant stability.  His relapse on drugs was the cause of this offence and the armed robbery was committed for the purpose of obtaining money to pay a bill from prior drug purchases.  The $55,000 (or as much of it as could be used) was spent on that drug bill and on the purchase of other drugs.  25 The effect of his relationship has been, both literally and figuratively, sobering.  His partner's devotion to him and her religion have had an enormous impact on his life.  He assists in rearing his stepchildren and has an extremely close relationship with them.  He cares deeply for his family and they care for him.  This was the subject of oral evidence, and obvious from the reaction of those of his stepchildren who attended during his sentencing hearing.  It was that relationship, both with his wife and her children, that brought about his stability and change in attitude.  Mr Taylor's report, and the evidence of Mr Raad was that Mr Raad got to the stage of his life when he couldn't handle his crime anymore.  Mr Raad, one day, looked at his own stepchildren and realised that the man he had killed had children too and would never see his children grow up.  It was this that led to Mr Raad's voluntary admissions.  His remorse is profound.""  17Summarising the effect of this evidence, his Honour said -  ""29 Mr Raad not only has prospects of rehabilitation, he has, it seems, wholly rehabilitated himself.  He has been clean from alcohol and drugs for a significant period of time and for almost all of the time since the commission of the offence in question. I have no doubt that, subject to the effect of prison itself, Mr Raad would not re-offend.  Even in relation to the incarceration and association with other offenders and association with criminal elements in prison, this would be more than matched by the positive effect of his family.  Indeed, one of the most troubling features of the sentence is the effect that prison, itself, will have on the rehabilitation of Mr Raad.  ......  31 Mr Raad was not a young offender.  At the time of the offences, he had just turned 41 years' of age and he is now about to turn 49.  In 1988, when Mr Raad was last before the courts for an armed robbery offence, Judge Herron sentenced Mr Raad to 8 years' imprisonment, with a 5-year non-parole period.  As earlier stated, Mr Raad is a very different person from that person who was before Judge Herron; his remorse is profound and his rehabilitation almost complete.  I would expect that he would not reoffend.""  18Dealing with the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation, his Honour accepted that he had wholly rehabilitated himself and had no doubt that ""subject to the effect of prison itself"" the applicant would not re-offend.  Even this effect, he thought, would be ""more than matched by the positive effect of his family"", though his Honour observed that ""one of the most troubling features of the sentence is the effect that prison itself will have on the rehabilitation"" of the applicant.  The Significance of Voluntary Disclosure  19The learned sentencing judge found that, in addition to the maximum discount for his plea of guilty, the applicant was entitled to a significant added element of leniency for his voluntary disclosure of involvement in serious crimes of which the police had no knowledge, citing the well known authority of R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603.  His Honour also cited the following passage from the judgment of McHugh J in Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; (2001) 206 CLR 267 -  ""[12] Thus, according to Ellis , the degree of leniency to be shown for the disclosure of unknown offences will vary according to (1) the likelihood that the offences would have been discovered by the authorities; and (2) the likelihood that the offences could have been proven beyond reasonable doubt in a court without the disclosure.""  The learned sentencing judge added -  ""20 Nevertheless, however significant the Ellis factors ought to be, the sentence imposed cannot fall below that which is appropriate for the seriousness of the crime. "" [Emphasis added.]  20It is important, in my respectful opinion, to bear in mind that (what might conveniently be called) an Ellis situation gives rise to two distinct matters that need to be taken into account.  First, it informs the assessment of remorse and contrition and reduces, potentially to insignificance, the requirement for personal deterrence.  It seems to me it also reduces the materiality of general deterrence, since it would be directed to that miniscule class of individuals minded to commit crimes and then admit to them.  At the same time, the notions of retribution and denunciation are undoubtedly still of considerable importance.  But they are only a part of the answer to the question; ""What does this particular offender deserve?""  and are necessarily affected, whether favourably or adversely to the offender, by the whole of the circumstances including - as is typical of the Ellis cases - the marked change in the character and personal attributes of the person being sentenced as distinct from the way that person was when the crime was committed.   This is no more than noting the incommensurable character of the factors forming the instinctive synthesis which is ultimately expressed in the sentence.  These considerations may be usefully termed the "" Ellis personal features"".  21A second very significant factor in Ellis cases is the policy of the law that offenders should be encouraged to come forward, a rather more objective and distinct matter than the personal attributes of the particular offender and his or her motivations.  Thus, in Ellis , Street CJ at 604 said -  ""When the conviction follows upon a plea of guilty, that itself is the result of a voluntary disclosure of guilt by the person concerned, a further element of leniency enters into the sentencing decision.  Where it was unlikely that guilt would be discovered and established were it not for the disclosure by the person coming forward for sentence, then a considerable element of leniency should properly be extended by the sentencing Judge. It is part of the policy of the criminal law to encourage a guilty person to come forward and disclose both the fact of an offence having been committed and confession of guilt of that offence.  The leniency that follows a confession of guilt in the form of a plea of guilty is a well recognised part of the body of principles that cover sentencing.  Although less well recognised, because less frequently encountered, the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency, the degree of which will vary according to the degree of likelihood of that guilt being discovered by the law enforcement authorities, as well as guilt being established against the person concerned."" [Emphasis added.]  This passage was cited with approval by McHugh J in Ryan .  22Accordingly, it is necessary to consider whether the sentence which is proposed to be passed would be likely to encourage a guilty person to come forward as distinct, of course, to deter him or her from doing so.  This matter may be termed the "" Ellis policy feature"".  With respect, I am unsure whether the significance of this feature is encompassed by the learned sentencing judge's statement of principle quoted above that ""the sentence imposed cannot fall below that which is appropriate for the seriousness of the crime"", language reflective of conventional considerations applying to sentencing, although including the Ellis factors as justifying a considerable degree of leniency.  23On the face of it, a confession of the kind made by the applicant is well within s23 of the Crimes (Criminal Procedure) Act 1999, sub-s(1) of which reads -  ""A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence.""  The ""offence concerned"" is the particular offence for which the offender is to be sentenced, a point made clear by para 23(2)(i).  The application of this provision was not brought to the sentencing judge's attention and his Honour did not refer to it.  This may be of little matter since the section appears to state the common law.  However, s23(3) makes it clear that the limitation on the extent to which the sentence might be reduced under this head is such that the sentence will ""not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence"" (emphasis added).  The assumption made by the Parliament is, therefore, that the resulting sentence will be ""disproportionate"" but requires that it be not ""unreasonably"" so.   24Clearly the assessment in any particular case whether the disproportion is unreasonable is a matter of judgment upon which reasonable minds may differ.  One of the matters that should be borne in mind, as I think, is that, since the expected sentence is lengthened as the seriousness of the crime increases, the graver the crime the greater the inducement to remain silent, so that the discount given to encourage confession must be all the greater in absolute terms.  This consideration, of course, is made in the context that, had the offender not come forward and confessed, he or she (in a case such as the present) would not be facing any punishment at all.  This is in marked contrast with the case where an offender decides to assist the authorities in respect of the criminal activities of another.  He or she is already facing punishment.  I do not underestimate the personal risks that some such informants can face.  However, someone in the applicant's position was facing sure and substantial punishment as against no punishment at all.  25Even though the offender in this situation is almost invariably motivated by very strong feelings of remorse, the likelihood of a heavy sentence will obviously operate as a considerable, probably decisive deterrent; if he or she is to be encouraged to come forward, it is self-evident that the sentence must be considerably lessened.  Perhaps this is to say little more than Street CJ said in Ellis about the need to extend ""considerable"" leniency in these cases.  I simply point out that, to be effective, this leniency might well need to be very considerable indeed.  It hardly needs to be added that the mere fact that in any particular case the offender is - at least at the time of confession - indifferent to the length of the sentence that might be meted out is irrelevant.  The policy is directed to those offenders who are minded to confess by their feelings of guilt, and might be encouraged to come forward by the considerable leniency they could expect.  For the reasons I explain below, I am of the respectful opinion that the leniency extended to the applicant was by a substantial margin less than the principle in Ellis required.  Other Ellis cases   26Before moving to a discussion of the way in which the sentencing judge calculated the sentences here, it is useful, as it seems to me, to look at previous cases of murder where Ellis considerations applied.  Not surprisingly, they are rare.  It is difficult to avoid the suspicion that the rarity is, at least in part, due to an apprehension that a resulting sentence is likely to be severe, even though probably much less severe than the conventional applicable sentence.  27In R v Bawden (unreported, NSWSC 30 October 1992) the offender walked into a police station and confessed to a murder committed 17 years previously for which the victim's husband had been wrongly convicted. It became clear that his confession was genuine and that it was motivated by his feelings of guilt about the killing.  The offender had only become aware of the husband's conviction a few days earlier.  Although there were some doubts at first about the genuineness of the confession, following an enquiry under s475 of the Crimes Act 1900 the husband was pardoned and the offender was charged and convicted on his plea of guilty.  The circumstances of the crime were particularly serious.  The applicant, then 22 years of age and under considerable personal stress, forced his way into the victim's home when she answered his knock at the door.  She was a stranger.  When she started to scream and a struggle started he took a shirt and wrapped it around her neck, tightening it as she continued to struggle.  When she stopped struggling he dragged her down the hall into the bedroom, by which time she was probably dead.  Although a sexual motive was suspected, the applicant denied this and claimed he had only intended to steal property from the house.  Matthews J accepted that this was so.  Her Honour found that the offence was ""quite out of character"" and noted that he had attempted suicide on three or four subsequent occasions.  Her Honour thought that these attempts, his transient life style, and difficulties with relationships were a product of his guilt about the killing and accepted that this had preyed on his mind from the beginning.  She found that it was his desire to put his life in order and the need to be punished for his crime that motivated him to hand himself into police and make his confession.  Although the motivation for the killing was baffling in light of the offender's character, Matthews J found that it was an isolated act of violence and there was no danger of his reoffending.  28Matthews J held that the lapse of time was not a mitigating feature since it arose from his own failure to come forward but commented that ""it is impossible to ignore the fact that that the prisoner ...is an entirely different man from the person who [committed the murder] almost twenty years ago.  Time and guilt have taken their toll upon him"".  Her Honour accepted that the confession was telling evidence of remorse.  There was no prospect of his guilt being suspected, let alone known.  Accordingly, her Honour held that ""he is deserving of substantial leniency ... [not only because] his action indicate[s] extreme contrition in a subjective sense but it is part of the policy of the criminal law to encourage guilty people to come forward and disclose their guilt ... [and the] only way that this can be done is by extending leniency to those who do so"".  29Commenting that ""I need hardly say that this case presents special circumstances which entitle me to vary the proportions [between the minimum and total terms] Matthews J imposed a sentence of fifteen years with a minimum term of eight years.  30In R v MHN [1998] NSWSC 533, the offender killed the deceased, in the course of a ""cowardly attack by four persons against [the victim]"".  His skull was fractured by kicks inflicted by the offender and unconscious or semi-conscious, he was taken to the premises occupied by one of the assailants, and, following an unsuccessful attempt to strangle him, his throat was cut by the offender, who was only 17 years of age at the time.  The body was taken away and left on a nearby building site.  The offender and his victim had known each other for some time and there was considerable (unexplained) ill-feeling between them.  31In R v McCabe (unreported, NSWCCA 14 October 1991) the offender's sentence following a plea of guilty to murder of twenty years imprisonment with a minimum term of fifteen years was reduced on appeal to sixteen years with a minimum term of nine years. The deceased, an elderly woman, died in her unit following the infliction of seven stab wounds.  Although the applicant was interviewed in the course of the police investigation as she had moved into an adjacent unit the day before the killing, her statement that she was absent from the building at the time was accepted by police and she was discounted as a suspect.  About two and a half years later the offender, accompanied by a solicitor, walked into a police station and said that she believed she might have been responsible for the killing.  The offender told police at first that she had been given entry into the unit and the victim had threatened her with a knife when she was stealing money from a wall unit.  She claimed the victim was fatally stabbed in the ensuing struggle.  She said that she was ""hanging out"" for drugs, though not intoxicated and discovered the victim was dead when she read of it in the newspaper a few days later.  She had no explanation for the seven stab wounds that were inflicted.  In due course, she was committed for trial.  Shortly after, the offender made a second statement to police, saying that she was heavily intoxicated on the night in question and had little memory of what happened.  She admitted taking the knife to the unit when she had gone there to return the victim's umbrella but had no idea why she had the knife with her.  Although she remembered stabbing the victim twice in the neck and throat, she could not recall why.  The offender then changed her plea to guilty of murder.  She did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings.  The sentencing judge's findings that the offender was not significantly intoxicated at the time of the crime but that she was suffering from a mental disorder occasioned by prolonged drug abuse associated with an appallingly sad personal background were accepted on appeal as were his Honour's findings that she had made very significant steps towards rehabilitation.  32Matthews J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Carruthers J agreed) observed that the sentence imposed at first instance was ""on any view of the matter... a lengthy term of imprisonment for murder"", pointing to the range of sentences for murder that had recently been passed, the highest of which was one of twenty four years with a minimum term of fifteen years for a murder described by her Honour as ""a much more serious matter"" both objectively and subjectively than the crime under appeal.  Her Honour said that other serious cases of murder which did not have ""substantial mitigating features"" resulted in sentences ""roughly similar"" to the appellant's, thus it fell ""within the upper range of sentences for murder over recent years"".  Although the objective circumstances were ""very serious indeed"" her Honour pointed to the appellant's strong subjective case, which included physical and sexual abuse as a child.  She was only nineteen years of age at the time of the crime, with a minor criminal history.  Matthews J concluded that the sentencing judge had given inadequate weight to the appellant's remorse, which had been somewhat diminished by the conflicting accounts of the offence, but compellingly demonstrated by her having come forward to confess when there was no prospect of being apprehended.  Her Honour added -  ""In my view, the fact that the applicant came forward and confessed to the killing two and a half years after the event should be given considerable weight upon sentence.  Not only did it provide graphic evidence of the applicant's remorse in a subjective sense, but there is also a policy consideration involved [citing Ellis ibid at 604, emphasis added].""  Her Honour considered that there was ""compelling evidence of special circumstances"" comprising the appellant's ""most difficult and unusual background ... leading to an altered mental state at the time of the killing ... her youth ... the fact that she gave herself up ... and ... the very strong evidence of her rehabilitation ..."" thus justifying the minimum term of nine years.  I would point out that the fact that all of these factors were relevant also in determining the total sentence did not prevent them from being again considered for the purpose of determining whether they also warranted a variation of the statutory ratio, a matter to which I return.  33In R v Baldacchino [1998] NSWSC 723 the offender murdered one Joseph Farrugia in August 1985.  After becoming a Jehovah's Witness in October 1995 and telling his wife and Elders of the congregation in April 1997 of his commission of the crime, he went to the police in May 1997 and made a full confession.  The objective circumstances were particularly serious.  His then girlfriend had been ordered as part of a property settlement to pay $20,000 to Joseph Farrugia, her ex-husband.  The couple unsuccessfully attempted to procure two persons to kill him and then, on her instigation, the offender planned to kill Farrugia himself by using a .22 rifle the barrel of which he shortened and machined to accept a silencer.  On the night of the crime, he had been drinking quite heavily and went to the victim's house, entering through a window forced open with a screwdriver, but the victim was not at home.  He left and returned about 30 minutes later.  Seeing the victim's car in the driveway, he reentered through the window, discovered the victim asleep in bed, put the rifle to his head and shot him.  He then disposed of the rifle and other items that may have been contaminated with blood.  The offender married his girlfriend the following year but the marriage was short and they separated after a couple of years, divorcing in 1996.  In about 1989 he turned to religion and became increasingly troubled in his conscience by Farrugia's murder.   The sentencing judge accepted that he had been suffering from severe depression at the time of the killing, which condition had continued to affect him episodically ever since, though improving somewhat with his religious conversion.  In addition to his own confession, the offender agreed to assist the authorities in the prosecution of charges against his ex-wife.  But for his confession there was no prospect that he would have been identified as the killer.  34The sentencing judge found that the offender's expressions of remorse and contrition were genuine and deeply felt and that, except for the killing of Farrugia, he was not a violent man.  35The sentencing judge categorised the murder as a ""cold-blooded assassination"" primarily to satisfy his girlfriend's greed, involving the invasion of the victim's home.  His Honour accepted that s442B of the Crimes Act 1900 concerning assistance to the authorities (now repealed and replaced by sec 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) applied to the case, noting that sub-s (2) prohibited a reduction to the sentence ""so that the sentence becomes unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence"".  The offender was sentenced to a minimum term of eight years with an additional term of eight years.  The special circumstances comprised ""the possible effect of such a lengthy sentence on the existing and expected rehabilitation, the estrangement from the prisoner's church where there appear to be no other family or friend support mechanisms operating and the likelihood that custodial circumstances would be harsher because of the assistance that the prisoner has rendered to authorities [together with] an extended period of supervision ... in both the prisoner's and the community interest"".  36In R v JSK [2004] NSWSC 470 the offender, not being a suspect, handed himself into police almost three years after he murdered the deceased and confessed his guilt.  At the date of the crime he was 16 years of age and his victim was 17.  About a week earlier, he and MH (just short of 18), who were members of a circle of friends that included the deceased, discussed killing him as he was becoming involved with MH's girlfriend.  The three youths drove to an area of bushland in MH's car.  MH struck the deceased with a piece of timber picked up from the ground, the offender hit and kicked him until he was unconscious and the two then dropped a large log several times onto his head until they believed he was dead.  He was buried in a shallow grave dug with a shovel brought for that purpose.  The offender took the deceased's wallet and mobile phone and hid them.  37Buddin J summarised the objective circumstances as follows -  ""[9] Whilst the offender must be given credit for his obvious candour in disclosing the details of the events that led to the death of the deceased, the fact remains that this was a cowardly and cold-blooded killing perpetrated upon a young man who would have had absolutely no reason to suspect that he was to be murdered by two of his friends. Moreover, the offence was committed in company and there was at least a degree of premeditation about it. Certainly by the time that MH arrived at the offender's place with the deceased in his car on the day of his death, the offender was well aware that MH intended carrying out his stated intention to kill the deceased and that he was expected to participate in MH's plan to do so.""  38Buddin J accepted expert evidence that the offender was somewhat more immature for his age than normal and was thus more vulnerable to the influence of MH than might otherwise have been the case.  His background was appalling, having been abused from an early age by his natural parents who were intellectually disabled.  Having been placed in foster care, he was eventually adopted when he was 12 and lost contact with his parents, which caused considerable distress.  He was genuinely remorseful and his coming forward was prompted by strong feelings of guilt.  Whilst in custody he had made substantial progress in his personal development.  An additional material factor was the offender's willingness to give evidence against MH.  He had no prior criminal convictions and was otherwise a person of good character.  He was most unlikely to reoffend.  When transferred ultimately to adult prison he would need to be placed in protection.  39The offender was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment with a non-parole period of seven years.  The special circumstances ""in particular"" comprised the fact that the offender had not previously been in gaol and that, upon release, he would require considerable supervision and assistance to facilitate his reintegration into the community.  40(For completeness I should mention R v Harris [2000] NSWSC 285 and R v Barker [2001] NSWSC 295, but these cases are for various reasons so different from the present as not to be of any real assistance.)  Calculation of the Sentence for Armed Robbery  41Dealing firstly with the armed robbery charge, the sentencing judge referred to the guideline in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 as relevant, noting that the seriousness of the offence escalates depending on the weapons used and how they are used and noting also that it was important not to double count the effect of the use of the firearm for the robbery and the murder of Mr Rashid.  His Honour noted, as earlier stated, that the robbery was planned, although not as planned as many, and was aggravated by the firing of the non-fatal shots.  His Honour mentioned the relevant discount for a plea of guilty and the significant added element of leniency on account of the Ellis factors.  His Honour also thought that the applicant's criminal history was more relevant to the armed robbery charge than to the murder charge.  He concluded -  ""The maximum sentence is imprisonment for 25 years, which is the main guidepost to the fixing of a sentence.  Further, generally heavy sentences are appropriate for persons who commit armed robbery in order to feed a drug habit, as was the case for Mr Raad: R v Ellis (1993) 68 A Crim R 449."" [Emphasis added.]  Although there was no appeal in respect of this sentence, I wish to deal with what, in my respectful opinion, are serious errors in the above statement, lest it be thought that by my silence I agreed with them.  42In my opinion, the maximum sentence in respect of any offence cannot be the "" main guidepost for the fixing of a sentence"" unless the offence either falls within the class of most serious cases for the commission of the offence or is close to it.  In R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 this Court said (omitting references) -  ""[51] The statutory maximum penalty has been regarded as an expression of the policy of the legislature in providing for the offence ... or as a reflection of the seriousness of that offence as perceived by the public ... It has been reserved for the ""worst type of case falling within the relevant prohibition"" ... although the adoption of that phrase is not an occasion for the imposition of a lesser sentence if it is possible to envisage a worse case ...  [52] Traditionally any intention on the part of the legislature that the offence should attract a heavier sentence has been manifested by an increase in the statutory maximum ... The courts are expected to recognise and reflect that intention when sentencing offenders for offences after such amendments are made ...  [53] There is nothing in Division 1A [of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, providing for standard non-parole periods] to suggest that the statutory maximum ceases to provide a benchmark, or a reference point, in sentencing, so far as it is a manifestation of legislative intention as to the seriousness of the offence. The focus is, however, likely to shift more towards the standard non-parole periods where they apply, since they may be taken to express a legislative intention as to the minimum periods of actual imprisonment, which are appropriate for the relevant offences.""  43In Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 the significance of the maximum sentence was explained by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ in the following terms -  ""[31] It follows that careful attention to maximum penalties will almost always be required, first because the legislature has legislated for them; secondly, because they invite comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the court at the time; and thirdly, because in that regard they do provide, taken and balanced with all of the other relevant factors , a yardstick. [Emphasis added.] That having been said, in our opinion, it will rarely be, and was not appropriate for Hulme J here to look first to a maximum penalty ...and to proceed by making a proportional deduction from it. That was to use a prescribed maximum erroneously, as neither a yardstick, nor as a basis for comparison of this case with the worst possible case. That he used the maximum penalty impermissibly appears from his Honour's particular deference to it in this passage:  ""Parliament cannot have intended that, other things being equal, the penalty for supplying more than 250 g should be less than for supplying that quantity.""  The form of the statement is explained by the fact that his Honour did not start with the maximum penalty for an offence involving the quantity in question, but used another maximum penalty as his starting point, that is, the maximum for an offence in the category of seriousness immediately below that of the principal offence.""  44I discussed this issue in Gore and Hunter v R [2010] NSWCCA 330 as follows (quoted not because it is authoritative but simply because there is no point in attempting to rephrase it) -  [37] [After setting out the above passage from Markarian.]  It is vital, as it seems to me, to give full weight to the italicised phrase to avoid the tendency to give the maximum term too much, even determinative, significance.  In referring to the rarity of appropriately starting with the maximum, their Honours were not only referring to the order of reasoning but also the mode of applying it as a ""yardstick"".  Of course, as a matter of logic, the problem of according the maximum penalty any primacy of significance over the other relevant factors to be taken into account is accentuated by the difficulties involved in comparing a case that is not in the worst category with (a necessarily hypothetical) one that is, and then attempting to make some adjustment - which must be itself highly impressionistic (or instinctive) - to apply the comparison in any useful way.  [38] Accepting the maximum sentence as reflecting the Parliament's view of an appropriate sentence for a worst category case - this being in fact a necessary construction having as its basis constitutional theory rather than any actual historical reality - it does not follow at all that any inference can be drawn about the intention of Parliament as to what kind of case would fall into the category which should attract a sentence, say, halfway between zero and the maximum or a third or a quarter of the way and so on - which points to the inherent illogicality of the opposite approach.  (I pass over the not insubstantial problem of what is meant by zero in this calculus and what would be a case falling into the least serious category.)  Putting this in another way, it cannot be right to reason that, by virtue of the maximum sentence, any sentence in a case of significantly less culpability can be calculated, even broadly, by reference to the maximum.  This is to give illusory measurement to essentially incommensurable factors.  Thus, it simply cannot meaningfully be said of any given set of circumstances, that, for example, they are half (or nearly half or broadly half) as serious as a case in the worst category.  By parity of reasoning (with unfeigned respect for those who take the other view) it cannot be right to either criticise or approve a sentence by reference to the proportion it bears to the maximum.  All one can say is that the culpability in the former falls short by an indeterminate (but, say, major or minor) degree from that which would bring the case into the worst class.  The greater the degree by which the instant case falls short of the worst category, so also must the sentence be short of the maximum but, since no comparison can give rise to an arithmetical proportion - or a range of proportions - in virtually every case the maximum can provide no more than a very broad perspective.  [39] The very fact that the worst category case must, of necessity, be a hypothetical construction is also a substantial (indeed, to my mind insurmountable) difficulty in the way of using it comparatively for the purpose of any kind of calculation.""  45Taking up the sentencing judge's assessment of the significance of the applicant's drug habit in respect of the seriousness of the armed robbery, the judgment his Honour referred to ( Ellis v R (1993) 68 A Crim R 449 - not the confessional Ellis ) is not, with respect, authority for characterising the offender's drug habit as an aggravating feature or requiring a heavier sentence than would otherwise be the case.  The true significance of an offender's addiction was discussed in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346: per Spigelman CJ at [171 ff] and per Wood CJ at CL at [215 ff], the latter citing what Hunt J said in Ellis as a refusal to consider drug addiction as a mitigating factor.  Both their Honours make clear, however, that the need to support a heroin habit may provide an explanation for the offence and support the finding of other connected mitigating features.  Calculation of the sentence for murder  46The approach of the sentencing judge to the sentencing of the applicant for the murder of Mr Rashid was expressed as follows -  ""[32] ...  Most of this offence I have already discussed or are covered in the subjective matters that I have dealt with in relation to the armed robbery.  I bear in mind that the sentence must be imposed under the regime that existed prior to the institution of a standard non-parole period and in accordance with the range of sentences that would have applied at the time of the offence.  The statistics, from the Judicial Commission of New South Wales, provided by counsel, are of some assistance, but not overly helpful.  The statistics provided disclose the term of the sentence, ie the head sentence, imposed for murder in circumstances where there was no standard non-parole period that applied.  It shows that the top third of the sentences imposed were for 22 years and above.  Of course these statistics take into account sentences imposed on persons who had pleaded guilty and were the subject of significant discount.  Nevertheless, to the extent that they disclose a range of sentences, it is appropriate that the commencement point for the sentence to be imposed for this murder ought be at the bottom of the top-third of that range, namely, 22 years.  That is the commencement point suggested by the Crown and, in this case, I accept that it is an appropriate point.  [33] As already stated, I apply the highest level of discount for the plea of guilty and a significant discount for the factors associated with the voluntary disclosure and those factors associated therewith.  But I fix a sentence, which I consider to be appropriate in all the circumstances.  [34] I do not find special circumstances.  The sentence that I will impose will have a sufficient non-parole period to allow for his supervision and to ensure that he returns to a life without crime, without drugs and alcohol, and with the kind of stability that has earned him a leniency that, for such a serious offence, would not otherwise be given.""  47It is my respectful opinion that the sentencing judge's use of the JIRS statistics constituted a significant error.  There is no explanation, either in point of principle or assessment of relative seriousness, for selecting the ""bottom of the top third"" of the sentences passed for all murders as representing the appropriate starting point for this particular case.  Accepting that one can, in a broad sense, compare the seriousness of this case with other cases of murder, the range of objective and subjective facts varies so greatly as to prevent any classification on the basis of a proportion of the sentences passed for all cases, especially because the various types of murder differ in their elements and there is no basis for thinking that any of the sentences in the top third are for felony murder.  If one were to make a general statement of relative seriousness (omitting subjective features) to my mind, other things being equal, the killing of a person intending to do so involves a higher degree of moral turpitude than killing without such an intention, whilst killing where there is no intention either of inflicting death or serious injury involves still less moral turpitude.  Broadly speaking, felony murder falls into this class.  Of course, other things are usually not equal at all, so at this level of abstraction such a generality is only slightly, if at all, informative.  Yet this is the level of abstraction that corresponds with the opacity of the statistics utilised by the sentencing judge.  In principle, it cannot provide an appropriate determinative measure of the starting point for a particular sentence, a fortiori when the subjective features are included in the arithmetical result.  It will have been noted that there were significant subjective factors other than the Ellis personal features that were relevant to the applicant's sentence.  Their significance could not be taken into account by mere reference to the statistics.  Putting the argument in another and perhaps simpler way, assume that all the objective and subjective features of the cases in the sample were known; what happened here would have entailed regarding all those circumstances as irrelevant.  In principle, this cannot be right.  Another difficulty is that the sample comprised 143 sentences imposed between July 2001 to June 2008, of which 13 were life sentences, a little over 25% of the sentences in the top third.  Apart from skewing the class upwards, life sentences are indeterminate, and so cannot yield any number for calculating the ""bottom of the top third"".   48In Hili v The Queen ; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45, especially at [48]-[49], the High Court criticised the use of the Judicial Commission's statistics for the purpose of considering the appropriateness of the sentence under consideration in that case.  Dealing with the question of consistency, the Court said -  ""[48] Consistency is not demonstrated by, and does not require, numerical equivalence.  Presentation of the sentences that have been passed on federal offenders in numerical tables, bar charts or graphs is not useful to a sentencing judge.  It is not useful because referring only to the lengths of sentences passed says nothing about why sentences were fixed as they were.  Presentation in any of these forms suggests, wrongly, that the task of a sentencing judge is to interpolate the result of the instant case on a graph that depicts the available outcomes.  But not only is the number of federal offenders sentenced each year very small, the offences for which they are sentenced, the circumstances attending their offending, and their personal circumstances are so varied that it is not possible to make any useful statistical analysis or graphical depiction of the results.  The Court cited with approval what was said by the plurality in Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 606 [59] -  ""... recording what sentences have been imposed in other cases is useful if, but only if, it is accompanied by an articulation of what are to be seen as the unifying principles which those disparate sentences may reveal.  The production of bare statistics about sentences that have been passed tells the judge who is about to pass sentence on an offender very little that is useful if the sentencing judge is not also told why those sentences were fixed as they were.""  [My emphasis.]  49Accepting that past sentences may illustrate the range which can be ""of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and appellate courts"" ( Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De la Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 per Simpson J at [303]) and ""can and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence"" (ibid at [304]), even then they cannot be used arithmetically to determine a sentence or a key element in the sentencing calculation such as the starting point here.  Depending on the size of the sample and the judicial experience of cases within it, the statistics might well provide a useful checkpoint or warning signal but cannot be anything more than suggestive.  50Here, the sentencing judge used the statistics to determine what his Honour described as the ""commencement point for the sentence to be imposed"".  Although it may be, as was conceded by counsel for the applicant in this Court, that 22 years was, as it happened, not outside the available discretionary range (and even assuming, though his Honour does not say so, that this consideration confirmed the result of the arithmetic), to give to this term the significance of a starting point was, to my mind and with every respect to the sentencing judge, fundamentally wrong.  And the mere fact that it might happen to be within an appropriate discretionary range does not make this error any less significant, since it was the reason given by his Honour for selecting the figure of 22 years.  Had his Honour not made this error, he might well have selected a significantly lower figure as the starting point.  51To my mind, the sentencing judge erred in another significant respect.  His Honour identified the ""highest level of discount for the plea of guilty"" (25%) as applicable and added ""a significant discount for the factors associated with the voluntary disclosure and those factors associated therewith"".  Quite what his Honour meant by this phrase is uncertain but it seems to be that the approach taken was to isolate all the features connected with the voluntary disclosure (both personal and policy) and apply them to reducing the commencement point of 22 years together with the discount for the plea of guilty.  Identifying the policy reduction is understandable, indeed, necessary when giving a discount for a plea or assistance, since it must apply to the sentence which would otherwise be imposed.  It is utilitarian in function and does not depend on the personal characteristics or subjective features of the offender.  It is wrong in principle, however, to start with a number reflecting the objective factors and then reduce it by reference to subjective factors that should form part of the objective/subjective synthesis.  There is much to be said for adopting in Ellis cases the approach used for pleas of guilty and in the other assistance cases, namely to specify the utilitarian discount given, not only in the interests of transparency, but to further the policy objective of the discount.  As demonstrated by the examples mentioned above, this approach has not yet been adopted and, though in my view desirable, is not essential.  This is not, however, what the sentencing judge did, since his Honour decided on the starting number absent the policy and personal Ellis features and the applicant's other subjective matters.   52Let me now move to the calculation undertaken by the sentencing judge.  Applying a utilitarian discount of 25% for the plea of guilty to the commencement point of 22 years yields 16 years and six months.  The ultimate head sentence of fourteen years accordingly reflected an allowance of two years and six months (or just over 15%) for what his Honour called ""the factors associated with voluntary disclosure"".  With all respect, this reduction could not be said to provide any real encouragement to other persons in the applicant's position to come forward to confess their guilt of the crime of murder.  To the contrary, I believe it can only be characterised as likely to deter any offender who might be minded to do so.  53No special circumstances were found that justified any adjustment of the statutory ratio of parole period to total sentence.  If the applicant had been sentenced to a head sentence of 16 years and six months, the ""default"" non-parole period would have been slightly over 12 years and four months.  The applicant's non-parole period of ten years and six months thus represented a deduction for the Ellis features of only one year and eight months.  This emphasises the above conclusion, namely that the sentence imposed, so far from encouraging a person in the applicant's position to come forward, would powerfully deter him or her from doing so.  54Putting this in another way, Kirby J said in Ryan -  [91] [Referring to the language of Street CJ in Ellis , and McHugh J in AB v The Queen , the] ... words ""significant"" and ""considerable"" are adjectives of degree.  Prima facie a large deduction in sentence is appropriate in such a case.  Otherwise, the judges concerned, when they expressed the applicable rule, could have used lesser adjectives, such as ""modest"" or ""minimal"" or perhaps the ever enigmatic ""appropriate""...  In my opinion, the applicant was not accorded a ""significant"", ""considerable"" or ""large"" deduction but, rather a ""modest"" or ""minimal"" one.  55I therefore respectfully conclude that the sentence was affected by significant errors of law and was also manifestly excessive.  Special circumstances  56When dealing with the question of special circumstances, the sentencing judge referred only to the issues of future supervision and continuing rehabilitation.  It is not clear whether he formed the view that the Ellis factors were not capable of being special circumstances within the meaning of s 44(3) the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act 1999 or that, being special circumstances, they did not justify adjustment of the parole period or, perhaps, that they were already accounted for in setting the head sentence and it would amount to double counting if they were utilised to adjust the non-parole period.  Since the applicant must be resentenced ( Douar v The Queen (2005) 159 A Crim R 154; Baxter v The Queen (2007) 173 A Crim R 284), it is not necessary to deal with the contention of counsel for the applicant that the sentencing judge erred in disregarding the Ellis features in his assessment of special circumstances.  57For the reasons set out below, I am of the view that Ellis considerations are special circumstances capable of justifying a variation in the s 44 ratio and do so in this case.  Apart from more direct reasons, it is clear from the cases cited above that this Court has habitually taken this approach.  Resentence  58In considering this question, I have taken account of the sentences passed in the cases discussed above.  It is unnecessary, indeed inappropriate, to make a detailed comparison of those cases with each other and the present case.  They exhibit, however, a broad consistency of outcome which is informative.  Whilst the subjective features of some of the offenders were somewhat more mitigating than those of the applicant, it seems to me that the objective nature of the murders they committed were, on the whole, markedly more serious than that committed by the applicant.  The most obvious more serious elements were the intention to kill (except in one case) and the premeditation in every case.  59It is appropriate to accept the sentencing judge's factual findings and assessment of the relevant objective features of the crime and subjective features of the applicant.  This was objectively a serious case of felony murder, in which the applicant killed the deceased by intentionally firing a loaded firearm brought to the scene to effect the armed robbery of the deceased.  He did not intend to cause death or grievous bodily harm but must have realized that, with the safety catch off and his finger on the trigger, serious injury if not death was a reasonable possibility.  Subjectively, the applicant was aged 40 years at the time, with an appalling criminal record including offences of armed robbery.  His early life was tragically dysfunctional and he lived on the streets from the age of fifteen, where he started abusing drugs and became a drug addict.  He had periodically managed to stop using but had lapsed shortly before the offence.  He voluntarily confessed to his crime, motivated by powerful feelings of remorse, and was for all practical purposes completely rehabilitated.  His strong continuing family support was the major factor in the applicant's rehabilitation and will remain of vital importance.  As the sentencing judge opined, subject to the effects of gaol itself, reoffending is most unlikely.  60The applicant's affidavit discloses that he has made as much good use of his time in gaol as is possible, undertaking various education courses and working as a machinist.  He says that the other inmates ""don't talk to me much"" because he gave himself in but says ""I can handle that"".  He says that he has no friends but this does not worry him.  He is very concerned about the difficulty his wife has in visiting him given the location of the gaol where he is presently being held and hopes to move closer to Sydney.  There is no indication of when this might occur, if ever.  Whilst his isolation from other prisoners does not, at the present, worry the applicant, this is a significant hardship as it seems to me, when prolonged and is exacerbated by the inability of his family to visit him.  To my mind, since his family's support was the major factor in the applicant's reformation, his isolation from them is an important factor to be taken into account on sentence.  The sentencing judge mentioned the importance of his family connexion in counterbalancing to some extent what must be accepted as the deleterious effects of long-term imprisonment.  61Applying a deduction of 25% for the applicant's plea of guilty and an additional discount for the Ellis factors, including the policy objective of encouraging offender's such as the applicant to come forward, I would impose a head sentence of twelve years.   In my opinion this sentence, although significantly less that that which would be appropriate in light of the facts and circumstances of the offence, is not unreasonably disproportionate having regard to the policy considerations to which I have already referred.  62I now turn to the non-parole period.  63At least three matters comprise, on the face of it, special circumstances justifying a variation of the statutory ratio between the balance of the term and the non-parole period.  These are the need to ensure that the minimum sentence to be served encourages persons who have committed murder to come forward, the social isolation of the applicant in gaol which not only renders his imprisonment more harsh than otherwise but can have a seriously deleterious affect over the long term, and his separation from his family, who have been the principal contributors to his rehabilitation which it is in the public interest to maintain and encourage.  64The application of s44 of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act 1999 was considered by a five judge bench of this Court in R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704.  After citing a number of decisions to the effect ""that the purpose of a non-parole period was not to fix the minimum sentence to be served, so as to ensure that an offender did in fact suffer at least that degree of actual punishment ... [but to] give primary weight to the rehabilitative purposes of parole, Spigelman CJ (with whom the other judges agreed, Sully J adding some further remarks) pointed out that this approach was held to be wrong in Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623 and added -  ""[57] The reasoning in Power indicates that it is not appropriate to determine the non-parole period primarily from the perspective of the length of the period of supervision on parole.  Indeed, the primary perspective should be the length of the minimum period of actual incarceration.  By enacting a provision that only works one way - requiring specific justification for a lower proportion but not for a higher proportion - Parliament has, in my opinion, reinforced this as the primary perspective.  This has the effect that the scope of the considerations relevant to the determination of ""special circumstances"" must encompass the full range of issues which are relevant to the determination of the minimum period of actual incarceration without hope of release on parole.  [58] The length of the non-parole period remains, however, of potential significance.  Indeed, the requirements of rehabilitation would be best computed in terms of a period of linear time, not in terms of a fixed percentage of a head sentence.  The desirability of a longer than computed period of supervision will be an appropriate approach in many cases.  It is not, however, the only perspective.""  65Having noted that ""there is the ultimate constraint that the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence"" [63] his Honour went on to say -  ""[65] In addition to the need to identify and articulate ""special circumstances"", in order to overcome the statutory constraint on the exercise of the discretion to fix a non-parole period, the need to ensure that the time an offender must spend in prison reflects all of the circumstances of the offence and the offender - including the objective gravity of the offence and the need for general deterrence - operates to confine the proper range for the exercise of the discretion.  ...  ...  [67] Where a circumstance is taken into account by way of reduction of the head sentence, the application of the statutory proportion will have the result that the circumstance also reduces the non-parole period.  Before a sentencing judge further reduces the non-parole period by reason of that circumstance, he or she must undertake a process of analysis which travels beyond that which has been undertaken in the course of determining the head sentence.""  66I interpolate the observation that there is a logical tension created by requiring on the one hand that the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence and applying the very same test to the head sentence, it being a given, by virtue of s 44(3) that, in the absence of special circumstances, the non-parole period will be 75% of the head sentence.  This tension is all the greater when it is appreciated that release at the end of the non-parole period in respect of a sentence of longer than three years is not at all automatic.  The distinction must therefore lie in the fact that the non-parole period represents the time which must be spent in prison whilst the head sentence represents a period of which, absent special circumstances, 25% may be served at large if the prerequisites of the grant of parole are, in the opinion of the Parole Board, satisfied, that liberty itself being conditional upon complying with the conditions of parole.  So considered, it does not seem to me to be double counting to have regard to a particular circumstance which operates to reduce a head sentence, necessarily in an unspecified way (unless quantified for assistance) and also treat it as a special circumstance which additionally justifies the downward variation of the non-parole period from that which would result from the statutory ratio. Here the circumstances in which the offender's guilt came to light are certainly exceptional by any standard and, to my mind, clearly constitutes a ""special circumstance"".  In accordance with the principle enunciated in Ellis , of course its presence has the result of significantly reducing the head sentence.  In my view, the policy of extending such leniency in order to encourage others in the position of the applicant to come forward can also affect in a marked way the actual minimum term which must be served in prison to give effect to that policy, recognizing, however, that the ultimate minimum term must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the facts and circumstances of the offence.  67In setting the head sentence, I have made some allowance for the applicant's situation in gaol as representing increased harshness but not in respect of the potential effect of the long term continuation of that situation on his rehabilitation.  I did not take into account the effect of separation from his family.  Of course, it is scarcely a ""special circumstance"" for a prisoner to be separated from his or her family and for visits to be difficult if not impossible because of the location of the gaol.  However, in this case, the applicant's remarkable rehabilitation which led him to confess to a very serious crime, at the inevitable risk of going to prison for a long period, was so much the extraordinary product of his relationship with his family that its inevitable attenuation by imprisonment should be reduced as much as possible consistent with avoiding an unreasonably disproportionate sentence.  68Taking these considerations together, I am of the view that the non-parole period should be six years.  69I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of Buddin J with whom McClellan CJ at CL agrees and appreciate that their Honours do not agree with my view about the presence in this case of special circumstances justifying a variation and the minimum sentence that is consistent with the requirement of s23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  I regret that, after anxious consideration, I am unable to agree with their Honours' proposed non-parole period.  It is not necessary that I should say more than is stated above as to my reasons for the conclusion to which I have come.  However, I wish to emphasise the decisive importance of the perspective with which I have approached the issue of unreasonable disproportion.  That is, the need to give full weight to the simple but fundamental fact that, when he volunteered his guilt to the police, the applicant was facing no sentence of any kind whatever.  The sentence now being imposed is thus, practically speaking, counting up from zero.  This is radically different from a case in which assistance is given to the authorities by an offender whose guilt can be or is proven.  In that case, the sentence is produced by counting down from the term that would otherwise have been imposed.  It follows that, in the present case, the sentences in other cases of murder provide, in principle, far less guidance than in what I might call the ""counting down"" cases, though they remain relevant as features of the instinctive synthesis which is ultimately determinative.  70In respect of the public policy objective of encouraging persons in the position of the applicant to come forward, it is material to ask how likely would it have been that the applicant or - more correctly - someone in his position would come forward had he been told that the consequence would be a sentence having a minimum term to serve of nine years.  With respect, it seems to me that such advice would almost certainly - at least, very probably - lead to a change of mind.  The policy would thus be reduced to practical irrelevance.  71I acknowledge, of course, the central importance of the fact that the applicant, by his intentional act, caused the death of another human being.  It is the tension between the significance of his coming forward on the one hand and the objective reality of the offence on the other that makes this case so difficult to resolve.  Proposed orders  72I propose the following orders -  (i)  grant leave to appeal against the sentence;  (ii)  allow the appeal and quash the sentence imposed at first instance;  (iii) substitute a sentence comprising a non-parole period of six years commencing on 7 February 2008 and ending on 6 February 2014 and a balance of term of six years commencing on 7 February 2014 and ending on 6 February 2020.  73BUDDIN J: I have had the considerable advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Adams J.  I share his Honour's view that this court should intervene and proceed to re-sentence the applicant.  I also agree with his Honour that the total term of imprisonment should be one of 12 years.  In my view, however, the non-parole period should be one of 9 years.  74At the outset of the sentencing remarks, the primary judge observed that:  [t]he purpose in sentencing any offender, even those charged with murder, seeks to resolve what are often, if not necessarily, conflicting goals.  In serious crimes such as murder, the importance of punishment and public deterrence loom large. ... There is no single correct sentence, and the often-complicated interplay of considerations point in different directions.  75Those remarks were particularly apposite to the present case, given its highly unusual features.  Notwithstanding the primary judge's conclusion that the applicant did not intend to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the victim, this was nonetheless an objectively serious example of the offence of murder.  Moreover, as Adams J has pointed out, the applicant had a lengthy criminal record which included two prior convictions for armed robbery.  The evidence revealed that the applicant's life, until the commission of these offences, had been driven by his addiction to illicit drugs.  On the other hand, as the primary judge observed, the man who stood for sentence ""was a very different person"".  His Honour concluded that ""no account of [his] history...can adequately describe the transformation that has occurred in him [and that he had] wholly rehabilitated himself"".  A significant feature of his ""transformation"" was his disclosure of his guilt of these offences to the authorities in circumstances in which he would not have otherwise been charged.  The significance of his having done so cannot be underestimated.  Apart from any other consideration, his actions have clearly assisted the family and friends of the victim in that they now know the circumstances in which the victim met his untimely death.  76Adams J has analysed in considerable detail the primary judge's reasons for arriving at a ""starting-point"" of 22 years imprisonment.  For present purposes, it is unnecessary for me to engage in a similar analysis.  First of all, as Adams J notes, senior counsel for the applicant disavowed, both in written submissions and during the course of oral argument, any contention that such a ""starting point"" was not open to his Honour.  More importantly I accept, in any event, the central argument advanced on the applicant's behalf to the effect that the extent of the discount allowed for the ""Ellis factor"" was inadequate.  Adams J has demonstrated why that submission should be accepted.  77It is necessary to now consider something else to which the primary judge referred during the course of the sentencing remarks.  His Honour said:  Because the offence occurred in 2001, [the applicant] is required to be sentenced in accordance with the law, as it then existed, and there is no standard non-parole period for the offence.  The introduction of a standard non-parole period for the crime of murder had a significant effect in increasing the range of sentences generally imposed for the crime of murder and it is necessary to bear in mind the range of sentences that  were imposed at the time that the conduct occurred, rather than at present.  78I respectfully agree with those observations.  The real challenge for the primary judge lay in determining the ""range of sentences"" in 2001 for a case of the kind presently under consideration.  In that respect the raw statistics, as Adams J has pointed out, would not have provided very much assistance.  On the other hand, this Court has been furnished with a number of cases in which a person has voluntarily disclosed his or her guilt of a homicide that would not otherwise have come to light.  Regrettably, the primary judge was not provided with the same level of assistance.  79As Adams J has comprehensively examined those cases in some detail, I am relieved from the need to embark upon a similar exercise.  As Adams J demonstrates, the researches of counsel have revealed that it is only in very rare instances that an offender has assisted the authorities in the fashion in which the applicant has done.  To the list of such cases may be added a further decision to which I referred in R v JSK [2004] NSWSC 470.  I there said that:  [I]t is common ground that the only decisions which provide any real guidance, given the highly unusual circumstances of the present case, are the decisions of Hidden J in R v TNT [2002] NSWSC 537 and of Sully J in relation to the same offender [2002] NSWSC 394. Although I must of course exercise my own independent sentencing discretion, it is apparent that the decision of Hidden J in particular is useful because the circumstances of that case bear considerable similarities to the present case. That offender was also aged 16 at the time that he participated, with others, in committing the offence of murder. He too pleaded guilty and got the benefit of having provided assistance to the authorities. There was also an additional measure of leniency extended to that offender on account of the considerations identified in R v Ellis . In the upshot Hidden J, after allowing an overall discount of 50%, sentenced that offender to a sentence of 10 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years. There were as might be expected, features which distinguish the two cases, not the least being that, only a mere week before the murder in respect of which that offender was sentenced by Hidden J, he had killed another person. For that offence, he was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years by Sully J. The sentence which Hidden J imposed was wholly accumulated upon the sentence imposed by Sully J and was undoubtedly affected by considerations of totality. It is to be noted that Sully J also sentenced that offender for an additional offence of unlawful imprisonment. Nor was there any Ellis factor in respect of the sentences imposed by Sully J. Moreover in relation to the homicide offence with which Sully J was concerned, the offender actually fired the fatal shots in what was, as his Honour observed, a gangland execution. It would appear that that offender was under the control of other members of a Vietnamese gang at the time of the commission of each of the offences.  [at para 51]  80Those cases are too few in number to provide anything in the nature of a ""range of sentences"".  Nevertheless, the outcome in each of those cases indicates a significant degree of consistency in approach.  Accordingly, and despite the fact that there are differences between each of those cases and the present case, those decisions do provide something of a frame of reference for the determination of the appropriate sentence in this case.  As I have said, I agree that the applicant has made good the submission that the discount for the ""Ellis factor"" was inadequate. My preliminary view as to that matter has been fortified by a consideration of the decisions to which Adams J referred, and in particular, the length of the appropriate non-parole period.  81The primary judge said that:  I do not find special circumstances.  The sentence that I will impose will have a sufficient non-parole period to allow for his supervision and to ensure that he returns to a life without crime, without drugs and alcohol, and with the kind of stability that has earned him a leniency that, for such a serious offence, would not otherwise be given.  82It is at this point that I part company with Adams J.  I agree, for the reasons given by the primary judge, that this was not a case which warranted a finding of ""special circumstances"".  Moreover, the non-parole period which I propose is the minimum period of actual incarceration that the circumstances require, notwithstanding the very powerful subjective factors upon which the applicant was entitled to rely: R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 [at para 57].  83In approaching the task of re-sentencing I have had particular regard to what was said in the plurality judgment in R v Markarian (2005) 228 CLR 357 about the difficulties to which ""an arithmetical process"" to sentencing may give rise and especially where, as here, there exists ""a complex of inter-related considerations"" [at para 37].  84Finally, unlike Adams J, I would forbear from expressing a view about the sentence imposed in respect of the armed robbery offence.  No application for leave to appeal was brought in respect of that sentence and accordingly, the parties did not address the Court in respect of it.  85I propose the following orders:  1 Grant leave to appeal.  2 Allow the appeal and quash the sentence imposed at first instance.  3 Substitute a sentence comprising a non-parole period of 9 years commencing on 7 February 2008 and expiring on 6 February 2017 and a balance of term of 3 years expiring on 6 February 2020.  4 The applicant is eligible for parole on 6 February 2017.  **********

2709349,R v KLINK [2011] NSWDC 225,"SENTENCE 
1HIS HONOUR: I have before me for sentence Abdulgini Klink, a young man who committed a small criminal act as part of a much larger criminal scheme conducted by others. Most of us in the law, and many in the community, know the name Bassam Hamzy. He is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment. Despite being in custody he was able to operate a significant drug distribution network through the use of a mobile telephone. Quite how he was able to use the phone as often as he did whilst in Lithgow gaol is for others to determine. I note that he has pleaded guilty and will be sentenced by Judge Zahra at a later date. 

2His drug distribution network had many facets. Obviously one of the important matters to him involved the delivery of drugs and the collection of money. It was this latter aspect, the movement of money from person to person, that this offender got involved in on a single occasion, which was not repeated. The offender was asked by some friends of his to join them on a trip to Melbourne. The offender, who was just short of nineteen at the time, went with them, not being aware that there was any criminal purpose of the trip. Once in Melbourne the offender learnt that there was to be some money transported from Melbourne to Sydney, in total $31,000 in cash, which the offender clearly realised was most likely to be the proceeds of some crime. Indeed, whilst in Melbourne he received a phone call from Mr Hamzy himself who asked for his assistance. 

3So the offender travelled back from Melbourne to Sydney with $31,000 secreted upon him. After arriving in Sydney there was a telephone conversation between Bassam Hamzy and the offender in which the offender was told to deliver the money to Ghassan Amoun, Mr Hamzy's brother. That is what occurred on 27 May 2008. The offender handed over $31,000. It is significant to note that that offence took place in May 2008 but it was not until December 2009 that the offender was spoken to by police. There is no suggestion at all that the offender has committed any other offence related to Mr Hamzy's drug distribution network. That is a very significant matter in determining the appropriate punishment to impose upon the offender. 

4That is not to say, however, that the offender has lived a law abiding life since that time. After committing this offence, the offender was dealt with in the Local Court for a series of offences, all relatively minor but which could well say something about the way the offender's character is developing. What appears to have been a minor traffic matter led to the offender being dealt with for using offensive language, resisting an officer in the execution of his duty, assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty and not stopping his vehicle when directed. True it is that he was either fined or had those matters dismissed under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . But given the offender's youth it is regrettable in the extreme that what should have been a simple traffic matter escalated to the stage where the offender committed the offences that I have just read out. 

5Of course, this offence is a serious one. Those involved in the supply of drugs need drug couriers and they also need people to take control of cash and deliver it from place to place. In that manner offences of this kind are essential to more serious criminals such as Mr Hamzy. It has to be recognised the offender's actions were part of a much larger enterprise which caused great harm to the community. On the other hand, of course, the offender must be sentenced for what he has done, which was on a single occasion transport $31,000 in cash aware of the likelihood that that money was the proceeds of crime. 

6The offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so the sentence that I will impose upon him is twenty-five per cent less than it would otherwise have been. 

7There is much to be said in the favour of the offender's character. Having left school after completing his school certificate he has been in constant employment and is now working in a concrete pumping operation. He lives at home with his family and, according to Mr Coroneos, no longer associates with people he used to associate with. This offence has the flavour that Mr Coroneos had suggested it had, that is, of a young boy trying to big note himself in the presence of others. It is, I am satisfied, most likely that he will not commit an offence of this nature again. 

8Mr Coroneos asked that I deal with the matter under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . I am not going to do that for two reasons. Firstly, the offender needs to be punished for what he has done. And, secondly, there needs to be an element of personal deterrence. Despite everything I have said before, the offender needs to be reminded on an ongoing basis that what he did was the wrong thing. I have come to this conclusion because of the subsequent offences that the offender committed. I do not want the offender in any way to get the idea that he can commit offences with any regularity and expect to walk away from court unpunished. It is an important aspect of the sentencing process that, where appropriate, offenders are personally deterred from committing further offences. This is one such case. He needs to be reminded that he did the wrong thing and he needs to be made aware that if he does the wrong thing again he will be punished again. In this regard I note that a psychological report tendered on his behalf referred to inadequate impulse control. If the offender is the sort of person that can decide to commit criminal offences easily when led by others, then the courts must do what they can to remind him that if he does not control his impulses and does commit criminal offences he will receive punishment appropriate to what he has done. 

9The result is that I convict the offender and order that he perform 150 hours of community service. He is therefore to report to the Parramatta office of the Probation and Parole Service within seven days.

		22 March 2012",2011-08-10 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709350,R v BAXTER [2011] NSWDC 180,"Judgment 
1HIS HONOUR: Darryl Baxter is to be sentenced for an offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm. He is forty-eight years old now and has spent most of his adult life in gaol. He gave evidence before me in a disarmingly frank way. He tells me that he is doing his time in custody now in a significantly different manner in the way in which he has previously served periods of imprisonment. He has grown up and no longer blames others for his predicament. He recognises that others have suffered because of his ongoing criminal offending, not only the victim in this matter who I will speak about in a little while, but also his sister, who is now seriously unwell and who has a son with autism with whom the offender gets on very well. 

2I have heard evidence today which suggests the desirability of the offender being released to care for his sister and his nephew. But my task is to look beyond the offender's personal predicament and also that of his sister and his nephew. My task is to look to the protection of the community generally and for that reason it is necessary that the offender must spend a significant further period of time in custody before his eventual release. 

3The offender had been released from custody in May 2009. Two months later he went to the Wentworth Park greyhound track with his then partner and her daughter. His partner was an alcoholic and proceeded to drink heavily that evening. Also at the greyhound track was a Benjamin Barry, he was celebrating his bucks night and was dressed in a distinctive bright jacket for the occasion. He was allowed to present one of the prizes. Things went well until at about 10 o'clock the offender's partner and her daughter were involved in an incident whereby one of them tipped some drinks on some members of the people helping Mr Barry celebrate his buck's night. This happened just after the last race finished. The patrons were then asked to leave. Mr Barry and another of his party were still inside the premises when they saw the two women being escorted from the premises by police. Mr Barry saw this happening and he turned to his friend and said, ""I'm not surprised to see them get thrown out"". The offender did not take this comment well. He came quickly towards Mr Barry and punched him once in his face to his cheek. Mr Barry had not seen or spoken to the offender before the offender punched him. The offender did not square up to Mr Barry to give him a chance to defend himself but rushed over and immediately hit him forcefully to his face. The person that Mr Barry was standing with said that the contact of the offender's fist to Mr Barry's face made a crunching sound. When Mr Barry stood up there were immediate and obvious signs of injury. 

4The offender was arrested, falsely telling the police that what had happened was self-defence and that Mr Barry had taken a swing at him first. He also falsely described what he had done as just a ""tap"". 

5Mr Barry was taken to hospital. He remained there for a couple of days and has undergone surgery to do what can be done to correct his injuries. He was shown to have a significant fracture of his left cheekbone and also a fracture of his jaw. 

6I mentioned before that Mr Barry was on his buck's night. His wedding was two weeks later. He was unable to eat solid food there, describing his wedding night meal as mashed potato and gravied steak. He ate nothing much more than soup and Weet-Bix for six weeks after this incident and has spent over 100 hours in hospital as a result of the assault. He is left with two disabilities too, one psychological and one physical. Psychologically, he says that he rarely stays out at public events and places much past 11 o'clock these days, as he is afraid of being the victim of a similar senseless and unprovoked attack again. He points out in the victim impact statement that he was in a large group in a crowded venue with security and police present. That did not stop the offender from hitting him without warning and without regard for the consequences. 

7Physically he is left with a disfigurement to his face in that his cheekbone on one side is lower than the cheekbone on the other side. He says, ""When I am tired and the muscles in my face fatigue, it is quite noticeable that my face droops on one side"". The offender described what he had done as two seconds of madness. That is true but it has led to lifelong consequences for Mr Barry. 

8The offender was born in Sydney. Both his parents were alcoholics and they fought on a regular basis. He lived an unhappy childhood in what he said was an angry house. At school he truanted and behaved badly, leaving at a very young age, indeed in year 7. His parents did not care for him much; he was largely left to his own devices. In those circumstances it is not surprising to find his criminal history commencing at a very early age. It is a substantial criminal history with offences of violence upon it. Mr Baxter said that almost all the offences of violence occurred while he was in custody. His sister, who gave evidence before me today, did what she could for a while but the offender's constant criminal activities, the fact that she had her own children to care for, and the fact that one of them requires a significant level of care due to his autism, led to her eventually pushing the offender away. No one, least of all the offender, blames her for that. In recent times, however, as the offender has matured, they have become close again. 

9The offender broke up from his partner, the woman whose honour he was perhaps trying to defend and moved in with his sister in the Central Coast. He gets on well with her autistic son Blake. He requires a significant level of care and is unable to live by himself. They have not told Blake that the offender is in custody, preferring to tell him that he is working up in Queensland. The offender rings him every day and the offender's sister said that that is the highlight of Blake's life. 

10I have got no doubt, having heard the offender and having read a report from Ms Laycock an alcohol and other drug counsellor at the MRRC, that the offender now is a different person to the way he was at the time he committed this offence. His sister said that previously he had a chip on his shoulder, which has now been removed and the offender very belatedly accepts that his problems are all of his own making. At the time of this offence the offender was not taking methadone, he stopped taking methadone upon his release from custody about two months before. He said that he was generally an angry person at the time and that the combination of not taking methadone and his high level of anger is what led to him committing this offence. 

11However, since going into custody again this time he has been able to deal with his anger problems and has finally realised that he has virtually wasted his life by spending so much of it in custody. In contrast to his earlier periods of custody he has not been dealt with for any internal disciplinary matter and is now a sweeper, a position of some responsibility within the gaol. Mr Baxter finally has a genuine desire to put his life of crime behind him. Despite that I cannot say that his prospects of rehabilitation are good, but in one sense that is not his fault. Much will depend on how he responds upon his release from custody to the supervision which he clearly needs. In this regard I note that he was released from gaol in May 2009 without any supervision at all. It is important that the offender is closely monitored and closely assisted with everyday living skills upon his release from custody this time. For that reason I make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour. Offences such as this are clearly serious. They represent a significant breach of the peace. The harm that offences such as this cause extend beyond the harm that Mr Barry suffered. Everyone in the community suffers when violent acts such as these are committed in public places. We all feel we should be able to go out and have a good time at the greyhound track without being subject to unprovoked and cowardly violence at the hands of an angry offender. 

12One way of determining how serious this offence is is to look at the circumstance that it carries with it a standard non-parole period of four years. That of course is not of direct application because of the offender's plea of guilty, but it remains as an important guidepost to the sentence that I should impose. The fact that it has a standard non-parole period requires that I make a finding about the objective gravity of the offence, which I would not need to make in the absence of a standard non-parole period. I find that the offence is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. This was as I have said, an unprovoked and cowardly attack upon a defenceless man who has suffered significant injuries. On the other hand it was a single punch with no weapon or planning involved. The middle of the range is just that, a range, it is not a point and I do find for those reasons that the offence is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. 

13I mentioned the plea of guilty. It came late. The offender did not even turn up on the day his trial was due to commence earlier this year and a bench warrant had to be issued for his arrest. His failure to attend is explained by the circumstance that he just could not face going back to gaol. Given the state he was in, living with his sister who is significantly unwell, I can almost understand why the offender would take that position. It was not a wise thing to do, however. 

14The late plea of guilty nevertheless had a utilitarian benefit to the criminal justice system and so I will reduce the sentence I would otherwise impose by ten per cent. The plea of guilty is also evidence of remorse. The offender said that he was sorry and wished that Mr Barry was here in court today so that he could express his remorse to him personally. The offender also recognises that others are going to suffer because of the need for me to impose a significant period of imprisonment upon him, people such as his sister and his nephew. 

15It is terribly sad that the offender has spent most of his adult life in gaol but what is a judge to do when an offender repeatedly offends and ends up causing significant harm to an innocent member of the community, as the offender did in this case? My duties extend beyond looking merely at the offender and his family. My duties include a consideration of the community as a whole. People such as Mr Baxter, who described himself as on a hair trigger, need to understand that if they are going to lose their tempers and commit serious offences such as this, they will go to gaol for a significant period of time, even if their sisters are seriously unwell and if their nephews benefit from them being around. 

16I will impose a sentence of imprisonment upon Mr Baxter which is the lowest I can possibly impose. Although Mr Cruikshank did not rely on the circumstances involving the offender's family as being exceptional, they are part of the general mix of subjective factors which I will take into account. In particular I will take into account that the offender accurately blames himself for his sister and nephew being deprived of comfort and care at a time when they most need it. For that reason he will do his time in custody much harder than would otherwise be the case. 

17The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of twenty-one months to date from 20 April 2011 and will expire on 19 January 2013, on which day the offender is to be released to parole. I set a head sentence of 42 months. Because the length of the sentence exceeds three years, it is not for me to set conditions of parole. It is my firm recommendation that upon the offender's release to parole, he is very closely supervised and provided with as much assistance as is possible in order to assist him to overcome his institutionalisation.

2709361,Charbaji v R [2011] NSWCCA 181,"Judgment 

1WHEALY JA: I agree with Buddin J and the orders he proposes . 

2BUDDIN J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court. The applicant adhered to his plea, which was first entered in the Local Court, to an offence of supplying cocaine. That offence attracts a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units. He also pleaded guilty to an offence of dealing with property suspected of being the proceeds of crime, being a quantity of cash, as well as an offence of possessing a prescribed restricted substance, namely a steroid. In respect of the supply offence, the applicant was sentenced to an overall term of imprisonment of 5 years 6 months to commence on 31 August 2009 and to expire on 28 February 2015 with a non-parole period of 3 years to expire on 30 August 2012. A concurrent fixed term of 1 month was imposed in respect of the proceeds of crime offence whilst the offence of possessing the steroid was proved but dismissed pursuant to s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . 

3The facts are not in dispute and can be shortly stated. Police executed a search warrant upon the applicant's premises in Bankstown on 31 August 2009. The applicant and two young children were present at the time. A total of $13,035 in cash was located in the applicant's bedroom. In the bedroom wardrobe police located a freezer bag filled with white crystalline rocks and powder, which upon analysis, was identified as being 73.49 grams of cocaine. In the bottom drawer of the wardrobe, police located a vial containing 9.5 mls of sustanol and a number of syringes. Police also located in the premises a set of electronic scales upon which was a small quantity of white powder, two mobile phones, approximately 100 small resealable bags, a collection of unused freezer bags and a torn piece of paper upon which a number of names and figures were written. The document had the appearance of being a drug ledger. The applicant declined the opportunity to be interviewed by police. 

4The applicant, who was aged 25 at the time of the offence, was born in Lebanon. He migrated to Australia with his family in 1988. Shortly thereafter his parents divorced, an event which greatly distressed the applicant. The applicant left school at the end of year 10 and gained employment in the building industry as a plasterer. In more recent times he had worked on a casual basis for family members in labouring jobs and as a waterproofer. 

5The applicant has a criminal record which commenced in 1999 when he was aged 15. In that year he was placed on a recognisance in the Children's Court in respect of an offence of goods in custody. In 2001 he was placed on a further recognisance in the Children's Court in respect of an offence of common assault. In 2002 he received fines in the Local Court for minor driving offences. In 2002 he was sentenced in the Children's Court to a control order of 21 months with a non-parole period of 9 months for offences of supplying a prohibited drug and the ongoing supply of a prohibited drug. In 2003 he was sentenced in the District Court to a period of 3 years and 5 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years in respect of an offence of armed robbery. In 2009 in the Local Court he was placed on a s 10 bond in respect of offences of having the custody of a knife in a public place and driving whilst suspended. In the same year he was also fined in respect of minor driving offences. 

6Shortly after his release from gaol in 2004, the applicant formed a relationship with a young woman and in due course they became engaged. In January 2008 the applicant received serious head injuries in an assault, as a result of which he remained in a coma for several days. Whilst he was recovering, his fiance was killed and his mother was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident. The accident occurred as they were returning home from visiting the applicant in hospital. The applicant told a psychologist Mr Tim Watson-Munro, who prepared a report on his behalf, that he ""continued to be plagued with symptoms of guilt, despair and depression"" as a result of that tragedy. The offender reported that it was against this background that he began to self-medicate with alcohol and cocaine. A psychiatrist Dr Olav Nielssen, who also prepared a report on the applicant's behalf, diagnosed him as suffering from traumatic brain injury, substance abuse disorder and a depressive illness. The applicant informed the author of a pre-sentence report that he had accumulated a significant indebtedness to his drug suppliers and that he had dealt in drugs in order to financially support his addiction. 

7The sentencing judge extended to the applicant a discount of 25 per cent for his plea of guilty. Although the applicant did not give evidence, the sentencing judge took into account his ""expression of remorse to others in a limited way"". The sentencing judge referred to the fact that a number of testimonials had been furnished to the Court. His Honour found that they demonstrated the extent of the support which the applicant enjoyed in the community. They also revealed that he had made significant progress in overcoming his drug addiction. His Honour also referred to the fact that the applicant had participated in counselling programs whilst in custody. On the other side of the coin, he had also incurred two institutional charges. The sentencing judge concluded, in the circumstances, that ""[o]ne must be guarded in assessing the offender's prospects of rehabilitation"". His Honour nevertheless found ""special circumstances"" because of the applicant's need to have a lengthy period of parole supervision to enable him to address his issues around grief and depression and to assist him in avoiding a relapse into drug use. 

8The applicant relied upon the following grounds of appeal: 

(a) His Honour erred in failing to determine the objective gravity of the offence: 

(b) His Honour erred in failing to explain how the applicant's record of previous convictions would be taken into account; 

(c) His Honour erred in treating the fact that the applicant had been placed on a bond pursuant to s. 10(1)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999 as a previous conviction; 

(d) His Honour erred by placing too great a weight upon the fact that the applicant was in breach of a bond previously imposed pursuant to s. 10(1)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 ; 

(e) His Honour erred in failing to identify those factors which were either aggravating (other than the applicant's record of previous convictions) or mitigating; and 

(f) The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 

Ground 1 

9In order to evaluate this ground, it is necessary to refer to passages from the Remarks on Sentence which appear under a heading entitled ""Assessment of the objective gravity of the offending"". His Honour said: 

For offences of supplying prohibited drugs the sentence should reflect the paramount importance of deterrence. 

In R v Clarke NSWCCA 15 th March 1990 Hunt J with whom Sharpe J agreed, said: 

This Court has...emphasised that sentences involving a substantial general deterrence are to be imposed on drug traffickers and...only in exceptional circumstances will a non-custodial order be appropriate. 

Judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal subsequent to Clarke have indicated that this statement is not restricted to those cases in which a profit has been obtained and profit is an aggravating factor. What the statement is principally directed to is the trafficking, the dissemination of drugs to others. Trafficking alone in any substantial degree should normally lead to a custodial sentence. 

10His Honour then referred to an observation by Mr Watson-Munro that the applicant's drug use ""compromised his judgment"". He then continued: 

The difficulty in understanding the offending here in terms of impaired judgment is that the supply here has elements of organisation. The offending could not be said to be impulsive. A considerable amount of drugs were found on the premises in various forms and places. There was a significant amount of cash and other paraphernalia including scales, resealable bags and mobile phones. Documentation found in his possession would suggest that the supply here was part of a significant ongoing enterprise. 

The offender is not to be sentenced for matters for which he is not charged. Conduct not the subject of charges may not be taken into account so as to result in the imposition of a sentence higher than would be merited by the conduct charged. Such conduct however may be relevant to deny leniency that might be afforded if the conduct charged were regarded as an aberration. 

The offender told Dr Nielssen that he mainly sold cocaine to people that he knew. The amount of drugs that the offender possessed here were substantial and not readily explained by the offender's need to support his drug addiction even though it was likely that the offender had a significant addiction at the time. The offender did not give evidence before me and caution should be exercised in assessing the weight to be attached to untested histories provided to Dr Nielssen and Mr Watson-Munro. 

In the context of the magnitude of the supply and the level of organisation, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the offender's moral culpability is reduced by the offender's underlying depression and substance abuse disorder. I am of the view ultimately that whilst the underlying conditions provide the context of the offending the offender's moral culpability is not reduced in a material way. 

11In advancing the submission that his Honour had erred in failing to determine the objective gravity of the offence, counsel for the applicant called in aid what was said in R v Cage [2006] NSWCCA 304. Latham J, with the concurrence of the other members of the court, said: 

A bare recitation of the facts constituting the offences and a reference to the ""objective features of the offences"" does not satisfy the requirements of sentencing. The correct approach to imposing a sentence for an offence has been the subject of repeated pronouncements of this Court since the decision in R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594, as the following excerpt from the Court's judgment in R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 459 at 468 demonstrates :- 

The sentence to be imposed for any crime must take into account the many different purposes which that sentence is expected to serve - the protection of society, personal and public deterrence, retribution and reform - even though those purposes overlap and sometimes are in conflict: Veen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476; 33 A Crim R 230 at 237-238. It is important always to have regard first of all to the gravity of the crime viewed objectively for, without such an assessment, the other factors requiring consideration before arriving at the proper sentence to be imposed cannot properly be given their place : Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354. Except in well-defined circumstances such as the youth or the mental incapacity of the offender, public deterrence is generally regarded as the main purpose of punishment, and the subjective considerations relating to the particular offender (however persuasive) are necessarily subsidiary to the duty of the courts to see that the sentence which is imposed will operate as a powerful factor in preventing the commission of similar crimes by those who may otherwise be tempted by the prospect that only light punishment will be imposed. (Italics not in original) 

In the instant case, there was no assessment undertaken of the objective gravity of the offences, insofar as no attempt was made to determine where on the scale of criminality these examples of the offences lay, referable to the maximum penalty prescribed by the legislature in each case. Accordingly, the respondent's criminal history, subjective circumstances and prospects of rehabilitation could not be meaningfully measured against the respondent's objective criminality. I do not mean to suggest by these remarks that it is necessary to undertake a mathematical or prescriptive approach to sentencing, or that one should engage in a two-tier approach : see Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25. However, his Honour's remarks lacked the transparency that would allow the respondent, this Court and the general community to understand how it was that his Honour arrived at the final result . [at 17-18] (emphasis in original) 

12Reliance was also placed upon what was said in Corby v R [2010] NSWCCA 146 in which Johnson J, with the concurrence of the other members of the court, observed that: 

That said, the law requires that a sentencing Judge engage in consideration of matters bearing upon the objective seriousness of a crime for the purpose of determining sentence. The sentencing Judge reserved for a week on the question of sentence and had the opportunity to consider the helpful written and oral submissions on sentence. However, the extracts from the remarks on sentence set out at [38]-[40] above, reveal only general statements concerning this class of offending, without any assessment of arguments, let alone conclusions, concerning the objective seriousness of the Applicant's offences. The closest his Honour came to consideration of the Applicant's submissions on objective seriousness was the statement (at [38] above) that it ""is all very well saying that the offence involved only touching, however that is exactly what the law is stating"" . Of course, indecent ""touching"" of the victim was an element of the s.61M(2) offence. The submissions made to the Court concerned the nature and extent of the touching in this case. His Honour did not address this issue. [at para 52] (emphasis in original) 

13It is important nevertheless to have regard to the context in which those statements were made. In Cage unlike the present case, and as Latham J pointed out, there was simply no assessment whatsoever of the objective gravity of the offences. In Corby , at least one of the offences in question carried a standard non-parole period and, as is apparent, although submissions had been directed to the issue of the objective seriousness of the offence in the court below, they were scarcely addressed. 

14The real complaint in the present case appears to be that the sentencing judge did not resolve an issue which had arisen between the parties as to whether the offence lay ""at the upper range of criminality"" or that it ""fell below the mid-range of such offences"". 

15The short answer to the submission is that as the offence in question does not carry a standard non-parole period, it was not necessary for the sentencing judge to have made a finding as to where precisely it lay on the spectrum of offending. In Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118, Simpson J observed: 

Thus, while an assessment of objective gravity is, in all cases, a necessary aspect of the sentencing determination, it is only in respect of offences that, pursuant to Pt 4 Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, carry a standard non-parole period that an evaluation of where, on a putative or notional scale of objective gravity an offence falls, is necessary. [at 74] 



See also Sivell v R [2009] NSWCCA 286 [at 5]; Locke v R [2010] NSWCCA 296 [at 62]; Mansour v R [2011] NSWCCA 28 [at 63]. 

But, in any event, it is conspicuously clear that the sentencing judge identified, in the passages to which I referred earlier, the salient features of the offence which pertained to the question of its objective gravity. 

16I would reject this ground of appeal. 

Ground 2 

17Under a heading entitled ""Antecedents"", the sentencing judge said: 

Prior criminal record cannot be taken into account when determining the objective seriousness of the offence. Prior record does not have the effect of aggravating the offence but it may either deprive the offender of leniency or indicate that more weight is to be given to retribution, personal deterrence and the protection to the community R v McNaughten (sic) [2006] NSWCCA 242. 

18His Honour then set out the details of the applicant's antecedents. It is true, as counsel for the applicant contended, that his Honour did not explicitly state if, and in what fashion, the applicant's criminal record was to be taken into account. Counsel referred to R v Walker [2005] NSWCCA 109, in which Johnson J, with the concurrence of the other members of the court, said: 

It should be observed, however, that a passing reference to s.21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 , without reference to the precise manner in which the sentencing judge takes that factor into account on sentence, is unsatisfactory. A failure to explain the manner in which the factor is taken into account does not enlighten the sentencing process, in a manner which s.21A appears to have been designed to achieve. Nor does it inform the offender, the Crown and the community of the use which the sentencing judge has made of this factor. In a case where the offender's criminal history is not capable of attracting the principles in Veen (No. 2) , error may be demonstrated which affects the sentencing process. It is important that sentencing judges keep firmly in mind the limited purpose for which an offender's criminal record may be taken into account, in a manner adverse to the offender, in the exercise of sentencing discretion. [at para 32] 

See also Doolan v R (2006) 160 A Crim R 54 [at 20]. 

19Those authorities however are of limited assistance because at no stage did the sentencing judge refer to s 21A(2)(d) of the Act or even hint that he was treating the applicant's record as an aggravating factor. 

20I am inclined however to assume that the sentencing judge did, in fact, give more weight to retribution, personal deterrence and protection of the community on account of the applicant's prior record. Indeed, his Honour stressed the need, in determining the appropriate sentence ""to meet the fundamental purpose of protection of society."" I have already referred, albeit in a different context, to the sentencing judge's observations concerning whether the present offence was ""an aberration"". Given the circumstances of the present offence, and the nature and extent of the applicant's prior offending, it could scarcely be suggested that his present conduct could be regarded as an ""uncharacteristic aberration"". By the same token it could not be said that the applicant had displayed a ""dangerous propensity"" in the sense in which that expression was used in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465. Nor, of course did his Honour make such a suggestion. Furthermore, I am not unmindful that in R v Price [2005] NSWCCA 285, Simpson J said: 

Veen is not, in my opinion intended to apply to every case where an offender has some criminal history, even of a like kind to that under consideration in the sentencing exercise.[at 38] 

Much will depend on the circumstances of the particular case. Indeed, in Price the prior offence had resulted in the imposition of a s 10 bond. In the present case, in my view, the applicant's prior convictions were relevant ""in determining the appropriate level of punishment for the particular offence"": R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 [at 25]. 

21That being so I do not detect error, with the consequence that this ground should be rejected. 

Grounds 3 and 4 

22These grounds may be dealt with together. It is common ground that for the purposes of s 21A(2)(d) of the Act a dismissal of a matter pursuant to s 10 of the Act should be disregarded: see Price (supra) 

23It was pointed out on behalf of the applicant that the sentencing judge had, when listing the applicant's antecedents, referred to the matters in 2009 concerning which the applicant had been dealt with pursuant to s 10 of the Act. It was submitted that his Honour had erred in not drawing a distinction between those offences, and the other offences to which I have referred that had resulted in convictions. 

24The submission, in my view, is quite untenable. So much is clear from the sentencing judge's remarks. Indeed all that his Honour said was that: 

In 2009 the offender was placed on a bond pursuant to s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act on counts of custody of a knife in a public place and driving whilst suspended. The offender was subject to this bond at the time of the commission of the present offence which is a significant aggravating factor. 

25Furthermore, as I have said, his Honour did not in any event refer to s 21A(2)(d). It is clear however that the sentencing judge regarded the fact that the applicant was on bonds at the time as a matter of aggravation. 

26It is the passage to which I have just referred that gives rise to Ground 4. The complaint is that the sentencing judge erred in using the epithet ""significant"" to describe what was otherwise accepted to be an aggravating factor. It was also submitted that the breach of those bonds should not have weighed heavily in the balance. Reliance was placed upon Frigiani v R [2007] NSWCCA 81 in which Howie J, with whom the other members of the Court were in agreement, said that: 

It is clear that the prior matter was relevant in two ways. Firstly it was an aggravating factor because the offence for which the applicant was being sentenced was committed in breach of a good behaviour bond. That is an aggravating factor listed in s 21A(2)(j) regardless of the conduct in respect of which the bond was imposed. However, it is generally considered to be more aggravating when the conduct is similar to that for which the offender is being sentenced. The second paragraph of his Honour's remarks quoted above reflects this fact. [at para 24] 

27See also Chaplin v R (2006) 160 A Crim R 85 in which it was observed that the ""aggravation will be more severe in circumstances where a similar offence is committed whilst a person is on conditional liberty"" [at para 27]. Moreover, it was submitted that the offences in respect of which the bonds had been imposed were not, of themselves, particularly serious and certainly not as serious as the offence for which the applicant stood to be sentenced. 

28In Lee v R [2011] NSWCCA 169, Basten JA in the context of considering an argument about parity, said: 

The respondent [Crown] contended on the appeal that limited weight should be given to the fact that [the co-offender] committed the offence while on conditional liberty, because the matters for which he was on conditional liberty were relatively minor offences, not involving personal violence. This contention should be rejected. The underlying offences were factors to be taken into account, as in fact they were, in relation to [the co-offender's] minor criminal record for offences of dishonesty. ... It may be that the breach would have been more serious if the offences for which he was on conditional liberty were similar to those committed in the present case, but the mere fact of conditional liberty is, as the sentencing judge noted, a significant factor of aggravation. [at para 41] (emphasis added) 

29In my view, those remarks are equally apposite to the present case. I am not persuaded that error of the relevant kind has been established and accordingly I would reject grounds 3 and 4. 

Ground 5 

30At the conclusion of the Remarks on Sentence, the sentencing judge said that ""I must take into account such of the aggravating factors and mitigating factors referred to in s 21A of that Act and any other relevant factor"". Complaint was made that the sentencing judge had not thereby identified those factors that had particular relevance to the present case. 

31Counsel for the applicant relied upon R v Mills (2005) 154 A Crim R 40 in which, Wood CJ at CL with the concurrence of the other members of the court, said: 

As is also the case in relation to s 21A of the Act, more is expected than mere lip service to the legislation. What is required is a clear identification of the relevant factors, the weight given to them, and their role in the structuring of the sentencing order: see R v Walker [2005] NSWCCA 109 [at para 49] 

32It is important to understand the context in which his Honour's remarks were made. The Court was there dealing with a Crown appeal in respect of offences which carried a standard non-parole period. Immediately prior to the passage which is set out above, Wood CJ at CL said: 

His Honour dealt with the requirement that the court identify the reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period in the following passage: 

The standard non-parole sentence is five years. I consider in the circumstances of this case and taking into account the submissions of counsel, that it is appropriate 
that the sentence to be imposed be less than the standard non-parole term. That is the view of the Court in relation to each of the counts. 

I do not consider that this was a sufficient compliance with the requirements of s 54B(4). A mere statement of the conclusion, accompanied by a confirmation that the submissions of counsel, and the circumstances of the case, have been taken into account, does not constitute an identification of the reasons which are expected in a case which falls within the umbrella of the Division. [at paras 48 - 49] 

33In truth, the only aggravating feature which his Honour identified was the fact that the applicant was on conditional liberty. There is no basis for concluding, as was submitted, that his Honour determined that the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity such as constitute an aggravating feature within the meaning of s 21A(2)(n) of the Act. Not only did his Honour not say that he was taking that matter into account, but neither party at the sentencing hearing contended that there was any basis for doing so. It was conceded, however, by the applicant's counsel then representative that there was, as the evidence demonstrated, a measure of planning. The references by his Honour to their being a ""level of organisation"" are to be understood in the context of an assessment as to whether the applicant had impaired judgment or reduced moral culpability for his actions. 

34Clearly enough, and contrary to the applicant's submissions, the sentencing judge did have regard to those mitigating features upon which the applicant could rely, including his early plea of guilty, the fact that he had displayed some remorse, the fact that he enjoyed a significant level of support in the community as well as what his Honour described as his ""significant progress towards overcoming his drug addiction"". 

35Finally, as Grove J observed in Van Can Ha v R [2008] NSWCCA 141, a judge is not required to ""engage in a ritual analysis of the possible factors [listed in 21A] in order sufficiently to reveal the processes involved in the penalty assessment"" [at para 4]. This ground of appeal should be rejected. 

Ground 6 

36In submitting that the sentence was manifestly excessive, attention was drawn to the mitigating features of the case, and to the fact that this was, so it was contended, an unremarkable instance of a 'deemed supply' of a quantity of cocaine which was ""considerably less than a third of the commercial quantity"". 

37Whilst counsel for the applicant conceded that statistics retained by the Judicial Commission provide a blunt tool for determining the appropriateness of a particular sentence, it was nonetheless submitted that they demonstrated that the present sentence, and in particular the head sentence, was beyond the range. The statistical material that was before the sentencing judge revealed that only 2 out of 52 persons received a non-parole period as long as that imposed upon the applicant. However, it should be observed that the table relates to all offenders. In other words, it does not allow for the particular features of the applicant's offending. For some unexplained reason the cohort for the total term consists of only 12 persons, none of whom received a sentence as long as the applicant. That apparent anomaly makes reliance upon the use of those statistics even more problematic than might otherwise be the case. Although the Court was provided with more recent information which revealed that the cohort for the total term was now 70 cases, that did not add anything of particular significance to the material that was before the sentencing judge. 

38Although the sentence which was imposed, and particularly the total term, may be considered to be towards the upper end of the range for such an offence, I am not persuaded however that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The quantity of drugs was substantial (bearing in mind that the indictable quantity was 5 grams) and had a relatively high level of purity (being in the range of 57.5 per cent to 60.5 per cent). Furthermore, as I have said, police located a document which was in the nature of a drug ledger. It contained a considerable number of references to the names of individuals and to sums of money. For example, figures of $3,250, $1,750 and $1,450 respectively appear on the document. That material, together with the discovery of the various kinds of paraphernalia that are commonly associated with drug supply, strongly indicate that this was, as his Honour indicated, a ""significant on-going enterprise"". Moreover, the applicant was on conditional liberty and had prior convictions for supplying drugs. In my view this ground should be rejected.

3BUDDIN J: 

Introduction 
This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court following the applicant's pleas of guilty to two offences which he committed on 8 December 2007. Count 1 involved an offence of sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14 years, an offence which attracts a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. The child (whom I shall refer to as SW) was his 11 year old niece. The circumstance of aggravation which was relied upon was that SW was under the applicant's authority at the time. She was also the victim of each of the other offences to which I shall now refer. Count 2 involved an offence of using a child under the age of 14 for pornographic purposes, an offence which attracts a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. 

4The applicant asked the Court to take into account three additional offences on a Form 1, namely: 

(i) A further offence of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14 years ; 

(ii) An offence of producing child pornography (which attracts a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment); and 

(iii) An offence of aggravated indecent assault (which attracts a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 5 years). The circumstance of aggravation in respect of that offence was the fact that the victim was under the age of 16. 

5In respect of count 2, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months to commence on 16 September 2008 and a total sentence of 2 years imprisonment. In respect of count 1, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years and 2 months and a total sentence of 6 years and 8 months. That sentence was ordered to commence on 16 September 2009. The sentences were structured in such a fashion as to give effect to his Honour's finding of ""special circumstances"". The total effective non-parole period is thus 5 years and 2 months and the effective head sentence is 7 years and 8 months imprisonment. The applicant will be eligible for parole on 15 November 2013. 

The evidence at the sentence hearing 

6The factual background to the offences is not in dispute and can be shortly stated. As I have said, SW was eleven at the time of the offences. The applicant was nearly 25 years of age. SW lived with her grandmother, who is the applicant's mother. Her father and the applicant are brothers. On 8 December 2007, the applicant picked SW up from her home and drove her to his home for a ""sleep-over"". The applicant's wife was working in a restaurant on the evening in question and so the applicant and SW were the only people at the house at the time. 

7When they arrived at the applicant's home, SW sat on the couch in the lounge room. She and the applicant, who was also sitting on the couch, were watching a DVD. Whilst they were doing so, the applicant removed SW's jeans and her underwear. SW said to the applicant ""Don't"". At the time the applicant was kneeling on the couch over the top of SW. The applicant touched SW on her vagina and then inserted his finger inside her vagina for a short period of time. (That conduct constituted the first matter on the Form 1 document). The applicant then held SW's knees apart and performed cunnilingus upon her for a period of time. SW asked the applicant to stop but the applicant requested that he be able to continue, ""just a bit longer"". (That conduct constituted count 1 on the indictment). 

8After performing cunnilingus upon SW, the applicant obtained a digital camera and took a number of photographs of SW's vagina whilst she lay on the couch. (That conduct constituted count 2 on the indictment). The applicant said to SW, ""I'm going to take these photos so that I don't have to do this again"". SW twice said to the applicant, ""Don't take the photos"". However, the applicant continued photographing SW's vagina whilst holding open her vagina with his fingers. (His conduct in holding open her vagina with his fingers constituted the final matter on the Form 1). The applicant had told SW to watch the movie that was being shown on the television. After taking the photographs the applicant dressed SW and left her sitting on the couch. He then left the lounge room and entered a second room where he sat at a computer. A little later he and SW left the house and went to pick up the applicant's wife (SW's aunt). When they returned to the house, SW sat and watched movies with her aunt whilst the applicant went to a nearby room where his computers were housed. 

9On 10 December 2007 a search warrant was executed and police seized a number of computers, a digital camera, and media storage devices. Police found twenty-nine photographs, which were taken between 7.55 pm and 8.25 pm on 8 December 2007, recorded on a four gigabyte memory stick. Of the twenty-nine photographs which had been produced by the applicant, twenty-three were pornographic. (That conduct constituted the second matter on the Form 1). A table describing those images was in evidence. Many of those photographs depict the applicant holding open SW's vagina. 

10When the applicant was arrested by police on 16 September 2008, he declined the opportunity to participate in a recorded interview. He has remained in custody ever since and the sentence was ordered to commence from that date. 

11The applicant did not give evidence at the sentence hearing. Information about his background emerged from a psychologist's report which was prepared by Dr Katie Seidler and from a pre-sentence report. That material was supplemented by a 19 page document which the applicant provided to the sentencing judge. His Honour dealt with that material at considerable length. His Honour accepted that during his childhood the applicant had been a ""loner"" and that he had not involved himself in the family's activities. He accepted that, as he was growing up, the applicant had been assaulted and bullied by his older brothers. His Honour also accepted that, between the ages of 11 and 15, the applicant had been sexually assaulted on a regular basis by a family friend (the details of that abuse were set out in a further document which was furnished to his Honour by the applicant). His Honour accepted that the applicant had only recently received professional assistance to help him deal with that experience. His Honour described the abuse as being ""very grave and very disturbing"". 

12To compound matters, the applicant was bullied at school, and as a consequence, under-achieved academically. Nevertheless, after leaving school it appears that he had been in fairly constant employment and that he had completed various educational courses. His Honour observed that the applicant had told the author of the pre-sentence report that he wanted to address his ""offending behaviour"". To that end, it seems that he will, in due course, be offered the opportunity of undergoing the CUBIT program. 

The sentencing remarks 

13His Honour concluded, contrary to a submission made by the Crown, that there were no additional factors which operated to aggravate the seriousness of the offences. His Honour also proceeded upon the basis that cunnilingus is less serious than other forms of sexual intercourse. Notwithstanding his conclusion that the act of cunnilingus ""persisted for some time"" his Honour determined that that offence was ""at the bottom of mid range of objective seriousness for an offence of this nature"". His Honour then determined, in conformity with the principles enunciated in Attorney-General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 [at para 42] that he would ""impose a longer sentence than I otherwise might for a case at the bottom of the mid range of objective seriousness"" to reflect the matters on the Form 1. His Honour formed the view that the offence which gave rise to count 2 fell ""at the bottom of the range of objective seriousness"". I observe in passing that it was strictly unnecessary for his Honour to determine where the offences fell in relation to the mid range of seriousness given that neither of the counts on the indictment concerned offences to which a standard non-parole period was applicable. It will be necessary to refer to his Honour's findings in a little more detail shortly. 

14There were a number of matters upon which the applicant was entitled to rely which served to mitigate the otherwise appropriate penalties. A discount of 15% was extended to the applicant to reflect the fact that he had pleaded guilty, albeit on the day of his trial. The applicant was extended a further measure of leniency by reason of the fact that he had no relevant criminal record, although his Honour observed that it was ""not as much as I otherwise would for other crimes"". His Honour also considered, for reasons which he explained, that the fact that the applicant had been the victim of sexual abuse as a child was a further mitigating factor. His Honour finally concluded that the applicant's likelihood of re-offending was low and that accordingly, his prospects of rehabilitation were good. 

15His Honour then indicated the process of reasoning by which he arrived at the sentence which he imposed in respect of count 1. His Honour said: 

As I have said the maximum penalty is twenty years imprisonment. Statistics available from the Judicial Commission indicate that the median head sentence for all offenders is six years imprisonment, and the eighty per cent range is between nine years imprisonment and two years imprisonment. Of the twenty-three cases, eleven are non-consecutive sentences and all involved a plea of guilty. After the necessary discount following a plea of guilty, the median head sentence is four years and six months imprisonment, and the median non-parole period is three years imprisonment. The top of the eighty per cent range is a period of eight years imprisonment, with a five year non-parole period. At the bottom of the eighty per cent range is two years imprisonment with a twelve month non-parole period. 

Bearing in mind the criminality involved, but bearing in mind, in particular, the matters contained on the Form 1, I believe the correct starting point for the first count in the indictment is a sentence of eight years imprisonment. The Offender is entitled to a discount for the plea of guilty. ... 

Eight years is ninety-six months. I discount that by fifteen per cent and round it off at eighty months. If the statutory nexus were preserved, that would indicate a non-parole period of sixty months with an additional term of twenty months, that is a non-parole period of five years and an additional term of one year and eight months imprisonment. However, I have already adverted to the fact that there are special circumstances. 
... 

I have determined the appropriate non-parole period is fifty months imprisonment, which is a period of four years and two months, and the additional term will be a term of two years and six months. 

16In respect of count 2, his Honour made the following findings: 

The offence of using a child under the age of fourteen for pornographic purposes is, in my view, at the bottom of the range of objective seriousness. The Crown accepts that the Offender took the photographs of the victim's vagina for his own use and that there was no intention, let alone any attempt, to disseminate the images as is often the position where child pornography is involved. However, the Crown contends that the offence of using a child for pornographic purposes represents a discrete aspect of criminality and that it is appropriate to accumulate the sentences for the two counts on the indictment to some degree. I accede to that submission as well. 

The Offender could have committed the offences of sexual intercourse with a child under fourteen years and aggravated indecent assault without photographing anything. The photographing of the body of the victim after the event is, in my view, not part of the same criminal activity, albeit that the two are temporally close. 

Although the offence against s 91G(1)(a) is at the bottom of the range of objective seriousness, I again note that this was not merely photographing of the victim's genitals but intrusive photographing of the victim's genitals, the Offender using his fingers to display, amongst other things, the interior of the victim's vagina. For example, image numbered 8 is a close up photograph of the vagina of the victim with the Offender using his thumb and index finger to hold the vagina opening showing the vaginal canal. There are other close up photographs involving not only the vagina, but also the anus and, on a number of them, the fingers of the Offender opening up the vagina can be seen. The offending is more serious than merely taking photographs of a naked child. 


17The applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 

1 That the learned sentence judge erred in that he double counted the Applicant's criminality in the s. 66M(1) [sic] Crimes Act offence on the Form 1 to increase the period of imprisonment for count 1 whilst also having regard to the same conduct in assessing the seriousness of the criminality for count 2, thereby increasing the period of imprisonment for that count; 

2 That the learned sentencing judge erred in that he double counted the Applicant's criminality in the s. 91H(2) Crimes Act offence on the Form 1 to increase the period of imprisonment for count 1, whilst also imposing a separate and partly-cumulated sentence for count 2 in circumstances where there was a significant commonality between the criminality and elements in count 2 and the offence on the Form 1; and 

3 That the learned sentencing judge erred in failing to have regard to or apply the principle of totality, in particular: 

a That the cumulation of 12 months for counts 1 and 2 was excessive in the circumstances of this case, where the offending of the 2 counts were so temporally close and similar as to be considered one episode of offending, particularly where certain offences on the Form 1 to count 1 related to the conduct in count 2; 

b The matters raised in grounds 1 and 2, above. 

4 The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive, and a lesser sentence is warranted in law. 

Grounds 1 and 2 

18It can be seen immediately that the grounds of appeal are interconnected. Moreover, at the hearing of the application, counsel for the applicant refined the submission in relation to Ground 3. The complaint was limited to a contention that the accumulation of a period of 12 months was excessive, it being accepted that his Honour had indeed had regard to the principle of totality. See generally R v MAK (2006) 167 A Crim R 159; Cahyadi v R (2007) 168 A Crim R 41; R x XX (2009) 195 A Crim R 38. 

19The core of the applicant's submission was that the sentencing judge engaged in a process of ""double counting"" in that ""2 of the 3 matters placed on the Form 1 were directly related to or within the criminality of the second count, yet were to be taken into account in the sentencing of (sic) the first count."" This resulted, so it was submitted, in the imposition of sentences which, in their overall effect, were manifestly excessive. 

20Accordingly, it was contended that the sentencing judge had fallen into error of the kind identified in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. The offender in that case had been charged with an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do so and also with an offence of breaking and entering a dwelling house and whilst therein inflicting grievous bodily harm. In a joint judgment, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ, said: 

To the extent to which two offences of which an offender stands 
convicted contain common elements, it would be wrong to punish that offender twice for the commission of the elements that are common. No doubt that general principle must yield to any contrary legislative intention, but the punishment to be exacted should reflect what an offender has done; it should not be affected by the way in which the boundaries of particular offences are drawn. Often those boundaries will be drawn in a way that means that offences overlap. To punish an offender twice if conduct falls in that area of overlap would be to punish offenders according to the accidents of legislative history, rather than according to their just deserts. 
... 

It is clear in this case that a single act (the appellant's inflicting 
grievous bodily harm on his victim) was an element of each of the 
offences under ss 33 and 110. The identification of a single act as 
common to two offences may not always be as straightforward. It 
should, however, be emphasised that the inquiry is not to be attended by ""excessive subtleties and refinements"" . It should be approached as a matter of common sense, not as a matter of semantics. 

The trial judge sentenced the appellant to identical terms of 
imprisonment on counts 9 and 10 and made those sentences wholly concurrent. We can only conclude that the sentence on each of those counts contained a portion which was to punish the appellant for his inflicting grievous bodily harm on his victim. Prima facie, then, he was doubly punished for the one act. 
... 

Looked at overall, it may well be said that the effect of the 
sentences imposed on this appellant was not disproportionate to the criminality of his conduct. Nevertheless, we consider that the 
individual sentences imposed on counts 9 and 10 were flawed because they doubly punished the appellant for a single act, namely, the infliction of grievous bodily harm. Further, to make the sentences imposed on those two counts wholly concurrent may also be said to reveal error in that to do so failed to take account of the differences in the conduct which were the subject of punishment on each count. [at paras 40, 42, 43, 49] 

21In R v Dudko (2002) 132 A Crim R 371, Spigelman CJ, with whom the other members of the court agreed, posited the test in terms of whether the ""gist or gravamen of the criminal behaviour"" was the same in the two offences. See also Della-Vedova v R [2009] NSWCCA 107. 

22As a matter of principle, there does not appear to be any difference between the circumstances that prevailed in Pearce , in which the two matters containing the common elements were both on the indictment, and the present case in which the offences in question involved one count on the indictment and two matters on the Form 1 document. Indeed, unlike Pearce , the present sentences were not only partially accumulated but, in respect of count 1, also took into account the Form 1 matters. His Honour did not, and nor of course was he required, to disclose the increment in the sentence which he decided was necessary to reflect the additional criminality. Nevertheless, I am inclined to proceed upon the basis that the increase was not insubstantial. That is because his Honour said that the ""starting-point"" in relation to count 1, before allowing for the discount for the plea of guilty but after taking into account the Form 1 matters, was 8 years. That was in relation to an offence that his Honour had already characterised as being ""at the bottom of mid range of objective seriousness for an offence of this nature"". 

23Although at times during the course of oral argument, there was reference to the fact that the matters on the Form 1 may arguably have been duplicitous, ultimately no submission to that effect was pressed. In the final analysis, counsel was content to proceed upon the basis which I have identified. 

24In any event, the combination of the matters which appeared on the Form 1 document required that there be a meaningful increase in the sentence to be imposed in respect of count 1. Counsel for the applicant did not contend otherwise. The main reason why such an increase was called for was because the first matter on the Form 1 document, namely the digital penetration of SW by the applicant was a most serious offence which, of itself, required a not insignificant increase in the sentence for count 1. Indeed, as counsel for the applicant conceded, it could easily have been the subject of a separate count in the indictment. As it happens, the court was informed that that offence, together with the other two Form 1 matters, had originally been the subject of separate counts before agreement was reached between the parties that the matter should proceed in the manner in which it did. 

25Also to be taken into account was the final matter on the Form 1, namely the aggravated indecent assault. That offence arose from the applicant's conduct in using his fingers to display the interior of SW's vagina. As I indicated, his Honour concluded that that offence was committed ""without photographing anything"" and that ""the photographing of the body of the victim after the event is ... not part of the same criminal activity, albeit that the two are temporally close"". The applicant's conduct consisted of the actions, which constituted the aggravated sexual assault, as well as his actions in photographing, at the same time, those acts. In short, the applicant simultaneously committed two offences. The applicant does not complain that his Honour erred in arriving at that conclusion. The complaint is not that the offence appeared on the Form 1 document, but that the same conduct was then relied upon by his Honour in determining the objective gravity of the second count. In written submissions, counsel for the applicant developed the argument in the following fashion: 

When considering the objective seriousness of the second count, [his Honour] said that although it was at the bottom of the range of objective seriousness, it is essentially aggravated by the offender's use of his fingers to display the interior of the complainant's vagina. The use of the offender's fingers in the complainant's vagina in taking the photographs was the very subject of the ... offence on the Form 1 already taken into account to increase the length of the sentence for count 1. In so doing, his Honour has inadvertently ""double counted"" that factor to increase the sentence ultimately imposed on the Applicant. ... 

26His Honour concluded, as I have observed, that count 2 lay ""at the bottom of the range of objective seriousness"". The imposition of a total term of 2 years imprisonment for this offence, as against the maximum penalty of 14 years, appears to reflect his Honour's view. However, his Honour's reference to the intrusive nature of some of the photographs, and particularly those in which the applicant use his fingers to splay open the vaginal canal, certainly suggests that that conduct served, at least to some extent, to increase the seriousness of the offence. That appears to be implicit in his Honour's remark that ""the offending is more serious than merely taking photographs of a naked child"". Allowing for the fact that the explicit nature of the photographs needed to be taken into account in assessing the criminality in respect of count 2, it does appear nevertheless that there has been an element of ""double punishment"" in the sense in which that expression was employed in Pearce (supra). 

27The remaining matter on the Form 1 document was the offence of producing child pornography. The Court Attendance Notice described the offence as being one of ""produce a pornographic image of the complainant's vagina"" (emphasis added). The facts make it clear however that the offence relates to 23 photographs in all. As I have said, the conduct which gave rise to count 2 was constituted by the applicant's actions in taking the photographs of SW's vagina. That, it was submitted, mirrored conduct which was contemplated by the Form 1 offence of producing child pornography. 


28In a submission which was received after judgment was reserved, the Crown appears to effectively concede the point. It was pointed out that a more appropriate charge may have been ""possess child pornography"". Although I accept that this was the least serious of the three matters which appeared on the Form 1 document, nevertheless, I am once again of the view that this matter falls within the principles identified in Pearce (supra). 

29In due course, I will return to consider the consequence of the conclusions at which I have arrived. 

Ground 3 

30The submission ultimately advanced by counsel for the applicant, in respect of this ground, was that although the ""offending encapsulated a 'single episode of criminality'"" some measure of accumulation between the two counts was required but that ""it should be a matter of months, and nothing as great as 12 months"". Even accepting that the offence of using a child for pornographic purposes represented, as the Crown contended, a ""discrete aspect of criminality"", it was submitted that there was still a considerable degree of overlapping between it and two of the matters on the Form 1. 

31As I have said, I am persuaded that there does appear to have been a measure of ""double counting"" particularly bearing in mind the manner in which the offences to which I have referred are inter-connected. For that reason, I am of the view that the court should intervene and proceed to re-sentence the applicant. For that purpose, I have had regard to the affidavit evidence of the applicant, his sister and his father. That material reveals that the applicant retains the support of two important members of his family and that he has been furthering his education at a tertiary level. There are other matters, the details of which it is unnecessary to record, which suggest that his time in prison is more burdensome than may otherwise be the case. 

32I would not be disposed to alter the individual sentences which were imposed. In my view, the overall circumstances can best be met by reducing the period of accumulation between counts 1 and 2 from 12 months to 6 months. 

Orders 

33I propose the following orders: 

1 Grant leave to appeal. 

2 Allow the appeal (in part). 

3 Confirm the sentences imposed in respect of counts 1 and 2. 

4 Quash the order that the sentence in respect of count 1 is to commence on 16 September 2009. In substitution therefore, order that the non-parole period of 4 years and 2 months in respect of count 1 is to commence on 16 March 2009 and is to expire on 15 May 2013 and that the balance of the term of 2 years and 6 months is to expire on 15 November 2015. 

5 The applicant is eligible for parole on 15 May 2013.

		12 August 2011",2011-08-10 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2709393,R v Hawi & ors (No 14) [2011] NSWSC 1660,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: This judgment concerns the admissibility of a police officer's informal notes written by him on the first occasion that an accomplice prosecution witness provided a version of events to police. 

2The relevant factual background is that the trial is concerned with two episodes of violent activity that occurred at the Qantas domestic terminal at Sydney airport on 22 March 2009. The Crown contends that unlawful violence, constituting an affray, occurred in the vicinity of Gate 5, and that further unlawful violence, constituting a riot, occurred minutes later in the departure hall. The latter culminated in the death of the deceased. 

3The Crown has called a witness, SP, who was responsible for some of the violent conduct in both locations. He obtained a reduced sentence after pleading guilty to affray and riot partly upon his undertaking to give evidence for the prosecution. A charge of murder was withdrawn. Both the reliability of his evidence and his general credibility are in issue. 

4The first occasion that SP spoke to police and provided a version of events was on 10 July 2009 when he spoke with Detective Sergeant James McLoughlin. That came about through the following process. SP had been arrested on 8 July 2009 and charged with affray. He was in custody at the Sydney Police Centre. Detective McLoughlin asked SP whether he would be prepared to be interviewed under caution. SP declined. Detective McLoughlin was instructed by Detective Inspector French to canvass with SP whether he would be willing to participate in an interview under an inducement that anything he said would not be used against him (except in respect of the falsity of anything he said). SP indicated that he was agreeable to this course. Detective McLoughlin, again on the instructions of Detective French, sought to obtain general details of the information that SP could provide so that a decision could be made as to whether police would proceed with an induced interview. 

5SP was taken to an interview room where Detective McLoughlin asked him whether he was prepared to assist police with the investigation. He told SP that there was a possibility that in doing so he could receive a reduced sentence. SP's response was that he was prepared to assist, but he was concerned about the safety of his family, and for his own situation in relation to his prosecution. Detective McLoughlin told SP that he was not in a position to negotiate terms of assistance, but in order for more senior police to enter into such negotiations, he would need to obtain an indication of the evidence which SP could offer to the investigation. 

6According to Detective McLoughlin, SP then outlined the evidence he could provide. SP told him what he claimed had happened, and what he had seen, before, during and after the events in the Qantas terminal. As he did so, Detective McLoughlin made notes on some A4 sheets of paper. 

7I have drawn the foregoing from the evidence of Detective McLoughlin (T2999 - 3000). 

8It is unnecessary for present purposes to relate the further course of the police dealings with SP, except to say that he subsequently engaged in three induced interviews of some length and then in what has been referred to as a ""walk through"" interview at the Qantas terminal. He was cross-examined extensively upon the contents of those interviews. Detective McLoughlin's notes of the version provided by SP on 10 July 2009 were also used in the course of the cross-examination, but to a significantly lesser extent. 

9MFI 64 comprises six pages of Detective McLoughlin's handwritten notes made on 10 July 2009. The cross-examination of SP proceeded as if counsel understood that Detective McLoughlin wrote six pages of notes while SP was speaking. Detective McLoughlin's evidence, initially, was to the same effect (T3022.40). However, during the cross-examination by Mr Driels, counsel for the accused Potrus, he came to agree with what appears to be apparent from the nature of the notes themselves. That is, that he jotted some notes during the course of the conversation and then rewrote them. This was done, partly to make the recording more legible and to put them in correct English (T3024) and, it seems to me, to amplify the recording of what he recalled SP to have told him. 

10When SP was cross-examined about what he had said to Detective McLoughlin, he was first shown the notes by Mr Stratton, senior counsel for the accused Menzies, and asked to read them (T2769). Mr Stratton then took SP to some, but by no means all, of what the notes record that he had said. Counsel for other accused subsequently cross-examined SP on the notes, particularly Mr Trevallion, counsel for the accused Abounader, Mr Young, senior counsel for the accused Eken, and Mr Driels. 

11On 1 August 2011, Mr Stratton tendered the notes during his subsequent cross-examination of Detective McLoughlin (T3017). The Crown Prosecutor indicated that she wished to consider the Crown's position on the subject. The question of admissibility was deferred. 

12At the conclusion of proceedings on that day, there was a brief discussion on the topic. I indicated that I understood that the conversation between SP and Detective McLoughlin was made relevant in the course of the cross-examination of SP in two ways. One was that it contained prior inconsistent statements and was thus relevant to his credibility. Upon reflection, it is more correct to say that the cross-examination upon the notes that was relevant to SP's credibility was directed to things that were included in his evidence in the trial but that he had not told Detective McLoughlin (e.g. T2771.10; T2851.44 - 2852.4). The other way in which the conversation appeared relevant was that it contained material favourable to at least one of the accused, Mr Eken, from which SP's memory could be prompted to recall (see T2880). I queried how the notes were otherwise relevant, it being apparent that SP had not been cross-examined upon the entirety of them. 

13Mr Stratton indicated that the notes were relevant in that they contradicted SP's assertion that the version he gave to Detective McLoughlin was ""just a rough outline"" (T3034.39). His submission was that the notes indicated that ""it's actually quite a detailed account and also it puts into context matters which we say relate to the accused Menzies"" (T3034.40). He cited, as an example of the latter, the note: 

""Touza (Christian) [accepted to be a reference to the accused Menzies] punched him down, he fell down and that one got finished off by someone else."" 

14Mr Stratton submitted that this could only be understood as referring to the deceased when seen in the context of the notes in their entirety. However, as Mr Stratton then conceded, it was clear from the evidence that SP gave that the ""he"" who ""fell down and ... got finished off by someone else"" was a reference to the deceased (see, for example, T2770.40 - T2771.22; T2851.37, bearing in mind that it was SP's evidence that the accused Abounader, in effect, stabbed the deceased when he was lying on the ground). 

15Also in the course of the discussion on 1 August 2011, Mr Trevallion indicated that he supported the admission of the notes as an exhibit, submitting: 

""[M]y client's name is mentioned at least twice in those notes, but when it comes to mentioning a person who finished off Anthony Zervas it refers to ... ""someone"" and doesn't use the name. I cross-examined [SP] in respect to that, but I haven't got into evidence either through him or through the last witness [Sgt McLoughlin] that [SP] did otherwise mention my client's name, that would be relevant. If they are not to be tendered I would seek to have Mr McLoughlin recalled or to have that evidence adduced another way."" (T3035.10) 

16The problem with that submission is that Mr Trevallion's cross-examination of SP involved him asserting, and SP accepting (having read the notes during Mr Stratton's cross-examination the previous day but not having them in front of him at the time of Mr Trevallion's cross-examination), that there was no mention in the notes at all of Mr Abounader (T2851). 

17The matter was revisited on 3 August 2011 (T3203 - 3205). The Crown was in a position to indicate that it objected to the notes being admitted. The Crown Prosecutor's submissions were, in brief, that the notes were not SP's document; he had not adopted them apart from those portions to which his attention had been specifically directed; those statements which he had adopted were already in evidence, in the oral testimony recorded in the transcript of the trial; and that it would be unfair for SP's credibility to be impugned upon the basis of the unadopted portions of the notes. 

18In relation to those submissions, the Crown Prosecutor referred to SP's evidence immediately after the notes were first shown to him and he was allowed the opportunity to read them: 

""Q. The first pages of that which are all in McLoughlin's handwriting on blank paper, do they accurately record what you said to Sergeant McLoughlin? 
A. Yes, like I can't remember all of that but I remember he was writing things down."" (T2769.49) 

19It was submitted that in the light of this, there was no way of knowing what parts of the notes SP actually adopted, aside from those portions which were specifically put to him. 

20Mr Stratton's submissions on 3 August 2011 were these (T3203 - 3204): 


The passage of evidence relied upon by the Crown (quoted above) made the evidence admissible under s 43 of the Evidence Act 1995. There was a prior statement which the witness had not admitted making and consequently Mr Stratton was entitled to prove it. 

SP was given the opportunity to adopt the notes as comprising his prior statements, but he said that he could not remember ""all of it"" and so he had not adopted them. 

The significance of the notes was that they provide a context to the particular passages upon which Mr Stratton relied. 

The only inconsistent statement recorded in the notes was ""the boys were downstairs"". Mr Stratton then said that ""the main inconsistency that I rely on is 'Touza punched him down, he fell down and someone else finished him off'. That's in effect the prior inconsistent statement that I'm seeking to prove"". 

The strength of the ""proof of the inconsistency is [enhanced] ... by being in the context of a complete account which he gives of the incident"" (T3204.13). 

21Upon inquiry as to whether it had been put to SP that the version given to Detective McLoughlin was a ""complete account"", Mr Stratton referred to the following evidence: 

""Q. Did you tell Sergeant McLoughlin the truth? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did you leave anything important out? 
A. I left like a few things out, yes. 

Q. What did you leave out? 
A. Like just more details of how things were."" (T2770) 

22Finally, Mr Stratton submitted that in the event that I was to rule against him on the s 43 point, the evidence was ""a representation made by an available witness so it's admissible under section 66"" (T3204.40). 

23First, to deal with the submission that the notes of the version provided to Detective McLoughlin are admissible pursuant to s 43. That provision is concerned with prior inconsistent statements of a witness. Subsection 2 provides: 

""(2) If, in cross-examination, a witness does not admit that he or she has made a prior inconsistent statement , the cross-examiner is not to adduce evidence of the statement otherwise than from the witness unless, in the cross-examination, the cross-examiner: 

(a) informed the witness of enough of the circumstances of the making of the statement to enable the witness to identify the statement, and 

(b) drew the witness's attention to so much of the statement as is inconsistent with the witness's evidence."" (Emphasis added) 

24The prior inconsistent statements asserted in Mr Stratton's submissions were admitted by SP. Accordingly, s 43(2) does not warrant admission of the evidence. 

25The tender of the notes is sought, clearly, to impugn the credibility of SP. Evidence relevant to the credibility of a witness is admissible if it ""could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness"": s 103(1). In the context of all of the attack upon the credibility of SP, the present issue is very minor. The contention that the notes contradict SP's assertion that he gave Detective McLoughlin ""just a rough outline"" is not contradicted, but in fact supported, by the notes. By comparison with the hours and hours of subsequent interviews in which SP was asked thousands of questions, the notes indicate that ""a rough outline"" is an apt description. It is pertinent to note that it was Mr Stratton who described the version given to Detective McLoughlin as an ""outline"": 

""Q. And at that stage, although you weren't prepared to go in front of a camera, if I could put it that way, you gave police an outline of what evidence you could give? 
A. Yes"" (T2769.24) 

26It is apparent that the focus of that question was not upon the extent to which the version given to Detective McLoughlin represented ""an outline"". There was no other questioning by Mr Stratton that was concerned with the extent to which it was ""an outline"". Moreover, it was not suggested to him, and he did not assert himself, that the version was ""a rough outline"". 

27Mr Driels included reference in his questions to the version being ""a brief outline"" (T2892). However, as with Mr Stratton's cross-examination, there was no questioning concerned with the extent to which it was an outline. 

28Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the tender of the notes would serve to contradict an assertion by SP, that any counsel disputed, that the version provided by SP on 10 July 2009 was other than an ""outline"". 

29SP readily agreed that he left out details in what he told Detective McLoughlin. His responses in cross-examination included: ""I left like a few things out"" (T2770.18). When asked what he had left out he said, ""[l]ike just more details of how things were ... [d]etails of how the events went down, who was involved in a lot of the events"" (T2770.21 - 25). By comparison with what he subsequently told police, and has said in evidence, the notes bear that out. SP's ready agreement that he did not tell Detective McLoughlin certain matters concerning Mr Abounader (T2851 - 2852) also bears that out. 

30In my view, there is no occasion for contradiction of the evidence of SP by showing that the notes represent more than ""an outline"" or a ""brief outline"", let alone a ""rough outline"". It simply was not an issue that was the subject of cross-examination. 

31If it was necessary for the jury to understand the portions of the notes that had been put to SP in cross-examination, in the context of the notes in their entirety, it was perfectly open to counsel to pursue such a course in that cross-examination. I can only assume that because that was not done, it was not, at least at that time, felt necessary. Nothing has been put to me that persuades me that there is anything that was referred to in the course of the cross-examination that cannot be understood by the jury without them having the notes before them. 

32It was clear that SP's evidence was that there were matters that he had subsequently told police, and subsequently said in evidence, that were not part of what he had told Detective McLoughlin. To now assert, by reference to the notes, that the account SP gave was more than an ""outline"", and that for this reason there should be an adverse view taken of his credibility, without SP having had the opportunity to comment on the proposition, has an unfairness about it. 

33As was previously indicated, Mr Stratton's alternative submission was that the notes were admissible pursuant to s 66 of the Evidence Act which, relevantly, is in these terms: 

""66 Exception: criminal proceedings if maker available 

(1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is available to give evidence about an asserted fact. 

(2) If that person has been or is to be called to give evidence, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of the representation that is given by: 

(a) that person, or 

(b) a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, 

if, when the representation was made, the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of the person who made the representation."" 

34It may well be that the evidence is admissible by application of this provision. However, an antecedent question is relevance: Evidence Act ss 55 & 56. The only matter to which the evidence could be relevant is the credibility of SP. For the various reasons I have given above, I am not satisfied that it could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of SP. 

35My conclusion, announced on 4 August 2011, was that the notes made by Detective McLoughlin of what SP told him on 10 July 2011 are not admissible.

		10 February 2012",2011-08-03 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709398,R v Paul JAMES [2011] NSWDC 164,"Judgment 

1. Mr T Phelan of counsel who appears for the accused has applied to discharge one of the jurors. 

2. His client is charged with a series of child pornography offences. 

3. The basis of his application is something that occurred this morning. When one of the exhibits was being discussed, a juror became obviously upset. She asked for tissues and it was apparent that she was crying. I asked her whether she wanted a break and she said no. The trial carried on. 

4. I discussed the matter after the jury retired. It is common ground that the juror might have been upset for reasons completely unconnected with the trial, but it is fair to say that most of us think that the likelihood is that she was upset because of the subject matter of the exhibit. 

5. There were no photographs in the exhibit, but it gave a description of the kinds of child pornography on particular files by reference to an ' Oliver scale' which had terms such as "" Penetrative "" and "" Bestiality "". Other descriptions were less objective and were the titles of the files but made reference to children engaged in sexual activity in enticing terms. 

6. Mr Phelan argues that his and his client's observation was that the particular juror, between morning tea and lunch, did not observe the exhibits during the course of the evidence. His concern is that the juror will be distracted by the emotion involved in what we all regard as the likely reaction to the evidence and will not give objective and fair consideration to the evidence so that his client may not get a fair trial. 

7. Mr B Neild of counsel who appears for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecution opposes the application. He points out that because it is a Commonwealth prosecution a jury of twelve is needed, so that in effect Mr Phelan's application is for a discharge of the whole jury. He argued that there was at this stage insufficient indication that the juror was unable to sit on in the trial. He suggested that any issue about the emotional distraction by the subject matter of the charges could be addressed by a direction now and a direction during the summing-up, rather than the extreme course of discharging the juror. The direction should refer to the need for a dispassionate analysis of the evidence. 

8. Both counsel fairly acknowledge that, of course, our observations are fairly speculative. 

9. I have decided not to discharge the juror. A discharge of a juror should be regarded as, in my opinion, a remedy of last resort, particularly when it might involve the effective discharge of the jury. 

10. I would make these observations about what has happened. Both counsel have acknowledged the hardly surprising proposition that the subject matter of the trial, namely child pornography, is something that almost all members of the community would regard as repulsive. That does not mean in my opinion that jurors cannot be objective. Nor does it mean that other jurors may not be affected in the same way. It may be that the juror who broke into tears, assuming that that was precipitated by the trial, was someone who more readily expresses her emotions physically than others. It may be that there are others who have similar reactions. Once again I observe that that is hardly surprising. 

11. Judges, magistrates and jurors are required to put aside their personal views and emotions when dealing with any criminal matter. This is especially important when the subject matter is offensive. 

12. I am inclined to accept Mr Nield's submission that the fact that the juror was observed not to be looking at exhibits is neither here nor there. It may well be that the juror elected not to look at them in court in order to avoid breaking out into tears publicly. It may be that she looks at the exhibits in the privacy of the jury room where she can talk. 

13. In my opinion this predicament is one which can be dealt with by a reminder both now and during the summing-up of the jury's responsibility to be objective and dispassionate in their consideration of the case. I do not think it requires a discharge of this juror. I am not convinced that the juror will not give fair consideration to the evidence. Judges must bear in mind, as the High Court has observed, that jurors are assumed to follow the directions given by a judge. 

14. For those reasons I reject the application.

		27 October 2011",2011-08-03 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709400,R v Mohammad RAHMAN [2011] NSWDC 101,"SENTENCE 

1. Patients have to trust doctors and most do. Patients feel obliged for their own good to comply with a doctor's requests. Most patients would understandably feel that it is against their own interests to refuse to cooperate with a physical examination. Accordingly patients will generally permit a doctor to handle them physically, and in private, in ways which they would permit either no one else or only those with whom they choose to be physically intimate. Oftentimes patients have to permit a doctor who is a total stranger to be physically intrusive. They may not have a regular doctor or that doctor may not be available. 

2. On the other hand doctors, like all of us, have sexual desires and attractions. It follows that a vital part of a doctor's professional practice is not to let such desires or feelings intrude into their relations with patients. It is equally important that patients know that a doctor will not let that happen. 

3. Here we return to trust. A patient trusts a doctor - indeed has to for their own wellbeing - not to let the doctor's personal sexual side have anything to do with the doctor's dealings with the patient. 

4. In this case Mohammad Rahman, who was a doctor, very seriously abused that trust which seventeen patients placed in him when they attended his surgery for treatment. Mohammad Rahman violated the trust which I have referred to. It was not a lapse which occurred on one occasion in a moment of weakness. Mohammad Rahman violated no fewer than seventeen of his female patients over one period of six months. One of the patients was a fourteen year old girl in her school uniform. Another was a mother and he violated her in the presence of her foster children. 

5. This sustained criminal conduct has brought about twenty-two charges of indecent assault and one charge of aggravated indecent assault. Indecent assault is an offence against s 61L of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament has fixed a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment to the crime of indecent assault. I need to sentence Dr Rahman to twenty-two sentences for the crime of indecent assault. Aggravated indecent assault is made a crime by s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act . Parliament regards that crime as so serious that it has fixed a maximum of ten years imprisonment to that crime. Not only that but Parliament has taken the further step of attaching to that crime a standard non-parole period of eight years imprisonment. 

6. In respect of three of the victims I have been asked by Dr Rahman 
and the prosecution to take into account additional offences which are listed on a form which has been provided to me under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I will take those additional charges into account in due course and I sign the forms to that effect. 

7. It is important for a judge in sentencing anyone to provide a brief description of the criminal behaviour which brought about the charges which the judge is sentencing the offender for. 

8. In this case Dr Rahman was a medical practitioner who practised at the Dapto Medical Centre. He had been there from July or August 2009. Each of the victims, to whom I will refer in a moment, was a patient of that Dapto Medical Centre at the time of the respective offences. The offences occurred over the period 11 September 2009 to 12 March 2010, as I said some six months. 

9. Dr Rahman was arrested on 17 March 2010 and was bailed. Last Friday 22 July 2011, when I took evidence and heard submissions about these matters bail was not applied and refused so that Dr Rahman has been in custody since last Friday, 22 July 2011, and his overall sentence will commence from that date. 
 
10. As I said I need to give a brief description of what occurred to bring about these charges. I had thought of doing that in a global way because much of the behaviour of Dr Rahman was common to some of the patients but I have now decided to make brief reference to each patient because each patient was separately violated and each patient's circumstances varied from the others in significant or minor respects. 

11. I do not propose to name of any of the patients and it is important for those in court to know that, if there is any reference to any name, the names of these victims of Dr Rahman's sexual crimes are not to be published outside this court room. Indeed it is an offence to do so. 

12. The victims of the offences are referred to in exhibit A in a document called the Agreed Facts which is signed by Dr Rahman and by the representative of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and they are referred to as victim 1 through to victim 17 and I will use those numbers in describing what happened to each of the victims. I use the numbers in order to avoid undue publicity which might identify each or any of the victims. 

13. Victim 1 was seventeen. She visited Dr Rahman on 17 February 2010. Dr Rahman told her that he wanted to check her heart and do a breast examination. He felt her breasts outside of her clothes but he told her to come back for another test and that she should see him and no other doctor. She returned a couple of weeks later. Dr Rahman examined her breasts using the palm of his hand in a circular motion one at a time. He asked her personal questions including whether she had a boyfriend and told her that the best time to check breasts was after having sex. He squeezed her breasts with two fingers and his thumb. He asked questions about the status of the relationship with her boyfriend. He watched her put her bra on and shirt and told her to sit down. He enquired about her single friends. She became scared and confused. This was the very first breast examination which she had. The breast examination was done on the pretext of checking iron levels. I say that because Dr Rahman mentioned that and the evidence in exhibit A includes a report from a specialist medical practitioner, Dr Rosemary Isaacs, who says that there is no link between low iron levels and a breast examination. The Agreed Facts record that the examination was carried out for Dr Rahman's own personal gratification. As a result of that behaviour over two days, Dr Rahman was charged with two indecent assaults. The first charge - number 24 - I will sentence him for. The other - charge 47 - is one of the additional offences which I take into account in imposing the sentence in respect of victim 1. 

14. Victim 2 was eighteen when she visited Dr Rahman on 8 March 2010. He again placed his hands on each breast and squeezed them. He asked questions about her relationship with her boyfriend and any sexual relations she may or may not have with him. He then observed that he could feel "" a bit of a lump on the left side "". He then said that he had to warm up the patient's breasts to get a better feel of the lump. He then asked the victim to put her arms behind her head and he pushed down. He asked her about any family history of breast cancer. He put his hand on her leg. The victim was scared and phoned her boyfriend. A doctor who later examined the same victim did not identify anything unusual when that doctor conducted a breast examination. As the facts record, that was carried out for Dr Rahman's own sexual gratification. That victim, number 2, as well as victim 1, have provided a victim impact statement which I will refer to in due course. That behaviour with victim 2 gave rise to one charge of indecent assault which became charge 25. The length of the consultation was some twenty-five minutes. 

15. Victim 3 also provided a victim impact statement. She attended Dr Rahman on 8 March 2010. All she wanted was to get a referral for a specialist appointment. She was thirty-seven. Dr Rahman in her case rubbed her waist and, as the facts recorded, "" whilst doing so moaned and said, 'Nice, nice' "". He slowly moved his hands up towards her breasts and rubbed them on the outside of her shirt for about twenty seconds. He was making moaning noises. That behaviour resulted in an indecent assault charge as I said. 

16. Victim 4 saw Dr Rahman on 23 February 2010 with rash or bites on the skin beneath her breasts. She was twenty one. Dr Rahman used his hand to massage her breasts. This took about five minutes. The medical specialist evidence is that a usual standard breast examination will take about two minutes. He did not wear gloves. He touched the victim's breasts with his fingertips. He was then talking to her and whilst gesturing with his hands his fingers were touching his breasts. He said to her, "" You shouldn't wear a bra unless you are going to a party "". During this he was acting as though he was conducting a normal breast examination. 

17. Victim 5 saw Dr Rahman on 15 February 2010. She was twenty-three. She had sustained an injury in some form of exercise . Dr Rahman did not tell her that he would examine her breasts. He touched her stomach from every angle and then touched her breasts. The examination lasted for about a minute. The victim felt very uncomfortable. He rubbed her nipple and cupped her breast with his fingers. He also asked personal questions. He rubbed her nipple for about one or two minutes. She returned two days later and on this occasion Dr Rahman pulled her t-shirt down and put his hand directly onto her breast beneath her bra and massaged it. He pulled her other breast out and did the same. This lasted about two minutes. He started to stare at her breasts. The facts record that the "" victim was of the view that he was being sexual, and obtaining sexual gratification due to his facial expression "". Understandably she felt very uncomfortable. This behaviour resulted in two charges, numbers 28 and 29, of indecent assault. 

18. Victim 6 saw Dr Rahman on 22 February 2010. She was aged eighteen. She complained of a urinary tract infection. He asked her about pap smears and breast examinations. That victim told Dr Rahman that she had never had either. He then made enquiries about whether or not she had engaged in sexual activity. He then began to firmly massage and squeeze her left breast. He did this for about five minutes and then repeated the process on the right breast and for a further five minutes moved his hands over both breasts. The victim never had a breast examination, as I have said, so was not aware of the normal procedure. Dr Rahman then arranged for a female nurse to come in whilst he conducted a pap smear. The nurse stayed outside of the curtain where the procedure was being conducted. When Dr Rahman placed lubricant on the victim's vagina he also put lubricant on her clitoris and rubbed it up and down once. The victim thought this was not correct procedure but "" did not say anything as she was a doctor and she was not completely sure as she had never had a pap smear "". This is an obvious example amongst many of a very serious violation of trust. That behaviour lead to a charge, which is number 30, of indecent assault and an additional charge of indecent assault, number 49, which I will take into account when sentencing Dr Rahman on charge 30. 

19. The victim returned to see Dr Rahman about a couple of days later. She had received a phone call to come in and discuss some test results. She was discussing with Dr Rahman a particular area of interest that she was studying. He asked her about that and engaged her in conversation asking whether she could help him in that particular area of study and activity. He made reference to an ultrasound. The victim was not sure why she needed one. Dr Rahman said it was "" for the lump he found in her left breast "". Dr Rahman had not previously advised her of that and understandably that victim became upset and scared. He then proceeded to use his thumb and forefinger to squeeze her left breast and pinch it and indicate where the lump was. Dr Rahman picked up her bra and threw it onto the desk. The facts then go on to record that the victim was "" completely topless, and was worried because people outside could see her as the blind was open and she could see people. She folded her arms to hide her breasts, however the offender told her to put her hands by her side. She did so as the offender was a doctor and she trusted him, however felt uncomfortable "". He also made reference to and asked questions about her personal life and any sexual activity in her life. He hugged her before she left. The ultrasound did not detect any problems in her breast. 

20. That victim returned again some days later to get the results of her pap smear and ultrasound. Dr Rahman told her there were a few dark spots in the ultrasound which made it hard to see if anything was there. He said he needed to conduct a further examination to check for lumps. Again he undertook a breast examination to look for lumps and, as the facts record, "" a third breast examination to look for lumps in such a short period of time would have offered nothing further from a medical perspective "". Understandably that victim was afraid that she may have cancer. That behaviour over those two days lead to two charges of indecent assault, one being charge 31, the other being charge 48. Charge 48 I will take into account as an additional charge when I am sentencing Dr Rahman. 

21. I should add if I have not that all of those additional charges, there are four in total, Dr Rahman has indicated he will plead guilty to. I should also have added that victims 3 and 5 have provided impact statements as well. 

22. Victim 7, who provided a victim impact statement, saw Dr Rahman on 10 March 2010. She was twenty and had been attending that particular practice since she was about five years old. Dr Rahman shook her hand, asked her to call him Mohammed and then pulled on her to move himself closer to her. He was sitting on a chair. He examined her on the consultation bed and was examining her stomach when he unzipped her pants without warning and pulled them down to the top of her thighs. He pushed down his fingers in her pelvis region and at the same time asked if she was married. That victim could feel the offender's crotch rubbing on her arm. She could also feel him constantly pushing his penis against her waist. He repeated, "" Come closer, come closer "". He continued to push in her pelvic region and moved his hand around toward her pelvic bone and vulva. He continued down to her vagina and pushed against that. When that victim got dressed and they were sitting down Dr Rahman grabbed her thigh and pulled her towards him, between his legs, once again saying, "" Come closer, come closer "". He put his hand on her top near her waist. It moved to the bottom of her bra and he put his hand under her bra and pushed her left breast. He then did the same with her right bra. The victim understandably felt violated and angry, embarrassed and is reluctant to see another doctor. The facts record that there was "" no medical reason for the offender to have had any contact with the inside or outside of the victim's underpants, or contact with her breasts "". That behaviour resulted in two charges of indecent assault, charges 32 and 33. 

23. Victim 8 saw Dr Rahman for a swollen ankles. She was thirty years old. Again he asked her personal questions. He asked her whether she was sexually active. This victim indicated that she had suffered a panic attack a few days before. She needed a referral to a female psychologist. What Dr Rahman then did is to roll his chair towards her and placed a knee on either side of her leg. He came so close that his face was right in front of hers. He lifted her skirt up to her knees and ran his hands up and down each leg checking on swelling. He put his hand inside her bra and felt her breasts. He started pressing around her stomach asking if she had pain anywhere. He stroked both sides of her face with his hand and asked that she should come back. This, I repeat, was after she attended him with a complaint of swollen ankles and asking for a referral. At one stage she felt trapped against the wall. That behaviour resulted in charge 34 of indecent assault. 

24. Victim 9 saw Dr Rahman in early March 2010 with cracked lips. She had her foster children with her. They were aged three and four. She was thirty-three. He touched her lips with his bare hands and told her that he thought she had an infection and asked her to return in a week. A week later, on 9 March 2010, that victim attended again also with her foster daughters. Dr Rahman stood between her and her daughters. He pushed at her stomach and made reference to her stomach being hard and asked her whether she went to the gym. He referred to her body being "" so hard "". The victim was shocked. She tried to push him away. Dr Rahman moved his hand to her lower stomach above her pubic bone. This took a minute or so more. He put his hand under her breast and squeezed it and did the same with the other breast. Understandably the victim's main priority as to "" get the girls away from him and out the room "". All of that behaviour resulted in an indecent assault charge which is charge 35. That victim has also provided a victim impact statement. 

25. Victim 10 was the fourteen year old school girl who came to see Dr Rahman on 8 March 2010 with her mother. There was some problem with her hips. Dr Rahman extraordinarily asked her whether she was sexually active and, as the victim said, "" she could not understand why "" he would ask such a question. He told her to lie on the bed. Dr Rahman then stood between her and her mother and told her to pull up her dress. He began to check her pelvis, hips and legs. He pushed her vulva/vagina area four or five times above her underwear. The facts record that this "" process took 15 to 20 minutes "". He was also grabbing her leg and thigh. That examination which I have just described gave rise to a charge of aggravated indecent assault which I will take into account when sentencing him for another charge with the same victim, that was called charge 50. The other charge, number 36, occurred during the same consultation when Dr Rahman told this fourteen year old school girl to take her bra off which she did. He checked her glands and her breasts. This process continued "" for approximately 10 minutes "". He squeezed and rubbed her breasts with his hands. Understandably she felt very uncomfortable. He said to her he could feel a lump. At no stage did Dr Rahman tell her why he was examining her breasts. Once again I observe that she had presented with a complaint of clicking in her hips. There was, as the facts record, "" no medical reason for the offender to have conducted a breast examination "". It is "" not standard procedure to check the breasts of a girl the victim's age "". A breast examination should take two minutes. And it also records that in a "" normal hip examination the doctor's hand would never come in contact with a patient's vagina "". 

26. Victim 11 was nineteen when she attended to see Dr Rahman on 2 March 2010. All she wanted was a prescription. He asked her about a pap smear and breast examination and that victim told him she had had neither. She declined twice. When she asked why he said that he should check for lumps, she then agreed. She laid down on the bed. Dr Rahman told her that it was a "" lengthy process, and would take approximately 10 minutes "". That information he provided the patient is an estimate of five times the amount of time which the specialist estimated would be required for such an examination. He went and pressed her breasts and placed his hands on her nipples and held the breasts, he even punched her nipples a few times. He then asked personal questions about her and any sexual activity that she may have been engaged in and the kind of sexual activity - if she was so engaged - that she might have engaged in with her boyfriend. He continued to push her breasts and proceeded to push in and out of her pelvic region. He said he was trying to get rid of the lump. That behaviour gave rise to a charge of indecent assault. That victim dressed and Dr Rahman told her to lift her bra and top again. She felt very uncomfortable. He looked at her breasts and then touched them one at a time over a couple of minutes. He then said, "" you have good breasts "". He then said that she should come and get her pap smear done with him. That behaviour gave rise to an additional charge, number 38, of indecent assault. 

27. Victim 12 was twenty when she went to see Dr Rahman on 21 September 2009 complaining of stomach aches. Dr Rahman pulled up her top to the bottom of her breast line and pressed her stomach at the same time. He put both hands under her top onto her breasts on the outside of her bra and squeezed each breast once. That gave rise to a charge, number 39, of indecent assault. He withdrew his hands from her breasts and put his fingertips on her stomach below her navel. He pushed her stomach, slid his left hand into her pants and touched clitoris and vagina with his fingertips. He had four fingers together, he was not wearing gloves at the time. That gave rise to charge 40 of indecent assault. The victim returned to the practice a month later with a throat problem asking not to see that particular doctor. Later she was hospitalised for an unrelated matter and on being discharged asked to see a GP for a referral so she went back on 9 December to the same practice. She asked to see the first available doctor which was Dr Rahman. She said all she wanted was a referral. He put both his hands on her glands and put his hands on her side under her armpits and felt the area next to her breasts on her side. He put his hands onto the top parts of his breasts and squeezed between them his four fingers and thumb. He did not wear gloves. This procedure amounted to a further charge, number 41, of indecent assault and, if I did not say so, charge 40 was the behaviour when he on a former occasion touched her clitoris and vagina. 

28. Victim 13 was, as it happens, the first person in time to be sexually assaulted by Dr Rahman. She visited him on 11 September 2009. She was aged eighteen. She just asked for an injection. He asked whether she would like a breast examination and she agreed. He started to feel around her left breast and grabbed her breast with his whole hand and squeezed. He said that there might be something wrong because the breast was hurting because he was squeezing so hard. He said that she had a lump in her breast. He said that she should come back to have her breasts checked. He gave her his business card. That patient, like some others, "" left the surgery feeling that she may have breast cancer "". It was contrary to correct practice, the facts record, to inform a patient that there was a breast lump without doing a complete breast examination. That behaviour gave rise to charge 42 of indecent assault. 

29. Victim 14 was twenty-six when she went to see Dr Rahman on 1 March 2010. He asked her personal questions about whether or not she was married. He asked her to lift her top. Her breasts became exposed but she was wearing a bra. Dr Rahman used his hands to cup and squeeze her breasts and dug his fingers into her breasts. He asked her whether her boyfriend checked her breasts. He asked her to move closer to him. She felt violated even though she felt she should trust the doctor because he was a medical practitioner undertaking an examination. He continued to squeeze, cup and pinch her breasts for a short time. He asked her whether she had breast cancer in the family. He at one stage asked that victim to move against his abdomen. That behaviour gave rise to charge 14 of indecent assault. 

30. Victim 15, who also provided a victim impact statement, was twenty-seven when she went to see Dr Rahman on 22 December 2009. She had some abdominal pains. Dr Rahman felt the right side of her stomach but then moved his hands up to her breasts and pushed and squeezed them at the same time. His hands were on the outside of her clothes and he kept them there for a number of seconds. Understandably the victim did not know the reason for the offender touching her breasts when she had presented with stomach pain. He told her she had a urinary tract infection. That behaviour gave rise to a charge, number 44, of indecent assault and that victim provided a victim impact statement. 

31. Victim 16 presented to the medical centre on 16 February 2010 with the flu. She was twenty-four. Dr Rahman told her that he would check her heart and he asked her to stand up. He put his stethoscope on the top part of her left breast on the outside of her clothes. He said that there might be something wrong. He placed his right hand under her shirt into her bra, touched her left breast, he squeezed and cupped her breast. This continued for about five minutes. He did the same thing with her right breast. The whole procedure took about five minutes. Examining the breasts whilst the victim is standing was not a standard practice. Examining her breasts from behind was not standard practice. Examining the breasts whilst the bra is on was not standard practice and the examination should have taken less than two minutes. That behaviour gave rise to charge 45 of indecent assault. 

32. Victim 17, the last one whom Dr Rahman assaulted, presented on 17 February 2010 in the evening with trouble breathing. She was only sixteen years old. She was wearing her pyjamas. She had no bra. He lifted her top to expose her breasts and pressed on her stomach. He did not say anything to her. He placed his thumbs under her breasts and stroked them in and outwards. He moved his whole hands onto his breasts and using his whole hands squeezed her breasts a number of times. At no time did Dr Rahman listen to that victim's breathing. As the facts record the actions of squeezing or stroking the breasts as not related to the diagnosis or management of any cause of shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. 

33. It is important in recording what I have said about each of these individual sexual assaults to also note that a number of the victims have provided individual victim impact statements. I have made reference to those who did in passing. Some of them have read them out in court. Others have not. Some have had them read out by a representative in court. All victims are to be commended for their courage in reporting the violations which were perpetrated on them to the police and allowing their evidence to be provided as a basis for charges to be laid against Dr Rahman. The victims who provided victim impact statements are to be commended for putting their experiences in writing, and in particular those who read their statements out are to be commended. That is not to be critical at all of others who chose not to put their experiences in writing. There may well be a number of very good reasons for a victim not wishing to reduce their experiences to writing or to attend court. 

34. There was some discussion between me and counsel about the relevance of the victim impact statements. I invited the representative of the Crown, Ms F Sullivan, and Dr Rahman's representative, Ms J Healey, to provide additional written submissions regarding the relevance of the victim impact statements. Both did so in a timely manner and I have been assisted by their submissions, as I was indeed assisted by both of them in their submissions in court. 

35. Ms Sullivan made clear that she is not submitting that any material in the victim impact statement should form the basis of the aggravating factor referred to in s 21A(2). 

HIS HONOUR: Just remind me Ms Sullivan. 
SULLIVAN: It should be 3A, I'm sorry that was the emotional loss in respect of mitigating factor. 21A(2)(g). 


HIS HONOUR: (g) to the effect that the "" injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial "". Ms Healey made her position clear that such a finding should not be made. I agree with both of them. I will not be making such a finding. As both counsel made clear, that is not to in any way diminish the impact which this predatory sexual criminal behaviour had on any of the victims of the crime. What the victim impact statements do is graphically illustrate why Parliament in these cases chose to fix a maximum of five years imprisonment to the sort of activity which Dr Rahman engaged in. 

36. However, both counsel acknowledge that the activity by Dr Rahman constituted an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in that Dr Rahman "" abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim "". In this case the abuse was to a position of trust which is based upon the circumstances which I referred to in my introduction to these remarks on sentence. 

37. I do not propose to refer to the individual victim impact statements but I can make these observations. By far the most common impact which victims described were two. The first was a reluctance or fear to go to a doctor, either alone or at all, and consequential concerns about what would happen if they needed to see a doctor. The second was difficulty in trusting other people. 

38. Other impacts which were referred to included social withdrawal, a sense of embarrassment or shame in not realising what was happening or not putting a stop to it at the time, a fear that the victim might encounter Dr Rahman in public and strains on relationships between the victim and their partner, particularly in the areas of intimacy. In some instances a victim's sleep was affected and some victims became argumentative or angry with those around them. In one or two instances there were impacts on employment and study. I regard all of these kinds of impacts which I have described as the kinds of impact to be expected from this kind of crime. They are impacts which, I repeat, are taken into account by Parliament in fixing the sentence which it does. 

39. Two of the victims presented with particular past histories. One victim, in her victim impact statement, referred to sexual abuse which she had experienced in the past. As a result of the behaviour by Dr Rahman the impact of that sexual abuse was aggravated and in a sense reexperienced. Another victim had suffered trauma in the past because of the original country from which she had emigrated. Once again the trauma of that war was aggravated and re-experienced as a result of the offending behaviour by Dr Rahman. I do not propose to take into account those two particular descriptions of impact by way of aggravating the offence above what would be normally expected to be consequences of this behaviour but I do propose to take them into account in the sentence as a description of the kind of impact which might come about. 

40. Ms Healey argued that such impacts may not be foreseeable. Whether or not foreseeability is appropriate for me to take into account has been the subject of some authority. However, I would regard such impact as foreseeable in the sense that Dr Rahman is a medical practitioner who saw a lot of patients on a daily basis. Some of them would be immigrants from countries which had civil, political and violent disruption in the past. Others may be people with pasts which involved abusive behaviour. It would be not unusual at all to be examining people who may present with such conditions in the past. I would regard such an impact as being foreseeable, not in particular instances but given that the behaviour occurred over so many victims. 

41. In sentencing an offender something must be said about their personal circumstances. There is not much information about Dr Rahman's personal circumstances. Indeed all of the information which I have is contained either in exhibit A, which comprises the Crown papers, or in exhibit 1, a report by a psychologist, Dr Steven Dragutinovich. 

42. It should be noted that Dr Rahman has no previous convictions of any sort. 

43. Dr Dragutinovich, who examined Dr Rahman four times last year after he had been charged with two offences and then again in April this year after he had been charged with the balance of offences, recorded information about Dr Rahman's past. He is from Bangladesh and was born in Dhaka as one of eleven children. He had a normal upbringing without any criminal behaviour within the family at all. He excelled in school. He went to medical school. He did very well. He was treasurer of an organisation helping poor people. After he graduated he spent some time with Red Crescent and then worked in Zambia and in South Africa for some five years. He returned to Bangladesh to marry his wife and they have three healthy children. They came to Australia and became permanent residents. When they came to Australia they first went to Mackay in Queensland and then to Claremont in Queensland where Dr Rahman practised with good repute for some eight years. He then accepted the position as a medical practitioner at the Dapto Medical Centre in August 2009. 

44. I should add that when I made the observation that there is not much information about Dr Rahman's past, I do accept all of that personal history and personal background about him which I expect is uncontroversial. 

45. When he was seen by Dr Dragutinovich in 2010 with a history of two complaints he told the psychologist that "" his examinations were clinically warranted in both cases as one of the patients complained of breast pain "". The psychologist described Dr Rahman as presenting as very embarrassed. Dr Rahman explained to him that he had to do very thorough breast examinations because of an experience in Queensland where a sister of someone who worked in the practice died of breast cancer at a young age. The psychologist quoted Dr Rahman as saying, "" I saw the agony and distress of her mother and sister-the cancer was missed until it was too late "". Dr Rahman told the psychologist that these were the first allegations made against him and there was no evidence to suggest otherwise. At the time of the initial consultation, the psychologist "" understood that Mohammad was intending to contest the charges "". Dr Rahman told the psychologist that it was common in country practices to engage in social talk with patients. 

46. When he saw the psychologist in April this year the psychologist had the Agreed Facts made by all of the victims and Dr Rahman told the psychologist that he "" had pleaded guilty as he could no longer tolerate the pressure of further court proceedings "". He had moved to Newcastle because of the publicity in Wollongong. His wife and children were back in Bangladesh. He was working in a friend's grocer shop up in Newcastle. He said he would "" like to resume work as a GP and is prepared to accept any restriction "" concerning female patients. 

47. Dr Dragutinovich described what is detailed in the facts as "" boundary-breaching behaviour "". This is a somewhat mild description of the criminal activity engaged in over a period of six months perpetrated against the seventeen women who were the victims of his crime. However, the psychologist recorded Dr Rahman as expressing "" regret, not only for the effect upon himself, his family and colleagues, but also, perhaps more so, for the effect it had upon his female patients, whose trust, or rather now lack thereof, in professionals he now acknowledges may adversely affect them in the future "". This does seem to be a somewhat qualified expression of remorse. It is qualified by reference to words such as "" perhaps "" and "" may "" and by a reference to the effects upon himself and his family. That is not to say that the charges will not have an impact on him and his family and his position but the impact upon the victims of this criminal predatory behaviour far outweighed the impact on one life, namely his. 

48. Dr Dragutinovich described a condition which he thought "" can only be considered to represent a breast fetishism "". Dr Dragutinovich thought that Dr Rahman had been "" pre-morbidly psychologically stable, well integrated, intelligent, conservative "" and a medical practitioner "" whose apparent thoroughness in conducting breast examination was triggered by the false negative diagnosis of the young sister of his practice manager who died as a result of a breast cancer that was missed "". He then started to conduct more thorough breast examinations that would be normally appropriate. The psychologist then goes on to describe that that "" thoroughness appears to have subsequently and insidiously segued into boundary-breaching behaviour of a paraphilic kind involving a form of partialism insofar as the focus generally appears to have been on one part of the body, that of the female breast "". The psychologist recommended some behaviour modification over a period of a year and thought that he was unlikely to re-offend. 

49. I will briefly refer to the helpful submissions which I received from Ms Sullivan and Ms Healey before sentencing Dr Rahman and I will make findings as I refer to those submissions. 

50. Ms Healey described partialism as a particular focus on a part of the body, in this case it was the breast area. She described it as maladapted behaviour. Ms Healey correctly made clear that she was not relying upon the psychological report as indicating some kind of mental health issue which would mitigate her client's behaviour but as a way of explaining his behaviour. I do accept that explanation but it needs to be seen in this context. The behaviour would have become obvious to Dr Rahman himself very soon after the first incident at the beginning of the period of six months. As a mature man he is presently aged forty-four and as an experienced medical practitioner the first transgression should have seriously alarmed him. So whilst the psychological report may explain his behaviour, it in no way excuses the six months of predatory criminal activity which occurred after the first offence when he should have asked for help. In addition, as Ms Sullivan points out, the psychological report is helpful but it is not supported by any sworn evidence verifying material from Dr Rahman. As I say, I accept the personal history but things such as expressions of regret and the impact which the death of the relative of the staff member had in Queensland were not the subject of any verified evidence or cross-examination. 

51. Ms Healey acknowledged that the offences were aggravated in accordance with s 21A(2)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . That was an appropriate acknowledgement and in my opinion the only position which could reasonably be taken. She acknowledged the fact that in one instance the offence occurred in the presence of infant children. She pointed to her client's previous good character with no prior convictions. I accept that he has no prior convictions and that will be of benefit to him and be taken into account from the point of view of leniency which is appropriate under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . However that seems to be the limit of the evidence about his good character. I do not find, of course, that he is a person of bad character but I have no sworn evidence from him nor any references to make any positive finding about the kind of character which Dr Rahman is in normal life. In other words the evidence about his good character is very limited. 

52. Dr Rahman has pleaded guilty to all of the offences that he was charged with. Ms Sullivan acknowledges that they were entered in the Local Court at the earliest available opportunity. Accordingly, and this is important to record, in imposing the sentences which I will impose shortly, those sentences according to the Court of Criminal Appeal should be and will be discounted by twentyfive per cent as a result of Dr Rahman's pleas of guilty at an early stage. 

53. Ms Healey asked me to take into account his remorse. I find that there is no remorse expressed in the terms of s 21A(3)(i) - sorry I withdraw that. I accord some weight to remorse under that provision but it is based upon the pleas of guilty and upon the information given to the psychologist which is, as I said, unverified. I do take into account, of course, that in pleading guilty he has not required the victims of his crime to attend and give evidence before a jury and to be crossexamined. 

54. There was some debate between Ms Sullivan and Ms Healey regarding the prospects of rehabilitation and the likelihood of reoffending. I think, given this experience, that the prospects of rehabilitation are fairly good and I take that into account. His prospects of re-offending are guarded. I only say that because he persisted in the behaviour which he did over six months despite it obviously being not only professional misconduct - in my opinion - but also seriously criminal behaviour; and also because the psychologist recommended a treatment which might take a year to deal with it. We do not know how Dr Rahman may respond to that treatment. So I would be guarded about his prospects of re-offending. 

55. There are special circumstances says Ms Healey in adjusting the normal ratio between a non-parole period and the head sentence. Normally when a judge or magistrate sentences a person the non-parole period, which the person must stay in gaol for, is fixed at seventy-five per cent of the full sentence. In special circumstances a judge or magistrate can adjust that ratio and reduce the non-parole period. Those special circumstances in this case, Ms Healey said, are that it is her client's first time in custody and that he has no contact with his family who will be back in Bangladesh, so it will be in some respects harder. 

56. Ms Healey referred to what lawyers know as extra curial punishment; that is, impacts which the criminal behaviour has on a criminal's life apart from the sentence imposed by the judge. In this case Ms Healey pointed to the fact that her client will be almost certainly struck off from the medical practitioners' roll and that his life's work will be therefore lost. It will be difficult for him retrain. It will have a financial impact and he has become ostracised from his community. I give some small weight to these factors but standing next to the gravity of the crime that was committed by Dr Rahman these impacts I do not regard as significant. 

57. Ms Healey acknowledged that the offence of aggravated indecent assault fell within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. I accept that submission. Once again, it is the only position that could be taken. However, Ms Healey points out that of course the standard non-parole period strictly does not apply because Dr Rahman has pleaded. She is right in saying that. The Court of Criminal Appeal nevertheless says that I must bear it in mind as a guidepost in sentencing an offender. Ms Healey then points out that the standard non-parole period in this case, being eight years with a maximum of ten years, is particularly high. I bear that in mind but nevertheless Parliament has chosen to fix it at that level and it is not for me to decide myself that it is not appropriate. Nevertheless, as I acknowledge, the standard non-parole period strictly does not apply. 

58. Although Ms Healey pointed out that the offences were committed over a period of six months, contrasting it with some offences occurring within families over many years, on the other hand I regard it as significant that the offences were committed over six months. This was a medical practitioner who, as I said, was a mature professional man and should have immediately realised that any behaviour which was inappropriate because of some past experiences should have been acted upon and stopped straightaway. I regard the period as significant. 

59. Ms Healey acknowledged that there should be some accumulation amongst the various sentences, perhaps with an overall extension of seventeen or eighteen months. 

60. Ms Sullivan described the offences as extremely serious and deplorable. I regard the offences as deplorable and as very serious. I avoid the expression as extremely serious in case it might be thought that I am finding that they fall within the worst category of case. It is, Ms Sullivan said and I accept, an appalling breach of trust which Dr Rahman has perpetrated against seventeen women. Each woman left the surgery feeling violated. She referred to some of the examinations lasting an extended period of time, well beyond the two minutes standard for a breast examination, and I take that into account. She reminded me that the Agreed Facts indicate that these examinations were clearly perpetrated for sexual gratification. Indeed I hesitate to use the expression examinations because it suggests that Dr Rahman was acting in some way professionally when in fact he was acting in a criminal way. 

61. Ms Sullivan referred to the profound effect on some of the victims and I have already referred to the way in which I will take that into account. She referred to the breach of trust which, as I said, I regard as very serious. She also referred to the particular crime committed in the company of two infant children. 

62. Ms Sullivan submitted that the offence of aggravated indecent assault was in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, perhaps in the high range because of the breach of trust. I would regard it as towards the top of the middle or the range of objective seriousness. 

63. Ms Sullivan also referred to some patients leaving the practice thinking that they might have had breast cancer. 

64. Ms Sullivan submitted that the only option was a lengthy custodial sentence and she acknowledged the presence of special circumstances being the inevitable accumulation of sentences and the fact that it was Dr Rahman's first time in custody. 

65. I propose to accumulate the sentences which I will impose. The sentences will be accumulated by two months. I propose to sentence concurrently in cases where two offences were committed against one victim with the exception of victim 6 where there were additional matters to be taken into account. 

66. I would regard - taking into account all the factors that I have referred to - appropriate sentences for the crimes of indecent assault as being three years imprisonment. That takes into account the maximum of five years. In those cases where I am taking into account other offences then in my opinion the appropriate penalty should have been three and a half years. I thought for the offence of aggravated sexual assault that the penalty should be six and a half years. 

67. However Dr Rahman, as I have said, has pleaded guilty to all of these offences and I am therefore required to discount those initial sentences by twenty-five per cent. Therefore for the offences of indecent assault I will sentence Dr Rahman to two years and three months imprisonment. For those that are accompanied by additional charges I will sentence him to two years and six months imprisonment. And for the offence of aggravated sexual assault I will sentence him for four years and six months imprisonment. 

68. I had thought that an overall sentence of twelve years with eight months non-parole period was appropriate but I am going to reduce that by twenty-five per cent, so his overall sentence will be nine years with a non-parole period of six years. The ratio between the six year non-parole period and the nine year full term is not seventy-five per cent because of the special circumstances which I have referred to. 

69. I will now impose the individual sentences. The overall result of the sentences will be a sentence of nine years imprisonment with a minimum to serve of a non-parole period of six years to commence 22 July 2011. 

HIS HONOUR: And now, Ms Sullivan and Ms Healey, I have reduced, or my associate did on my instructions, to writing so that when I have finished imposing the sentences I am going to ask you first whether the mathematics are correct and, secondly, whether there are any errors of law or fact which I have made which I should revise under s 43 during the remarks on sentence. 
If you would stand up Dr Rahman. 


70. In respect of victim 1 or charge 24 of indecent assault, taking into account charge 47 of indecent assault, I sentence you to two years and six months imprisonment to commence on 22 July 2011 and to expire on 21 January 2014.

77. In respect of victim 8 and charge 34 I sentence you to two years and three months imprisonment to commence on 22 November 2012 and to expire on 21 February 2013. 

78. In respect of victim 9 and charge 35 of indecent assault I sentence you to two years and three months imprisonment commencing 22 January 2013 and expiring on 21 April 2015. 

79. In respect of victim 11 and the two charges of indecent assault, being charges 37 and 38, I sentence you on each count to concurrent terms of two years and three months imprisonment commencing on 22 March 2013 and expiring on 21 June 2015. 

80. In respect of victim 12 and three charges of indecent assault, being charges 39, 40 and 41, I sentence you on each offence to concurrent terms of two years and three months commencing 22 May 2013 expiring 21 August 2015. 

81. In respect of victim 13 and charge 42 I sentence you to two years and three months imprisonment commencing on 22 July 2013 and expiring on 21 October 2015. 

82. In respect of victim 14 and charge 43 I sentence you to imprisonment for two years and three months commencing on 22 September 2013 expiring on 21 December 2015. 

83. In respect of victim 15 and charge 44 of indecent assault I sentence you to imprisonment for two years and three months commencing 22 November 2013 expiring on 21 February 2016. 

84. In respect of victim 16 and charge 45 of indecent assault I sentence you to imprisonment for two years and three months commencing on 22 January 2014 and expiring on 21 April 2016. 

85. In respect of victim 17 and charge 46 of indecent assault I sentence you to imprisonment of two years and three months commencing on 22 March 2014 and expiring on 21 June 2016. 

86. In respect of victim 10 and charges 50 and 37 and taking into account charge 50 I fix a nonparole period of one year and six months commencing on 22 January 2016 and expiring on 21 July 2017. There will be an additional period of three years commencing on 22 July 2017 and expiring on 21 July 2020. 

87. The overall sentence will be nine years commencing 22 July 2011 expiring 21 July 2020 and the nonparole period will be six years commencing 22 July 2011 and expiring on 21 July 2017. The first date on which it appears to me on the information available that you will be released on parole is 21 July 2017. 

HIS HONOUR: Have a seat Dr Rahman. We think in respect of victim 8 I wrongly said the expiry date was 2013. 

88. In respect of victim 8 the sentence of two years and three months commences 22 November 2012 and expires on 21 February 2015. 

HIS HONOUR: My associate just drew that to my attention. 
Now first, Ms Sullivan and Ms Healey, mathematics? 
HEALEY: Yes it's correct your Honour. 

SULLIVAN: I haven't noticed anything that jumps out at me your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: No, Ms Healey? 

HEALEY: I've checked it carefully and it seems to be correct your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Okay, thank you. Now any matters that should attract my attention under s 43? 

SULLIVAN: There was one matter that my friend and I had thought, that in respect of victim 10 before your Honour pronounced sentence your Honour said aggravated sexual assault rather than indecent assault. 

HIS HONOUR: That's wrong, yes, thank you, thank you. 

SULLIVAN: We simply draw that to your Honour's attention. 

HEALEY: That's the only matter your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Thank you. 


89. In respect of victim 10 the crime that I am sentencing him for are two crimes: two counts of aggravated indecent assault and I take into account one count of aggravated indecent assault being charges 50 and 36 for which I am sentencing him and charge 50 which I take into account. 

HIS HONOUR: Now is that correct? 
SULLIVAN: That's correct your Honour. 
HIS HONOUR: I see, yes, I am wrong, my associate has corrected me. 

90. There are two offences overall for the aggravated indecent assault and I am sentencing him for charge 36 and I take into account charge 50. 

HIS HONOUR: I think that is correct, Ms Healey you are nodding, yes? 
HEALEY: That's correct, yes. 
HIS HONOUR: Ms Sullivan? 
SULLIVAN: Yes thank you your Honour. 
HIS HONOUR: Is there anything else? 
SULLIVAN: Not from me thank you, your Honour. 
HIS HONOUR: Ms Healey? 
HEALEY: No your Honour.

		25 August 2011",2011-07-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709405,R v Costa [2011] NSWSC 1392,"Judgment  1HIS HONOUR: On 9 May 2011 the offender, Tiago Costa, pleaded guilty to offences of affray and manslaughter.  The offences are against s 93C and ss 18 & 24 respectively of the Crimes Act 1900 and the maximum penalties are imprisonment for 10 years and imprisonment for 25 years.  2On 15 July 2011 I heard and received evidence and submissions on sentence before standing the matter over until today.  Facts  3A statement of agreed facts was tendered in the sentence proceedings and I draw the following from that document.  Overview  4Mr Anthony Zervas was killed in Terminal 3 at Sydney Airport on 22 March 2009 during a brawl between rival motorcycle gangs, the Hells Angels and the Comanchero.  The offender was a member of the Comanchero.  The deceased was the brother of Mr Peter Zervas who was a member of the Hells Angels.  5The affray took place at Gate 5 of the terminal after the offender had met some Comanchero members as they disembarked from an arriving flight.  It was in the vicinity of that gate that he, along with fellow Comanchero members, used unlawful violence towards one or more Hells Angels members or associates.  This was done in the presence of members of the general public in circumstances that caused those of them who were of reasonable firmness to fear for their personal safety.  6The manslaughter of the deceased occurred during a fight that occurred minutes later and about 300 metres away within the departure hall of the terminal.  The offender was a party to a joint criminal enterprise to commit an unlawful and dangerous act, namely an assault upon one or more members or associates of the Hells Angels.  The offender acknowledges that the assault was of a nature that carried with it an apprecible risk of somebody suffering serious injury.  It was in the course of such an assault that the deceased was killed.  Background  7At the time of the incident, the Comanchero motorcycle club had a hierarchical structure.  It had a president, Mr Mahmoud (Mick) Hawi; a ""commander"", Mr Daux Ngakuru; a ""road captain"", Mr Farres Abounader; a treasurer, Mr Francesco La Rosa; a ""nominee boss"", Mr Rui Antao; and a ""sergeant at arms"", Mr Herb Laupepa.  The offender was the secretary.  He was responsible for the collection of membership fees.  8Hostility and enmity existed between the Comanchero and Hells Angels which had been given expression by earlier acts of malicious damage between the two clubs. The offender acknowledges that the events of 22 March 2009 occurred in this context.  As the secretary, he was generally aware of the hostility between the two entities.  The precipitating event  9Five members of the Comanchero flew to Sydney from Melbourne.  They were Mahmoud Hawi, Canan (aka Ishmail) Eken, Christian Menzies, Maher Aouli and Pomare Pirini.   When they boarded the flight there was a chance sighting of Derek Wainohu, the president of the Hells Angels.  Mr Hawi and the other Comanchero members were observed to exhibit animosity towards Mr Wainohu before the flight took off.  10Mr Hawi directed Mr Aouli to contact Comanchero members in Sydney in order to have them attend the airport.  Mr Wainohu also made contact with Hells Angels members in order for them to come to the airport.  Seven Comanchero members attended the airport as a result of the call from Mr Aouli.  A car driven by Mr Abounader conveyed the offender and Mr La Rosa while a car driven by Usama Potrus conveyed Zoran Kisacanin, SP and AL (the latter two being Comanchero members who subsequently became Crown witnesses).  The two cars stopped at Brighton on the way to the airport where Messrs Potrus and Abounader spoke with Messrs Ngakuru and Laupepa.  11The two cars were parked illegally at the airport.  It is not a part of the agreed facts, but I observe that this is consistent with there being a perception of urgency for the occupants to meet their colleagues arriving from Melbourne.  12Five of the Comanchero members proceeded through security screening to Gate 5.  Messrs Abounader and Potrus remained outside, but near where arriving passengers emerge from the ""sterile"" area.  13Seven members of the Hells Angels (or ""associates"" in the case of the deceased and Musa Ovalle) also came to the airport.  Two of them, Tom Baker and David Padovan, went through to Gate 5 while the others, Mr Ovalle, Anthony and Peter Zervas, Elias Khoury and Peter Martin, remained outside of the sterile area.  The Gate 5 affray  14The five Comanchero members disembarked at Gate 5 and met their five fellow members nearby.  Mr Wainohu, similarly, met the two members of his gang.   At this point there were ten Comanchero members and three Hells Angels members.  15Mr Hawi confronted Mr Wainohu.  After a short argument, Mr Wainohu was punched and he fell to the ground.  Comanchero members then chased and assaulted Mr Padovan.  There was violent punching and kicking of Mr Padovan by the Comanchero members.  The other Hells Angels, Messrs Wainohu and Baker, did not engage in the violence.  The fighting resulted in Mr Padovan losing his shirt.  At one stage he was on the ground being punched and kicked by numerous Comanchero members.  16There were a large number of people at Gate 5 at the time of this affray.  There were passengers disembarking from the flight and others waiting to board the departing flight.  They included children and elderly people.  The offender acknowledges that these people were put in fear by his actions, and the actions of his fellow Comanchero members.  17The offender was involved in ""scuffles"" in the course of these events, but the Crown accepts that there is no evidence that he either punched or kicked Mr Padovan whilst Mr Padovan was on the ground.  18None of the participants received any serious injuries in the course of the affray.  Threats at the conclusion of the Gate 5 affray  19Mr Padovan rejoined Messrs Wainohu and Baker when the fighting had ceased.  Mr Hawi pointed and yelled out threats towards the Hells Angels, including, ""You're fucking dead"" . The other Comanchero members present at Gate 5 were with him when he uttered these threats.  20The Comanchero members then proceeded towards the exit and emerged into the departure hall of the terminal where they met up with Messrs Abounader and Potrus.  21The entire incident in the vicinity of Gate 5 took place in less than three minutes.  Confrontation in the departure hall  22Rather than going down the escalators immediately outside the exit into the terminal which proceed down to the baggage collection area, the now 12 Comanchero members moved quickly towards the 5 Hells Angels who were waiting in the check-in area. They covered a distance of about 73 metres to the point where the 2 groups met up.  The offender acknowledges that as this occurred, he contemplated the possibility of a physical assault upon one or more of the Hells Angels.  23There was a short argument before a fight commenced.  SP and AL have claimed that as the two groups approached, one of the Comancheros called out, ""He's got a gun"" and that some of the Comanchero, including the offender, dropped to the ground.  No gun was ever found and none of the innocent eyewitnesses described men dropping to the ground.  24SP and AL have also claimed that the deceased stabbed at Mr Hawi at the commencement of the fighting.  None of the innocent eyewitnesses saw the deceased with a weapon.  Some of them did, however, describe the deceased being chased after the fighting had commenced and there were descriptions of a fight breaking out with both sides fighting each other and ""punches flying everywhere"".  25It is agreed between the parties that precisely how the fight started does not need to be resolved.  The offender is to be dealt with upon the agreed basis that he was part of a joint criminal enterprise to assault one or more of the Hells Angels and that, although he did not actually participate in the fighting, he was willing to assist if required.  26The fight erupted behind the check-in counters and continued as the participants moved to the front of the terminal.  Eyewitness descriptions are of a fight between two sides with one side outnumbering the other.  There are references to an ""all in brawl"" and ""everybody"" punching.  27The offender was a part of the moving group of Comanchero members coming through from behind to in front of the check-in counters.  After the two groups had moved to the front of the counters there were a number of fights occurring simultaneously.  The assault upon the deceased was one of these fights.  28Some of the participants picked up bollards, the metal poles which weigh about 12 kilograms that were used in the check-in queues.  There were anywhere between two and five of these bollards being used as weapons by the men involved in the brawl. I note that the Crown does not assert that the offender was involved in the brawl in this way notwithstanding that his fingerprints were found on a bollard that was recovered from the scene.  29The Crown contends that Messrs Menzies, Hawi and Abounader, at least, assaulted the deceased towards the end of the brawl.  There is evidence which suggests that there was anywhere between two to seven men assaulting him.  It is agreed, however, that the offender was not one of them.  30The fighting in the check-in area took place in the presence of a large number of people, including children and elderly people. Many witnesses commented upon the extreme viciousness of the fighting.  Some specifically commented about feeling threatened and terrified.  One said, ""Whilst the fight was occurring I was shocked.  The punches were thrown with force and the attack was vicious"" .  Another said, ""During the incident I was scared and sickened as to what had happened.  These people looked like animals going at it"" .  31The deceased died from the combined effects of blunt force injuries to the head and stab wounds to the chest and abdomen.  The head injuries were severe.  They included extensive fracturing at the base of the skull, bleeding over the surface of the brain and bruising of the brain tissue.  The stab wounds injured the right lung, liver and stomach and caused significant internal bleeding.  32The fighting in this area of the terminal is agreed to have lasted no more than two minutes.  The offender fled at the same time as SP, Mr Abounader and Mr Potrus.  After running towards taxis that were immediately outside the terminal, they turned back and ran through the carpark and left the area in one of the two cars that had been driven to the airport.  The offender was not arrested until 3 July 2009.  He was charged on that date with riot and affray.  On 11 August 2009 he was charged with murder.  33The offender gave evidence in the sentence proceedings and it included some further information as to his involvement.  34He said that he had been at a child's birthday party when he was contacted by another Comanchero member and told that he, and others, were required to go to the airport. He said that he had an expectation that they may be confronted by Hells Angels members.  He thought that ""it was possible that there might be some sort of assault, some sort of trouble"", but that this was unlikely due to the location.  The reason he thought it was unlikely was because it was an airport with ""lots of people, cameras, police, witnesses"" and it was daylight.  35After the affray at Gate 5, he and his fellow Comanchero members walked out to the departure hall where they saw further members of the Hells Angels.  He accepted that as they approached these men their actions were threatening and that the possibility of a violent physical confrontation was enhanced.  36In relation to the offender's fingerprints being found on a bollard, he could not offer a definitive explanation but suspected that he touched one as the fighting proceeded through from the back of the check-in counters and into the area where passengers queued in front.  He said that he recalled stumbling and also that bollards were falling around him.  Seriousness of the offences  37I have previously sentenced a number of other offenders in relation to this matter.  Mr Pickin, counsel for the present offender, conceded that the assessment of the seriousness of the offences I made when sentencing Pomare Pirini was open to me to make in this case.  I am satisfied that is so because the roles and culpability of Mr Pirini and the offender are, in the respects that are material, virtually indistinguishable.  As a result, I will largely be reiterating what I said when sentencing Mr Pirini.  38I stress that I am not sentencing the offender for directly causing the death of the deceased.  I am not sentencing him for his participation in a joint enterprise that had as its object the doing of an act with the intention of killing or inflicting grievous bodily harm.  I am not sentencing him for his participation in a joint enterprise with the contemplation that the commission of murder was a possible occurrence.  39For the affray, the offender is being sentenced for his participation with fellow Comanchero members in using unlawful violence towards one or more members of the Hells Angels in circumstances that would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety.  40For the manslaughter, the offender is being sentenced for his participation in a joint criminal enterprise to commit an unlawful and dangerous act, namely the assault of one or more members of the Hells Angels, in circumstances in which there was an appreciable risk of serious injury being occasioned to a person.  41As for the affray, it was relatively short-lived and the offender's role was less than that of other participants.  Nevertheless, it was an offence of some seriousness.  It involved a considerable number of combatants.  The location where it occurred is relevant.  So too is the number and nature of innocent people who were present.  These are prominent features of this offence and render it considerably more serious than if it had occurred elsewhere and otherwise.  42The starting point in assessing the gravity of an offence of manslaughter is to recognise that it involves the unlawful taking of a human life.  There are, however, a wide variety of ways in which the crime of manslaughter can be committed and there is an equally wide variety of ways in which an offender may be culpable.  43The present case is one of considerable seriousness.  The offender accepts that the fighting that occurred in the departure hall carried with it an appreciable risk of somebody suffering serious injury.   That risk was not only of injury to participants in the fighting but to innocent bystanders who included children and the elderly.  The offender was part of a large group of men who outnumbered their opponents.  The statement of agreed facts includes that witnesses felt threatened and terrified.  Comments were made about the extreme viciousness of the fighting.  44It must be acknowledged that the offender's role was, relatively speaking, minor.  It is not alleged that he was directly involved in any physical violence himself.  He was not armed and, unlike some others, he did not take up any object to use as a weapon.  He was not directly involved in the attack upon the deceased.  Acknowledging each of those matters, however, does not mean that his offence was anything other than a serious one.  The absence of those factors simply means that his culpability is less than that of others.  45There was a level of planning and organisation that attended the incidents.  Clearly, a confrontation was contemplated at the time phone calls were made to summon fellow gang members to attend at the airport.  The offender conceded quite candidly that when he went to the airport with Messrs Abounader and La Rosa he realised the possibility that there might be a confrontation, although he thought it unlikely due to the nature of the location.  It was further conceded, again quite candidly, that after the Gate 5 affray the prospect of further violence as the Comanchero members advanced upon the Hells Angels in the departure hall was a greater likelihood.  46Each of the offences are of considerable seriousness.  The offender was willingly involved in the manner described in the agreed facts.  However, in assessing the appropriate sentences to impose I must also bear in mind that the role played by the offender was significantly less than that of other participants.  Denunciation, punishment and deterrence  47An observation I have made in sentencing others bears repeating.  Members of the community have an entitlement to feel safe and secure in public places.  The selfish and mindless arrogance of those who perpetrate extreme levels of violence for their own ends with complete disregard for others warrants the strongest condemnation.  48It is necessary in the assessment of sentence to denounce the offender's conduct.  It must be made clear to him, and others who may contemplate acting in such a way, that such conduct will be met with condign punishment.  Aggressive and violent conduct between rival gang members in public places simply will not be tolerated, the more so where there is an appreciable risk of somebody suffering serious injury.  That risk, in what occurred in this case in the departure hall, was high indeed.  The offender must be punished and made accountable for his part in this tragic affair.  Subjective features  49The offender was aged 29 at the time of the offences and is now aged 32.  50He has no previous convictions, a matter that stands to his credit in the assessment of sentence.  51Mr Pickin tendered a variety of documentary material.  It comprised affidavits by the offender, his wife and one of his brothers; a number of testimonials; reports by the offender's wife's general practitioner, Dr Peter Parras; and a report by Mr Tim Watson-Munro, forensic psychologist.  The offender gave evidence and during the course of it Mr Pickin tendered a letter that the offender had written.  The Crown tendered a Pre Sentence Report prepared by an officer of the Probation and Parole Service.   The salient points I derive from this material include what follows.  52The offender was born in Portugal and came to Australia with his family at the age of 6.  He is the eldest of three boys.  He was educated to Higher School Certificate level and then completed an apprenticeship with John Newell Mazda as a motor mechanic.  53He married his wife in 2004.  They purchased a house in Carlton.  It was around this time that he resigned from his position with John Newell Mazda and took up work in the construction industry.  He explained that this was because it was better paying work and he had a wife, a mortgage and a child on the way.  Since he has been in custody, he has been employed as a storeman and later as a cleaner.  It would seem that he has a good work ethic.  54The couple's first son was born in January 2005.  Another son was born in March 2006.  They sold the house in Carlton and bought a larger home in Panania.  55It was around this time that the offender bought an old Harley Davidson that required restoration. He had been friends with Mr Abounader, Mr Laupepa, and Mr Aouli.  They used to ride bikes together.  The offender was introduced to Mr Hawi through Mr Abounader.  He was invited to join a ride on Fathers' Day in 2006 and became acquainted with other Comanchero members.  He was invited to attend the clubhouse.  It was not long after this, in about late 2006, that he was invited to join the Comanchero.  56In relation to his membership of the Comanchero, the offender said that prior to 2007 his life revolved around his family but then his priorities became confused.  He could not see it at the time, even though his wife and one of his brothers spoke to him about it. He said that he spent all of his spare time riding his bike rather than caring for his family and spending time with his very young children.  He was attracted to the Comanchero because of his love for bikes and the riding.  Once he was in the club he enjoyed ""the lifestyle, the parties and all that sort of thing"" .   He was ""pretty much living the single life with the boys"" and ""would go out partying, drinking and taking drugs"" .  He also said that he was attracted by the respect that members showed each other and the bond that they had together.  To the author of the Pre Sentence Report, he described this as ""a fake lifestyle"" .  57In cross-examination, the offender denied seeing any criminal activity in the club, although he acknowledged, as do the agreed facts, that he was aware of ongoing hostility between the Comanchero and Hells Angels clubs and that he knew that this was manifested in the malicious damage of the opposing club's property.  58The offender said that soon after he went into custody he made the decision to leave the Comanchero.  However he deferred doing so until the time he decided to plead guilty.  In the interim, he felt safer being in gaol in the company of fellow Comanchero members. He has told Messrs Hawi, Abounader, Aouli and La Rosa of his decision to leave the club and, apparently, there have been no recriminations.  59The offender claimed that he had recommitted himself to his family and vows that upon his release he will devote himself to them and eschew the life that he led in the period prior to his arrest.  He has anguished over missing milestones in his children's lives.  He regrets the distress that his behaviour, and his incarceration, have caused to his wife and his family.  He is fortunate they have maintained regular contact with him and it bodes well for his rehabilitation that he has their support.  60I am satisfied that the offender is genuinely remorseful.  What he said in his evidence, his letter and his affidavit, as well as what he is reported to have said to others, makes it evident that he has empathy for the family of the deceased and is able to appreciate the grief and anguish that they have had to suffer.  61I am also satisfied that the offender appreciates the terrifying experience of the airport staff and members of the public who were in the Qantas terminal at the time of the events and who witnessed such horrific acts of violence.  He has reflected upon ""how that day has changed many people's lives"" .  62The affidavit by the offender's wife makes abundantly clear that she and their two young sons have found their enforced separation from him a most distressing experience.  There is confirmation of this in the other documentary evidence, particularly the reports by Dr Parras.  Mr Pickin fairly conceded, however, that in accordance with sentencing principles, the family hardship is not at a level that would justify some mitigation of sentence.  I do, however, acknowledge the hardship to the offender's family that is an indirect consequence of his criminal conduct.  This simply serves to highlight that there were a number of ways in which the offender was not thinking of consequences when he responded to the command to attend the airport on 22 March 2009.  63There are many positive expressions of the offender's personal characteristics in the testimonials that were tendered.  He is described as well-liked, hard-working, dependable, trustworthy, loyal, loving and honest.  64Mr Watson-Munro's report recounts much of the circumstances of the offender's life that are set out elsewhere in the documentary material.  He administered the Beck Depression Inventory which he described as canvassing a range of psychological and physiological symptoms of depression and anxiety experienced by the subject over the previous fortnight.  The results indicated ""a significant degree of unresolved depression and anxiety"".  However, given that the results are based upon symptoms reported to have been experienced in only the previous fortnight, and that Mr Watson-Munro refers to some aspects having become more acute as the sentence hearing approached, it is difficult to draw any useful conclusion as to whether depression and anxiety are long-term conditions.  None of the other material before me supports such a proposition.  65In the concluding section of his report, Mr Watson-Munro referred to the offender having ""continuing themes of low self-esteem, intermittent depression and anxiety as an adult"".  That seems to be at odds with, or at least not supported by, all of the positive descriptions of the offender's personality in the other evidence.  Not even the offender himself claims to have experienced symptoms consistent with those described by Mr Watson-Munro.  66I have not referred to all of the opinions expressed in the report. With respect to Mr Watson-Munro, I do not find the report particularly helpful.  I have formed a generally favourable view of the subjective case presented by the offender upon a consideration of the other material.  Specific mitigating features  67The offender was charged with riot and affray on 3 July 2009 and with murder on 11 August 2009.  He participated in a protracted committal hearing before being committed for trial on 23 September 2010.  He pleaded not guilty to murder, riot and affray upon arraignment in this Court.  He pleaded guilty to manslaughter and affray on 9 May 2011.  68I accept that there were negotiations with the Crown on behalf of the offender as to the facts upon which he would plead to manslaughter following my sentencing of Mr Pirini on 18 March 2011.  The fact of the matter is, of course, that if he knew he was guilty upon the basis of the agreed facts, there was nothing stopping him indicating that at an earlier time.  I accept, also, that whilst the pleas were entered on the date set for trial, they were indicated in the weeks before.  69Having regard to this chronology, the utilitarian benefit of the offender's pleas of guilty warrants a reduction of his sentence of 12.5 per cent.  A plea entered at such a late stage would ordinarily warrant a reduction of around 10 per cent but in this case there is the potential length and complexity of the prospective trial that should also be taken into account.  70The offender will also be given credit for his lack of previous convictions, his prior good character (aside from his being a member of the Comanchero), his good prospects of rehabilitation and the unlikelihood of his re-offending.  71I am also satisfied that the offender is genuinely remorseful.  There is abundant evidence of this.  I take into account not only his empathic expressions of contrition in relation to the family of the deceased, but also the regret that he has for the unfortunate witnesses to the violence for which he shares responsibility.  Sentencing of co-offenders  72There is no need for me to outline in any great detail the sentencing of co-offenders. His Honour Judge Charteris sentenced the offenders AL and SP and I have sentenced Messrs Pirini, La Rosa and Aouli.  Mr Pickin, on behalf of the offender, accepted that ""a sentence very similar to the sentences that your Honour's imposed for the other three would be appropriate for my client"", subject only to the extent of the reduction allowed for his pleas.  73AL and SP each pleaded guilty to riot and affray.  Charteris DCJ sentenced them both to a total term of 3 years with a non-parole period of 9 months.  He allowed a reduction of 55 per cent for their pleas of guilty and assistance to authorities.   He adopted a starting point for the affray sentence of 3 years and a starting point for the riot sentence of 6 years.  The sentences were partially accumulated by 4 months.  74I sentenced Mr Pirini to an overall term of 6 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months.  The sentence for affray was 2 years 2 months (starting point 2 years 8 months) and the sentence for manslaughter was 6 years (starting point 7 years 6 months).  The sentences were reduced by 20 per cent for his pleas of guilty which were entered last year at the arraignment phase in this Court.  75Mr La Rosa was sentenced to an overall term of 7 years 1 month with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months.  The sentence for affray was 2 years 4 months (starting point 2 years 9 months) and the sentence for manslaughter was 6 years 7 months (starting point 7 years 9 months).  The sentences were reduced by 15 per cent for his pleas of guilty which were entered on 8 April 2011, a month before the trial date.  76Mr Aouli was sentenced to an overall term of 6 years 2 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months.  The sentence for affray was 2 years 5 months (starting point 2 years 9 months) and the sentence for manslaughter was 5 years 8 months (starting point 6 years 6 months).  The sentences were reduced by 12.5 per cent for his pleas of guilty which were entered on 9 May 2011.  That was the trial date but I took into account that Mr Aouli's intention to plead guilty was known before then.  77The starting point for the sentence for manslaughter in Mr Aouli's case was less than that which was adopted in the cases of Messrs Pirini and La Rosa.  The reason was that the agreed facts in Mr Aouli's case yielded a lesser assessment of objective seriousness, a matter which the Crown conceded.  78The subjective cases presented on behalf of each of Messrs Pirini, La Rosa and Aouli were similar in terms of their mitigating weight to that which has been presented on behalf of the offender.  There was, however, a feature that was present in the case of Messrs La Rosa and Aouli that was not present in Mr Pirini's case and that was that they were on conditional liberty at the time of the offences. In my view, it would be appropriate to adopt the starting points for each of the sentences that were applied in the sentencing of Mr Pirini.  The final sentence will be greater because of the lesser reduction for the offender's pleas of guilty.  Other sentencing considerations  79I am satisfied that there are special circumstances for reducing the proportion of the sentence to be represented by the non-parole period.  There is the partial accumulation of sentence that I propose to apply in the same manner as I did in the other cases.  More pertinently, however, I am satisfied that there should be a longer parole period to better ensure that after his release from his first experience of full-time imprisonment, he settles back into a lifestyle akin to that which he led prior to his involvement with the Comanchero.  An extended period of supervision by the Probation and Parole Service will be of assistance in ensuring that the party lifestyle, with binge drinking and recreational use of illicit drugs, is a thing of the past.  It will also assist in ensuring that the offender develops social contacts that do not include his former Comanchero associates.  80It was common ground that to give credit for pre-sentence custody, the sentence should date from 4 July 2009.  SENTENCE  On each:  Convicted.  Affray:  Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years 4 months.  The sentence is to date from 4 July 2009 and expire on 3 November 2011.  Manslaughter:  Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years 3 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 3 years 4 months.  The sentence is to date from 4 January 2010.  The offender will be eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 3 April 2013. The total term will expire on 3 August 2016.  That is a total sentence of 7 years 1 month with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months.  The sentence of 2 years 4 months for the affray, but for the offender's plea of guilty, would have been one of 2 years 8 months.  The sentence of 6 years 7 months for the manslaughter, but for the offender's plea of guilty, would have been one of 7 years 6 months.  **********

		18 November 2011",2011-07-25 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709415,Health Care Complaints Commission v Kristin Scott Stoker [2011] NSWSC 960,"Judgment (ex tempore)  1HIS HONOUR:  The defendant Kristin Scott Stoker ('the Chiropractor'), is a registered chiropractor against whom, on 12 October 2009 the plaintiff Health Care Complaints Commission ('the Commission') made a complaint to the Chiropractors Tribunal ('the Tribunal') containing three counts, with corresponding particulars, as follows:  Complaint One  The practitioner has been convicted of an offence and the circumstances of the offence are such as to render the chiropractor unfit in the public interest to be registered as a chiropractor:  Particulars  On 18 May 2007 in Sydney, NSW, the chiropractor was convicted of one count of exposing his person in or within view from a public place contrary to (NSW) Summary Offences Act 1988 , s 5 .  Complaint Two  The practitioner is not of good character:  Particulars  1.  On 18 May 2007 the practitioner was convicted of one count of exposing his person in or within view from a public place contrary to Summary Offences Act, s 5 .  2.  On 17 May 2007 at the Downing Centre Local Court, whilst giving evidence under oath at the hearing of the prosecution of himself for the offence of wilfully and obscenely exposing his person within view from a public place, in contravention of Summary Offences Act, s 5, the practitioner falsely denied that he had so wilfully and obscenely exposed his person on 26 September 2006 at North Sydney.  3.  Contravened (NSW) Chiropractors Act, s 21(1)(a), by failing to notify the Board (being the Chiropractors Registration Board ('the Board') as constituted under (NSW) Chiropractors Act 2001, Pt 7) in writing within 7 days after conviction;  a.  On 18 May 2007 the practitioner was convicted of one count of exposing his person in or within view from a public place contrary to Summary Offences Act, s 5;  b.  On 28 May 2007, the Board received a letter dated 27 May 2007, from Ian Byrne lawyer for the practitioner advising the Board of the conviction.  Complaint Three  The practitioner has been guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct contrary to Chiropractors Act, s 25 Act in that he has:  (i)  contravened Chiropractors Act, s 21(1)(a) by failing to notify the Board in writing within 7 days after conviction.  Particulars  1.  On 18 May 2007 the practitioner was convicted of one count of exposing his person in or within view from a public place contrary to Summary Offences Act, s 5 ;  2.  On 28 May 2007, the Board received a letter dated 27 May 2007, from Ian Bryne lawyer for the practitioner advising the Board of the conviction.  2After a hearing on 1 June 2010, the Tribunal on 25 August 2010 decided as follows:  1.  The Tribunal is satisfied that Kristin Scott Stoker (the Chiropractor) was on the 18 th of May, 2007 in Sydney convicted on one count of exposing his person in or within view from a public place under the provisions of Summary Offences Act, s 5 , and Complaint One is therefore proven to the extent of the conviction. However, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the Chiropractor is unfit in the public interest to be registered as a Chiropractor.  2.  The Tribunal does not find Complaint Two proven, but does find Particulars 1, 2 and 3 of Complaint Two proven.  In the circumstances, and taking into account relevant considerations, the Tribunal does not find that the Chiropractor is not of good character.  3.  The Tribunal does find that the Chiropractor failed to notify the Chiropractors Registration Board within 7 days after conviction but in the circumstances the Tribunal does not find Complaint Three proven that he is guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct in relation to that failure.  4.  The Tribunal imposes the following condition of registration in the interests of public safety and confidence:  For a period of two years from this date the Chiropractor when assessing or treating any female patient under the age of 45 years there must be present in the treatment room for the duration of the visit an adult female person unless the patient is accompanied by a parent or guardian who is male and the patient consents.  3By its summons in these proceedings, the Commission appeals to this Court alleging that the Tribunal's conclusions are wrong in law in the following respects:  1.  The Chiropractors Tribunal erred in law in not finding the first complaint proved, that is, that [the Chiropractor] had been convicted of an offence, the circumstances of which rendered him unfit in the public interest to practise as a chiropractor within the meaning of Chiropractors Act, s 26(2)(a), (Repealed), because the Tribunal took into account an irrelevant consideration, that is, if the Tribunal imposed a condition upon his practice requiring him to be supervised, he was fit to practice.  2.  The Chiropractors Tribunal erred in law in not finding the second complaint proved, that is, that the Chiropractor was ""not of good character"" within the meaning of Chiropractors Act 2001, s 26(2) (Repealed) because the Tribunal failed to take into account a relevant consideration, namely, that the Chiropractor had lied to a court under oath.  3.  The Chiropractors Tribunal erred in law in not finding the third complaint proved, that is, that the Chiropractor was guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct pursuant to Chiropractors Act, s 25(b) (Repealed) in that he failed to notify the Chiropractors Board within 7 days that he had been convicted of an offence pursuant to Chiropractors Act, s 21(a) (Repealed) when the primary facts as found by the Tribunal required that it find that the third complaint had been made out.  4As Ms McNaughton, appearing on behalf of the Commission, has pointed out in her helpful submissions, the appeal is brought pursuant to (NSW) Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (NSW) No 86a, s 162, which is in a form very similar to the provisions that have applied for many years in respect of appeals from the Medical Tribunal and other disciplinary tribunals in the health sector.  It relevantly provides as follows:  (1)  A person about whom a complaint is referred to the Tribunal, or the complainant, may appeal to the Supreme Court against -   (a) a decision of the tribunal with respect to a point of law; or  (b) the exercise of a power by the tribunal under subsection (6) of division 3.  5In this appeal, it is chiefly, if not exclusively, subparagraph (a) of s 162 that is relevant, although during the course of argument a question about the Tribunal's exercise of power in imposing the chaperone condition referred to in paragraph 4 of its reasons has arisen.  6As Ms McNaughton also points out in her submissions, the original complaint was brought under the Chiropractors Act , which Act was repealed by the (NSW) Health Practitioner Regulation Amendment Act 2010, with effect from 1 July 2010.  Clause 4(3) of schedule 5A of the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law provides:  After the relevant matter has been decided under the repealed Act, any further proceedings or appeal in relation to the matter the subject of the relevant matter is to be dealt with under this Law as if the relevant matter had been decided under this Law.  7The original complaint was made under the Chiropractors Act , s26, which relevantly provided as follows:  (1)  A complaint may be made under this Act concerning:  (a)  the professional conduct of a registered chiropractor, or  (b)  the provision of a chiropractic service by a registered chiropractor  (2)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), a complaint may be made that a registered chiropractor:  (a)  has, either in or outside New South Wales, been convicted of or made the subject of a criminal finding for an offence, and the circumstances of the offence are such as to render the chiropractor unfit in the public interest to be registered as a chiropractor, or  (b)  is guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional misconduct, or  (c)  is not competent to practise chiropractic, or  (d)  suffers from an impairment, or  (e)  is not of good character.  (3)  A complaint need not be made in terms that are strictly in accordance with the terminology of this section.  (4)  In determining for the purposes of this Act whether a chiropractor is of good character regard may be had to conduct of the chiropractor before becoming registered as a chiropractor.   Ground 1 - Complaint 1  8I turn to the first ground of appeal, which pertains to Complaint 1.  It will be seen, from s 26(2)(a), that the subject matter of a complaint within that provision has two elements:  first, conviction of an offence, and secondly, that the circumstances of the offence are such as to render the chiropractor unfit in the public interest to be registered.  9On 18 May 2007, the Chiropractor was convicted in the Downing Centre Local Court of an offence against Summary Offences Act , s 5, of ""exposing his person in or within view from a public place"".  The Chiropractor pleaded not guilty, and gave evidence before the Magistrate to the effect that he had not wilfully and obscenely exposed his person on 16 September 2006 as alleged, but that such exposure as had occurred was unintended and accidental.  10The complainant's evidence, accepted by the Magistrate, whose decision was upheld on appeal to the District Court, was that prior to entering a jewellery shop in which the complainant (a young woman of about eighteen years of age) was working, the Chiropractor had been staring at her from outside the shop, making her feel uncomfortable.  He then entered the shop, and she again felt uncomfortable.  He was looking at some display cases.  She picked up a piece of jewellery that had fallen to the floor, he moved, and as she was getting up she was faced with his fully exposed penis.  She was shocked and fairly shortly thereafter gained the attention of a security guard.  11The Chiropractor's account, not accepted by the magistrate, was that he did not stare at the complainant; that he was some four or five metres away from her, and noticed that she was looking at his groin.  He said that he then apprehended that there was something awry, and realised that a small part of his penis was protruding from his trousers.  He said that he did not wear underwear.  He attempted to rectify the situation in the shop, and left the shopping centre in a hurried fashioned, losing his wallet on the way.  Returning to the shop later to collect his wallet, he was recognised and apprehended.  He said that the zipper in his trousers was faulty and had come apart from the bottom.  The defect in the zipper was apparently confirmed by police when they examined his trousers later that day.  12As I have said, the Chiropractor's version was not accepted by the magistrate or the District Court judge as raising a reasonable doubt.  The Tribunal was bound by the conviction, and there is nothing in its reasons to indicate that it did not regard itself as so bound, nor that it endeavoured to go behind the conviction in any relevant way.  The first element of the complaint was therefore established.  13But the second element of the complaint - whether the offence was one that rendered the Chiropractor unfit to practice - was a matter for the Tribunal, in respect of which the conviction was far from conclusive.  While conviction for some offences may not admit of doubt as to their impact on fitness, even serious offence such as manslaughter are not unambiguous in this respect.  As was said by Kitto J in the context of the legal profession in Ziems v The Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of New South Wales (1957) 97 CLR 279, (at 298):  A conviction may of its own force carry such a stigma that judges and members of the profession may be expected to find it too much for their self-respect to share with the person convicted the kind and degree of association which membership of the Bar entails.  But it will be generally agreed that there are many kinds of conduct deserving of disapproval, and many kinds of convictions of breaches of the law, which do not spell unfitness for the Bar; and to draw the dividing line is by no means always an easy task.  14The Tribunal referred to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Ex parte Tziniolis; Re The Medical Practitioners Act (1967) 84 WN (NSW) (Pt 2) 275, and in particular to the often cited passage in the judgment of Holmes JA (at 300-301):  Medical practitioners occupy positions of trust.  An inability to withstand the importunings of the evilly disposed would disqualify, as would the propensity to exploit the gullible.  These and other defects in moral fibre may not be part of a man's reputation, but evidence of these traits must be weighed in estimating character.  Even these characteristics cannot be looked at in isolation.  The judgment as to character must be arrived at by giving due weight to all features.  Finally, the judgment must be made at the time when the court is asked to consider the application ...  ""Good character"" is not a summation of acts alone, but relates rather to the quality of a person.  The quality is to be judged by acts and motives, that is to say, behaviour and mental and emotional situations accompanying that behaviour.  However, character cannot always be estimated by one act or one class of act.  As much about a person as is known will form the evidence from which the inference of good character or not of good character is drawn.  15In considering whether a practitioner is, within the meaning of the Chiropractors Act, ""unfit in the public interest to be recognised as a chiropractor"", similar considerations to those referred to by Holmes JA apply.  16In forming that judgment, the Tribunal took into account the Chiropractor's background, education, work history and practice history.  It also took into account that the District Court judge had found that he was of prior good character, as attested to by a significant number of witnesses.  The Tribunal referred at length to the report of an eminent psychologist, Dr Lennings, who concluded that the Chiropractor had good impulse control, was in the ""moderately low risk category"" on a test that was a predictor of sexual recidivism, and was ""a low risk"" under a dynamic risk assessment.  The Tribunal concluded that, while the offence was committed on 26 September 2006, the Chiropractor had been practicing as a chiropractor since that time; that the offence was an isolated incident and that the Chiropractor had not come under notice from any authority nor was there any evidence of him committing any offence of a like nature prior to or since the offence; that the District Court judge had found that the Chiropractor was otherwise of good character; and that there was no evidence before the Tribunal to suggest that, apart from the offence, the Chiropractor was not of good character.  17At paragraph 30 of its judgment, the Tribunal concluded:  The Tribunal finds that Complaint One proven to the extent of the Chiropractor having been convicted of an offence, however, with a condition on practice, finds that the practitioner is able to remain registered.  In other words, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the second element of the complaint was satisfied, as referred in paragraph 1 of its reasons, already set out, where the Tribunal found that it was not satisfied that the Chiropractor was unfit in the public interest to be registered as a chiropractor.  18However, that conclusion appears to have been influenced by the view expressed in paragraph 30 that it could impose a condition on his practicing, as a risk mitigation strategy.  The Commission challenged this on two grounds:  first, that the Tribunal had no power to impose such a condition in the absence of a finding that the complaint was proved; and secondly, that the perceived need for such a condition bespoke unfitness.  19As to the first of those matters, the powers of the Tribunal to impose a condition are the same as those of the Chiropractors Board, and are contained in and conferred by Chiropractors Act, s 51(1)(d).  That provision allows the Board to ""direct that such conditions relating the person's practice of chiropractic as it considers appropriate be imposed on the person's registration"".  Section 50 of the Act makes explicit that the powers reposed in the Board or the Tribunal by s 51 are conditional upon the Board or the Tribunal, as the case may be, having found the subject matter of a complaint of the kind referred to in s 26(2) proved.  20The Tribunal did not find a complaint of that type to have been proved.  What it said in paragraph 1 of its reasons is entirely to the contrary of such a finding.  In those circumstances, it had no power to impose the condition that it imposed.  On the other hand, in reaching the conclusion that the Chiropractor was not unfit, it took into account the circumstance that it proposed to impose that condition.   In that way, I think the Commission's contention that the Tribunal's decision was infected by error of law is established.  21As to the second matter, the Commission contends that the perceived requirement for a chaperone condition is inherently inconsistent with a conclusion that the Chiropractor remains fit to be registered as such, referring for that purpose to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Health Care Complaints Commission v Litchfield (1997) 41 NSWLR 630, in which the following view was expressed (at 639):  The majority thus found that the appellant could not be trusted to observe proper professionals standards of his conduct towards female patients unless a female chaperone was present throughout.  With the greatest of respect, the necessity for imposing such conditions on the appellant's jurisdiction demonstrated he was unfit to practise medicine.  In those circumstances the only appropriate order is one dismissing his appeal.  22As Ms McNaughton accepts in her submissions, it is important not to over-generalise from that statement in Litchfield .  Conditions are imposed for a variety of reasons, as the Court of Appeal subsequently explained in Health Care Complaints Commission v Wingate (2007) 70 NSWLR 323, where Basten JA said (at [62]):  In relation to the Health Care Complaints Commission v Litchfield , care must be taken, as the Commission recognised in its written submissions, in deriving a principle of over-general application from the circumstances of a particular case.  It might be argued from Health Care Complaints Commission v Litchfield that a condition ought only be imposed to provide necessary protection to the patients of a practitioner, but that if such a condition is reasonably necessary, the practitioner must lack a pre-condition to entitlement to continued practise and accordingly the need to impose a condition demonstrates unfitness to practise.  Clearly that reasoning is, when stated at that level of generality, fallacious.  Conditions may be imposed in varying circumstances and for various purposes.  The circumstances and purposes will always be important, in part because of the need for the Tribunal to be satisfied that the condition will be effective.  In the present case, the practitioner had committed no misconduct of a ""hands-on"" kind; there had been no inappropriate conduct of a sexual kind with any patient or indeed with any non-patient.  23The relevant conduct in that case was the private viewing of pornographic material involving persons under sixteen years of age.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal from the Tribunal's refusal to find the practitioner unfit, but imposed a restriction that he not attend, treat or perform operations on patients under eighteen years of age.  24Conditions are not necessarily imposed because of a finding that there is, in their absence, a probability, or even an unacceptable risk, of inappropriate behaviour.  They are often imposed as a means of securing and maintaining public confidence in the profession when the slightest doubt arises.  The imposition of a condition of this kind does not necessarily bespeak that there is otherwise an unacceptable risk in allowing the practitioner to continue to practise.  In this case, it is clear from the Tribunal's reasoning that it was satisfied that there was a low risk of recidivism.  The Tribunal referred, in particular, to Dr Lennings' evidence that the Chiropractor presented as a low risk, but also that in the working environment of a chiropractor (which necessarily involves being alone with people and engaging in legitimate physical touching), the opportunity for recidivism was enhanced.  It was to guard against that possibility - albeit one it regarded as remote - that the Tribunal imposed the chaperone condition.  It reflected the Tribunal's perception that notwithstanding the low risk of recidivism, in this particular work environment, more abundant caution suggested the presence of a chaperone condition be required.  To my mind, that process of reasoning does not bespeak a conclusion that the practitioner lacked the necessary quality of fitness to practise, and  I therefore do not accept that the Tribunal erred in this respect.  25I shall return to the consequences of the conclusion that the Tribunal erred in law in imposing a chaperone condition when it did not have power to do so, and in taking into account its ability to impose such a condition in connection with the conclusion that the chiropractor was not unfit after dealing with the other grounds of appeal.  Ground 2 - Complaint 2  26I turn then to the second ground of appeal, which pertains to the second complaint.  As the Commission accepts, the appeal is limited by Health Practitioner Regulation National Law, s 162, to a question of law.  To show that the Tribunal erred in law in failing to find that the Chiropractor was not of good character, it must be shown that the Tribunal either was bound to conclude on the proved facts that the Chiropractor was not of good character, or that it misapprehended its task.  In an appeal from a decision limited to one on point of law, an appellate court is not entitled to reach its own conclusion on the facts.  It can intervene only if upon comparing the primary facts found with the ultimate conclusion reached, it is demonstrated that the Tribunal must have applied an incorrect test [see Hope v The Council of City of Bathurst (1980) 44 CLR 1; Azzopardi v Tasman UEB Industries Ltd (1985) 4 NSWLR 139; McBride v Walton [1994] NSWCA 199].  Essentially, this ground amounts to a contention that the Tribunal's conclusion that it was not established that the Chiropractor was not of good character is necessarily inconsistent with the primary facts found by the Tribunal.  In a comparable setting, the Court of Appeal recently, in Health Care Complaints Commission v Karalasingham [2007] NSWCA 267, explained that if facts inferred from the evidence are necessarily within the description of a word or phrase in a statute or necessarily outside that description, a contrary decision will be wrong in law.  27Both McBride v Walton and Health Care Complaints Commission v Karalasingham concerned the statutory phrase ""not of good character"", in the context of decision by a Medical Tribunal.  In Karalasingham, the Court of Appeal held that those words did not bear a special or technical meaning but were used in their ordinary meaning, and that although determining the ordinary meaning of a word had traditionally been identified as a question of fact, there was no clear distinction between ascertaining the ordinary meaning of a word and the construction of a term the meaning of which was established.  Hence, the construction of a statutory provision would usually involve a consideration of its words, the context in which they appear and the underlying purpose of the statute, and this process would usually involve a question of law.  However, as Basten JA (with whom Giles JA and Bergin J agreed) pointed out (at [55]), in order to establish error on the part of the Medical Tribunal, it would be necessary to establish that the Tribunal misunderstood the nature of the task on which it had embarked: the mere fact that another decision maker might have made a different factual finding in a matter of evaluative judgment would be insufficient to demonstrate error of law.  28Karalasingham concerned a medical practitioner who had provided false medical certificates to three non-citizens who held study visas, for the purpose of justifying their non-attendance at university classes, so that they could maintain the requisite 80% attendance record.  Basten JA (at [69]), observed that dishonesty in medical practice was a matter of some seriousness, but that there were degrees of dishonest conduct.  Ultimately, no relevant error was demonstrated in the manner in which the Tribunal assessed the circumstances that led to its dismissal of the complaint that he was not of good character.  29McBride v Walton, another case concerning complaints against a medical practitioner to the Medical Tribunal, demonstrates how in the circumstances of a particular case different minds may evaluate facts differently: while Kirby P found that it was not open to the Tribunal to reach a conclusion of want of good character, Handley and Powell JJA were of the opposite view.  The significance of this is that, in the context of an evaluative judgment as to whether the proved particulars establish an absence of good character, an appellant - whether an unsuccessful practitioner or an unsuccessful complainant - bears a considerable burden.  30In this case, three matters were relied on by the Commission by way of particulars of want of good character.  The first was the conviction to which I have referred; the second was the giving of false evidence by the Chiropractor before the Magistrate in the prosecution for the offence; and the third (which overlaps with Complaint Three, to which I shall in due course come) was the failure to give timely notice to the Board of his conviction.  31As to the third matter, at this stage it suffices to say that having been convicted on 18 May 2007, his solicitor sent a letter to the board on 27 May 2007 informing it of the conviction.  The Board received the letter on 28 May 2007.  The Act required that notice be given within seven days.  On the most adverse view, this was three days late.  To my mind, it is impossible to see how that particular bears any relevance to the Chiropractor's character.  32As to the conviction, the impact of criminal convictions on practitioners in the context of an assessment as to their character will vary widely.  This is demonstrated by a wide range of cases, including Wingate , to which I have already referred.  In Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of New South Wales v P [2003] NSWCA 320, which concerned a solicitor who had become addicted to heroin and subsequently was convicted of importing cocaine from South America to Australia when returning from a vacation there.  The solicitor had pleaded guilty to importing cocaine to Australia and was sentenced by a District Court judge to six months imprisonment.  In the ensuing disciplinary proceedings for her removal from the roll, the Court of Appeal, having regard to character evidence adduced in her case, concluded that she was not shown to be unfit to remain on the roll at the time of the hearing before it.  In A Solicitor v Council of the Law Society of New South Wales (2002) 216 CLR 253, a solicitor had pleaded guilty to four counts of aggravated indecent assault on persons under the age of sixteen years with whom he stood in a step parental relationship.  In subsequent disciplinary proceedings, the High Court allowed an appeal from the Court of Appeal's order that he be struck off the Roll of Practitioners, and substituted an order that he be suspended from practice for five years, which had expired by the time of the hearing before the High Court - notwithstanding that it was also found by the Court of Appeal that the solicitor had been less than frank with his professional association and had committed a breach of candour in that respect.  In the well-known case of Ziems v The Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of New South Wales (1957) 97 CLR 279, the appellant barrister had been convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to two years imprisonment with hard labour, and subsequently removed by the Full Court of the Supreme Court from the roll of barristers on account of his conviction and sentence.  The High Court substituted an order that he be suspended from practise during the continuance of his present imprisonment, but did not find him unfit to remain on the roll once he returned to liberty.  33The above cases demonstrate, if demonstration be required, that convictions for quite serious offences do not necessarily mean that a professional practitioner is deprived of the quality of good character required as a condition of fitness to practise.  In the scope of things, the crime of which the Chiropractor here was convicted is towards the lower end of the scale described by the cases to which I have just referred.  34So far as the second particular to Complaint Two is concerned, the Tribunal characterises this at paragraph 31 of its reasons as ""the ongoing reluctance of the Chiropractor to admit the facts of wilful and indecent exposure as proven and upheld at appeal"".  Significantly, that very statement answers the Commission's submission that the Tribunal failed to take into account the circumstances that he must have given untrue evidence in answer to the charge.  35There are many reasons why persons find it difficult to admit wrongdoing after the event and persist in denying it even in courts.  No doubt it is generally regarded as a good indication for rehabilitation that a person who has committed an offence admits guilt and repents.  However, embarrassment, pride, shame and all manner of human factors also tell on whether men and women are prepared to do so.  Although, like the Tribunal, I do not for a moment attempt to go behind the findings of the District Court, it must also be recognised that persons who have been found guilty of misconduct can honestly believe that the tribunal that convicted them was wrong.  36An eloquent statement of the difficulties that arise if too stringent a view is maintained in this respect is to be found in the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in In the Matter of Alger Hiss (1975) Mass 333 N.E.2d 429.  Alger Hiss was struck off the roll of Massachusetts lawyers in August 1952 having been convicted in 1950 of two counts of perjury on an indictment by a Federal Grand Jury, following the sensational testimony of former Communist Party member and Soviet spy Whittaker Chambers before the United States House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities.  Chambers had testified that Hiss, a former clerk to Holmes J of the US Supreme Court and employee of the US State Department, was a committed communist and had been involved in espionage activities on behalf of the Soviet Union from the late 1930's.  The relevant grounds on which the grand jury had found that Hiss had falsely testified were 1) that he or his wife had never turned over any documents of the US State Department or any other US government organisation to Chambers, or made copies of such documents and turned over such copies to Chambers; and 2) that he definitely had not seen Chambers after 1 January 1937.  Hiss appealed his conviction, which was affirmed on appeal [ United States v Hiss (1950) 185 F.2d 822].  A subsequent application for a writ of certiorari before the US Supreme Court was refused [ United States v Hiss (1951) S.Ct 532].  Hiss served a term of imprisonment for three and a half years.  Throughout his trial and subsequent appeals and during his petition for reinstatement on the roll of Massachusetts lawyers, Hiss continued to protest his innocence.  In 1974 he filed a petition for reinstatement as an attorney.  A central issue for the Court was whether statements of repentance or recognition of guilt were prerequisites to reinstatement.  Hiss came before the court as a convicted perjurer.  The relevant professional board who had prepared a report for the court in relation to Hiss' readmission had noted, according to Tauro CJ who delivered the judgment of the Court (at 435):  ... the task of a petitioner such as Mr Hiss, who continues to assert his innocence, to satisfy this Board of his present good character, becomes logically impossible ...  So long as Mr Hiss' conviction stands, and so long as he continues to deny his guilt of an offence of which he was convicted ... the petitioner has not satisfied us that his readmission would not be detrimental to the standing of the Bar, the administration of justice or to the public interest.  37Tauro CJ observed (at 436) that ""mere words of repentance are easily uttered and just as easily forgotten.""  His Honour continued (at 436-437):  The continued assertion of innocence in the face of prior conviction does not, as might be argued, constitute conclusive proof of lack of the necessary moral character to merit reinstatement.  Though we deem prior judgments dispositive of all factual issues and deny attorneys subject to disciplinary proceedings the right to relitigate issues of guilt, we recognise that a convicted person may on sincere reasoning believe himself to be innocent.  We also take cognizance of Hiss' argument that miscarriages of justice are possible.  Basically, his underlying theory is that innocent men conceivably could be convicted, that a contrary view would place a mantle of absolute and inviolate perfection on our system of justice, and that this is an attribute that cannot be claimed for any human institution or activity.  We do not believe we can say with certainty in this case, or perhaps any case, what is the true state of mind of the petitioner.  Thus, we cannot say that every person who, under oath, protests his innocence after conviction and refuses to repent is committing perjury.  Simple fairness and fundamental justice demand that the person who believes he is innocent though convicted should not be required to confess guilt to a criminal act he honestly believes he did not commit.  For him, a rule requiring admission of guilt and repentance creates a cruel quandary:  he may stand mute and lose his opportunity; or he may cast aside his hard-retained scruples and, paradoxically, commit what he regards as perjury to prove his worthiness to practice law.  Men who are honest would prefer to relinquish the opportunity conditioned by this rule:  ""Circumstances may be made to bring innocence under the penalties of the law.  If so brought, escape by confession of guilt may be rejected - preferring to be the victim of the law rather than its acknowledged transgressor - preferring death even to such certain infamy""...  Honest men would suffer permanent disbarment under such a rule.  Others, less sure of their moral positions, would be tempted to commit perjury by admitting to a nonexistent offence (or to an offence they believe is nonexistent) to secure reinstatement.  So regarded, this rule, intended to maintain the integrity of the bar, would encourage corruption in these latter petitioners for reinstatement and, again paradoxically, might permit reinstatement of those least fit to serve.  We do not consider in this context the person who admits committing the alleged criminal act but honestly believes it is not unlawful.  38In this case, the matter relied on in the particulars to Complaint Two is the putting forward of a defence to the initial prosecution in the Local Court, which the Court has been told that the Chiropractor did so again in the District Court, which might be implicit in the fact that there was an appeal, it is not apparent that he actually gave evidence in the District Court; in any event, it is not the subject of a particular and it would be inappropriate in those circumstances to take it into account.  39The Court was also informed that the Chiropractor maintained his innocence before the Tribunal.  This can well be inferred from paragraph 20 of the Tribunal's reasons.  However, this was not relied on by the Commission before the Tribunal as a particular going to the Chiropractor not being of good character.  If it were to be relied upon, an amendment - or at the very least notice of some sort - would have been required [see Smith v New South Wales Bar Association (1992) at 176 CLR 256; and McBride v Walton, which also reaffirmed that reliance by a disciplinary tribunal upon dishonesty outside particulars provided, including any conduct before the tribunal, amounts to procedural unfairness, at least unless those matters are charged and particularised].  40In my view, the Tribunal took into account the relevant considerations on forming an ultimate conclusion as to whether or not the Chiropractor was shown to be not of good character.  The proven facts did not dictate that the only possible outcome was that he was not of good character.   The Tribunal's approach, far from demonstrating that it did not understand or misconceive its task, in fact (at [18]) referred to the relevant test enunciated by Holmes JA in Ex parte Tziniolis, and took into account all that was known about the Chiropractor to form its conclusion, including the conviction and his ongoing reluctance to admit the offence.  That others might have reached a different view does not mean that the Tribunal erred in law in that respect.  Ground 3 - Complaint 3  41Chiropractors Act, s 21(1)(a) provided at the relevant time as follows:  A registered chiropractor must notify the Board in writing within seven days after:  (a) the chiropractor is convicted of an offence ... in this State or elsewhere, giving details of the conviction or criminal finding and any penalty imposed for the offence.  42As I have already recorded, having been convicted on 18 May 2007, the Chiropractor's solicitor sent a letter to the Board on 27 May which was received on 28 May.  The complaint appears to be then that the Chiropractor was, at worst, two or three days late in providing that notice.  44Chiropractors Act, s 25(b), defines ""unsatisfactory professional conduct"" to include ""a contravention by the chiropractor of a provision of this Act or the regulations or of a condition of the chiropractor's registration"".  Technically, even one day's delay in complying with s 21(1)(a) is, by definition, unsatisfactory professional conduct.  45The Tribunal said (at [33]):  The circumstances in relation to the Chiropractor failing to notify the Registration Board within 7 days of his conviction as required by Chiropractor's Act, s 21(1)(a), are such that the Tribunal finds that the breach has been committed but does not find that he is guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct. The Chiropractor was represented by a solicitor, a Mr Bryne.  The conviction was recorded on the 18 th May, 2007. The Board should have received notification on Friday the 25 th May, 2007, but did not receive it until Monday the 28 th May, 2007.  The Tribunal is of the opinion that the Chiropractor was aware of his obligation to notify the Board and relied upon his solicitor whose letter was in fact only one working day late. The Tribunal therefore finds that the Chiropractor is not guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct in relation to Complaint Three.  46For my part, I cannot understand why this complaint was brought.  As the Tribunal points out, the conviction having been recorded on 18 May 2007, the Chiropractor should have informed the Board by 25 May, which was a Friday, and the Board received the notice only one working day late, on Monday 28 May.  Although I cannot pretend to know all the factors that might have informed an exercise of the prosecutorial discretion to bring it, it is, of course, well-established that just because of an offence under the criminal law might be capable of being established does not mean that it is always appropriate to prosecute it, and the same principle applies in the disciplinary jurisdiction.  I am even more mystified as to why one working day's delay has attracted so vigorous a response, when - having been notified of the conviction in May 2007 - it took the Commission until 12 October 2009 to institute proceedings in the Tribunal - although, of course, I do not know the total of the investigative procedures that were undertaken in the interim.  47Mr Dailly, for the defendant, has conceded that there is an error of law in this respect, in that upon a proper application of the definition contained in the Chiropractors Act , a conclusion that the Chiropractor was in that respect guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct was inevitable, on account of even one day's delay.  Having reached that conclusion, it remains to consider what the outcome should be.  Consequential Orders  48It follows that Ground 1 succeeds in part, and Ground 3 succeeds.  In such circumstances Health Practitioner Regulation National Law, s 162A, provides as follows:  162A   Powers of Supreme Court on appeal [NSW]  (1)  In deciding the appeal, the Supreme Court may-  (a)  dismiss the appeal; or  (b)  make the order it thinks proper having regard to the merits of the case and the public welfare, and in doing so may exercise any one or more of the powers of the Tribunal under this Law.  (2)  If the Supreme Court dismisses an appeal against an order of the Tribunal, the Court may by order direct that the Tribunal's order is to be taken to include provision that an application for its review under Subdivision 3 of Division 6 may not be made until after a specified time.  49As to Complaint 3, in my view, no disciplinary order is called for, and it would be entirely inappropriate to exercise any disciplinary power in respect of it.  In effect, I approach it as one might in a criminal matter apply (NSW) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 10, which allows a court upon finding a person guilty of an offence to order that the relevant charge be dismissed where the court is satisfied that it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment on the person having regard, amongst other things, to the trivial nature of the offence .  50I return now to Complaint One.  As I have said, I have found that the Tribunal erred in law in the approach that it took.   On the other hand, my conclusion that the Tribunal did not err in law by concluding that it was not established that in respect of Complaint Two the Chiropractor was other than of good character, and that a finding of unfitness was not the only conclusion open on the primary facts found, informs a conclusion as to whether he was shown to not be a fit and proper person to remain in the public interest on the Register of Chiropractors.  51It needs to be borne in mind that, while it is true - as Ms McNaughton has submitted - that the conduct of the Chiropractor in this case took place in the presence of a person (as distinct from Wingate, where it was the reading of material), there was no physical contact.  It did not take place in the context of the Chiropractor's professional practice, and there was, as I have said, powerful evidence to suggest that it was a one-off, isolated incident.  52Although it seems to me that the Tribunal was not entitled to impose the condition of practise that it imposed, the Chiropractor has offered an undertaking to this Court, in the same terms as that condition.  In Prothonotary v P , to which I have referred, while dismissing the Prothonotary's application, the Court took into account that the solicitor offered to the Court to agree to have attached to her practising certificate any reasonable condition considered appropriate by the Law Society to the effect that she undergo regular urinalysis or other regular medical examination to ensure that she had not taken any illicit drugs.  53In my view, in this case I can proceed on the basis that while this Court, in place of the Tribunal, will not exercise a power to impose a condition, it can and will accept the undertaking that has been proffered, which provides comfort to the Court, as the condition did to the Tribunal, that no unacceptable risk to the public interest is involved in his remaining registered.  54Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the Chiropractor is unfit in the public person to be registered as a chiropractor.  It follows that, although I have found that the Tribunal's decision is in some respects affected by error of law, the ultimate outcome will not differ, in substance from the orders of the Tribunal.  While I sympathise with the view that errors need to be corrected, I do not think too many issues will arise from an error of the kind made in the Chiropractor's Tribunal.  It seems to me that the Commission has, in practical terms, not succeeded in substance in improving its position before this Court, whereas the Chiropractor has been put to the expense of defending an appeal, which he has done successfully.  55My orders are as follows:  In respect of Complaint 1:  1.1 Order that paragraph 4 of the order of the Chiropractors Tribunal of New South Wales in the matter of Health Care Complaints Commission v Stoker [2010] NSWCHT made on 25 August 2010 be set aside.  1.2 Upon Kristin Scott Stoker undertaking to the court that he will agree to the imposition by the Chiropractor's Board on his registration, of a condition for a period of two years from 25 August 2010, that when assessing or treating any female patient under 45 years of age there must be present in the treatment room for the duration of the visit an adult female person, unless the patient is accompanied by any person or guardian who is male and the patient consents to that person being present, otherwise dismiss the appeal from the Chiropractor's Tribunal of New South Wales decision on Complaint One.   In respect of Complaint 2:  2.Dismiss the appeal from the Chiropractor's Tribunal of New South Wales decision on Complaint Two.  In respect of Complaint 3:  3.Allow the appeal from the Chiropractors Tribunal of New South Wales decision on Complaint Three.  4.Pursuant to Health Practitioners Regulation National, s 162A, I substitute a finding that Kristin Scott Stoker was guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct as alleged in Complaint Three.  5.Decline to exercise any power under Chiropractors Act , s 50 and s 51, in respect of that finding of unsatisfactory unprofessional conduct.  Costs  6.Order that the Health Care Complaints Commission pay Kristin Scott Stoker's costs of the appeal.  **********

Crown case 

7It was common ground that the complainant was at the time of the events married to Mr Homsi, and that she was living along with both appellants and the four children of the marriage in rented premises at Condell Park. The four children of the marriage included three girls who were going to school, and a younger boy, who was aged three and was not going to school. 

8The complainant gave evidence to the following effect: 

(1) In 2008, having separated from Mr Homsi in 2004, the complainant took a lease on the Condell Park house, and moved in with the four children. Against her wishes, Mr Homsi moved in with Ms Karamalakis, and they first took over the main bedroom, causing the complainant to sleep in the lounge room or sometimes in her son's room. (However, her later evidence, including a diagram drawn by her (Ex H9), was that at the time of the alleged offences the complainant was sleeping in what appears to have been the main bedroom, identified as bedroom 1, and that the appellants were sleeping in another bedroom, identified as bedroom 4.) 

(2) Up until the week of 20 October 2008, the complainant would normally take the three girls to school, driving a Tarago car registered in her name. The complainant had a mobile phone, but Mr Homsi used to take it with him; and the last time she had it was Sunday 19 October 2008. 

(3) On Monday 20 October 2008, the complainant spoke to Mr Homsi's mother on the phone and told her that Mr Homsi and Ms Karamalakis had been hitting her and screaming at her. At about 11 pm that night, Mr Homsi called the complainant to his room, and Mr Homsi and Ms Karamalakis questioned her about that phone call. Mr Homsi then asked for the children's birth certificates, passports and blue books. The complainant gave him the birth certificates and passports, but could only find two of the blue books. Mr Homsi told her to look for the others. The complainant went to her room to do so, and as she was doing so Mr Homsi grabbed her by the hair, hit her with his fist to the right side of her head (count 1), and swore at her. Mr Homsi took her jewellery and told her to choose what she wanted because he was giving the rest to Ms Karamalakis. The complainant said no, and Mr Homsi punched her. Mr Homsi then woke up their son and took him into his room, and then called the complainant in and asked for her handbag. The complainant got it from the kitchen and gave it to him; and he took the complainant's bankcard, concession card, driver's licence and Medicare card. Mr Homsi then demanded her wallet, and she said she did not have one. Ms Karamalakis accused her of lying. Mr Homsi asked her for the car keys, and the complainant got them from the kitchen and gave them to him; and Mr Homsi said she was no longer allowed to take the car out and it belonged to him. Mr Homsi gave her their son and told her to go and clean the house and that she was not allowed to sleep that night. He also struck her again (count 2). 

(4) The following morning, Tuesday 21 October 2008, the complainant dressed the three girls for school, and knocked on the appellants' bedroom door to wake Mr Homsi to take the girls to school. Ms Karamalakis told her that Mr Homsi was asleep, and threw the car keys to the complainant and told her to take them herself. The complainant took the girls to school, driving without her licence because Mr Homsi had taken it. Her son was also with her. 

(5) After dropping the children to school, she called Mr Homsi's mother from a pay phone, and arranged to meet her. She told Mr Homsi's mother that the appellants had been treating her like a slave and that Mr Homsi was hitting her. Mr Homsi's mother told her to go back home and that things would change. (It was put to the complainant in cross-examination, and denied, that she had taken her son to the doctor that day.) The complainant returned home with her son. The appellants were waiting in the driveway. Mr Homsi opened the car door and grabbed the complainant by her hijab and pulled her hair as she was taking her son out of the baby seat. He pulled her inside the house into the lounge-room and kicked her on the legs, punched her to the head and pulled her hair. The complainant pleaded to Ms Karamalakis for help, but Ms Karamalakis told her she deserved it. Mr Homsi got a stool with metal legs from the kitchen and struck her forearms as she put them up to defend herself. The complainant went to the kitchen and Mr Homsi followed her there, and punched her in the face causing her nose to bleed. He obtained a black stick with two red bands on it from his and Ms Karamalakis' bedroom, and returned to the lounge-room and struck the complainant on the legs with it (count 4). 

(6) At about 2 pm the appellants left to pick up the girls from school, taking her son with them. Mr Homsi told the complainant that she was not to open door for or speak to anyone, and that she was not even to go outside to take the rubbish because he did not want anyone to see her bruises. He told her that if she left the house he and Ms Karamalakis would take her to the cemetery and bury her there. The complainant felt drowsy and exhausted, her hair had been pulled out and she could not stand on her feet. There was no landline in the house and Mr Homsi had taken her mobile phone. While the appellants were out, the complainant picked up the clumps of hair that had been pulled from her head and put them in a bin so they would not be on the floor when the appellants returned. At about 3pm, Mr Homsi's mother came to the house. The complainant told her what had happened and showed her a bruise, and asked for her help. Mr Homsi's mother left prior to the appellants coming home. 

(7) At about 5 pm the appellants returned with the four children. They were all in the kitchen. Mr Homsi grabbed a 2.5 litre bottle of juice and hit the complainant over the head with it four or five times. The complainant fell to the floor, she could not see properly and noticed blood from her nose (count 5). Her daughter asked her if she was all right and if she wanted her to get some water, and her daughter was shaking; and Ms Karamalakis said to her ""No, your mum is acting"". 

(8) At about 7.30 pm that night, Mr Homsi's brother Rabi came to the house. He asked how she was and she showed him her hands. She was crying when she said this and Rabi went out to the garage. (In cross-examination, the complainant disagreed that Rabi had in fact come on Wednesday 22 October 2008.) At the time, the complainant was in pain. She had not dared leave the house earlier in the day when she was alone because Mr Homsi had warned that if she did he would do something bad to her. Also, the complainant did not want to run away without all her children. 

(9) On Wednesday 22 October 2008, the complainant got the girls ready and the appellants took them to school. Her son remained with the complainant. Ms Karamalakis told the complainant to keep looking for the blue books, and also to clean up the kitchen and that if it was not clean then she was going to punch her. The complainant felt like a slave to her. The complainant did not leave the house while they were out because she did not have all her children with her. 

(10) When the appellants returned, Ms Karamalakis went to get something out of her bedroom. On the way out, she pushed the complainant by the shoulders against the wall of the hallway and said ""did you find the blue book you bitch?"" The complainant replied that she had not and Ms Karamalakis said ""Keep looking for it, either way I'm going to break your head"" (count 11). 

(11) At about 2.30 pm the appellants left to pick up the girls from school, and they returned about 3.30 pm. Again, the complainant did not leave, because she did not want to leave without all her children. 

(12) At about 10 pm that night the complainant went to bed. At about midnight she was woken up by Mr Homsi with a punch to the head (count 6). She saw both appellants standing over her. Mr Homsi said to her, ""You done it on purpose, you freaking bitch, the hot water is off"". The appellants then left and the complainant went back to sleep. 

(13) On Thursday 23 October 2008, the complainant dressed the three girls for school. The appellants left with them at about 8.30 am leaving the boy with the complainant. The complainant did not leave because she was bruised and swollen and could not walk properly. She was afraid that if Mr Homsi discovered that she had run away that she would be in more trouble from him because he had threatened to kill her if she called the police or spoke to someone. In addition she did not want to leave without the three girls. At about 2.30 pm the appellants left to pick the girls up from school, and at about 3.30 pm Mr Homsi and the girls returned without Ms Karamalakis. At about 3 pm Mr Homsi's mother came to the house, and she was still there when Mr Homsi returned. 

(14) When Mr Homsi returned, there was a question and answer about what the complainant had made the children for lunch, after which Mr Homsi slapped the complainant across the face and grabbed her by the hair and started kicking her in front of his mother and the children. His mother told him to stop. Mr Homsi said that the complainant was his wife and he could do whatever he wanted to her. 

(15) Between 5 pm and 6 pm, Mr Homsi left to pick up Ms Karamalakis. Mr Homsi told the complainant not to open the door for anyone and not to go outside for anything. The complainant felt like she needed to do something about her situation but she was afraid. She felt tired and helpless, and was in pain and unable to walk properly. 

(16) After Mr Homsi finished eating dinner, he went to his bedroom and called out to Ms Karamalakis who also went into the bedroom. Then they both called out to the complainant. The complainant was standing in the doorway of her bedroom when Mr Homsi asked her where the speeding fine was. The complainant was afraid to tell him. Mr Homsi grabbed her by the hair and pushed her into her bedroom and began punching her to the head with his first. She fell to the ground and Mr Homsi kicked her all over her body. She begged him to stop. She saw that he had clumps of hair in his hand (count 7). In the meantime, Ms Karamalakis was going through clothes in the complainant's closet, and after obtaining a pair of scissors commenced cutting up the complainant's clothing (count 15). Mr Homsi kicked her. He lit a cigarette, and with the lighter in his hand began hitting her on the back of the head. The complainant was on the floor at that time, and Ms Karamalakis was still in the room (count 12). 

(17) At about midnight, the complainant went to her son's bedroom and sat on his bed. At about half an hour after midnight, on Friday 24 October 2008, the complainant heard Ms Karamalakis call out to Mr Homsi that she had found a Centrelink statement, and the appellants came to her son's room. Mr Homsi told the complainant that Ms Karamalakis believed that, according to the Centrelink statement, the complainant had hidden $4,000. The complainant denied this. 

(18) At about 2 am, the appellants called the complainant to the lounge-room and questioned her about money. She denied she was hiding money from them. Mr Homsi started kicking the complainant in the legs, with Ms Karamalakis sitting on the lounge watching (count 8). Mr Homsi then asked for the registration papers for her car, the Tarago. The complainant got them from the right bedside table and gave them to him. Mr Homsi told her to sign the papers, otherwise he would kill her. She initially refused, but Mr Homsi then grabbed her and told her to do it as the vehicle now belonged to Ms Karamalakis. The complainant then signed the transfer paper. The complainant saw Mr Homsi fill in the rest of the document and give the keys to Ms Karamalakis. 

(19) At one point when the complainant was standing in the doorway between the lounge-room and the hallway, Mr Homsi got up and told her that she was a ""filthy bitch"" and that she deserved it, and then urinated on her in front of Ms Karamalakis (count 10). Mr Homsi then told the complainant to clean it up, and the complainant mopped the floor. Mr Homsi then continued to kick her. The complainant sat on the lounge, and Ms Karamalakis said to Mr Homsi that she wanted to get some pliers and cut off the complainant's fingers, and that she wanted to get some duct tape and do things to her. Mr Homsi told Ms Karamalakis to go and get the duct tape. This took place between 4.30 and 5 am. The appellants then questioned the complainant about money and said they wanted $40,000 back, which they calculated to be the amount she owed to them. 

(20) Some time later Mr Homsi fell asleep on the lounge. A little later the complainant was making school lunches for the girls, and Ms Karamalakis said she was not allowed to speak to or go near her children. The complainant went to the girls' bedroom and Ms Karamalakis pushed her from the back of the shoulders out of the kids' bedroom. The complainant went to the kitchen and Ms Karamalakis followed her. Ms Karamalakis grabbed the complainant by the hair and was trying to drop her cigarette ash on her, and then touched the complainant's hand with the cigarette (count 13). Ms Karamalakis told the complainant that if she didn't tell her where the money was she was going to wake Mr Homsi up and tell him to cut her fingers off. 

(21) A little later, the complainant realised that Ms Karamalakis had fallen asleep on the lounge. She went to her children's room and told them they were leaving. She did not take anything with her except the children's school bags to make it appear that she had taken them to school. When they were outside, the complainant saw her next door neighbour parking her car and asked her to get her out of there. The neighbour dropped them off near Bankstown police station. The complainant described her state as being exhausted. She was crying and could not walk properly. She had blood coming from behind her ear and she smelled of urine. She did not have any formal identification or other documentation with her. She did not have her mobile phone, her handbag, the keys to her Tarago, the keys to the house, nor any clothing for herself or the children. 

(22) At the police station, photographs were taken of her injuries. She spoke to police and a woman from Bankstown Community Service Centre. She was then taken to Bankstown hospital by ambulance where she stayed until Monday 27 October 2008. Photographs of her injuries were also taken at the hospital. At some stage, police took her back to the house to obtain clothing for herself. The complainant never recovered her identification, driver's licence and other documents which she believed were with the appellants. She was later given assistance to change her accounts and obtain a new Medicare card. 

(23) In cross-examination, the appellants' case was put to her and denied. Also put to her were a number of inconsistencies between her evidence at the trial, her evidence at a previous trial, a Family Court affidavit and a written statement made to the police. (However, neither the police statement nor the Family Court affidavit nor her previous evidence was put into evidence at the trial.) In relation to the cigarette incident, the complainant accepted that in the police statement she had referred to the cigarette being thrown, and that the cigarette incident had not been included in her evidence in the previous trial. The complainant accepted that in her previous evidence she had said that Ms Karamalakis had pushed her against a cupboard, not against the wall, and that this incident was not included in the police statement. The complainant accepted that there was no mention in the police statement of being kidnapped, or of being beaten with an object. The appellant accepted that in the police statement she had described the first assault being slapping rather than punching. She accepted that there was no reference in the police statement to being dragged from the car by her hair. She accepted that in the police statement there was no reference to being hit by the bar stool and a stick, and that these matters were put in a different order in her evidence in the previous trial. She accepted that in the police statement she said it was Mr Homsi who made the complaint about hot water, that in her previous evidence she said it was Ms Karamalakis, whereas at the trial she said they both made the complaint. She accepted there was no reference in the police statement to Mr Homsi throwing their son against a wall, this being something included in her Family Court affidavit. She also accepted that there were different versions of the urination incident. It was put to her that she was lying about separation in 2004, in circumstances where the youngest child was born in February 2006. 

9Constable Stephen Carey gave evidence that he attended Bankstown police station at 10.20 am on Friday 24 October 2008, following a request from police radio. He saw the complainant and her four children. He asked how she was and he saw her eyes become teary and glazed and she was gasping for breath. She was wearing full-length clothing which fully covered her arms and legs, and she was wearing a hijab that covered her hair. She told him that her husband and his girlfriend had been bashing her since 7 pm the previous night, and that she was only able to leave after they had fallen asleep. When the complainant rolled up her right sleeve, Constable Carey saw swelling and redness extending from her right bicep down to her right forearm, as well as a small red wound on her right forearm where the blood had come to the surface. When the complainant rolled up her trousers, he saw extensive redness and swelling to both lower legs, and a large amount of swelling to her right leg. 

10Constable Melina Jeffrey gave evidence that she escorted the complainant to an interview room where a number of photographs were taken; and these photographs were in evidence. Constable Jeffrey could smell urine on the complainant. She observed that the complainant had trouble walking. The complainant told her that she hurt all over and that ""they"" had pulled her hair out and her head had been bleeding. Constable Jeffrey observed a patch of what appeared to be dried blood on the back of the complainant's hair. Her hair looked very thin and there appeared to be bald patches. When the complainant tried to untangle her hair with her fingers, a clump of hair came out in her fingers. Constable Jeffrey also observed extensive bruising and swelling to various parts of the complainant's body and she photographed these. The complainant told her that ""they"" had punched and kicked her, and that in relation to a welt on her arm, Constable Jeffrey believed the complainant had told her that ""she"" had thrown a cigarette at her. 

11Detective Senior Constable Helen Weston gave evidence that she observed a number of cuts and abrasions on the complainant's legs, as well as yellow coloured bruising across her lower back, forearms, thighs and shoulders. The complainant appeared timid and frightened and spoke quietly. The complainant told her that she felt pain all over, and DSC Weston observed that the complainant had difficulty walking. The complainant told DSC Weston that she was frightened of her husband and that she was afraid of what would happen to her as a result of speaking with police. Whilst a statement was being taken from her, the complainant needed to take breaks due to pain and discomfort. She was unable to sit for long periods of time and one of her feet was extremely painful. In addition, the complainant needed to comfort her children who were upset. DSC Weston found it difficult to take the statement because of the complainant's physical and mental state. 

12Constable Bradley Munro gave evidence that he observed the complainant when she presented at Bankstown police station to be red-faced and in pain. She walked slowly and found it hard to stand. She appeared glassy eyed and close to tears. 

13Amanda Gray, a paramedic gave evidence that she attended Bankstown police station at about 12.30 pm on 24 October, and examined the complainant. The complainant told her that she had been assaulted over a 12-hour period. She examined the complainant and noted a laceration in the back of the head, bruising and laceration to both ears, bruising all over her body, in particular her arms and legs, and a large bruise to her left lumbar back area. The complainant complained of pain all over but especially her arms and legs. The complainant's jeans needed to be cut because her legs were so swollen that they could not be lifted up. There was significant bruising on her legs as well. The complainant told her that her husband had urinated on her. Ms Grey did smell a urine-type smell. The complainant told Ms Grey that her husband had assaulted her with his closed fist, shoed foot and a cigarette lighter which had caused the injury to the back of her head. The complainant appeared distressed and upset about her children. She was taken to hospital by ambulance. 

14Senior Constable Claudette Gebrael gave evidence that she attended Bankstown hospital with Senior Constable McCardie and Constable Lena Bastoncino. Senior Constable Gebrael observed the complainant lying in a hospital bed wearing a hospital gown and a hijab. The complainant's arms were swollen with purple and blue-yellow bruises. Senior Constable Gebrael observed red bloody cuts and scratches across the complainant's legs, and she had blue, yellow and purple bruises on her upper and lower legs. Her skin appeared swollen in different areas of her legs. When asked what that was from, the complainant replied that they were from Mr Homsi kicking her. The complainant also had bruises on her upper back, right shoulder, and cuts to the back of the left and right ears and face. The complainant moved stiffly and slowly. As she sat up on her bed, SC Gebrael asked the complainant whose hair it was that she observed near the edge of the bed. The complainant told her that it was hers and it was still falling out from where Mr Homsi pulled her hair. The complainant told her that the injury on her head occurred as a result of Mr Homsi having hit her with a lighter. In relation to an injury on her arm, the complainant told her it was caused from trying to defend herself when Mr Homsi threw a chair at her or hit her with it. The complainant consented to photographs being taken, and those photographs were also in evidence. 

15Constable Bastoncino also gave evidence. She gave similar injury evidence about observation of the complainant to that of SC Gebrael. She also took a bag of clothing handed to her by a nurse which she understood to be the complainant's clothing, including a yellow dressing-gown, grey pants, and a grey and white striped lady's long-sleeve top. She noticed that the clothing smelled of urine to the extent that it made her gag. 

16Plain-clothes Senior Constable Belinda Haggerty gave evidence that she saw the complainant on 29 October 2008 when the complainant gave her second statement. She described the complainant as being between 5 feet and 5 feet 1 inch tall, and as being the size of a teenage girl. She observed the complainant to have bruising from the top of her feet and up her legs. One of her feet was incredibly swollen compared to the other one. When the complainant removed a band from her hair at the police station, hair came out, and a bag with that hair was an exhibit in the case. 

17Senior Constable Craig Sands gave evidence concerning the arrest of the appellants. He attended with other police at the Condell Park house at about 2.40 pm on 24 October 2008. There was no answer when police knocked at the door. A short time later a white vehicle parked on the opposite side of the road and two males and two females got out. Mr Homsi walked towards police. Senior Constable Sands asked him his name. Mr Homsi replied ""What for?"" When asked again, Mr Homsi provided his name. At about 3.30 pm, Mr Homsi was told that he was being placed under arrest for assault, and he was cautioned. He replied ""I didn't touch her"". Mr Homsi's mother then said he had done nothing wrong. SC Sands asked Ms Karamalakis her name, and she said that she was not going to tell him anything. She then told him her name. She was placed under arrest and cautioned. The appellants were both searched and then placed in the police vehicle. Mr Homsi's mother approached SC Sands and wanted his details. She said: ""You will not hear the end of this, my son has done nothing wrong"". The appellants were taken to Bankstown police station at about 6 pm. They each declined to be interviewed. 

18Constable Stephen Carey also gave evidence concerning the arrest of the appellants. His evidence did not include Mr Homsi's alleged statement ""I didn't touch her"". However, Constable Carey did give evidence that Mr Homsi's mother said ""Why are the police picking on Houssam?"" and that she was going to make a complaint about the police. 

19Constable Carey gave evidence that later the same day, with the complainant's consent, he entered the house with the assistance of a locksmith, because the complainant did not have keys to the premises and because the keys held by the real estate agent did not open the door. On entering the premises, Constable Carey observed two clumps of hair in a rubbish bin on top of the kitchen bench, that the complainant's room was disorganised and messy, with women's clothes strewn across the bed and floor, a clump of hair on the floor inside the doorway of the bedroom, a clump of hair near the window, a pink pair of scissors on the bedside table, and a pile of clothing behind the bedroom door that had been cut. These items were photographed and left in situ; and the photographs were exhibits in the case. Constable Munro gave similar evidence. 

20Evidence was given by Fatima Elcheikh, a child protection caseworker at Bankstown Community Services, that she met the complainant and her four children at Bankstown police station on 24 October 2008. The complainant told her that she had run away after having being assaulted over the previous twelve hours. She said she had not been allowed to leave the home for the previous week, and that her husband Mr Homsi and his girlfriend took turns watching her, while one of them would drop off and pick up the kids from school. She was asked by the complainant to return to the home to obtain the children's birth certificates and passports, because she was afraid that Mr Homsi would take the children overseas. That same day, Ms Elcheikh attended the Condell Park home with police. She was present when the appellants were arrested. After the locksmith attended to change the lock, she entered the house and saw that the kitchen and bedrooms were messy; the drawers were out and their contents on the floor. She saw clumps of hair on the floor of the children's room and in the garbage bin in the kitchen and around the house. She gave evidence that one of the girls' blue books was located and that she took clothing for the children. 

21SC Gebrael and Constable Bastoncino also gave evidence that at about 2 pm on 27 October 2008, they escorted the complainant home to obtain personal items for her and the children. They were also there to get the children's birth certificates and blue books. These were not recovered. SC Gebrael observed dirty plates in the sink and clothes on the floor. She saw a clump of hair sitting on top of the garbage bag. 

22PCSC Haggerty also gave evidence that, at about 9.20 am on Thursday 30 October 2008, she and other police arrived at the Condell Park house in execution of a search warrant, and shortly thereafter the premises were searched. Entry to the premises was gained through use of keys provided by the locksmith. The search was recorded on video. Items belonging to both the complainant and Mr Homsi were noted in bedroom 1 of the premises. Bedroom 4 was a bedroom said to be occupied by the appellants. The following items were seized: 

(1) One empty 2-litre juice bottle on the kitchen bench. 

(2) One large clump of long brown hair in a rubbish bag on the kitchen bench. 

(3) One unopened Golden Circle brand 2-litre apple and mango juice bottle on the bottom shelf of the kitchen pantry. 

(4) and (5) Two unopened Berry Healthy Balance juice bottles on the bottom shelf of the kitchen pantry. 

(6) Two Centrelink sheets in the name of [the complainant] on the kitchen floor. 

(7) One right Nike white men's shoe on the floor of the hallway. 

(8) One blue plastic lighter in the top drawer of the bedside table in bedroom 1. 

(9) One scissors with blue handles on top of the set of drawers behind the television near the entrance to bedroom 1. 

(10) One page of RTA paperwork in the name of [the complainant] in the second drawer of the bedside table in bedroom 1. 

(11) One left Nike brand white men's shoe on the floor of bedroom 1. 

(12) One blue plastic lighter in the bedside table in bedroom 4. 

(13) One black wooden pole/ stick with two red rings around its base located next to the bedside table in bedroom 4. 

(14) One Subaru remote car key attached to a Bulldog's key ring on a table in the garage near the garage door. 

A traffic infringement notice was located in the garage. A knife was located in a drawer where the blue lighter and registration papers were located in bedroom 1. In bedroom 1, police observed over 20 items of women's clothing that had been cut up rendering them useless. No items of men's clothing were observed to be destroyed in this manner. Documents such as birth certificates, blue books and passports for the complainant's children, and gold jewellery were not located during the search. 

23Plain clothes Constable Melissa Horvat and Constable Bane Zekanovic also gave evidence of participation in execution of the search warrant. 

24Virginia Freidman, an analyst at the Division of Analytical Laboratories at Lidcombe conducted a DNA analysis on a number of items, a buccal swab taken from the complainant, a juice bottle, a black wooden pole/ stick, a buccal swab from Mr Homsi, a buccal swab from Ms Karamalakis, a right shoe, a left shoe, a blue BIC lighter and a dark blue Rhino lighter. The following results were obtained. For the black pole, Mr Homsi had the same profile as DNA recovered from the end of the pole with the red rings, and traces of a second individual too low to determine a profile were also recovered; and from the other end of the pole three mixtures that originated from at least three individuals were recovered, and the complainant, Mr Homsi and Ms Karamalakis could not be excluded as contributors to this mixture. No blood was detected from the pole. No DNA or blood was detected on the juice bottle. For the blue BIC lighter, a preliminary screening for blood was positive, but the presence of blood was not confirmed; and DNA testing was unsuccessful. No blood was detected on the shoes, and no blood was detected on the dark blue Rhino lighter. Ms Freidman stated that traces of DNA could be transmitted by handling things. 

25Karen Cabanastia, a scientific officer, had experience in the examination of human hair. She examined two clumps of brown hair. She said that the proportions of hair in the samples examined, found to be present in each growth stage, supported the hypothesis that the hair examined had been forcibly removed from the scalp. 

26Transfer documents from the RTA were put into evidence, in relation to the registration of the Toyota Tarago. There was a transfer document dated 23 October 2008, signed by the complainant transferring ownership to Mr Homsi and showing that registration of the vehicle was transferred by Mr Homsi to Danny Kourouche on 23 October 2008 for a sale price of $5,000. The declaration on the document was signed on 27 October 2008. Further documents showed that on 10 November 2008, Danny Kourouche sold the vehicle to Shah Kahn for $2,500. The declaration signed on 10 November 2008. 

27Also put into evidence were clinical notes from the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital for Ms Karamalakis. These notes showed that at just before 10 am on Saturday 25 October 2008 Ms Karamalakis presented at the Emergency Department of RPA, her presenting information being that she ""finished menstrual cycle 3/7 ago, while running last pm, hit side of table, lower abdomen affected. This am woke with PV bleeding which hasn't stopped since. Slight lower abdominal pain and dizziness. Nil other. Nil HX."" Ms Karamalakis is also recorded as saying ""in police custody"" ""? What for - she says she doesn't know; and ""LMP - finishing 3 days ago. Was a few days late so she had done a pregnancy test prior to period. Negative"". 

28The case history notes included ""not using C/C - withdraw method. Prev on COC pill. Has had a IMB on stopping pill"". The only injury noted was ""mild tender lower abdo"" and ""no bruising. There is no record of any assertion that she had been attacked by the complainant. Her registration form showed her next of kin as Mr Homsi, and the relationship with him as ""fiance"". 

29Evidence from the previous trial by Dr James Chau was read. He examined the complainant at about 4 pm on 24 October at the Emergency Department of Bankstown Hospital. He found tenderness to the left para-spinal region, bruises to both arms and legs, and swelling to the left leg. X-rays of the complainant's chest, knees, ankles and legs were taken, and an analgesia was administered. Dr Chau's opinion was that the injuries were consistent with the complainant having been assaulted. In cross-examination, Dr Chau stated that he had examined the complainant's head and observed some abrasion but no bruising. He agreed that the photograph of the complainant's head (taken three days after his examination) showed an injury on the complainant's head which was consistent with her being struck with an object. He stated that bruising could last for weeks, depending on the patient. 

30Finally, a statement of Fadia Bekdache dated 9 March 2009 was read to the jury. In that statement, Ms Bekdache stated that on a Friday in 2008 she saw the complainant as she was returning home. The complainant was standing near the fence-line between their two houses and she had her children with her. She was wearing a robe or pyjamas and was carrying a small bag. The complainant asked for a lift to Greenacre. Ms Bekdache told her that she could take her to Bankstown. She asked the complainant if there was something wrong, and the complainant told her that she had had an altercation with her husband. Ms Bekdache took the complainant and her children to Bankstown. She observed the complainant was having difficulty walking and getting into the car. She suggested that the complainant go to see a religious leader to help conciliate between her and her husband. The complainant told her that her husband was mistreating her and showed her marks and bruises on her legs and what looked like burns on her hand. The complainant said: ""look, this is where they hit me and where they burnt me with cigarettes and they tore clothes --- my husband and his girlfriend were pulling my hair all night, he made me sign my van over to his name and he took my money and jewellery as well"". When Ms Bekdache dropped the complainant off at Bankstown, the complainant pleaded with her not to tell her husband where she was. At about 10.30 am the same day, Ms Bekdache saw the other woman who lived at the Condell Park house pass by as though looking for something. Her husband went outside and spoke to the husband from the Condell Park house. When the husband returned a second time, Ms Bekdache went outside and told him that she had dropped the complainant on Marion Street Bankstown. The husband asked whether the complainant had told her anything and she said she was told there had been a domestic problem. Ms Bekdache then went back inside. 

Mr Homsi's case 

31Mr Homsi's case was that the complainant had set him up and that her injuries were occasioned during an altercation she had with Ms Karamalakis. 

32Mr Homsi gave the following evidence: 

(1) Mr Homsi said he was an upholsterer, having started his own business (which included making chairs) in September 2008. Ms Karamalakis had designed and made his business cards, and also ordered the materials, fabrics and legs for the chairs. 

(2) Mr Homsi met the complainant at his uncle's engagement in Lebanon, and they were married there in 1999. They moved to Australia in 2000. They moved into the Condell Park house about six months prior to October 2008. Ms Karamalakis moved in with them in September 2008. He and the complainant shared the first bedroom on the left. He described his marriage as normal and happy. He said that his wife and Ms Karamalakis were best friends. He said that the complainant wanted to collect Centrelink payments and made him agree to sign a separation form so that she could do so; but they were never separated and did not separate until 23 October 2008. 

(3) Mr Homsi gave detailed evidence of what happened during the day on Monday 20 October 2008. His brother Aladean and his friend Adam Wasi came over at about 8 pm and they sat in the garage. The complainant made them coffees and sat with them for a while. She then went back inside and Adam and Aladean left at about 10.30 pm. Mr Homsi had a shower, and then lay in bed next to the complainant and their son. He had a headache so he went to the kitchen to get some medicine. He found an electricity bill and a Foxtel bill for which he had given the complainant $1,000 the previous Tuesday, money which he had borrowed from his brother Rabi. Mr Homsi then confronted the complainant about the bills, and she told him that she had to send money to her family. That night the complainant also told him she was taking their son to a doctor the following day because he had a cough. 

(4) On Tuesday 21 October 2008, Homsi got up at about 8.30 am. The complainant had already gone to take the girls to school. He went to the garage to work on children's chairs. At about midday he went to Condell Park to pay the overdue electricity bill. The complainant returned between 1.30 and 2 pm and sat with him in the garage until she left to pick up the girls from school. His brother Aladean and his business partner Danny Kourouche came at about 4 pm, and the complainant returned with the girls about half an hour later. Aladean and Danny left at about 6 pm. Mr Homsi had dinner then went back to work in the garage, and he went to bed at about 10.30 pm. 

(5) On Wednesday 22 October 2008, he got up at 7 am. He went with the complainant to take the girls to school. They got home between 9.30 and 10 am and he went to work in the garage. At about midday he called his mother to borrow some money to pay for one of the girls' school fees and for some shopping. He met his mother at the school where she gave him $1,000. He and Ms Karamalakis went to pick up the girls from school that day. He paid the school fees and they then went to do some shopping. At about 7.30 pm his brother Rabi came over because he was leaving on a cruise the following day. The complainant and the children spent some time with him. After putting them to bed, the complainant made them coffees. Mr Homsi and Rabi then went to the garage to see the chairs. Before Rabi left, the complainant told him not to forget their presents. Rabi left at about 11 pm. That night Mr Homsi slept on the couch because he couldn't cope with his son's noise. 

(6) On Thursday 23 October 2008, he got up at about 7.30 am. He and Ms Karamalakis took the kids to school because the complainant wanted to have a shower. His youngest daughter did not go to childcare that day. They got home between 9.30 and 10 am and he went to the garage to work. In the afternoon, Ms Karamalakis asked him to take her to his mother's house because she had no fuel in the car. He dropped her off at about 4.30 or 5 pm after picking up the girls from school. He got home at about 6 pm and his mother was there. At about 8.30 pm he received a call from Ms Karamalakis to go and pick her up. He left, and when they returned home between 9.30 and 10 pm his mother had gone. He went out to the garage while Ms Karamalakis was making pizzas. When they were ready he went inside to eat. He asked the complainant to put the children to bed because it was late. After doing so, the complainant called him into the bedroom and told him that she had been spending all the money that he had been giving her for bills, on herself. Mr Homsi told the complainant that their relationship was over because he could no longer trust her. The complainant was sad and cried. He asked her to give him the registration papers for the Tarago because he did not trust that she would not sell it. In the meantime Ms Karamalakis was holding his son and trying to settle him. Mr Homsi told the complainant to put her son to bed. About five minutes later he heard his son scream as though the complainant had done something to him. He saw a red mark on his son's side and his son was pointing to the complainant. He took his son from the complainant and gave him to Ms Karamalakis who put him to sleep. Mr Homsi reminded the complainant about the registration papers. She got them, signed them and gave them to him. 

(7) Mr Homsi told the complainant that he was leaving and would come in the morning to pick up the kids. The complainant was crying. He went to the toilet and she tried to barge in. He went to get his wallet and keys from the kitchen and heard a bang. He ran back to the hallway and saw Ms Karamalakis getting up onto her knees and the complainant swinging an orange juice bottle at her. Ms Karamalakis was hitting the complainant with a ""baton"". Mr Homsi pulled them apart. The complainant said that it was all because of Ms Karamalakis. Mr Homsi told them that from tomorrow, they should each go their own way and they agreed. He then hid the ""baton"" in Ms Karamalakis' bedroom behind her bed where he believed it had come from. He then left at about 12.30 am and went to his mother's house where he slept on his mother's couch. 

(8) At about 5.30 am on 24 October 2008 he woke up and went home. Ms Karamalakis opened the door for him and the complainant came to kiss him. He moved away from her and she started to cry and walked away. He sat on the lounge and Ms Karamalakis went to make coffee while the complainant got the girls ready for school. He fell asleep and woke up at about 8 am and discovered that the complainant and the children were gone. He tried calling her but her phone was switched off. He grabbed the keys for his Subaru but could not get out because the Tarago was in the way and the complainant had taken the keys (as well as the keys to the house and keys for the Subaru). He went to the Condell Park shops to look for them and then called his brother Aladean who came with Danny Kourouche to pick him up in their work van. They went back to the house to see if the complainant had come back. Ms Karamalakis told him that a lady was coming to pick up items she had purchased on eBay. While they were standing out the front, his neighbour Gasam Bekdache came out on his balcony. Mr Homsi asked him if he had seen his wife and children. Mr Bekdache replied that he hadn't and enquired what was wrong. Mr Homsi told him they had left. Mr Bekdache went back inside but came back out about five minutes later and told him that his wife had dropped the complainant and the children off at Bankstown shopping centre. They drove to Bankstown in search of them and then to Aladean's house to get in his car so Danny could go back to work. They went back home and saw their mother there. Aladean told him that his wife had seen birth certificates and passports in the complainant's bag the previous Sunday. Mr Homsi called the airport to see if the complainant and the children had left the country, and they put them through to the Federal Police. They went to KFC for lunch, and then waited for school to finish. They went back to the house at about 3.30, where they saw police officers in front of the house. 

(9) Mr Homsi denied hitting the complainant in any way and forbidding her to leave the house. He denied urinating on the complainant. He denied verbally abusing the complainant and threatening her. He denied that police had told him he was under arrest for assault or that he had said he didn't touch her. He said that, after sitting in the back of the paddy-wagon with Ms Karamalakis for three hours, he asked her out. He denied he had been in a relationship with her prior to this time. Mr Homsi called a number of relatives and acquaintances who gave evidence to the effect that his relationship with the complainant was a good and happy one. 

33Mr Homsi's brother Aladean gave the following evidence: 

(1) He had known the complainant for ten years and Ms Karamalakis for just as long. She was the complainant's best friend, and they were like sisters. He described his brother's marriage with the complainant as a normal happy marriage. He said he assisted his brother in moving to the Condell Park house. The things moved included Mr Homsi's, the complainant's and the children's belongings. 

(2) On Monday 20 October 2008, Mr Aladean and his friend Adam Wasi went to Mr Homsi's house. They were greeted by the complainant. They went out to the garage with Mr Homsi. The complainant later made them coffee. She said that her son had been sick and she was taking him to the doctor the following day. Aladean and Mr Wasi left at about 10.30 pm. 

(3) On Tuesday 21 October 2008, Aladean and his business partner (and Mr Homsi's cousin) Danny Kourouche went to Mr Homsi's place at about 4 pm. Mr Homsi was in the garage working on some chairs. About half an hour later the complainant returned and came into the garage with the kids. After a while she went inside to help Ms Karamalakis cook dinner. Aladean and Danny Kourouche left at about 6 pm. The complainant appeared normal. 

(4) At about 9.30 am on Friday 24 October 2008, Aladean received a call from Mr Homsi to help him look for his wife and kids because they were missing. He and Danny Kourouche picked up Mr Homsi from the Condell Park shops and they drove around before going back to the house. They were standing at the front when the neighbour came out. Mr Homsi asked if he had seen his wife and kids and the neighbour said no. He went inside and then returned a couple of minutes later and told them that his wife had taken them to Bankstown shops. Aladean, Mr Homsi and Danny Kourouche then drove around Bankstown looking for the complainant. Later Aladean and Mr Homsi went to the school to see if the children were there. Aladean then called his wife Diana, who told him she had seen passports and birth certificates in the complainant's bag the previous Sunday when they were on a picnic. Ms Karamalakis then called the Federal Police and they were told they had not left on any flights that day. They went to KFC across the road from the school and waited until school finished. They asked the complainant's friends if they had seen her. They returned to the house and saw police out the front. Mr Homsi got out of the vehicle and was arrested. 

34Adam Wasi gave evidence that he believed Ms Karamalakis was the complainant's best friend; and gave evidence that he had helped move Mr Homsi's, the complainant's and the children's belongings to the Condell Park house. He gave similar evidence to that of Aladean concerning Monday 20 October 2008. He described the complainant as happy that night. 

35The appellant's brother Rabi gave evidence that he visited his brother on 22 October 2008 at about 7 pm to say goodbye as he was leaving on a cruise the following morning. The complainant answered the door. She then took the kids for a bath. After bathing the kids, the complainant came out and they chatted and she made them coffee. They all went out to the garage so that Mr Homsi could show him the chairs he was making. At about 9.30 pm they went back into the house and he left at about 10.30 pm. Before he left, the complainant told him not to forget to buy them presents. A P & O cruise tag for 23 October to 1 November 2008 was put into evidence. Rabi described the complainant as normal that evening. He did not see any injuries on her. He also gave evidence that he had helped them move to the Condell Park house, involving moving all of Mr Homsi's, the complainant's and the children's belongings. 

36Danny Kourouche gave evidence similar to that of Aladean concerning the events of Tuesday 21 October 2008, and also concerning events on the morning of 24 October 2008. He also gave evidence that he bought the Toyota Tarago from Mr Homsi on 27 October 2008 although the papers were dated 23 October 2008. He sold the vehicle for $5,000 (although the documents say $2,500) on 10 November 2008. 

37Aladean's wife Diana Homsi gave evidence that she, the complainant and Ms Karamalakis had taken the children to Wiley Park for a picnic on Sunday 19 October. At one point she saw passports and birth certificates in the complainant's bag. Her impression was that the complainant and Ms Karamalakis were good friends. 

38Halah Kourouche, the appellant Mr Homsi's mother, gave the following evidence: 

(1) She had known the complainant since 2000 when her son married her. She had known Ms Karamalakis for nine years as they used to work together. The complainant and Ms Karamalakis were very close. Whenever she visited the complainant, Ms Karamalakis would always be there. Ms Kourouche treated the complainant like her own daughter. 

(2) On Tuesday 21 October 2008, Ms Kourouche met the complainant at about midday in front of Dr Alameddine's surgery as arranged the previous day. (There was put into evidence a handwritten document showing the date 21 October 2008 but otherwise illegible, purportedly provided by Dr Alameddin in response to ""subpoena for [the son] Homsi"".) They were to go for coffee, however the complainant stated she had received a call from Avon and she had to go and see the manager, and then she left. The complainant appeared normal. 

(3) On Wednesday 22 October 2008, Ms Kourouche met her son in front of the school, to give him $1,000 he had asked to borrow from her. 

(4) On Thursday 23 October 2008, Ms Kourouche went to the complainant's house at about 4 pm and saw the complainant and the two youngest children. Mr Homsi had gone to pick up the older girls from school and then to take Ms Karamalakis to her mother's house. The complainant made spaghetti for the children and they chatted. At about 5 to 5.30 pm Mr Homsi returned and showed her the chairs he was making in the garage. At about 8.30 pm, Mr Homsi went to pick up Ms Karamalakis, and about 15 minutes later Ms Kourouche left. The complainant appeared normal. 

(5) At about 1 am on Friday 24 October 2008, Mr Homsi came to her house wanting to sleep there. He told her he could no longer trust his wife because she had not used the money he had given her to pay the bills. He slept on the sofa and left at about 6 am that morning. 

(6) At about 10 or 10.30 am Ms Kourouche received a call from her son who told her that his wife and children had left. She told him she was coming. When she went to the house she saw Ms Karamalakis, and a short time later Mr Homsi arrived with his brother Aladean. They all left in her car and went to make enquiries at the school. They also asked the complainant's friends at the school whether they had seen her. They drove back to the house and saw police at the front of the house. Police approached Mr Homsi and asked him his name. When he told them, they apprehended him and put him on the ground. Police then told Ms Kourouche and Aladean to go home. 

(7) Ms Kourouche stated in cross-examination that she did not hear police tell Mr Homsi that he was under arrest for assault, and that Mr Homsi did not say that he did not touch her. She denied speaking to the police at all, stating there was no time and she was in shock. She denied having seen Mr Homsi assaulting the complainant on Thursday afternoon, and she denied that the complainant had complained about Mr Homsi's treatment of her on 21 October. Ms Kourouche was also cross-examined about an affidavit dated 25 June 2009 she had made in Family Court proceedings in answer to an affidavit of the complainant dated 19 June 2009. She accepted she was aware from reading the complainant's affidavit that there were allegations concerning things that happened during the morning of 24 October 2009, but said she did not in her affidavit make any statement about what happened in the early hours of 24 October (that is that her son had come to stay in her house between 1 am and 6 am) because no one asked her to do so. 

39Evidence was given by a Greg Gillan of going to pick up an outdoor play gym from the complainant's house between about 2 pm and 3 pm on Tuesday 21 October 2008. 

Case for Ms Karamalakis 

40Like the appellant Mr Homsi, Ms Karamalakis' case was that the complainant had set her up, in that the complainant's injuries were caused during altercations between them, instigated by the complainant attacking her. 

41Ms Karamalakis gave the following evidence: 

(1) She had known the complainant since 2001. She moved into the Condell Park house in August 2008. She had the last bedroom at the end of the hall. She denied having been in a sexual relationship with the appellant while he was living there. At the time she was going through a bitter divorce. 

(2) After her arrest on 24 October 2008, she was taken to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital because she had very heavy bleeding and cramps. She told the doctor that the previous night she had run into a table hitting her abdomen. It occurred during her altercation with the complainant. She had nominated Mr Homsi as next of kin on the hospital forms, because while they were in the paddy wagon after their arrest, he ""asked me"", and that was why she put down he was her fiance. The records stated that a pregnancy test had come back negative and that she was not using contraception. Ms Karamalakis said she had been in a relationship with a person named Isaac and they had ended the relationship in early October, and he had gone back to live in Morocco. 

(3) Ms Karamalakis said she assisted Mr Homsi in his upholstery business. She denied the complainant's allegations in relation to events alleged to have occurred between 20 and 24 October 2008. She did not at any time see Mr Homsi strike the complainant or urinate on her. 

(4) On Thursday 24 October 2008, while she was making pizza, the complainant approached her and told her she wanted to ""come clean"" about a few things with Mr Homsi. The complainant told her she had used the $1,000 that Mr Homsi had given her for the electricity bill to put a deposit on a ring. Ms Karamalakis told her she should be frank with Mr Homsi. 

(5) Later that night when the girls were asleep, Ms Karamalakis was settling the boy when the complainant called Mr Homsi into their bedroom. Five or ten minutes later, Mr Homsi walked out and told the complainant to put her son to bed. The complainant took her son and went to his room. In the meantime Mr Homsi appeared devastated. He was questioning whether he could trust the complainant. Then they heard the boy scream and they ran to his room. Ms Karamalakis took him and lay him on his mother's bed to settle him. The complainant then came into the room and pulled a piece of paper from one of her drawers. A couple of minutes later she heard a bang and Mr Homsi asked the complainant what she was doing. The complainant glared at Ms Karamalakis and walked towards the lounge-room. 

(6) After the boy was asleep, Ms Karamalakis went to leave the room and close the door gently. She felt a blow to the back of the head and blacked out. When she gained consciousness she saw the complainant with a juice bottle in her hand. Ms Karamalakis reached for the black stick she saw near the dresser and hit the complainant with it. Mr Homsi broke up the fight and removed the juice bottle and the stick from them. He asked them what they were fighting about and the complainant screamed that it was all Ms Karamalakis' fault. Mr Homsi told them he was moving out the following day and he then left. Ms Karamalakis then went to her room and locked the door. 

(7) After a while, she felt like a cigarette so she went to the dining area to get them. She saw the complainant running towards her with a kitchen knife in her hand. Ms Karamalakis ran and hit the dining-room table with her stomach. She turned round and whacked the complainant's hand to make her drop the knife. They proceeded to fight. Ms Karamalakis punched, kicked and hit the complainant. She hit the complainant on the head with the lighter she was holding. She overpowered the complainant and ended up throwing a stool at her. She told the complainant not to touch her again. She then went back to her room and locked the door and did not sleep all night. In cross-examination, Ms Karamalakis stated that she pulled the complainant's hair during the fight. 

(8) At about 6 am she got up to go to the bathroom and heard a car pull up and a car door slam. She saw that it was Mr Homsi in the Tarago and opened the front door for him. She offered to make him a coffee. The complainant then went to kiss him and he told her that it was over between them, and the complainant walked off crying. After making coffee Ms Karamalakis saw that Mr Homsi had fallen asleep on the couch. She sat down and also fell asleep. She woke up at about 8 am to Mr Homsi asking where the complainant and the kids were. She gave evidence then of Mr Homsi going to look for the complainant and the children, and of being arrested. 

(9) At no time on the Thursday night did she see Mr Homsi punching or kicking the complainant or grabbing her hair or urinating on her. At no time did she cut any clothes. Some of the cut clothes shown in the photograph were hers. Mr Homsi's clothes and the complainant's clothes were in the complainant's and Mr Homsi's room, while her clothes were in her room and also some of them were in the complainant's and Mr Homsi's room. 

42Evidence was given by Aliki Naxakis, the grandmother of Ms Karamalakis. She said Ms Karamalakis came to her house on 23 October, arriving at about 4.30 pm. The witness' son and daughter (Ms Karamalakis' mother) also came to the house. At about 9 pm, the appellant Mr Homsi came and collected Ms Karamalakis. 

Grounds of appeal against conviction 

43Both appellants rely on the following four grounds of appeal against conviction: 

Ground 1: 

The trial judge erred in 

(a) The application of the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 in allowing the Crown to address on the issue of counsel's failure to cross-examine a witness; and 

(b) In reinforcing the Crown's address by repetition and expansion in his direction to the jury; 

and the trial miscarried as a result. 

Ground 2: 

The trial judge misdirected the jury on the element of detention in Count 3 leading to a miscarriage of justice. 

Ground 3: 

The trial judge erred in failing to warn the jury under Section 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 that the hearsay evidence of Fadia Bekdache may be unreliable. 

Ground 4: 

That the verdicts are unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. 

Credibility issues 

44Before considering individual grounds of appeal, it is helpful in my opinion to have an overview of credibility issues that were raised at the trial. The contention of the appellants is that the complainant's evidence was so unreliable that there was a significant possibility that innocent people had been convicted. The contention of the Crown was that central aspects of the appellants' evidence were so unbelievable that the jury could reasonably be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that their account of what happened, particularly on the Thursday night and Friday morning, was a complete concoction. 

45It was clear that either the broad account given by the complainant, or that given by the appellants, or possibly both, must be an elaborate concoction. 

46In order to contend that the complainant's evidence was unreliable, counsel for the appellants made the following submissions in relation to her cross-examination: 

10. The cross-examination of the complainant covered the following areas: 

a. People who came to the house 

A. Until the complainant was cross-examined in the trial in October 2009 she had never mentioned that anyone had come to the house during the period she was allegedly being detained. She was taken through the numerous opportunities she had to tell someone that people had come to the house (T 65-67). 

B. The cross examination about people who came to the house was then taken up again at T140. The complainant agreed that she had never told police that she had shown the appellant Homsi's mother and brother bruises. (T141) She was certain that the appellant Homsi's brother came on the Tuesday night and not on Wednesday. She denied that she had said to him ""don't forget our presents. (T 142). 

C. She denied that someone came for some eBay purchases during the time (T 143). It was suggested that a man called Greg Gillan had attended, and the complainant said she did not see him. The complainant further denied that the appellant Homsi's brother Aladean and Adam Wasi came to the house at about 8:30 PM on Monday, 20 October 2008. She further denied that Danny Kourouche came to the house at about 4 PM on 21 October 2008 in company with the appellant Homsi's brother Aladean. 

D. She further denied that at 10:30 AM on Thursday, 23 October 2008 a female attended to pick something up that had been purchased over eBay. It was put to her that seven different people came to the place between Monday and Thursday which she denied. (T 145-146) 

b. Relationship with the appellants 

A. The complainant gave evidence that she and the appellant Homsi had separated in 2004 (T 67), and they were no longer in a relationship at 20 October 2008. 

B. In cross examination it was being suggested that the complainant and the appellant Homsi was still in a relationship as at October 2008. In particular the fact that: 

1. The complainant's clothes were in the main bedroom, contrary to her evidence that the appellants shared the main bedroom (T 69) 

2. The appellant Homsi's clothes were in the same cupboard as hers (T 70) 

3. That the appellant Homsi is the father of her youngest child who was born to [sic] February 2006, two years after she said she was separated from the appellant Homsi (T 70) 

4. That the electricity at at the house in which she was living was connected in the appellant Homsi's name (T 70). 

5. The complainant stated that the family knew that she was separated from the appellant Homsi (T 68). 

6. The complainant agreed that the appellant Homsi paid for her mother to travel from Lebanon to Australia in April 2007 (T 80) 

7. The complainant was shown a Western Union document which showed money had been sent to her father in Lebanon in February 2007 and 2008. It was put to her that was money that was given to her by the appellant Homsi to transfer to her father. The complainant initially stated, when shown the Western Union document, ""this document is a fake document"". The document had been produced under subpoena. (T 81) 

8. The complainant was shown a video of her mother arriving in Australia in 2007 which showed complainant's [six] auntie hugging the complainant's mother as well a [sic] showing the appellant Homsi and his brother at the airport (T 85). There is further video from the following day which was a party for her mother showing various members of the appellant Homsi's family there as well (T 85) 

C. It was further suggested in cross examination that she and the appellant Karamalakis were good friends including: 

1. The complainant had known the appellant Karamalakis since late 2000 (T 70) 

2. The complainant denied that she had asked the appellant Karamalakis to move into the house in August of 2008, to assist in looking after the children (T 71) 

3. The complainant agrees that a photo of the previous house in which she lived showed a car belonging to the appellant Karamalakis in the driveway and the complainant's car was on the front lawn (T 73). 

4. That the appellant Karamalakis had taken the complainant to hospital and was nominated as her next of kin in May 2008 (T 194-196) 

c. Friends and family in Australia 

A. The complainant gave evidence that she did not have any family living in Sydney (T 75) 

B. She was cross-examined about the fact that her auntie lived in Wiley Park (T 75). That she went to her auntie's wedding in Lebanon (T 75). That her auntie's husband Hassan Kourouche lived with her auntie in Wiley Park and photos were tendered of the wedding with the complainant standing next to her auntie's husband (T 76). 

C. The complainant agreed that Jasmine Kourouche was also related to her and was born and raised in Australia (T 77) 

D. The complainant agreed that her mum's uncle also lived in Australia, as well as her uncle. She had in fact stayed at her uncle's house previously (T 78). The complainant denied that she had lied when she said she did not have any family here because those people were related to her mother not to her (T 78). 

E. The complainant agreed that she had a number of friends living in Sydney (T 78-79). 

d. Prior inconsistent statements 

A. The complainant was cross-examined extensively about numerous prior inconsistent statements. The cross-examination of inconsistencies between the various statements that she made to the police, the family court affidavit, the evidence she gave on the last occasion and the evidence before this jury commenced on page T 91 through to page T 135. 

B. A summary of the various major inconsistencies is as follows: 

1. The complainant's first statement to the police does not mention anything that occurred before the evening of 23 October 2008. 

2. For Count 1 the complainant gave evidence in chief that she was sitting down when the appellant Homsi got her by the hair and punched her. In her statement to the police of 29 October 2008 she said she was standing up when the appellant Homsi slapped her. 

3. For Count 2 the complainant gave evidence in the previous trial that she was punched more than five times to the head and her hair pulled when she said that she would not hand over her jewellery. In her evidence in chief, when describing the incident of being asked to hand over her handbag she did not mention being hit at all. 

4. For Count 3 there is no mention in her initial statement that she was detained other then from the evening of 23 October 2008. Further, in her affidavit to the Family Court she says she is detained for 12 hours commencing 23 October 2008. 

5. For Count 4 in her statement to the police she said that no violence occurs until she goes into the house, however she told the jury that she was dragged from the car and kicked and punched. 

6. Further, the complainant told the jury she was hit with the stool then with the stick, however the previous jury she had told she was hit with the stick and then the stool. She further stated that she was hit with a stick a second day when being cross-examined which had not been mentioned to anyone previously. 

7. For Count 5 the version changes from being hit 3 or 4 times to being hit 15 times, and from going to the ground after one hit, compared to remaining standing for a number of hits before going to the ground. Further she could not recall the juice bottle when shown photos of it when giving her statement to the police on 7 January 2010 (T 198). 

8. For Count 6 the complainant said that the appellant Homsi punched her in the head with both appellants blaming her for using the hot water. The complainant didn't even mention to the police that the appellant Karamalakis was present. 

9. For Count 7 the complainant stated that the appellant Homsi's mother was present however she never mentioned that to the police. Further she said in her Family Court affidavit that the appellant Homsi threw their son against the wall, with no mention of that in any statement to the police. 

10. For Count 15 there was no mention to the police that the appellant Karamalakis left to go and get scissors to cut up her clothes. 

11. For Count 10 the complainant in her affidavit stated that the appellant Homsi urinated on her twice, including on the face, with no mention of twice, nor on the face, in her statements and evidence. 

e. Opportunities to Leave 

A. The complainant was cross-examined about her ability to leave during the period of time that she was allegedly detained. That cross-examination commences at page T 159. The following concessions are made: 

1. She could have left the house if she wanted to (T 159.37) 

2. She took the children to school on Tuesday morning (T 159.42) 

3. She told the police in her statement of 29 October 2008 in relation to 21 October 2008 that ""I went back home thinking that perhaps I could work it out"" (T 160.1) 

4. She could have left the house on Wednesday, 22 October 2008 when the appellants took the children to school (T 160.16) 

5. She had ample opportunity to leave the house if she wanted to (T 160.43) 

6. On Thursday night she could have left, but she said she was too scared to leave because she believes that the appellant Homsi would kill her (T 161.11) 

7. Most of the time she did not want to leave because she didn't have the children (T 161.41) 

B. The complainant denied taking [her son] to the doctors on the morning of 21 October 2008. She said ""That's a lie"" (T 165.50) 

47The appellants also relied on the evidence of defence witnesses, in particular: 

(1) Mr Homsi's mother, particularly her denial of any complaint to her or showing of a bruise, and of Mr Homsi hitting the complainant in her presence, and also her evidence that Mr Homsi was at her house between about 1 am and 6 am on Friday 24 October. 

(2) Evidence of Aladean Homsi and Danny Kourouche of their visit from 4 pm to 6 pm on Tuesday 21 October, when they were with Mr Homsi and the complainant appeared normal. 

(3) Rabi Homsi's evidence that the complainant was normal when he visited the house, which was on Wednesday 22 October not Tuesday 21 October. 

(4) The evidence of a number of witnesses that Mr Homsi did not move to the Condell Park house after the complainant, but at the same time and with her. 

(5) Evidence of many witnesses that up to the week in question the complainant and Mr Homsi were not separated but had a happy marriage. 

48The matters raised in cross-examination could significantly affect the credibility of the complainant, although in my opinion it was well open to the jury, having seen her give evidence, to accept the substance of it. I would also make the following three comments: 

(1) As regards the appellants' point b.B.1., the complainant's evidence (in particular, her diagram exhibit H9) was that, at the time of the alleged offences, her bedroom was the main bedroom, and the appellants slept together in bedroom 4. 

(2) As regards their point c.B., the complainant's auntie was married to Mr Homsi's uncle, and both of them gave evidence for Mr Homsi. 

(3) As regards point e.A., it was submitted for the appellants that there was no indication why suddenly the complainant was able to leave on Friday morning as opposed to any other time. However, the complainant did give one significant answer, namely that ""the morning that I left that was the morning that I had enough from that night"" (T 181), suggesting that she then had greater fear about staying than about leaving. 

49Some of the evidence of Mr Homsi's witnesses, if considered as having some credibility, would count strongly against the complainant's evidence. However, it was well open to the jury to consider that their evidence had no credibility. One matter of some significance was that Mr Homsi's mother had, on 25 June 2009, made an affidavit in the Family Court proceedings answering an affidavit by the complainant dated 19 June 2009, in which the complainant alleged assault by Mr Homsi during the morning of 24 October; and in that affidavit, Mr Homsi's mother had denied seeing Mr Homsi assault the complainant but had not said that Mr Homsi could not have assaulted the complainant during the morning of 24 October because he was at her house, an omission which she explained in terms of no one having asked her. 

50If what the appellants said was substantially true, then what must have happened was that the complainant, having been extensively injured by Ms Karamalakis when the complainant had twice attacked Ms Karamalakis, and having been rejected the next morning by Mr Homsi when she approached to kiss him: 

(1) Waited until both appellants happened to fall asleep; 

(2) Cut up some of her clothes and some of Ms Karamalakis' clothes and strew them about; 

(3) Found and successfully concealed car keys, house keys, passports and birth certificates; 

(4) Did not drive away but walked out of the house with the four children, and obtained transport from a neighbour she happened to encounter and whom she hardly knew; 

(5) Told police that both Mr Homsi and Ms Karamalakis had been bashing her; 

(6) Told police and others that Ms Karamalakis was Ms Homsi's girlfriend (when in truth Ms Karamalakis was the complainant's best friend, having no affectionate relationship with Mr Homsi); and 

(7) Told police and others that assaults by both had occurred over a 12-hour period from 7 pm the previous night (when in truth Mr Homsi had been absent from the house from about 12.30 am to about 6 am, and could have an alibi for those hours). 

51Also, if what the appellants said was substantially true: 

(1) The very extensive and varied injuries observed on the complainant and photographed by police must have been caused in two relatively short incidents, by Ms Karamalakis acting in self-defence. 

(2) Ms Karamalakis, having been attacked by the complainant with a knife leading to a hectic fight causing extensive injuries to the complainant, then went into her bedroom and locked the door, leaving the complainant and the children in the house, making no attempt to contact Mr Homsi or the police, and also making no mention of these circumstances to Mr Homsi when he returned in the morning, or to police when arrested, or when seen at the hospital (where she displayed no injuries other than mild tenderness to the abdomen region). 

(3) Entirely coincidentally with the complainant's untrue allegation to police and others on 24 October that Ms Karamalakis was Mr Homsi's girlfriend, and although Ms Karamalakis had until 24 October not been in any affectionate relationship with Mr Homsi, Ms Karamalakis on 25 October nominated Mr Homsi as her next of kin with the relationship of fiance. 

(4) That circumstance occurred because, when both appellants were held in the police van, Mr Homsi asked Ms Karamalakis out, and Ms Karamalakis, as a Muslim, took this to mean that they were engaged to be married (and Ms Karamalakis' suspected pregnancy just a few days earlier was due to a relationship with a man, not otherwise mentioned in evidence, who had since returned to Morocco; and her reference to ""withdraw method"" in the hospital must have been, not to any current practice, but rather to what her practice with that man had been some weeks earlier, before their relationship ended in early October). 

52In those circumstances, without any need to rely on the complainant's evidence, it was well open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellants' version of events, particularly the events of Thursday night and Friday morning, was so implausible that it must be a concoction. This of course would not be sufficient to establish guilt; but in my opinion, it is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the appellants' grounds of appeal. 

Ground 1: Browne v Dunn 

53During the Crown's final submissions, the Crown Prosecutor, after referring to Mr Homsi and others driving in (or ""around"") the Bankstown area on the morning of 24 October, said this: 

And then when they come back and are arrested by the police Constable Sands is the officer speaks to Houssam Homsi outside or in the vicinity outside the house. Said, ""You're under arrest for assault"" the accused said, ""I didn't touch her"" and I suggest that on the face of it he's denying doing anything but it has in it knowledge that [the complainant] - who it's about, that's [the complainant] and that she would be suggesting he hit her. It's a denial on that but the extraordinary thing is both accused and witnesses who were there, the mother and Aladean said that was never said. The police officer never even said, ""You're under arrest for assault"" and the accused never said, ""I didn't touch her"". The accused himself said I didn't say that. 

As you've seen witnesses get cross-examined and things are put. There was no suggestion to the police officer that he was incorrect about that. You might think other than he's investigating, he's got to arrest someone, nothing there said is other more than him saying at that time, ""I didn't do anything"" denying. So you wouldn't think the police officer would be just making that up. It certainly wasn't suggested he'd made something up or was in fact wrong, but it wasn't said apparently according to the defence case. And the concern the accused has is because it shows he knows exactly who is hurt and who hurt her. 

54In his summing up, the trial judge said this: 

Indeed what the Crown points to is the evidence of Officer Sands who said that when he arrested Houssam Homsi he said, ""You're under arrest for assault"". To which Houssam Homsi replied, ""I didn't touch her"" indicating that he knew full well that this was all about. Of course both he, and Ms Karamalakis, and Mrs Kourouche, deny that those words were said, just as Mrs Kourouche denies that she asked for the details of the police officer. 

The police officers were not cross-examined about these things. It was not suggested to them that they had made up these exchanges, and the Crown suggests, in consequence of that, that you would have a reasonable doubt about the veracity of the accused and Mrs Kourouche because they deny these things which the police said happened. If you got the impression, so this argument runs, that they were lying to you about that, then you might think that their evidence did not carry much weight in respect of other things. 

55There was no complaint about this, and no request for a re-direction. 

56Before this Court, an affidavit by Mr Homsi's counsel at the trial was read. He said he had instructions from Mr Homsi that Mr Homsi had not stated ""I did not touch her"" at the time of his arrest by SC Sands, but that counsel made a forensic decision not to cross-examine on this because he did not want it disclosed to the jury that a struggle had occurred at the time of the arrest. Counsel also gave evidence that it was his oversight that he did not complain about the Crown's comments or the trial judge's directions, or seek any re-direction. 

57It was submitted for the appellants that the trial judge erred in repeating the Crown's submissions, thereby giving them the weight of judicial authority; and indeed, in going further, and suggesting that the jury could use this failure to cross-examine to support a conclusion that the appellants' evidence did not carry much weight about other things. It was submitted that, consistently with R v Manunta (1990) 54 SASR 17 and RWB v R [2010] NSWCCA 147, the trial judge should at least have told the jury that the absence of cross-examination of SC Sands on this issue could have explanations that did not reflect on the credibility of the appellants. 

58I agree that the process of reasoning associated with the case of Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 should be used only with much caution and circumspection in criminal trials. As pointed out by King CJ in Manunta at 23, there may be explanations for failure to cross-examine which do not reflect on the credibility of witnesses; and where the possibility of drawing an adverse inference is left to the jury, the jury should generally be assisted by reference to such possible explanations - for example, misunderstanding of instructions by counsel, looseness or inexactitude in framing of questions, or oversight. And as pointed out by Simpson J in RWB at [101], it may be quite unfair to suggest to a jury that they should draw the inference that, because the witness was not cross-examined on a contentious matter, the witness must have failed to include that matter in his/her instructions or statement. 

59In deciding whether to allow an appeal on a ground such as this, there are a number of steps that may arise: 

(1) If the ground does not involve a question of law, there is a question whether leave should be granted: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 5(1)(b). 

(2) If the ground relates to a direction, omission to direct or decision as to the admissibility or rejection of evidence, to which objection was not taken at the trial, there is the question whether the Court should give leave for this ground to be taken: Criminal Appeal Rules r 4. 

(3) Then there is the question whether there was a ""wrong decision on any question of law"" or ""on any other ground whatsoever ... a miscarriage of justice"": Criminal Appeal Act s 6(1). 

(4) Then there may be the question whether the Court considers that ""no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred"": proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act . 

60No point is taken by the Crown that leave is required on this matter under s 5(1)(b). 

61Rule 4 does apply, and I will return to this. 

62Ground 1 does not involve a wrong decision on any question of law. ""Miscarriage of justice"" in the body of s 6(1) has been interpreted as extending to "" any departure from trial according to law, regardless of the nature or importance of that departure"": Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300 at [18]. However, where what is complained of is not ""a departure from applicable rules of evidence or procedure"" ( Weiss at [19]), but rather a comment in the summing up that could be inadequate or misleading or unfair, in my opinion there is no miscarriage of justice unless it appears that there is some realistic possibility that the comment could have influenced the jury verdict. If there is such a possibility, then the Court would need to consider the proviso, in accordance with Weiss . 

63As submitted for the Crown, the comments complained of were not directions; and they could not in my opinion be considered as involving a departure from applicable rules of evidence or procedure, or a departure from trial according to law; and in my opinion, they could not give rise to a miscarriage of justice unless, in all the circumstances of the case, there was a realistic possibility that they could have influenced the verdict. 

64In this case, it would have been preferable that the trial judge point out that there were alternative potential explanations for failure to cross-examine SC Sands on this point; although there could not in my opinion be a miscarriage arising from failure to point out the possibility of inadvertence or misunderstanding of instructions, when counsel's affidavit shows that these were not factors. However, any effect of SC Sands' evidence on the jury's view of the credibility of Mr Homsi (and thus indirectly on that of Ms Karamalakis) would in my opinion be wholly insignificant, having regard to the totality of considerations going to their credibility. I do not consider that there was any miscarriage of justice, within that phrase as used in the body of s 6(1). 

65In any event, I would not grant leave under r 4. I accept that counsel's failure to take objection was due to inadvertence; but this in itself confirms the minimal significance of the matter in the whole context of the trial, and supports the view that it did not give rise to any miscarriage of justice that could justify the grant of leave under r 4. 

66Accordingly, there is no need to consider the proviso. 

Ground 2: Misdirection on detention 

67Count 3 was a charge under s 86 of the Crimes Act 1900, which relevantly provides: 

86 Kidnapping 

(1) Basic offence 
A person who takes or detains a person, without the person's consent: 

(a) with the intention of holding the person to ransom, or 

(b) with the intention of obtaining any other advantage, 

is liable to imprisonment for 14 years. 

(2) Aggravated offence 
A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if: 

(a) the person commits an offence under subsection (1) in the company of another person or persons, or 

(b) the person commits an offence under subsection (1) and at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, actual bodily harm is occasioned to the alleged victim. 

A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 20 years. 

(3) Specially aggravated offence 
A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (1): 

(a) in the company of another person or persons, and 

(b) at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, actual bodily harm is occasioned to the alleged victim. 

A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 25 years. 

... 

68There is the following definition of ""detaining"" in s 86(7): 

detaining a person includes causing the person to remain where he or she is. 

69In his summing up, the trial judge gave the following direction in relation to detaining: 

The first point I should make I suppose is that whilst the Crown casts the net for this charge as between 20 October and 25 October as the Crown made clear both in his opening and closing addresses, it is not necessary for the Crown to establish beyond reasonable doubt that for the entirety of that time [the complainant] was detained. You might think that the detention if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about all the other elements to which I will come in a moment the detention started on the 21st, or you might come to the conclusion that you are not persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that it started until the 22nd or the 23rd namely the twelve hour period which elapsed on what you might call the final period of conflict in this household at Condell Park. You will not be asked how long the period was if you find there was a detention if you so find. It is enough from the Crown point of view if you find that there was some period during which she was detained with all of these other elements being established beyond reasonable doubt. 

Now what does detain mean? I know counsel have bandied around the word ""kidnapped"" a few times. You will notice this charge does not use the term kidnapped. Nobody is suggesting she was picked up, thrown in a car and taken somewhere else. This is a detaining. It might in common parlance sometimes be referred to by ignorant laymen as kidnapping, but it is detaining. What does detain mean? It means to interfere with the liberty of somebody to leave when they want to. That is all detaining means, it means preventing a person from leaving should they wish to do so. It is sufficient if the person is detained for only a very short time, there is no minimum period involved. The Crown here says, as I understand the way in which it puts its case, that the detention was constituted by the acts of the two accused taken together with in the case of Mr Homsi uttering threats about what would happen if - first of all telling her to stay inside the house. Secondly uttering threats of what would happen if she left the house. 

She told you at various times that he had said bad things would happen to her, that he would find her and kill her and so on. So it is the uttering of the threats. It is the physical violence which she says was inflicted upon her which of course would give very much practical resonance to the threats that something bad would happen to her if she did disobey this direction. It is the deprivation of the means of escape if you like, as I understand the way the Crown puts it, first of all she was stripped of her driver's licence and then her credit cards and Medicare card and so on were taken from her so that she was less able to move out into the world and support herself. So she was handicapped to that extent and then finally there is this element of separation from the children. The children, apart from some times to which we will come when I am dealing with counsel's arguments on Monday, the children were often separated either at school or with [...] the young boy at home. So they were not all together very often, so she says she could not leave without taking all four of them, that is part of the array of actions on which the Crown relies to say that she was in fact being detained. The Crown has to prove that this was done on the part of each accused in the company of the other. 

70During the trial judge's summing up, in the absence of the jury, there was the following exchange: 

LITTLE: Your Honour I had a point that's outside that. It's to deal with count 3. In the situation that [the complainant] decided as a result of actions directed towards herself not to leave because she couldn't take all of the children with her at the same time then that would not amount to detention. That's the direction I'm asking your Honour to give. Your Honour just talking about it, there's no doubt that she could use children as a vehicle to detain but in the factual matrix of this case that hasn't been what's happened and as such, the direction I'm putting is appropriate. Don't you leave this house, this sort of thing, or I'll bash you, or things like that are the sort of things that lead to the detention. 

HIS HONOUR: Except that I don't think you can really take one element - one strand out of that mix. 

LITTLE: But if the sole reason she doesn't leave. 

HIS HONOUR: Well did she ever say that was the sole reason she didn't leave? 

LITTLE: She said that was the reason she didn't leave. 

HIS HONOUR: Sure, she agreed that that was a reason she didn't leave. 

LITTLE: So if that is the reason she doesn't leave, then in those factual circumstances that could not amount to detention. 

HIS HONOUR: Well look, had you got her to say there were times when I was not worried about the threats and the only thing that stopped me from going was the children, I'd agree with you entirely. But can you really quarantine that element to the point where I can give them a meaningful direction? 

LITTLE: Well if they form a view the sole reason was that she didn't leave was because of the fact that she couldn't take all four children at once, yes, you can quarantine it. If there's a mixture, yes. 

HIS HONOUR: That would require the most extraordinary mental gymnastics, would it not? They would have to reject her fears but accept her complaint that she wouldn't leave without the kids? 

LITTLE: Well that's part of the usual function that they're capable of accepting or rejecting the evidence of a witness-- 

HIS HONOUR: Well I hear what you say, what do you say Mr Crown? 

HARRISON: Your Honour I agree with my friend's last submissions. I'd submit that it invites the jury to draw an unfair inference against Mr Homsi in terms of he was using the children in some way to detain [the complainant]. Her evidence was that Mr Homsi had said to her that she's not to leave the house essentially so that no one would see her injuries or bruises. She went on further in her evidence to say - in prefacing her evidence with. 'I'll be honest, I wasn't going to leave without my children.' Now that is nothing to do in her evidence there with Mr Homsi. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes but you see the Crown case is rather broader than that. The Crown, as I understood the way in which this was put, was that not only were there threats, there were actions taken in depriving her of a licence, a credit card, a Medicare card and so on, which made her less independent and it's in those circumstances that the fear about leaving the children there resonates, you see. 

HARRISON: I can understand that point in terms of depriving her of things means to be independent, but at no stage does she suggest that it's intentional in terms of what's happening with taking the children to school. She says, I didn't want to leave without my children. She doesn't draw any sort of inferences or conversations from Mr Homsi towards her in regards to, well I'm going to take the children now, I'm going to take one of the children now. That certainly doesn't come up at all in her evidence. 

In my submission it's totally independent as to what she is saying as to the reasons why she doesn't leave the house. Her evidence was she's not leaving because - her evidence being that Houssam is saying to her, don't leave the house because I don't want anyone to see your bruises. She's not saying that she-- 

HIS HONOUR: I don't think she ever said that actually - I don't want you to leave because I don't want anybody to see your bruises. 

HARRISON: I think that was the tenor of her evidence. 

HIS HONOUR: Well it might be the tenor, I don't recall her saying that in terms. But that's splitting hairs. If all you want me to say is if you ever got to the stage of believing that her sole reason for not leaving the house was because she wouldn't leave the children, then that doesn't amount to detention. If that's all you want me to say. What do you say Mr Crown? 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well in my submission it doesn't follow because the clear evidence of [the complainant] is that - only that she wanted to get out of the house is because these things had happened. This is more going to an opportunity, they're saying you had an opportunity when they're out of the house. She'd already at that stage wanted to - felt that she was detained, but she couldn't leave or couldn't take an opportunity because the children weren't altogether. That's it in effect, so it's really flowing already from her saying, because of the violence, the threats, threats not to leave and the stripping of her identity, that she was detained there and when there was an opportunity that arose, she couldn't go, one being because all the children weren't together and I didn't want to leave the children. 

So in my submission, it is splitting hairs, it's really if a jury are coming down to that - considering whether she didn't leave at that stage because all the children weren't together, they must really have found that she wanted to leave and felt detained there by things that had already happened to her. 

HARRISON: Your Honour I'd submit it goes further than opportunity, it goes to the very reason. 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: But why does she want to leave - that's the only reason. 

71Subsequently, in the summing up, the trial judge said this: 

Now I told you the way in which the Crown relies on a combination of things to represent the act of detaining. It is the threats, the actual physical violence, the deprivation of independence by the removal of the car, the licence, and so on, and into that mix there was also the fact that [the complainant] said that she did not want to leave without her children. If you got to the stage - I do not suggest you would get to this stage, I do not know how you would get to this stage, but I am required to try and cover all possibilities and eventualities - if you ever got to the stage of believing that her sole reason for not leaving was because of the children, that is excluding these other elements on which the Crown relies, then that probably - in fact I would have to tell you that as a matter of law - would not amount to detention, that single element, by itself, if it was the exclusive reason why she did not go at an earlier time. But how you would tease that out of the other combining factors on which the Crown relies would be a matter entirely for you and I give you no advice or assistance in that regard. 

72It was submitted for the appellants that there were three errors in this direction: 

(1) It suggested to the jury (especially by the words ""I do not know how you would get to this stage"") that the jury should not accept that the complainant stayed for reasons other than threats and violence. 

(2) It reversed the onus of proof, suggesting that in order to acquit, the jury had to come to believe that the complainant's sole reason for not leaving was because of the children. The judge should have directed to the effect that the jury must acquit if the Crown had not excluded beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant's sole reason for staying was because of the children. 

(3) It indicated that, even if the complainant would have left but for the children, the jury could still find she was detained. The trial judge should have directed that the jury must acquit if the Crown had not excluded beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant would have left but for not wanting to leave without the children. 

73As conceded by the appellants, there does not have to be an actual physical detention to satisfy the requirement of detaining: it can be as a result of threats and/or violence depriving the complainant of her liberty. 

74In my opinion, the appellants' third complaint about the trial judge's direction is incorrect. In my opinion, so long as threats and violence materially contributed to detention of the complainant (and were intended to do so), it would not matter that the threats and violence would not have been effective but for the additional influence of the complainant's concern about her children and her not wanting to leave without the children. 

75I accept that the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the threats and/or violence of the appellants materially contributed to the detention of the complainant (and were so intended), so that if the jury had a reasonable doubt that this was so, the appellants were entitled to an acquittal. However, if the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the substance of the complainant's evidence, it is very difficult indeed to see that they could have had such a reasonable doubt. It is true, as put for the appellants, that the complainant said on a number of occasions that she would not leave the house without her kids; but it was not put to her that at any time she was not motivated at all by the threats and violence but remained only because of the children, and certainly that position was never expressly or impliedly suggested by the complainant's evidence. In those circumstances, the difficulty perceived by the trial judge in giving the directions requested by the appellants' counsel is understandable. 

76I accept that, if read in isolation, the part of the direction complained about might conceivably be taken as suggesting that it was not enough for acquittal that the jury had a reasonable doubt as to whether the complainant's only reason for not leaving was because of the children, but that rather it was necessary that they ""come to the stage of believing that her sole reason for not leaving was because of the children"". However: 

(1) The direction was given in response to a submission by counsel for Ms Karamalakis that included the assertion ""if they form a view the sole reason was that she didn't leave was because of the fact that she couldn't take all four children at once, yes, you can quarantine it."" 

(2) The trial judge indicated in the discussion that he was contemplating saying ""if you ever got to the stage of believing that her sole reason for not leaving the house was because she wouldn't leave the children, then that doesn't amount to detention""; and counsel for the appellants raised no submission against that proposal. 

(3) The part of the summing up should not be read in isolation. The trial judge had directed the jury that the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt the essential elements of each charge, and that if any of those essential elements is missing in the sense of not being proved beyond reasonable doubt, then the jury must acquit; and he repeated this direction in relation to detaining. The part of the summing up complained of could not reasonably be understood as a retraction of these directions. 

(4) No complaint about this part of the direction was made at the trial. 

77In these circumstances, although it may perhaps have been preferable for the trial judge to say that detention is not proved beyond reasonable doubt if it is not proved beyond reasonable doubt that it was not the case that the complainant's sole reason for not leaving was because of the children, the trial judge's formulation had the merit of avoiding a confusing double negative, and of drawing the jury's attention to a situation which would not amount to detention; and the general directions concerning proof beyond reasonable doubt would have appropriately alerted the jury to the need for this situation to be excluded beyond reasonable doubt. 

78As regards the first complaint, insofar as this part of the summing up included comments by the trial judge indicating a view of the facts, those comments were not inapposite. If the jury accepted beyond reasonable doubt the complainant's evidence that Mr Homsi threatened her that if she went out, the appellants would take her to the cemetery and bury her there, threatened to kill her if she left or called the police or told anyone about what was happening, and that in conjunction with those threats there was extensive application of actual violence, and that the complainant was scared to leave because of threats that Mr Homsi would do something bad to her, it is difficult to see how they could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that these threats and actions made a material contribution to her not leaving. On her account, the question of her staying solely because of the children, in the absence of the threats and their influence on her, did not actually arise. Thus it was a purely hypothetical question; and even if that hypothetical question could be given the answer that she would not have left without the children, this would not mean that, as things actually occurred, the threats did not make a substantial contribution to her not leaving. Further, the trial judge gave an appropriate direction to the jury that they were the sole judges of facts, and that if he expressed any opinion on the facts, the jury was obliged to disregard it unless it happened to coincide with the view they had themselves independently formed. 

79In my opinion, this part of the summing up did not amount to a wrong direction on any question of law, nor any departure from trial according to law, nor any departure from applicable rules of evidence or procedure. In my opinion in its context it was not a misdirection as to the onus of proof, nor such as could mislead the jury or otherwise be unfair. Even if it were considered a misdirection in any respect, in my opinion it is not one which could as a reasonable possibility have influenced the verdict. In my opinion it gave rise to no miscarriage of justice, within that phrase as used in the body of s 6(1). I would not allow this ground of appeal. 

Ground 3: Unreliable evidence 

80Section 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 provides as follows: 

165 Unreliable evidence 

(1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence: 

(a) evidence in relation to which Part 3.2 (hearsay evidence) or 3.4 (admissions) applies, 

(b) identification evidence, 

(c) evidence the reliability of which may be affected by age, ill health (whether physical or mental), injury or the like, 

(d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding, 

(e) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness who is a prison informer, 

(f) oral evidence of questioning by an investigating official of a defendant that is questioning recorded in writing that has not been signed, or otherwise acknowledged in writing, by the defendant, 

(g) in a proceeding against the estate of a deceased person-evidence adduced by or on behalf of a person seeking relief in the proceeding that is evidence about a matter about which the deceased person could have given evidence if he or she were alive. 

(2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to: 

(a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and 

(b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and 

(c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. 

(3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so. 

(4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information. 

(5) This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury. 

(6) Subsection (2) does not permit a judge to warn or inform a jury in proceedings before it in which a child gives evidence that the reliability of the child's evidence may be affected by the age of the child. Any such warning or information may be given only in accordance with section 165A (2) and (3). 

Note . The Commonwealth Act does not include subsection (6). 

81In the course of his summing up, the trial judge said this: 

On the question of Fadia Bekdache who figured in not only the Crown's address but also the address of defence counsel, she apart from the professional witnesses, like the police, the ambulance and the social worker, and Mr Gillan, appears to be the only non-family member whose testimony is before you in any form. I could be wrong about that, I am not sure about the relationships which were described by each of the witnesses but I rather thought they were all related in some fashion. She on the other hand seems to be a witness of no apparent bias, she was simply caught up in the events of the day by being outside when [the complainant] was out in the front yard with her children looking for a lift. Nonetheless what she said in her evidence, admittedly you have not had the chance to see her but what she said about telling the accused, Houssam Homsi, directly about how she had given [the complainant] a lift is denied by everybody who was present on the defence side, if you like. That is both accused, Mr Kourouche, Mr Aladean Homsi, they all claim to have been present and that there was no contact between Fadia Bekdache and Houssam Homsi. 

Whether that is of any importance to you or not is a matter entirely for you. I simply point out that that is a direct conflict between those grouped on the defence side, if you like, and Ms Bekdache who does not appear to have any axe to grind but you did not get to see her, so you will have to make of that whatever you see fit. 

82At the conclusion of the summing up, and in the presence of the jury, the trial judge asked if there were any applications, and counsel for Mr Homsi responded that ""I'd take a warning under s 165 in regard to Ms Bekdache's evidence given that counsel haven't had the opportunity to cross-examine her"". The trial judge did not give that warning and the jury retired. The following exchange then occurred: 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour there is just one matter, only because my friend Mr Harrison made a request for a warning under 165 in respect of Ms Bekdache her evidence being admitted. Just that looking at subs (3) it says ""The judge not need comply with subs (2), that is the warnings, if there are good reasons for not doing so"". It may require your Honour to provide some reason for the record. 

HIS HONOUR: Well because there is nothing to suggest that Mrs Bekdache was in any way a partial witness, I do not see any reason to warn the jury about accepting her evidence in that respect. Nor could it be thought that her reluctance to come is entirely devoid of any attitude of the accused or those in support of him. So I don't propose to warn about a witness whose reluctance to come may at least in part be traceable to the activities of the accused. It may at least be in part be attributable. 

HARRISON: Well your Honour the section addresses whether the evidence may be unreliable and obviously the reading of her statement is really hearsay evidence. 

HIS HONOUR: There is no reason to suggest that her evidence would be unreliable is there Mr Harrison? 

HARRISON: Well your Honour the evidence is that there was a conversation taking place at the house between a number of persons which including Ms Bekdache's husband. Now the issue is and has been in this trial is to who was speaking to Mr Homsi directly, whether it was the husband or whether it was the wife and essentially this is hearsay evidence whether she's possibly told something by her husband as opposed to whether she's had conversation directly with Mr Homsi. 

HIS HONOUR: Is there anything critical about her evidence? Is there any basis upon which you can suggest that she might be confused about whether she spoke directly to Mr Homsi? 

HARRISON: Not that I can point to in her statement. That's the whole point your Honour, I haven't had the opportunity to obviously cross-examine her in regards to how she come to have that knowledge that she's actually, or the conversation that she's attributed to Mr Homsi in her statement. Whether that's possibly come from something that her husband has told her. 

HIS HONOUR: Well anyway I haven't give a warning and I don't propose to. 

83The statement by the trial judge that the reluctance of the witness to come ""may at least in part be traceable to activities of the accused"" appears to have been based on paragraphs in a signed statement of the witness that was before the primary judge, and is also before this Court as an annexure to an affidavit of Maria-Rosa Etnasios dated 3 June 2011, which was read at the hearing of the appeal. This affidavit also annexed a medical report supporting the unavailability of the witness to give evidence. The relevant paragraphs of the statement made assertions to the effect that there had been threatening conduct by Mr Homsi towards the witness, which had caused the witness to be scared. 

84It was submitted for the appellants that the trial judge erred in not giving the direction requested, in particular for the following reasons: 

(1) The statement was hearsay and was therefore within s 165(1)(a), and as such was ""evidence of a kind that may be unreliable"" within s 165(1). 

(2) Accordingly, a direction having been requested, the judge was required to give the warning unless there were ""good reasons for not doing so"". 

(3) The judge did not address the question whether there were good reasons for not giving the warning, but rather considered whether there were reasons for giving the warning. 

(4) One of the reasons referred to by the trial judge was erroneous because there was no evidence that the witness's reluctance was traceable to the activities of the accused. 

(5) The circumstances that there was nothing to suggest the witness was partial, or that on the face of the statement there could be no confusion about whether she spoke directly to Mr Homsi, were not reasons for not giving the warning, in circumstances where defence witnesses asserted that Ms Bekdache did not speak to Mr Homsi and defence counsel were precluded from exploring her recollections. 

(6) The need for such a warning was supported by the cases of Henriques v R (1991) 93 Cr App Rep 237 and Mendham & Foster v R (1993) 71 A Crim R 382. 

85In relation to point (4), it is clear in my opinion that the trial judge could not rely on the relevant paragraphs of the witness' statement as reasons for not giving the warning. Although those paragraphs could be considered evidence, they were not evidence that the appellants had any opportunity to contest; and it would in my opinion be a denial of natural justice to rely on them. It was submitted for the Crown that the judge could take the paragraphs into account to the extent of supporting a view that the witness' reasons for failure to attend did not affect the reliability of her statement. However, in my opinion even to do that would involve a denial of natural justice. Accordingly, to the extent that the trial judge did rely on those paragraphs, it was an error for him to do so. 

86However, this does not necessarily mean that the trial judge erred in not giving the warning. 

87The first question is whether the mere fact that the evidence was hearsay meant that the warning must be given unless there were good reasons for not doing so, or whether there was a preliminary question whether the particular hearsay evidence tendered in this case was ""of a kind that may be unreliable"". There is in fact clear authority of this Court that, quite apart from the effect of s 165(3), a warning is not required by reason of the evidence falling within a category in s 165(1) unless that evidence is of a kind that may in fact be unreliable by reason of being within that category: R v Clark [2001] NSWCCA 494; (2001) 123 A Crim R 506, R v Fowler [2003] NSWCCA 321; (2003) 151 A Crim R 166, Derbas v R [2007] NSWCCA 118, and GAR v R (No 2) [2010] NSWCCA 164. 

88In the light of that authority, any question as to the interpretation of what Howie J said in R v Stewart [2001] NSWCCA 260; (2001) 52 NSWLR 301 and any doubts expressed by Smart AJ (Giles JA and Dunford J agreeing) in R v Harbulot [2003] NSWCCA 141 need no longer be considered. The following clear statement by the Court (Tobias JA, James and Howie JJ) in Fowler at [187] must be considered authoritative. 

[187] If, for example, the Crown relies upon a lie allegedly told by an accused as evidencing a consciousness of guilt, the lie will amount to an admission for the purposes of Pt 3.2 of the Act. Whether a warning under s 165 should be given about that evidence depends upon the issues raised in relation thereto during the trial. If there is no issue that the accused made the statement upon which the Crown relies, it is unlikely that any warning will be required. The directions to be given to the jury identifying the pre-conditions that must be fulfilled before the statement can be used as evidence of a consciousness of guilt would be sufficient to fully alert the jury as to the way in which they are to consider that evidence and determine the issues raised before them. In such a case, there will usually be no risk of unreliability notwithstanding that the statement may amount to an admission for the purposes of the Act. A warning is not required where, even though it falls with the ambit of s 165(1)(a), the evidence is not ""of a kind that might be unreliable"" (applying Clarke ), or where there are good reasons for not giving a warning (applying s 165(3)). If the accused denies making the statement relied upon by the Crown, the question of whether a s 165 warning is required will depend upon the nature of the attack made upon the evidence of the making of the disputed statement. 

89There is of course a sense in which any evidence may be unreliable; but plainly s 165 is directed towards evidence in relation to which there is such reason to suspect unreliability that caution should be exercised in relation to it, over and above the ordinary scrutiny that should be exercised in relation to all evidence. 

90However, hearsay evidence does generally have characteristics such that it is ""of a kind that may be unreliable"", in the sense in which that phrase is used in s 165(1). As was said in R v TJF [2001] NSWCCA 127; (2001) 120 A Crim R 209 at [55], in relation to evidence of a complaint: 

[55] By its very nature, evidence of complaint, being hearsay evidence, may be unreliable for a number of reasons expressed in the report of the Australian Law Reform Commission which led to the enactment of the Evidence Act 1995. Those reasons are identified in Uniform Evidence Law by Odgers, 4th ed at p413 and may be restated as follows: 

""(a) The potential compounding of weakness of perception, memory, narration skills and sincerity when evidence of the fact is given second hand. 

(b) The statement to the witness not be testable by cross-examination. 

(c) The statement made to the witness not being made in a court environment and thus potentially more susceptible to pressures which might result in a false account. 

(d) The statement made to the witness not being made on oath or affirmation in the solemn context of proceedings in court."" 

91In the present case, consideration (a) did not apply to any significant extent. The hearsay evidence was in the form of a detailed and signed statement, so that there was no danger that words spoken might be inaccurately recalled or expressed, or might not have been intended by their source as sincere and considered assertions of fact; and no danger of any compounding of weakness of perception, memory, narration skills or sincerity, by reason of the assertions being relayed second-hand. The statement was made on 9 March 2009, a little under five months after the event, so the danger of weakness of memory skills was not only not compounded, but was also less than that for evidence given orally in the case in 2010. 

92Consideration (b) did apply. However, this of itself does not suggest unreliability, but rather means that factors indicating unreliability that may exist are not disclosed: see R v Nemeth [2002] NSWCCA 281 at [10]. Such possible factors concern Ms Bekdache's honesty, perception of events and accuracy of recounting them. There was in this case no basis for suggesting partiality or dishonesty; and while it is true that cross-examination may have disclosed such a basis, this possibility is remote in the extreme. However, in circumstances where there was a conflict between Ms Bekdache's statement and evidence of defence witnesses as to whether Ms Bekdache spoke directly to Mr Homsi, cross-examination might possibly have raised a question as to whether this was something she clearly remembered or had reconstructed. 

93Consideration (c) did not apply to any significant extent. There is no reason to think that Ms Bekdache may have been susceptible to pressures in making her statement to police. 

94Consideration (d) did apply, but can be considered of less force in relation to an independent witness such as Ms Bekdache. 

95In this particular case, accepting that absence of cross-examination does not of itself suggest unreliability, I am not satisfied that a conclusion that the evidence was not of a kind that may be unreliable was a wrong conclusion. 

96A requirement of s 165(2) is that the judge inform the jury of the matters that may cause the evidence to be unreliable. In the present case, the matters that could possibly fall within that requirement would be the facts that the evidence was by way of a signed statement and was not sworn or solemnly affirmed in court, and that it was not the subject of cross-examination that could disclose potential unreliability. I do not think that either of these matters, as such, indicates that the evidence is of a kind that may be unreliable within s 165(1); and in any event, both would have been apparent to the jury. 

97In my opinion also, having regard to the above considerations, to warn the jury that this evidence maybe unreliable, to give those reasons, and to warn the jury of the need for caution in relation to it, would not have been warranted in this case, particularly having regard to the relatively minor significance of points of conflict between this evidence and that of defence witnesses; so that there were good reasons within s 165(3) for not giving those warnings. 

98I note that in Mendham at 388, Gleeson CJ (Handley JA and Grove J agreeing) said this, in relation to a deposition of evidence given by a police officer Sergeant Hain at committal proceedings, which over objection had been read at the trial in purported reliance on s 409 of the Crimes Act (since repealed): 

The authorities make it clear that, even if Sergeant Hain's deposition had been admissible under s 409, the trial judge should have given the jury an appropriate warning of the approach to be taken of that evidence. His Honour was asked to give such a warning but declined to do so. 

In Henriques (1991) 93 Cr App R 237 at 242 the Privy Council said: 

""When a judge allows deposition evidence to be admitted he should as a matter of course warn the jury that they have neither had the benefit of seeing the deponent nor of hearing his evidence tested in cross-examination and that they must take this into consideration when evaluating the reliability of his evidence. Furthermore as Lord Griffiths said in Scott and Barnes [1989] AC 1242 at 1259; (1989) 89 Cr App R 153 at 161: 

'in many cases it will be appropriate for a judge to develop this warning by pointing out particular features of the evidence in the deposition which conflict with other evidence and which could have been explored in cross-examination.'"" 

The present case involved a good example of the sort of thing to which Lord Griffith [sic] was referring. There was a clear and important conflict between the evidence of Hain and the evidence of Eastwood, relating to the matter of Hain's notebook. This is just the sort of matter that should have been dealt with in the course of an appropriate warning. 

The reference to the evidence of Eastwood was a reference to evidence given at the trial by another police officer, which conflicted in an important respect with that of Sergeant Hain. 

99That decision pre-dated the Evidence Act 1995; and it is important that the only significant evidence against the appellant in that case was a statement he was alleged to have made in a conversation described by Gleeson CJ as rather extraordinary, asserted by the deposition and by the evidence of Constable Eastwood, and that there was a conflict between the deposition and that evidence in a vital respect. In those circumstances, a decision that a warning was required is entirely unsurprising. 

100In my opinion, that decision is not apposite to the construction of s 165, and does not affect the views I have expressed above on its application in this case. 

101Nevertheless, on the basis of the considerations discussed in Henriques and Mendham , it may have been desirable that the trial judge point out to the jury that: 

(1) Ms Bekdache's statement was not sworn or solemnly affirmed in court. 

(2) The jury did not have the benefit of seeing her or hearing her evidence tested in cross-examination. 

(3) There was a conflict between her statement and the evidence of defence witnesses as to whether Ms Bekdache spoke directly to Mr Homsi, and the defence had not been able to test by cross-examination whether this was something she remembered clearly or had reconstructed. 

Of course, the trial judge could at the same time have pointed out, as he did, that Ms Bekdache appears to have had no axe to grind. 

102However, to the extent that what the trial judge did fell short of this, it did not in my opinion amount to a departure from trial according to law or give rise to a miscarriage of justice, within that expression in the body of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act , particularly having regard to the circumstance that Ms Bekdache's evidence was, in comparison with other matters concerning credibility to which I have referred earlier in this judgment, not of major significance in the case. 

103Accordingly, even if an argument based on this view of Henriques and Mendham was within this ground of appeal, I would not accede to it. In my opinion this ground of appeal fails. 

Ground 4: Unreasonable verdict 

104For the appellants, it was submitted that the Crown case relied almost entirely on the word of the complainant, and that her evidence was wholly unreliable in the following ways: 

a. Inconsistencies through various statements, her Family Court affidavit, and her previous evidence as set out above. 

b. Inconsistencies with numerous other witnesses (including some of her family and friends), in various aspects from her relationship with the appellants, to attendance of people to her home, to seeing people away from home and attendance at the Doctors during the time of detention. 

c. The injuries, while severe, not being consistent with constant punching to her face alleged, and being consistent with the evidence of the appellant Karamalakis. 

d. The numerous opportunities to leave, and no indication why suddenly she was able to leave on Friday morning as opposed to any other time. 

105The appellants also referred to M v R [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493-5, Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [29] and State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Earthline Constructions Pty Limited [1999] HCA 3; (1999) 160 ALR 588 at [88]. 

106Mr Hamill SC for the appellants also relied on the verdict of not guilty on count 10, as indicating that the jury had not accepted the complainant as a reliable witness. He submitted that, particularly in the light of the trial judge's directions on the matter, the jury would have found urinating on the complainant was an act of indecency on the complainant, if it occurred as the complainant alleged; and so on that matter at least, the jury must have disbelieved her. 

107I have already expressed the view that the jury could reasonably have concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the version of events given by the appellants was a concoction. However, it is still necessary to consider whether the positive evidence led by the Crown made it reasonable for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellants. As submitted for the appellants, there were inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence which the jury may have considered significant. However, there was also substantial evidence supporting her, including the following: 

(1) Descriptions and photographs of extensive injuries suffered by the complainant all over her body, with bruising of different colours (yellow, blue and purple) supporting her evidence that the injuries were the result of assaults over an extended period of time. 

(2) Clumps of the complainant's hair scattered round the house, found by the social worker and police when they first entered the house, along with expert evidence that the recovered hair had been pulled out. 

(3) Cut up clothing found at the same time. 

(4) The circumstance of the complainant's flight from her house, with virtually nothing apart from her children, badly injured and making largely consistent complaints to Ms Bekdache, the police and the social worker. 

108In my opinion, having regard to this supporting evidence, it was well open to the jury to accept beyond reasonable doubt the substance of the complainant's evidence, notwithstanding inconsistencies in it. 

109As regards the not guilty verdict on count 10, it is a little surprising that there should have been this not guilty verdict and no others; but this does not in my opinion show that the jury did not accept the complainant as a reliable witness in such a way as to raise a doubt about the verdicts on other counts. 

110There was some independent corroboration of count 10 (smell of urine described by some witnesses), but the defence sought to explain this as possibly due to the complainant carrying the youngest child. There were also variations in the complainant's account of the incident. 

111One other possible explanation is that, after the jury had retired to consider its verdict, it sent a note asking that the trial judge define ""assault"". In response, the trial judge gave an answer in which he included, as one of the necessary elements of assault, that there ""has to be the application of some force or pressure to the person of another""; and it is conceivable that the jury took the view that the direction of urine on to a person did not satisfy that requirement. 

112In any event, for the reasons I have set out above and notwithstanding the verdict of not guilty on count 10, having assessed the sufficiency and quality of the evidence in the case, my opinion is that it was well open to the jury, as a matter of fact, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of both appellants. I do of course take into account that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the consideration that the jury had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses. 

113Accordingly, I would reject this ground also, and I would dismiss the appeal of both appellants. 

Proviso 

114For reasons I have given, it is my opinion that any shortcomings in the trial judge's directions did not occasion any miscarriage of justice, as that expression is used in the body of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act , or otherwise come within the body of s 6(1); so it is not necessary to consider the proviso. 

115However, it does follow from my discussion that I am of the view that any such shortcomings had no significance in determining the jury's verdict, and that there was no such shortcoming that the appellants were deprived of a trial according to law. Having independently assessed the evidence, and having taking account of the jury's verdict, I consider that the appellants were proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offences on which they were found guilty by the jury, and I am affirmatively satisfied that no substantial miscarriage of justice actually occurred. 

Appeals against sentence 

116In his remarks on sentence, the trial judge made the following findings and observations concerning the objective seriousness of the offences: 

The litany of [the complainant's] injuries is a lengthy one. The Crown summarises it and I propose to adopt the phrase as indicating only that she had bruises and grazes from her head to her legs. She had clearly been the victim of prolonged and widespread violence. 

She had been detained from some time after two o'clock on 21 October to about seven o'clock on 24 October when she made her escape. That is a period of about sixty-five hours during which time she had been bashed, terrorised by threats and deprived of the means of escape. Her detention had been achieved; that is the interference with her liberty to move away from her home had been achieved by a combination of factors, namely those threats, the actual assaults and the fact that she had been handicapped by removal of the car keys, her bankcards and Medicare cards so that she had no means to travel and no means either to identify herself or to access any funds. 

Overall the submission made by both counsel is that this act of detainment falls not, as the Crown suggests above the middle level of objective criminality. And, as well, Mr Little for the offender Karamalakis, suggests that because she is charged as a principal in the second degree, her sentence should be less than that imposed on Homsi. The Crown appears to accept that that is so, although the consensus between them is that the difference should not be a significant one. 

The evaluation of criminality involved in a charge of detaining includes consideration of the duration of the period and the extent to which fear was occasioned. This was a prolonged period and the level of violence, actual and threatened, was such as to engender very grave fears on the part of the victim. In all this was a very serious abuse of the liberty and person of the victim. It occurred in her own home. It was, at least on one occasion, witnessed by at least one of the children who protested at the violence being administered to her mother. These latter factors are aggravating elements pursuant to s 21A(2). 

The actual and threatened violence are not themselves elements of the offence and are at least theoretically available as aggravating factors also. But because actual bodily harm is already included in the offence I have deemed it appropriate to disregard these matters in the sense of not finding them established under s 21A(2). 

As to the level of harm, emotional and physical, it is clear that the victim suffered significantly and is left with ongoing anxiety. To her credit in her victim impact statement she asserts that things are getting better and I am not therefore prepared to find that the level of harm she suffered amounted to a separate aggravating element over and above the level to which any victim of a prolonged and violent detention would be expected to suffer. 

I have been referred, understandably, to the statistics, but more so in this case than in some others they are of really little value. The act of detainment can range from a momentary detention to a very prolonged period. The level of violence and fear can vary widely. In all circumstances I find this offence falls comfortably within the middle range of objective seriousness. Whilst there is no standard non-parole period applicable to this crime, the maximum sentence of twenty-five years means that such a finding should result in a very significant term of imprisonment. 

I note that both offenders have maintained their innocence. This is their right and no criticism is made of that. The only relevance in making that observation is that such a stand negates any contrition or remorse and this forecloses any prospect of additional leniency on that basis. 

117He then considered the subjective case of Mr Homsi, noting evidence that he had a dysfunctional childhood because of an abusive alcoholic father; that his father was murdered when Mr Homsi was 16; and that he had the trauma of seeing his father's body. The trial judge referred to Mr Homsi's criminal antecedents, and also to a suggestion from a report of a psychologist, tendered on behalf of Mr Homsi, that this crime may be related to Mr Homsi's heavy cannabis use. (I note that the trial judge did not refer to another part of the psychologist's report, in which Mr Homsi is reported as smoking cocaine from the age of 19, and doing so three times a week up until the time of his arrest.) The trial judge referred to the psychologist's view that the risk of violent recidivism was low to moderate and that Mr Homsi's prospects of rehabilitation were good. The trial judge referred to references given for Mr Homsi; and he concluded that Mr Homsi's prospects of rehabilitation were average. 

118The trial judge noted that this was Mr Homsi's first time in custody and that he had lost contact with his children; and he considered it appropriate to vary the proportions of his sentence because of those circumstances. 

119The trial judge then considered the subjective case of Ms Karamalakis, noting that she had a dysfunctional and abusive early family environment, and that she suffered from having married a man later convicted of terrorism offences. He said she was young and pregnant to Mr Homsi, and that this was her first time in custody; and he found that a substantial reduction should be made in her non-parole period to reflect these circumstances. 

Submissions for Mr Homsi 

120It was submitted for Mr Homsi that the assaults (counts 1 and 2) could have been dealt with by the Local Court, where statistics showed that only 7 per cent of cases are dealt with by way of full-time custody, and only 0.06 per cent dealt with as harshly as this case. Even in the District Court, only 27 per cent receive full-time custody, and only 10 per cent received a term of 7 months or more. There was nothing in the assaults in this case that would put them at the top of the range of seriousness. 

121As regards the detain count, statistics showed that the sentence imposed was in the highest 18 per cent of sentences; and having regard to the trial judge's assessment of objective seriousness as being in the middle of the range, the sentence was outside the accepted pattern. The excessiveness of the sentence for assault, although concurrent, contributed to the excessiveness of the overall sentence. 

Submissions for Ms Karamalakis 

122It was submitted for Ms Karamalakis that the malicious damage charge could have been dealt with at the Local Court, where of 17,068 offenders not one received more than 12 months fixed term or non-parole period. Even in the District Court (where there were no limits on the value of the damage) only three of 51 received a fixed term or non-parole period more than 12 months. There was nothing in this case to put it at the top of the range of seriousness. As regards the detain offence, the role of Ms Karamalakis was less than that of Mr Homsi; and it was difficult to see how her prior good character, background and prospects for rehabilitation had been properly taken into account. The excessiveness of the sentence for malicious damage, though concurrent, had contributed to the excessiveness of the overall sentence. 

Decision 

123The maximum penalty for assault is two years imprisonment ( Crimes Act s 61); for malicious damage five years ( Crimes Act s 195(1)(a)); and for specially aggravated detain for advantage 25 years ( Crimes Act s 86(3)). 

124I accept the Crown's submission that sentencing statistics are of limited use. I also note that, in circumstances where it would have been pointless to fix a non-parole period for the assault and malicious damage charges, the appropriate comparison would be with fixed terms and head sentences, not with fixed terms and non-parole periods. 

125In relation to the assault and malicious damage offences, it is legitimate to take into account that they were not isolated incidents, but were committed in the context of extensive, prolonged and serious wrongdoing perpetrated on the victim. In relation to these, as well as the main offence, it is to be taken into account that the appellants have not shown any remorse. In those circumstances, I am not satisfied that the sentences imposed for the assault and malicious damage offences were excessive. 

126As regards the detain for advantage offence, I accept the Crown's submission that these are serious examples of a serious offence. Although Mr Homsi was the principal in the violence shown towards the complainant and in her detention, Ms Karamalakis was also an active participant. The substantially lower non-parole period in her case appropriately reflected her lesser role, and also her prior good character, her youth and her pregnancy. 

127I am not satisfied that the sentences for the detain for advantage offences were excessive. 

Orders 

128In the case of each applicant I propose the following orders: 

(1) Appeal against conviction dismissed. 

(2) Leave to appeal against sentence granted, and appeal against sentence dismissed. 

129HOEBEN J: I agree with Hodgson JA. 

130GROVE AJ: I agree with Hodgson JA.

2709428,Collier v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2011] NSWCA 202,"HEADNOTE 
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment] 
Facts 
On 30 June 2009, the plaintiff was charged with six traffic offences at the Surry Hills Police Station. At the station she was given Court Attendance Notices detailing the offences and showing a return date of 22 July 2009 before a Downing Centre Local Court. On 14 July 2009, the plaintiff's ex-husband sent an email in her name to the Local Court Registrar stating that she intended to plead guilty ""with an excuse"", and requesting the matter be transferred to the Local Court in Gulgong, closer to where she lived. By letter dated 23 July 2009, the Local Court advised her that the six matters had been adjourned to the Local Court at Gulgong ""for plea"". 

The matter was mentioned before the Local Court on a number of occasions, before being finally dealt with on 7 April 2010. On none of these occasions, nor on 7 April 2010, was the substance of the offences charged stated to the plaintiff, although indications were given by or on behalf of the plaintiff to the effect that she was pleading guilty. 
On 7 April 2010, when the plaintiff's matter had been identified, a solicitor representing the plaintiff told the magistrate that he was instructed to enter a plea of guilty. 
The solicitor then made submissions in mitigation, and the plaintiff was convicted of the six offences and sentenced to two 12-month bonds with probation supervision, a three-year licence disqualification and fines. 
Section 192(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides: 
(2) The court must state the substance of the offence to the accused person and ask the accused person if the accused person pleads guilty or not guilty. 
However, ""accused person"" is relevantly defined in s 3 of that Act so as to include ""a legal practitioner representing an accused person"". 
The plaintiff appealed to the District Court from her conviction, claiming that she had not pleaded guilty, and in the alternative seeking leave to withdraw the pleas. The primary judge found that the plaintiff had pleaded guilty, and that she should not be given leave to withdraw that plea. The plaintiff sought judicial review of that decision. 
Issues 
Issues arising on the application for judicial review: 
(1) What is required for an effective plea of guilty to a summary offence? 
(2) Whether the primary judge erred in law in determining that a guilty plea had been entered in these circumstances. 
(3) Whether s 192(2) invalidates a plea made in circumstances where the charges are not formally and separately stated in court prior to the plea being entered. 
(4) Whether procedural fairness or natural justice had been denied to the plaintiff by the primary judge or the magistrate. 
Held (dismissing the application with costs): 
( Per Hodgson JA, Campbell JA and Latham J agreeing ) 
In relation to (1) - requirements for effective guilty plea 
For an effective plea of guilty it must be appropriately conveyed to the court that the accused person (personally or by a legal practitioner) understands what is charged against him/her and unequivocally pleads guilty to that charge. 
In relation to (2) - whether guilty plea entered 
A guilty plea was entered. It can be inferred that the solicitor representing the plaintiff had been provided with copies of the Court Attendance Notices and police facts, so that he was well aware of the terms of the charges. Therefore his statement to the Court that he was instructed to enter a plea of guilty unequivocally conveyed to the Court that the plaintiff did plead guilty to those charges. 
In relation to (3) - section 192(2) 
The purpose of s 192(2) is to ensure that, to the knowledge of the court, an accused person adequately understands what it is to which he/she is to plead guilty or not guilty, and understands that his/her response will count as such a plea. In circumstances where the accused is represented, this purpose can be achieved without charges being formally and separately stated before a plea is entered. The stating by the court of the substance of the offence is not a condition precedent to the validity of a plea of guilty, and it is not the purpose of s 192 that the power to convict be dependent upon such a stating. Therefore non-compliance with s 192 does not of itself invalidate a guilty plea. 
Ex parte Dunn (1904) 21 WN(NSW) 152, R v Paauwe [1971] 2 NSWLR 235, R v Wakefield Justices [1970] 1 All ER 1181 considered. 
In relation to (4) - procedural fairness and natural justice 
The plaintiff was at no stage denied procedural fairness or natural justice. 


			Judgment 

1HODGSON JA: On 7 April 2010, Mrs Collier, the plaintiff in these proceedings, was in the Local Court at Mudgee convicted and sentenced on six traffic offences. 

2On 23 June 2010, Walmsley SC DCJ dismissed an application by Mrs Collier for leave to appeal from her conviction, deciding that Mrs Collier had pleaded guilty to the offences and that she should not be given leave to withdraw her plea. 

3By her amended summons in this Court, Mrs Collier seeks an order in the nature of certiorari quashing the judgment of Walmsley DCJ, and consequential relief. 

Circumstances 

4Exhibit A before the primary judge included court copies of the six Court Attendance Notices by which the proceedings in the Local Court were commenced against Mrs Collier under s 172 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 ( CP Act ): Application Book (AB) 333-346. 

5Three of these notices alleged offences occurring between 1.40 pm and 1.45 pm on 30 June 2009 at Surry Hills (never licensed person driving motor vehicle, using unregistered Class A motor vehicle, and driving uninsured vehicle), and three alleged offences occurring between 2.03 pm and 2.05 pm on 30 June 2009 at Paddington (same offences). 

6Exhibit A before the primary judge also included a fact sheet that was before the Local Court (AB 347-351), setting out the police allegations as to what had happened. These allegations included: 

(1) At about 1.40 pm, police observed an identified Holden vehicle travelling in Albion Street, Surry Hills towards Flinders Street, turn into Flinders Street, then turn into Moore Park Road, and then turn into Greens Road, Paddington, where it stopped following activation of a warning device on the police vehicle. 

(2) The vehicle was unregistered. 

(3) Mrs Collier was the driver and was unlicensed. 

(4) Mrs Collier was then issued with a Field Court Attendance Notice for three offences. 

(5) Mrs Collier was told she was not to drive the vehicle and would need to arrange for it to be towed. 

(6) Less than five minutes later, police observed the same vehicle being driven along Greens Road by Mrs Collier. 

(7) Police indicated for Mrs Collier to stop, and she was arrested and taken to Surry Hills police station. 

(8) The Field Court Attendance Notice was cancelled, and Mrs Collier was charged with the six offences at the police station. 

7The copy Court Attendance Notice shows a return date 22 July 2009 before a Downing Centre Local Court. 

8On 14 July 2009, an email was sent to the Local Court in the following terms: 

""Dear Registrar, 

My name is Marion Louise Collier and I have two traffic matters (totalling 6) which are to come before your Court Tuesday next 22nd July. I have been informed by a Mr. Richard Wise Solicitor of Mudgee NSW, that since I live at Gulgong (3300 kms.) from Sydney"" (that's clearly an error) ""and wish to plead guilty with an excuse that it would be possible to have these matters transferred to Gulgong. 

Mr. Wise mentioned the 6th August 2009, and since the Gulgong Court does not alway [sic] sit, I presume that this must be the next date. Also as I explained when I rang your court this morning, My printer is not printing correctly, so you would not clearly understand if I printed and faxed to you. 

If this is not appropriate by e-mail, could you kindly let me know, my telephone number is"" (and then it is set out) ""Thanking you, 

Your's [sic] Sincerely, Mrs Marion Louise Collier"". 

9By letter dated 23 July 2009 to Mrs Collier, the Local Court at Downing Centre advised her that on 22 July 2009 the six matters had been adjourned to the Local Court at Gulgong ""for Plea"". 

10On 6 August 2009, the matter came before Magistrate Stevenson in the Local Court at Gulgong. A solicitor Mr Wise appeared. According to the transcript, this was said: 

WISE: Your Honour, if I could just call through some of the matters that I'm involved in this morning, Starting with number 2, the matter of Marion Collier. 

HER HONOUR: She's not here? 

WISE: That is so your Honour. I received a telephone call from her indicating that she is unwell and she has asked for an adjournment of the proceedings. As I understand it, she is actually in for sentence having pleaded to certain matters at the Downing Centre. 

HER HONOUR: That's right. Right and then she says here she is waiting to be admitted to hospital. 

WISE: I have no further particulars your Honour. I think that if the matter could be put over to sentence to 8 October, I might be able to sort something out for her in the interim if that is suitable to your Honour. 

HER HONOUR: All right. You might like to remind her that she'd better not drive, she's already got two unlicensed matters, I don't know what else is on her record but it wouldn't be a good look. Okay, 8 October? 

WISE: Yes thank you, your Honour. 

HER HONOUR: Yes, for sentence yes. 

And then the transcript records: ""ADJOURNED FOR SENTENCE TO THURSDAY 8 OCTOBER 2009."" 

11On 8 October 2009, the matter again came before Magistrate Stevenson at Gulgong. A Mr Flynn mentioned the matter for Mrs Collier. According to the transcript, this was said: 

FLYNN: I actually saw Mrs Collier myself a few days ago and I was going to ask for this matter to be adjourned to obtain some medical reports anyway it appears that she is suffering from - she had a lung biopsy a few weeks ago, she's now got a lung infection on that, she's having problems where she just hasn't been diagnosed properly so I think I need to get some reports in any case. 

HER HONOUR: All right. They were pleas of guilty weren't they as I understand it but no facts tendered? Pleas of guilty at the Downing Centre by letter. 

FLYNN: Yes, yes. That's correct. 

HER HONOUR: All right."" 

12The transcript notes that the matter was adjourned for sentence to 10 December 2009. 

13On 10 December 2009, the matter was again before Magistrate Stevenson at Gulgong. According to the transcript before the trial judge, the following exchange occurred: 

HER HONOUR: Marion Collier, are you representing yourself today? 

ACCUSED: Yes your Honour. It is your Honour isn't it? 

HER HONOUR: Yes. No that's fine I'll deal with that matter shortly. 

LIST INTERPOSED 

ACCUSED: Excuse me can I just mention something? 

HER HONOUR: Mm. 

ACCUSED: Which might help out. I actually - my name's Marion Collier. I issued a subpoena in this matter. I was at a respiratory physician and got it done at Orange last week and I was told by the Registrar when she had to check it up that it was in for mention and Mr Wise when I saw him it was the first time I got to see him, had told me, had given me some paperwork and so I really don't know what's going on today but I need to get-- 

HER HONOUR: You're actually in for sentence today. 

ACCUSED: Well I suppose that's right. Everyone gets a different story. But - no offence your Honour - but the other thing is that I need to get access to that subpoena if that's possible-- 

14Magistrate Stevenson then spoke to a barrister Mr Day, who was in the court, and asked if he could spend five minutes to advise Mrs Collier. 

15Later that day, according to the transcript, the following was said: 

HER HONOUR: Mr Day did you have a chance to have quick word to that lady? 

Mr Day now appears for the Accused 

DAY: Yes I have spoken to Ms Collier your Honour- 

HER HONOUR: Thank you very much. 

DAY: --for the drive matters your Honour. I return the court's file. 

HER HONOUR: Thank you. 

DAY: Your Honour, I explained to her that the matter is listed for sentence today and there's six driving matters. She told me that she attended at the Local Court registry at Orange last week and spoke to Registrar Steele who apparently consulted the computer and informed Ms Collier that the matter was listed for mention today. Apparently also at the time a subpoena was issued for the production of documents relating to her condition, not so much a medical condition perhaps another condition, associated with the circumstances of the commission of one of the series of offences, there's three and three making it six your Honour. Your Honour, she is not in a position to proceed to sentence today. I explained to her the procedures of the court and that your Honour may be inclined to grant her an adjournment to the next sittings here at Gulgong. 

HER HONOUR: Okay. She sent a letter on 14 July to the registrar - it was at the Downing Centre saying she wanted to plead guilty and have the matter transferred here. 

DAY: What she has indicated to me your Honour, the pleas would be guilty. It's a rather interesting situation where the matter has some history to it your Honour, apparently. 

HER HONOUR: She's not seeking to traverse her pleas is she? 

ACCUSED: No I'm not. Yeah no, not really no I just want to explain why it happened. 

DAY: She is not traversing the plea your Honour, she is endeavouring to obtain material to explain her subjective circumstances at the time of the - at least one of the offences if not both. Your Honour she tells me also she has spoken to - she's not traversing her - she's also indicated that she has consulted with a duty solicitor, I think Mr Wise. It seems that she is eligible for Legal Aid and I did give her some advice, it wasn't of a legal nature your Honour, it was that she should contact Legal Aid and get representation to assist her on sentence. 

HER HONOUR: Well certainly it's two unlicensed and it does carry a - could carry a gaol sentence. 

16Later again on that day, according to the transcript, the following was said: 

ACCUSED: Maybe I could speak for a second if that's all right? 

HER HONOUR: Well I'm going to say this. You've got two unlicensed, you've two unregistered and uninsured, that's what I'm focussing on. 

ACCUSED: Yes your Honour what I'm getting at is that basically the first one the reason why I was doing it and the second was to move the car off the road which was in a bad position and that was all I did. So I'm not denying that there was but I'm denying the facts that they've put in. And the reason that I subpoenaed that document is for the same reason that I have a letter from a doctor which I'll hand up which is basically that I do not have a mental illness, I have a letter from the AFP confirming that the registrar refused to have the matter investigate-- 

17The matter was adjourned for sentence to 4 February 2010. 

18On 4 February 2010, the matter again came before Magistrate Stevenson at Gulgong. Mrs Collier was unrepresented. According to the transcript, this was said: 

HER HONOUR: Now in relation to Miss Collier as I understand it sergeant Miss Collier is still seeking Legal Aid but not here. Miss Collier I can take the matter to Mudgee and you can speak to a Legal Aid solicitor there if you like. 

ACCUSED: Well what's actually happened, I have got a letter from them. 

HER HONOUR: Right. 

ACCUSED: What initially had happened was I put in the application believing because I'd signed the documents that Mr Wise had sent all the necessary documents. I received a letter which I've got a copy here if you want it, dated 23 December sent to me to say that it was knocked back so when I got onto them and said, 'Well I'll send you in the documents"" after I found out they hadn't been sent, they said, ""No now you've got to appeal"", so the twenty-eight days aren't up on the appeal so I'm really basically at this stage seeking an adjournment under s 57. 

HER HONOUR: No that's okay. So you've lodged your appeal? 

ACCUSED: Yes I lodged it straight away but I'm worked out-- 

HER HONOUR: And you don't know when it's going to be heard? 

ACCUSED: No I worked out that they would've received it 6 or 7 January, maybe the 8th at the latest. 

HER HONOUR: What about 17 March at Mudgee? 

ACCUSED: I'm involved in a family law matter in March and it could take up to two weeks. 

HER HONOUR: Well okay I'll tell you what. Your matter's for sentence on 7 April at Mudgee. 

ACCUSED: Okay thank you. 

HER HO'N0UR: All right. 

ACCUSED: I can leave now? 

HER HONOUR: Yes thank you. 

ACCUSED: Did you want a copy of that letter? 

HER HONOUR: No that's fine thanks. 

ACCUSED: Thank you. 

19The transcript records that the matter was adjourned for sentence to 7 April 2010 at Mudgee. 

20On 7 April 2010, before Magistrate Stevenson at Mudgee, Mrs Collier was represented by a solicitor Mr Madden. According to the transcript the following was said: 

HER HONOUR: yes other matters? 

MADDEN: Matter number 5 Marion Collier. 

HER HONOUR: Yes, Ms Collier. 

MADDEN: Ms Collier is before you in court your Honour, she is coming forward now. In relation to this matter, l am instructed to enter a plea of guilty. 

HER HONOUR: Thank you. 

MADDEN: If I may hand up some documents from the Manning Medical Practice and Dr Ronald Perry that may assist your Honour in regard to the submissions thank you. 

PROSECUTOR: I'll just show my friend before I hand up the facts. There's no objection to the references - facts and record. 

HER HONOUR: Yes thank you. Is Ms Collier still living in Gulgong? 

MADDEN: Yes your Honour. 

PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, I just note from my file that a plea of guilty may have been entered quite a few months ago, I think that would assist my friend and I think that should be brought-- 

HER HONOUR: 22 July. 

PROSECUTOR: It was entered back then? 

HER HONOUR: It was sent up from the Downing Centre. 

PROSECUTOR: Yes it's just that my file indicates that a plea may have been entered at Gulgong Local Court on 6 August perhaps. 

HER HONOUR: 6 August was the first time at Gulgong and it was put over to 8 October for sentence. So it must've been indicated at the Downing Centre. 

PROSECUTOR: Right. 

HER HONOUR: So what has happened to the car? 

MADDEN: Yes the car wasn't - isn't owned by my client your Honour, it's owned by her de facto as I understand it. 

HER HONOUR: So where is that car now? 

MADDEN: It's at home in the garage. It's still not registered, it's still not on the road other than the brief appearance it made on the road. 

COUNSEL ADDRESSED 

HER HONOUR: With the never licensed there's two matters, they would have to - do you have any objection if they're concurrent sergeant? 

PROSECUTOR: No your Honour. But it's an automatic three years I think-- 

HER HONOUR: YES THEY'RE EACH THREE YEARS DISQUALIFICATION AND I WILL MARK THEM WITH PROBATION. 

IT WILL BE A BOND FOR 12 MONTHS WITH PROBATION SUPERVISION BECAUSE IF SHE GETS A ..(NOT TRANSCRIBABLE).. OF DRIVING UNLICENSED IT DOES CARRY A GAOL SENTENCE. 

IN RELATION TO THE UNREGISTERED VEHICLE IT'S $100, COURT COSTS $76, 28 DAYS TO PAY THAT'S SEQUENCE 2. 

SIMILARLY, FOR SEQUENCE 3. I AM TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HER ABILITY TO PAY OTHERWISE THEY WOULD BE QUITE LARGER FINES. SEQUENCE 5 - $100, COURT COSTS $76. 

SO IT'S TWO BONDS WITH PROBATION SUPERVISION, A THREE YEAR DISQUALIFICATION AND FINES. 

YOU WILL HAVE TO ENTER THOSE DOCUMENTS IN THE OFFICE AND SEE THE PROBATION OFFICER TODAY, THANK YOU. 

MADDEN: They're 12 months bonds wasn't it your Honour? 

HER HONOUR: They are, thank you. 

Proceedings before the primary judge 

21Before the primary judge, evidence was given by Mrs Collier that: 

(1) The email of 14 July 2009 was sent by her ex-husband without her knowledge or authority at a time when she was ill. 

(2) She had always maintained her innocence, and that insofar as the transcripts showed her as making statements amounting to admissions, the transcripts were wrong. 

(3) Significant parts of what was said at the court appearances had not been transcribed. 

(4) Mr Madden was instructed to plead not guilty, and acted contrary to her instructions in purporting to enter a plea of guilty. 

22Evidence was given by Mr Collier that he had sent the email of 14 July 2009 in the name of Mrs Collier, and had not asked her about its contents or shown it to her because she was too unwell. He had been told it was necessary to say that she was pleading guilty, in order to get the matter transferred to Gulgong. 

23Also before the District Court was an email from Mr Day to Mrs Collier, confirming that he did not represent her on 10 December 2009 (Exhibit D before the primary judge, AB 93). 

Decision of primary judge 

24The primary judge outlined the circumstances of the court proceedings. 

25Having noted that Mr Madden did not give evidence, and having stated that he did not draw any inference adverse to Mrs Collier because of Mr Madden's absence from the witness box, the primary judge continued: 

16. I am persuaded that the record shows without doubt that Mrs Collier did plead guilty to the six offences, although I accept her ex-husband's evidence of the circumstances in which he says he sent the email. The transcript, which I am satisfied is correct, notwithstanding Mrs Collier's submissions to me to the contrary, shows that on several occasions she was present in court and made statements which could only be consistent with her having pleaded guilty or intending to plead guilty. For example, on 10 December 2009 when the Magistrate said, ""She is not seeking to traverse her pleas is she?"" She said, ""No I'm not, yeah, no not really no. I just want to explain why it happened"". Then at transcript page 4 on that day she said she was in effect not denying she had driven the car but ""denying the facts that they've put in"". In that context she referred to a subpoena. A document she subpoenaed consisted of a COPS entry, which she said shows that the police had it in for her and were motivated by malice in certain respects, in the way they dealt with these matters. 

26Having thus found that Mrs Collier had pleaded guilty, the primary judge then considered whether she should be permitted to withdraw that plea. He referred to Sagiv v R (1986) 22 A Crim R 73 and Wong v DPP [2005] NSWSC 129; and he continued: 

20. I do have difficulty in seeing that there is any defence available to Mrs Collier. There was not a great deal said to me about the merits when this matter was before me last week. It is possible that Mr Wise addressed the merits, but the transcript of his address, as I have observed, was not transcribed. As I understand Mrs Collier's position, she concedes that she drove her car on each of the two relevant occasions but she says the second occasion was to avoid a dangerous situation. 

21. On 10 December 2009 at transcript 3 Mrs Collier is recorded as saying, ""I just want to explain why it happened"". I observe also that in the email originally sent to the Local Court to get the matter transferred, the email said she wished to plead guilty with ""an excuse"". I infer that her husband had heard from her that there was to be an excuse offered. 

22. The fact that she says, ""I just want to explain why it happened"" or that she had ""an excuse"", does not of course exclude the possibility that she does have some defence on the merits. But it does, so far as I am concerned, point much more in the direction of her wanting to explain why she did what she did, so as to ameliorate the objective seriousness of the offences. It is not as though she said she was not driving, that someone else was driving or something of that nature. 

23. In summary, although I had concerns about the integrity of the pleas as originally entered, it is clear that she was present on several relevant occasions after that, particularly on the occasion when the sentencing exercise occurred and when she had a solicitor acting for her, and, as I found, did plead guilty. But I am very far from being convinced that any miscarriage of justice would occur if I did not allow her to withdraw the pleas of guilty. 

Proceedings in this Court 

27The claim to this Court is put on the basis of error of law on the face of the record, denial of procedural fairness and denial of natural justice. 

28The evidentiary material before this Court included what was before the primary judge, and also some material that was not before the primary judge, which was admitted on the basis that it could be relevant to denial of procedural fairness or natural justice, and to the exercise of discretion in relation to the remedy of certiorari. 

29In Mrs Collier's affidavits of 5 August 2010 and 27 August 2010, assertions are made concerning inaccuracies of transcripts, and there is also some material apparently relied on as supporting procedural unfairness towards her. 

30In Mrs Collier's affidavit of 27 August 2010, it is stated that Mrs Collier was not shown the paperwork relating to the so-called facts of the New South Wales Police Service until November 2009; and that when, contrary to her instructions, Mr Madden made a guilty plea, she tried to intervene, which was not shown in the transcript. She also stated that there was no record in the transcript before the primary judge of Mr Madden's submission or Magistrate Stevenson's unnecessary adverse remarks against Mrs Collier. It was also stated that the primary judge had denied procedural fairness in not allowing her adequate time to prepare adequate submissions at the conclusion of the case. 

31Material in paragraphs 26 to 32 of that affidavit were objected to and not immediately ruled on. In my opinion they are irrelevant and are to be rejected. 

32Mrs Collier's affidavit of 29 November 2010 was objected to. In my opinion, the material in that affidavit is irrelevant, except in its references to that part of the transcript of 7 April 2010 which was not before the primary judge, but which is before this Court. 

33There were also affidavits of Mrs Collier of 22 December 2010 and 29 March 2011, which are entirely irrelevant to this application. 

34There is also documentary evidence before this Court that was not before the primary judge. This includes documents signed by Mrs Collier at the police station on 30 June 2009, and additional transcript for 7 April 2010, which was not before the primary judge. Relevantly, that transcript is as follows: 

MADDEN: If I may-- 

HER HONOUR: Yes. 

MADDEN: --indulge your Honour for reasons I won't put forward. 

HER HONOUR: Yes. 

MADDEN: I won't try and do my usual Legal Aid submission. I'd Just like to give some background if I could. 

HER HONOUR: Mm. 

MADDEN: Your Honour my client was a different stage of her life at that stage. It was a bad time. There were some family problems, especially in regard to certain things, court, District Court appearances and things she had to fix up there with her daughter at the time where her daughter was making certain problems and saying it was her that was making them. 

And in regard to the accident of 30 June my instructions are that on that day - there had previously been an accident in 99 and which she went to court. She disputed the fine in regard to that accident. My instructions are that she won that court case and she believed that she had a licence. She paid some sort of a fine but she still had her licence so in that period ensuing up to 30 June she thought that she did have a licence. 

On that day, yes she knew the vehicle wasn't registered. She didn't drive it very often. It was her de facto's vehicle and I would say the onus was on him to make sure it was registered. She was having some health problems. You can see with what the documents that I tendered to your Honour she wasn't in a good mind frame in regard to that. She was driving to the doctor's appointment at the time when the police pulled her over. 

When the police pulled her over you can see by the facts that they said, ""Don't move the vehicle, you have to get somebody to two [sic] it away"". She went to ring on her mobile. Her mobile was flat. Because of her health problems she was having trouble breathing. The car was not in a particularly good spot on a busy road in Sydney. My instructions are she moved that car some 20 metres or so in which time the police had done - came back, so there would've been a period of time so she just didn't do it straight away. She tried to get on the mobile. There was a period of time because the police had come around again and they saw that she had moved the vehicle. Hence the time that she was unlicensed on the second occasion. 

Your Honour my client is fifty-six years of age. She did complete Year 12. She's worked as a postal clerk. She's worked as an assistant manager in food outlet. She's worked in a call centre for Vodafone. She's currently on a disability pension. I ask your Honour to take into consideration the medication is in regard to anti-depressant which I believe now her life's in a better space, the medication's right. She has fixed up those concerns in regard to the respiratory problems. As I understand the problems in regard to her daughter are fixed up so her life's in a better place than what it was. 

And if you look at her record you will see there are other unlicensed offences but I'd ask your Honour to take that in consideration that that was the period of time that I'm talking about in her life. 

There is an early plea and I thank my friend for bringing that to my attention so that needs to be taken into consideration - I ask your Honour to take that into consideration. 

I understand that there would be - and I've explained to my client that a lengthy suspension of licence in regard to this matter. It would also be dealt with by - could be dealt with by way of fines but I've explained and my client does understand the serious nature, particular with the amount of offences there but I'll repeat and I'd ask your Honour to take into consideration when they happened I that period of time in her life. [sic] 

There's nothing further. 

HER HONOUR: The police weren't very happy with her I can see that by the - she was probably having an argument with them too I assume. 

Submissions 

35Mrs Collier submitted that the primary judge erred in that, having stated he ""had concerns about the integrity of the pleas as originally entered"", did not apply the principles stated in Sagiv that ""in the case of mistake or other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt, the court should readily grant leave"". 

36Mrs Collier submitted that the primary judge erred in not taking account of the fact that individual charges were not put to her so as to obtain clear pleas to those charges; and in not taking account of the 23 July 2009 letter to the effect that the matter had been set down for plea to be given by her in the future. 

37Mrs Collier submitted that the primary judge denied her procedural fairness in not giving her time for submissions, based on the fact that on the last day of the hearing the DPP's solicitor put up two legal case studies concerning principles on which the primary judge would act; and that the primary judge's offer of a sentence appeal showed he had a preconceived mindset. 

38Mrs Collier submitted that she was denied procedural fairness by Magistrate Stevenson, having regard to the transfer of proceedings to Mudgee, the fact that Magistrate Stevenson met in chambers with Mr Wise and Mr Madden on the morning of 7 April 2010, and having regard to Magistrate Stevenson's adverse comment after Mr Madden's submissions. 

Decision 

39In my opinion, the most significant question raised in this application is whether, on the facts as found by the primary judge, there was an error of law in his determination that a guilty plea had been entered. 

40This question calls for consideration of the effect of ss 192 and 193 of the CP Act , which applied to the proceedings brought against Mrs Collier in the Local Court: 

192 Procedures where both parties present 

(1) If both the accused person and the prosecutor are present at the day, time and place set for the hearing and determination of proceedings for an offence (including a day to which the hearing has been adjourned) the court must proceed to hear and determine the matter. 

(2) The court must state the substance of the offence to the accused person and ask the accused person if the accused person pleads guilty or not guilty. 

(3) Instead of hearing and determining the matter, the court may, if it thinks that the matter should not proceed on the specified day, adjourn the hearing to another day for mention or hearing. 


193 Procedure if offence admitted 

(1) If the accused person pleads guilty, and does not show sufficient cause why he or she should not be convicted or not have an order made against him or her, the court must convict the accused person or make the order accordingly. 

(2) This section does not apply if the court does not accept the accused person's guilty plea. 

41These sections must be read with the definition of ""accused person"" in s 3 of the CP Act : 

accused person includes, in relation to summary offences, a defendant and, in relation to all offences (where the subject-matter or context allows or requires), an Australian legal practitioner representing an accused person. 

42Also relevant are provisions dealing with the commencement of summary proceedings. Section 172 of the CP Act provides that proceedings are commenced by the issue of a Court Attendance Notice, and s 177 provides for the service of such notices. Section 175 provides for the form of such notice: 

175 Form of court attendance notice 

(1) A court attendance notice must be in writing and be in the form prescribed by the rules. 

(2) The rules may prescribe one or more forms of court attendance notice. 

(3) A court attendance notice must do the following: 

(a) describe the offence, 

(b) briefly state the particulars of the alleged offence, 

(c) contain the name of the prosecutor, 

(d) require the accused person to appear before the court at a specified date, time and place, unless a warrant is issued for the arrest of the person or the person is refused bail, 

(e) state, unless a warrant is issued for the arrest of the person or the person is refused bail, that failure to appear may result in the arrest of the person or in the matter being dealt with in the absence of the person. 

(4) The rules may prescribe additional matters to be included in court attendance notices. 

(5) A court attendance notice may describe an offence, act or other thing in a way that is sufficient under this Act for the purposes of an indictment or an averment in an indictment. 

43A previous section to somewhat similar effect to s 192 was s 78 of the Justices Act 1902: 

78 Defendant to plead 

(1) Where the defendant appears at the hearing and has been provided with a written copy of any charges against the defendant, the substance of the information or complaint shall be stated to the defendant, and he or she shall be asked if he or she has any cause to show why he or she should not be convicted or why an order should not be made against the defendant, as the case may be. 

(2) If he or she thereupon admits the truth of the information or complaint and shows no sufficient cause why he or she should not be convicted or why an order should not be made against him or her then the Justice or Justices present at the hearing shall convict him or her or make an order against him or her accordingly. 

(3) If he or she does not admit the truth of the information or complaint then the said Justice or Justices shall proceed to hear the prosecutor or complainant and the witnesses whom he or she examines and such other evidence as he or she adduces in support of the information or complaint and to hear the defendant and the witnesses whom he or she examines and such other evidence as he or she adduces in his or her defence. 

44The effect of that provision was considered in Ex parte Dunn (1904) 21 WN(NSW) 152. In that case, the applicant before the Supreme Court had been charged upon an information with an offence under the Games, Wagers and Betting Houses Act 1902. At the hearing before a magistrate, the applicant was not present but was represented by counsel. The information was not read nor its substance stated in court, but the clerk asked the applicant's counsel ""What is the plea?"", and counsel replied ""not guilty"". The magistrate found the offence proved. The applicant sought prohibition, inter alia on the ground that the substance of the charge had not been stated as required by s 78 of the Justices Act . The Full Court dismissed the application. Darley CJ gave the leading judgment, in which he said: 

With regard to the second ground it appears that the defendant did not appear in person, but by counsel, as he has a right to do. The defendant not being present in person, his counsel, who was doubtless in possession of the information and summons, was called upon to plead, and he pleaded ""Not guilty."" It is now complained that the substance of the charge was not stated in Court under s. 78 of the Justices Act. It may be that that section does contemplate cases where a defendant is represented by counsel as well as those in which he is personally present, but it appears to me that if counsel appears, it is his duty, if he has any doubt as to the nature of the charge, to ask that it may be stated, or that the information be read. If instead of doing so he pleads when called upon it seems to me that he waives his right to have the substance of the information stated to him. It would be a mere waste of time. In my opinion, therefore, there is nothing in that point. 

45Another case of some relevance is R v Paauwe [1971] 2 NSWLR 235. In that case, the appellant was charged before a magistrate with indictable offences, pleaded guilty to them and was committed for sentence. At Quarter Sessions, without the appellant being formally charged, his counsel stated that he appeared for the appellant and that the appellant adhered to his pleas. The appellant was convicted and sentenced. The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that it was not necessary that the appellant be re-charged before Quarter Sessions. At 238, the court (Manning JA, Lee and Slattery JJ) said this: 

It is well settled that where a proceeding for a non-indictable offence is instituted by summons, the accused is not required to appear in person and counsel or solicitor may appear for him and plead guilty or not guilty: Ex parte Hughes; Re Moulden (1946) 47 S.R.(N.S.W.) 91; 63 W.N. 293; R v Thompson [1909] 2 K.B. 614 and Ex parte Dunn (1904) 4 S.R. (N.S.W.) 486; 21 W.N. 152. But where the information results in a charge being laid, it is the invariable practice, when the accused is before the magistrate, that the proceedings should commence with the accused being charged. Once charged, his counsel or attorney in his presence, may answer for him: Justices Act , s. 70(3); R v Salisbury and Amesbury Justices; Ex parte Greatbatch (1954) 2 Q.B. 142, at p.147 per Godard L.J. 

46In the present case, if on the facts as found by the primary judge there was never an occasion when the substance of the six charges was stated by the court to Mrs Collier or to a legal practitioner representing her, and if it is the case that in those circumstances there was no plea of guilty that could support her conviction and sentence, then in my opinion there would be an error of law that could justify certiorari. 

47The primary judge's acceptance of Mr Collier's evidence as to the circumstances in which he sent the email of 14 July 2009 means that the email could not amount to a plea of guilty by Mrs Collier (even if it could otherwise do so). None of the exchanges in court, prior to 7 April 2010, could amount to a plea of guilty; and in my opinion it is clearly implicit in the primary judge's account of what happened on each of these occasions that there was no occasion when the substance of the charges was stated by the court. 

48As regards the hearing on 7 April 2010, the primary judge described that occasion as follows: 

11 On that day Mr Madden appeared for her. He is from the Legal Aid office. He told the court he was instructed to enter a plea of guilty. The transcript shows that he then handed up some documents concerning medical problems which Mrs Collier had. [Although I note that in her address to me last week Mrs Collier told me that he had no such documents to hand up, that is what the transcript shows.] Mrs Collier told me that she was there that day and that Mr Madden did appear for her but that he did not do what she had asked him to do. However, the record, that is the transcript, shows there was a discussion about when the pleas had been entered and then there were addresses which were not transcribed and then the Magistrate found her guilty of all matters and imposed penalties for all matters. 

49Again, in my opinion it is implicit in that account that the substance of the charge was not stated by the court, at least unless the calling of the matter could be considered as in the circumstances amounting to such a statement. I note that the part of the transcript that was before the primary judge, and is before the Court, suggests that Mr Madden's statement about entering a plea was in response to the calling of the matter, and that nothing was said as to what the charges were; although, unless this was a finding of the primary judge, it may be that any error based on this would not be on the face of the record . Alternatively, it might be said that the failure of the primary judge to address the question as to the stating of the charges would be an error of law on the face of the record. In any event, having regard to my view that this is implied by the judgment itself, it is not necessary to pursue this. 

50In my opinion, it can confidently be inferred by this Court, as it could have been by the primary judge and by Magistrate Stevenson, that Mr Madden had been provided with copies of the Court Attendance Notices and the police facts, so that he was well aware of the terms of the charges. In my opinion, in those circumstances, his statement to the court that he was instructed to enter a plea of guilty would unequivocally convey to the court that Mrs Collier did plead guilty to those charges, in a way that was valid and sufficient, at least unless s 192 prevented this. In my opinion, it is clear from the definition of ""accused person"" in the CP Act , as well as from Dunn and Paauwe , that a plea can be entered by a legal practitioner. If it were the case that Mr Madden acted contrary to his instructions from Mrs Collier or misunderstood those instructions, this would not affect the validity of the plea, but at best support an application to withdraw it. 

51Dunn lends support to the proposition that the stating of the charge to the accused person, or at least to a legal practitioner appearing for the accused person, can be waived. Of course, that was a case in which counsel pleaded ""not guilty""; but I do not think that this would justify a different result. If the statement of the charge is a condition precedent to the validity of one plea, I think it must be a condition precedent to the validity of the other, and to the validity of consequent proceedings also. The legislation in that case was in somewhat different terms from s 192 of the CP Act ; but again I do not think it is sufficiently different to justify a different result. 

52I am not sure, however, whether a procedure required by a statute can simply be ""waived"". I think the more appropriate enquiry is whether or not s 192(2) of the CP Act is prescribing something that must occur before the power (and perhaps obligation) to convict can be exercised, and/or whether or not it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [41], [91]-[93]. 

53It seems clear that the purpose of s 192(2) is to ensure that, to the knowledge of the court, an accused person adequately understands what it is to which he/she is to plead guilty or not guilty, and understands that his/her response will count as such a plea. 

54But for the definition of ""accused person"" in s 3, one would read s 192(2) as requiring that the stating of the offence charged be to the accused person himself/herself; and one might then quite readily consider that this requirement was appropriately selected by the legislature as something that had to happen, in order to ensure, to the knowledge of the court, that the accused person does understand these things. One might then find that the purpose of the provision was to invalidate purported pleas of guilty entered into in the absence of such statements. This appears to have been the position in the United Kingdom under statutory provisions there, which do require the stating of the charge to the accused person himself/herself: R v Wakefield Justices, ex parte Butterworth [1970] 1 All ER 1181. 

55However, in my opinion the definition of ""accused person"" in s 3 makes an important difference. In the light of that definition, the statement in s 192(2) can be made to a legal practitioner, and the legal practitioner may enter the plea. It is clear that in those circumstances what I have identified as the purpose of s 192(2) could be achieved readily and sometimes much more efficiently in other ways; for example, by the court directing the attention of the legal practitioner to an identified document in which the charge or charges are set out. In a busy Local Court list it may be highly inconvenient that multiple charges be individually stated in court; and the identification of charges could more effectively, as well as more conveniently, be done by drawing attention to an identified document. I think this suggests that, consistently with the purpose of s 192(2), it was not the purpose of the legislation to invalidate pleas or convictions if that section was not complied with. 

56One indication in the CP Act suggesting that the formality of stating the charges in court may not be a requirement for the validity of a plea is s 182: 

182 Written pleas 

(1) An accused person served with a court attendance notice may lodge with the registrar a notice in writing that the accused person will plead guilty or not guilty to the offence or offences the subject of the court attendance notice concerned. 

(2) The notice is to be in the form prescribed by the rules and, in the case of a guilty plea, may be accompanied by additional written material containing matters in mitigation of the offence. 

(3) An accused person who lodges a notice under this section with the registrar not later than 7 days before the date on which the person is required to first attend before the Local Court: 

(a) is not required to attend the Court on that date, and 

(b) is taken to have attended the Court on that date. 

(4) This section does not apply to an accused person who has been granted or refused bail or in relation to whom bail has been dispensed with. 

57This means that, in cases where an accused has not been arrested, there may be a written plea of guilty based on no more than the Court Attendance Notice; in which case, the accused would have no more than the Court Attendance Notice, which an accused to whom s 192(2) applies would also have. 

58In my opinion, apart from any effect of s 192, for an effective plea of guilty it must be appropriately conveyed to the court that the accused person (personally or by a legal practitioner) understands what is charged against him/her and unequivocally pleads guilty to that charge: that is, unequivocally acknowledges guilt in such a way as to authorise the court to convict him/her of the particular charge and sentence him/her accordingly. This means that, even if non-compliance with s 192 does not of itself invalidate a guilty plea, such non-compliance may result in invalidity, just because in the circumstances of non-compliance there has not been the necessary unequivocal acknowledgment. 

59Having regard to all the considerations set out above, and to the authority of Dunn , which this Court should respect, in my opinion the better view is that the stating by the court of the substance of the offence is not of itself a condition precedent to the validity of a plea of guilty, and it was not the purpose of ss 192 and 193 that the power to convict not arise unless there has been such a stating. However, generally in the case of an unrepresented accused, the considerations set out in the previous paragraph would require that, for validity of a plea, s 192(2) be explicitly followed (and, in the case of multiple charges, that separate pleas be taken to each charge). In the case of a represented accused, the legal representative should as a matter of practice at least have attention drawn to the Court Attendance Notice and the offence stated in the Court Attendance Notice: I am inclined to the view that, at least in the case of a represented accused, this would be a substantial if not exact compliance with s 192(2). 

60Accordingly, in my opinion the primary judge did not make an error of law in determining that Mrs Collier had pleaded guilty, because non-compliance with s 192 does not of itself invalidate a guilty plea, and Mr Madden's statement that he was instructed to plead guilty, when Mrs Collier's matter had been identified, was a sufficient unequivocal acknowledgment of guilt, referable to charges well understood by Mr Madden and Mrs Collier. The later reference in the transcript of 7 April to an earlier plea was plainly made with a view to giving Mrs Collier the benefit of greater leniency because of an early plea; and it in no way affected the validity of the plea entered by Mr Madden. 

61In my opinion no error of law is shown in the primary judge's refusal of leave to withdraw the guilty plea. His reference to concerns about the integrity of the guilty plea as originally entered referred in my opinion to Mr Collier's email and to suggestions that there had been a plea of guilty at the Downing Centre. In relation to the plea as entered on 7 April 2010, the primary judge expressed no such concern. It was well open to the primary judge to find that the transcripts were relevantly accurate, and to find that Mrs Collier's conduct demonstrated an intention to plead guilty. Having regard to Mrs Collier's various statements going to the merits, which suggested no viable defence, it was well open to him not to be satisfied that there would be any miscarriage of justice if he did not allow her to withdraw the pleas. 

62In my opinion Mrs Collier's complaints about procedural fairness have no substance whatsoever. The matters referred to by her do not begin to justify any inference of apprehended or actual bias in either Magistrate Stevenson or the primary judge, or to suggest that she was not given a fair opportunity by the primary judge to present her case. 

63The circumstances of the matter being transferred to Mudgee, disclosed by the transcript of 4 February 2010, do not begin to suggest any oppressiveness against Mrs Collier; the meeting in the magistrate's chambers cannot support any inference as to actual or apprehended bias; and the comment by Magistrate Stevenson after the submissions of Mr Madden on 7 April 2010 is no more than an innocuous comment based on her reading of the police facts. 

64The material does not support a conclusion that Mrs Collier was not given by the primary judge a fair opportunity to present her case; and the primary judge's offer, at the end of his decision, to consider a sentence appeal shows commendable concern for the interests of Mrs Collier and does not begin to suggest a preconceived mindset. 

Discretion 

65Having regard to what I have said above, no basis for the grant of certiorari has been shown, and the question of discretion in the granting of certiorari does not arise. 

66However, I am of the view that, if I were wrong in holding that a failure to explicitly state the substance of the offence charged to an accused person is not fatal to the validity of a guilty plea, it would not be appropriate to deny a remedy in the exercise of discretion. Although I accept that Mrs Collier at all times until and including 7 April 2010 manifested an intention to plead guilty, and has not by any statement or evidence suggested any viable defence, such a fundamental departure from a requirement of the legislation, so construed, would I think require a remedy: cf R v Wakefield Justices . 

Orders 

67For those reasons, in my opinion, the summons should be dismissed with costs. 

68I note that the effect of this decision is that Mrs Collier will be liable to be sentenced pursuant to s 97 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Although there has been a stay in force for some of the time since entry into the bond was required, there has been a failure to enter into it. However, this has occurred in circumstances where there has been a challenge to the conviction in respect of which, as this judgment shows, there was one point that was reasonably arguable. In those circumstances it seems to me that it would not be a reasonable exercise of sentencing discretion now to impose any heavier sentence on Mrs Collier than the fines and the bond that was originally required. 

69CAMPBELL JA: I agree with Hodgson JA. 

70LATHAM J: I agree with Hodgson JA.

2709440,PRITCHARD v TRIUS CONSTRUCTIONS PTY LIMITED & Ors [2011] NSWSC 749,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: 
Nature of proceedings 
The second defendant, Oceanic Coal Australia Pty Limited (Oceanic) owned and operated ""The Macquarie Coal Preparation Plant"" (MCPP) at Teralba in New South Wales. The plaintiff brought proceedings against Oceanic in negligence alleging that on 4 January 2007 he suffered injuries when a forklift controlled by an employee of Oceanic drove over his left leg. At the time the plaintiff was an employee of the first defendant, Trius Constructions Pty Limited (Trius). 

2The claim by the plaintiff against Oceanic was settled. The plaintiff discontinued his proceedings against Trius. 

3Oceanic brought a cross-claim against Trius. The cross-claim seeks contribution up to a full indemnity pursuant to s5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 and a contractual indemnity. The contractual indemnity is based on an implied term in the contract between them or alternatively, on an express term in the contract in the nature of an indemnity. 

4Trius accepts that it has an obligation to contribute pursuant to s5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 but denies that it has any obligation in contract. It is common ground that any contribution by Trius, pursuant to s5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 is limited by s151Z of the Workers Compensation Act 1987. 

5The matter before the Court is Oceanic's cross-claim against Trius. 

Factual background 

6Except as otherwise indicated, I find the facts to be as follows: 

7Oceanic conducted coal mines in the Newcastle area and was engaged in the mining and export of coal. It owned and operated the MCPP site at Teralba in New South Wales. 

8Trius was a company primarily involved in the fabrication, construction and installation of steel products in the mining industry. It employed between 35 and 60 people, depending on the workload. Trius had had a commercial relationship with Oceanic since December 1997. Mr Brittain was a director of Trius and had been in that position since Trius was incorporated. 

9In June 2006 George Muller, the engineering manager at Oceanic, telephoned Mr Brittain inviting him to quote for the replacement of a number of metal floor beams that had been rusted out at the Teralba plant. Mr Brittain inspected the work that was required to be done and quoted for it. He later typed up the quote and sent it to Mr Muller by email. Shortly after that Mr Muller telephoned and told him that Trius had the job. 

10Mr Brittain provided a statement and gave evidence in the proceedings. While he could not remember the precise terms of the conversations which he had with Mr Muller, he said that he was given to understand that having been advised that Trius had the job, it was expected that Trius would commence work on the fabrication of the metal floor beams, even though their installation might not take place for some time. 

11Mr Brittain could not remember exactly when Trius received a purchase order for that job from Oceanic but said that it usually took three or four days after notification for such a purchase order to arrive. He did, however, have a clear recollection that work had already commenced on the fabrication of the floor beams at the time when the purchase order arrived. 

12There was an issue in the proceedings as to exactly how contracts were entered into between Oceanic and Trius. On that issue, Steven Claridge gave evidence. The evidence was in the form of a statement, which Mr Claridge adopted in the witness box. He was not cross-examined. Mr Claridge at the time he gave the statement was a commercial manager in the employ of Oceanic and had been employed in that capacity since October 1999. 

13Mr Claridge's responsibility in Oceanic was for contracts and methods of contracting with contractors and subcontractors. In respect of large value contracts, Oceanic generated or negotiated a specific written contract. These were usually lengthy and complex documents and an example was annexed to his statement. 

14In respect of ""small contracts"" Mr Claridge's evidence was as follows:- 

""5. For all small contracts and procurements, Oceanic Coal operates a purchase order system known as PULSE. Each purchase order details the name of the contractor, the services or goods to be procured, the purchase order number and (if necessary) the due date for delivery. 

6. Each purchase order is then provided to the relevant contractor or subcontractor before work is commenced. The contractor or subcontractor then provides Oceanic Coal with a tax invoice for payment. The purchase order number is vital to the procurement and payment system of Oceanic Coal as it allows Oceanic Coal to track accounts and pay such accounts in a timely manner. It is Oceanic Coal's general practice not to pay invoices without a purchase order. 

8. Since its inception in or about 2001, all purchase orders generated by Oceanic Coal using this system have contained a reference to terms and conditions in the bottom left hand corner. 

9. The records maintained for the purpose of Oceanic Coal's business record that on about 21 June 2006 a purchase order was generated and issued to the first defendant for the fabrication and installation of L3CD67 metal beams at the Macquarie Coal Preparation Plant at Oceanic Coal. The purchase order number was PP319522. Attached and marked ""B"" is a true copy of that purchase order. 

10. The records maintained for the purpose of Oceanic Coal's business record that this purchase order was generated in relation to certain shutdown maintenance operations being conducted by the first defendant at and around the preparation plant. 

11. For the purposes of purchase orders Oceanic Coal and Xstrata Coal Australia Pty Limited (and its other subsidiaries) had developed general purchase order standard terms and conditions. 

12. Attached and marked ""C"" is a true copy of the general purchase order standard terms and conditions in effect as at 21 June 2006. These general purchase order standard terms and conditions were also in effect as at 4 January 2007. 

13. A copy of the general purchase order standard terms and conditions is available on request to contractors ... 

16. The records maintained for the purpose of Oceanic Coal's business record that Trius had been receiving purchase orders from at least 23 June 2003. 

17. Attached and marked ""D"" are true copies of all purchase orders sent to the first defendant since 23 June 2003 to 21 June 2006. 

... 

20. The terms and conditions in effect as at 21 June 2006 and 4 January 2007 were first introduced in 2003 and remained unchanged until 24 November 2008 when new terms and conditions were drafted."" 

15It was common ground that the following was set out in the bottom left hand corner of purchase order PP319533: 

"" Terms and Conditions 

1. Payment 30 days from the end of the month following invoice. 
2. The above goods are supplied subject to the terms and conditions of Oceanic Coal Australia."" 

This notation was in small print and did not occupy a prominent position on the purchase order. This can be seen from a copy of purchase order PP319533, which is annexed to this judgment. The purchase order which was received by Trius was signed by Mr Mitchell on behalf of Oceanic. 

16Annexure ""C"" to the statement of Mr Claridge was headed: 

""Oceanic Coal Australia Limited 
General Purchase Order Terms and Conditions for 

West Wallsend Colliery Killingworth NSW 
Regional Office Killingworth NSW 
Westside Mine Killingworth NSW

Prep Plant Teralba NSW

17The General Purchase Order Terms and Conditions comprised just over four pages of small type with the following headings: 

""1. Supply of goods and/or services 
2. Conditions as to quality and description of goods and/or services 
3. Delivery 
4. Inspection and acceptance 
5. Performance of the services 
6. Title and risk 
7. Price 
8. Invoicing and payment 
9. Termination

14. Confidentiality 
15. Taxes 
16. Assignment and subcontracting 
17. These terms are exclusive 
18. Other matters 
19. Governing law"" 

Thereafter words and phrases, used in the document, were defined. Each of the headings had a number of subparagraphs set out beneath it. 

18The following parts of that document were relied upon by Oceanic in the proceedings as express terms incorporated into the agreement between it and Trius. 

""2.5 The services must be performed by appropriately qualified and trained personnel and must be rendered with due care and skill. 
... 

5.1 You must, in performing the services:

(h) any claim that the goods, the services or the results of the services, anything you do in supplying us with the goods and/or the services, or our use of the goods or the results of the services infringes or allegedly infringes the intellectual property rights of any person."" 


19Mr Brittain's description of how contractual arrangements were actually entered into between Trius and Oceanic differed somewhat from the description given by Mr Claridge. 

""Q. ... Now, as I understand it the evidence will be that before this quote was given, before you gave this quote in June 2006 in the previous year you did about 150 jobs. I'm sorry, since 2004 up until the quote in June 2006 you did approximately 150 jobs for Oceanic, does that sound about right? 
A. That could be the count. Some jobs are as little as $200, some are as big as 500,000. We did a range of jobs, ranging from two to $300 to $500,000 and there could have been on any given day, like on a shut down day we might have done 15 jobs on that day all worth about, you know, about $500, but that is classed as 15 different jobs. So that is how you get 150 jobs. 

Q. And in respect of the system or the procedure adopted for the documentary procedure in each case would you give a written quote or would you give a quote - 
A. A lot of the times on smaller jobs we would probably do the work before we give him a quote and then we would give him the price of the job then he would give us a purchase order afterwards so we could claim it. That doesn't happen any more. They have stopped all that. You need a purchase order before you do any work there now."" (T.20.4) 

""Q. When you received this purchase order, it was then you went ahead and fabricated the beams; is that correct? 
A. We actually started fabricating before we had the purchase order. 

... 

Q. ... How did you know you commenced the fabrication of these beams before you got the purchase order? 
A. Because we started the day he rang us. He rang me in the morning and said, ""You've got the job"", and we started it because it was a job that had to be done and we wanted to do it in the next shutdown period."" (T.30.1) 

... 

""A. Well, what had happened, we were already doing beams around this same area. He sent me a drawing to say we've just decided we need to do these beams as well because they're rusted as well, how much are they going to be, and I'll get them started on it. So I did a quote, sent it back to him. Later on that afternoon he said, ""Go ahead with it."" 

... 

""Q. You can't remember whether you received the purchase order before or after you commenced fabrication of the beams? 
A. No, I know for a fact I would have started fabricating before because I if started fabricating the day after the quote, and purchase orders take at least three to four days to come. "" (T.31.14) 

20In relation to the terms and conditions of the contract, Mr Brittain's evidence is to be found in his statement and in his evidence in cross-examination. 

""14. When I received Oceanic's purchase order for the work in June 2006 the only terms and conditions on the purchase order were listed in the bottom left hand corner. I was not aware when Trius agreed to undertake the work that there were any other terms and conditions apart from those printed on the purchase order. Further, no-one at Oceanic ever mentioned to me or, as far as I am aware, to anyone else at Trius the existence of terms and conditions in addition to those printed on the purchase order when Trius agreed to undertake the work. Similarly no-one at Oceanic ever took any steps to bring any terms and conditions in addition to those printed on the purchase order to the attention of me or, as far as I am aware, of anyone else at Trius when Trius agreed to undertake the work. 

... 

16. If I had known of the existence of the terms and conditions that Oceanic now allege form part of the purchase order when Trius agreed to undertake the work at the MCPP, I would have taken those terms and conditions to our usual solicitors in order to review and advise on. This was Trius's usual practice when undertaking work pursuant to a written contract and it was done with a view to ensuring that all necessary insurance was put in place before undertaking the work."" 

""Q. And in that case when they gave you, they gave you a document which included the scope of work that had to be done, is that right? 
A. Yes, correct. 

Q. Did that have any terms and conditions contained in it? 
A. Off the top of my head I can't remember, that was a few years ago. But if there were any terms and conditions in the written contract we would have given that to our solicitors to advise us on anything that we needed to seek changing or any further insurances we needed."" (T.19.34) 

... 


""Q. And subsequent to that you say a purchase order was faxed to you. Is that correct? 
A. After the quote, yeah. 

Q. Do you remember seeing the purchase order? 
A. Probably would have went straight into the job file. 

Q. So the answer to my question is no, you don't remember seeing a purchase order? 
A. That's correct. 

Q. When you look at the purchase order now, it's similar to hundreds of purchase orders you've previously received, isn't it? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And when you have received previous purchase orders have you ever read what's on the purchase order, apart from just checking the items and the price? 
A. No, not really, not that I can remember. 

Q. So all you really do when you receive a purchase order is to check the items and the price and file it away? 
A. Yeah. Well, I usually start the job and then we get the purchase order. When the purchase order arrives the secretary usually puts it in the job file."" (T.31.20) 

""Q. Do you remember you were asked about whether in relation to any prior tenders with Oceanic Coal you had ever been given terms and conditions? Do you remember that question being asked of you? 
A. I do, yes. 

Q. And do you remember saying to his Honour that you don't remember, but if you had received terms and conditions in that way you would have given them to your solicitor? 
A. Correct. 

Q. Do you have any recollection of ever giving terms and conditions to your solicitor? 
A. I don't have any recollections before the incident, no, not from Oceanic. I may have, I don't know. I just cannot remember."" (T.33.23) 

21I found Mr Brittain to be a truthful and reliable witness who was doing his best to assist the Court. I found his evidence more helpful as to how small contracts were negotiated with Oceanic than the rather theoretical process described by Mr Claridge. I find that the small contracts between Trius and Oceanic were negotiated in the way described by Mr Brittain with the purchase order often arriving after work had been commenced and on occasions after the job had been completed. 

22Mr Brittain explained that some delay occurred before the metal beams could be placed into position. 

""A. Because we were trying to do it a lot earlier than we did the job on site. He wanted us to get under way and get the fabrication started so we could get it in on the next plant shutdown, which didn't happen because they had to shut down a couple of days beforehand because they ran out of coal, so it got put off for a couple of months. "" (T.30.11) 

In fact the installation of the beams did not commence until the day of the accident on 4 January 2007 which was an occasion when the MCPP was being shut down. 

23On the day of the accident there were two Trius employees at the MCPP, Mr Barnes and the plaintiff. Mr Barnes had been employed by Trius as a supervisor for about 12 months. He was a qualified boilermaker, had a licence to operate a forklift and had a certificate to work as a dogman. By 4 January 2007 he had been working at the MCPP continuously for about six months. The plaintiff was also a qualified boilermaker and had been employed by Trius since August 1999. He had worked at the MCPP on many previous occasions. This, however, was his first day back at the MCPP after an absence. Both men had completed the Oceanic safety induction course. 

24Because no specific work had been allocated to them, Mr Barnes decided that it would be opportune to move the fabricated metal floor beams to where they could be placed in position. As Mr Barnes put it: 

""A. Oh, it was probably just a job that we could do if we had nothing else to do."" (T.44.16) 

25There was some dispute as to the dimensions of the beams. Mr Barnes described them as being 5 metres in length and weighing 200 kgs. The plaintiff said they were between 3.5 and 4 metres in length and weighed about 50 kgs. 

26The beams had been stored at the MCPP for some time. It was necessary for them to be transported to a lifting bay so that an overhead crane could then take them to where they were to be installed. The lifting bay was inside the washery and it was necessary for the beams to be transported through a doorway into the washery so that they could be positioned in the lifting bay. 

27Because there was no other suitable lifting equipment available, Mr Barnes decided to use a forklift in order to transport the metal beams through the door of the washery and into the lifting bay. The forklift was owned by Oceanic and operated by an employee of Oceanic. Trius employees were not allowed to operate any of the forklifts on site. 

28Mr Barnes requested from Oceanic the use of a forklift and driver and these were provided to him. He did not explain to Oceanic the purpose for which he required the forklift. The forklift which he obtained was an industrial forklift, capable of lifting about 5 tonnes. It had six wheels, two on each side at the front, and one on each side at the back. The driver sat to the left hand side of the forklift in an enclosed cabin. A photograph (page 62 of exhibit 3) was tendered and it is clear that the forklift was a large piece of plant and should not be confused with the small forklifts one conventionally sees in warehouses. 

29In his statement, Mr Barnes described the system which he devised for the movement of the beams as follows: 

""9. ... Neil Buckley was driving the forklift for me and I was slinging the load. Terry was away cleaning the hut. Neil and I were carrying beams from the yard into the washery to the crane bay. The beams were about 5 metres long and would have weighed about 200 kilos. We moved 3 beams into the crane bay and I was about to sling the fourth one with a web sling across the one tyne and in the middle of the beam. The beams were slung this way because it was wider than the doorway into the washery. Once it was lifted up by the forklift and was off the ground I was able to turn it manually to face longways so it would go through the doorway and it was slung so it hung out the front of the forklift and on an angle down the right hand side of the forklift ending at about the front of the forklift. The distance from where the beams were being picked up to the entrance to the washery was about 15 metres. 

10. The beams were stacked under the gantry and after they were picked up the fork backed across the road and then turned onto the road and drove up the road very slowly. I turned the beam longways and Neil drove towards the doorway at the end of the washery. We had as I said moved three beams in this manner with no problems. I had been walking at the front of the beam and in plain sight of Neil as he was driving."" 

30In his oral evidence, Mr Barnes described the process in this way: 

""Q. So you decided it would be easier to sling it under the left-hand tine? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And you showed me with your hand that you could control it then if you slung it in the middle, is that right? 
A. That's correct. 

Q. If you slung it under the left-hand fork of the tine, which end of the beam did you control? 
A. The one furthest from the machine. 

Q. Which is the left-hand side, is that right? 
A. Yes, it would be. 

Q. Why the one furthest from the machine? 
A. Because that's what you're taught to do, stay away from the machine. 

Q. That's what you are always - 
A. Taught to do. 

Q. Who taught you to do that? 
A. Just everybody wherever you do training, blokes on the job. 

Q. Training as a dogman? 
A. Rigger, dogman, whatever, stay away from the machine. You always go from the furthest point from the machine as possible."" (T.50.41) 

31Mr Barnes used hand signals to direct Mr Buckley, who was the driver of the forklift. At all times he could see the driver and the driver could see him. When the beam reached the lifting bay, it was lowered onto dunnage to make it easier to place another sling onto it so that it could be raised in due course by the overhead crane. 

32When the plaintiff arrived at the plant, Mr Barnes directed him to clean up the Trius lunch/staffroom which was on the Oceanic site. This was his first job of the day. When that job was finished, he was directed to set out the Trius equipment so it could be inspected by a fitter employed by Oceanic. One of the Oceanic protocols was that the equipment of subcontractors had to be inspected and tagged every three months. 

33As the plaintiff was completing this task, Mr Barnes called out to him and requested that he assist in placing some dunnage under the fourth metal beam. 

34In his statement, the plaintiff described what happened thereafter as follows: 

""17. I saw that Warren was in the process of lifting one of the metal unibeams so that he could run a cloth sling under it that was suspended from a single tyne of a forklift truck. Each unibeam is about 3.5 to 4 metres long and weighs about 50 kgs. I could see that a number of the beams had already been moved into the plant. The beams were placed in a row outside the preparation plant near trestles which supported the coal conveyer belt. The beams had to be transported through the plant to a crane which was fixed in position to lift them into the plant. The crane could only pick up the beams from that location because of the location of a mezzanine level in the plant. 

18. I inserted the dunnage under the beam and Warren then wrapped the sling around the beam. I started to help Warren tie the sling up when Warren's phone rang. Warren answered the phone and walked away from the forklift truck. I was not given any instruction from Warren or anyone else as to what to do next. 

19. The forklift driver reversed the truck backwards turning to the right so that he could drive around the trestles (which were on his right hand side) and towards the door to the preparation plant. I walked through the trestles and met the forklift at the preparation plant door. 

20. The door was only about three metres wide so one end of the beam had to be swung into the middle so it would fit through. I stood at the right hand side of the forklift and pushed the rear end of the beam into the middle lightly so it would swing into the centre allowing the forklift truck driver to move through the door. The beam was carried by the forklift at approximately waist height. There was no dogging line attached to the beam and so I had to move it by hand. 

21. I was given no instruction on what to do. 

22. I walked along the side of the forklift as it drove the beam through the doors. The forklift truck driver sits on the left hand side of the truck. I couldn't see the driver from the position that I was in. The beam then swung back out a little and I had to push it in again to avoid some barrels that were on the left hand side of the plant. I only used a little push at a time. 

23. Something grabbed the back of my left foot. I was pulled under the forklift. I ended up directly in front of the forklift facing back looking at the front right wheels seeing my left leg under the wheels, screaming in pain and for the forklift driver to stop the forklift as I was directly in the path of the forklift."" 

35Mr Barnes in his statement described what happened as follows: 

""11. As I came back to sling the fourth beam my mobile rang and I can't remember who slung the beam Terry or me but I'm pretty sure it was Terry. I walked away from the forklift so I could hear what was being said on my phone. I did not see what Terry did after that and I don't know which end of the beam he was at or what he was doing. When I finished talking on the phone I walked to my ""gang box"" which is located at the side of the washery outside the doorway. Mick Allibon was there and I was speaking to him about what was going to be happening the next day. He is responsible for tagging equipment brought onto site. 

12. While I was speaking to him I heard a scream ..."". 

36Under cross-examination the evidence of Mr Barnes was: 

""Q. In any event, he was there helping you and then your phone rang; is that right? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And at that stage when your phone rang you knew that he hadn't seen what you had been doing previously, had he? 
A. Don't know. 

Q. As far as you were aware you hadn't taken him around on a previous run of dropping these beams off, had you? 
A. No, but it's an ongoing task. We had done it before. 

Q. I appreciate that, but you hadn't been showing him what you had been doing? 
A. On that day I hadn't shown him, no. 

Q. When your phone rang on this fourth occasion had you actually slung the beam or not? 
A. Not sure. 

Q. You could have done, you might not have done? 
A. May have done, may not have. 

Q. At the time you were slinging the beam your phone rang? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And you went off to answer it? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did you tell Mr Pritchard to stop the job and wait for you to come back? 
A. No. 

Q. You just went off and answered your phone; is that correct? 
A. That's correct. 

Q. And as far as you're aware the job carried on whilst you were talking on the phone? 
A. Yes. "" (T.53.47) 

37The plaintiff suffered a serious injury to his left leg. As a result of that injury, it was amputated below the knee on 8 February 2007. The plaintiff has been unable to work since that date. He was aged 61 at the time of the accident. 

38The claim by the plaintiff against Oceanic was settled for $850,000 inclusive of costs. The Court was not told how much of that figure comprised costs. As between the parties it was agreed that had the plaintiff's damages been assessed pursuant to Part 5 of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 they would have amounted to $130,000. It was necessary for the parties to agree on that figure so that in due course the calculation under s151Z of that Act could be made. 

39At page 90 of exhibit 3 there is a handwritten statement from the forklift driver, Mr Buckley. It does not provide any further information as to how the accident occurred. 

40Following the accident, Oceanic commissioned a report from Forkpro, an organisation with experience and expertise in the movement and control of industrial equipment such as forklifts on work sites. The purpose of the investigation was described in the following terms: 

""Forkpro Australia was requested by RED Australia Newcastle Branch to undertake a review of Industrial Traffic Management and other Mobile Plant Equipment activities at the West Wallsend Colliery at Boundary Road, West Wallsend NSW. The review was to examine practices mainly surrounding the use of forklift lifting attachments. 

The request was as a result of an accident which occurred on 4.1.07."" 

41One recommendation made in the report was that there be pedestrian exclusion zones around large pieces of plant such as industrial forklifts. The report concluded that physical separation was the most effective way of reducing the possibility of a collision. The report also recommended that an Industrial Traffic Management plan be developed which would set out precautions to be observed by forklift drivers when operating near to pedestrians. 

42The report identified the position of the injured person as contributing to the accident. The report emphasised that the injured party should not have been in a location close to the wheel of the forklift. 

43Even before the report from Forkpro, Oceanic had implemented the following additional precautions following the accident: 


Safe zone of 3 metres to be maintained at all times when a forklift is in motion, i.e. the body of the forklift must not be moved if any employees are within 3 metres. 

The forklift operator is responsible for the enforcement of the ""safety zone"". 

When working as a spotter you must where possible remain on the driver's side of the forklift (exhibit 3, p 108). 


Submissions and consideration 
Whether Oceanic and Trius were joint tortfeasors and if so how should their liability be apportioned. 

44Each party sought to apportion most of the tortious liability against the other. Implicit in the submissions was that each party through its negligence had contributed to the plaintiff's injuries. 

45The liability of Trius is clear. It was the plaintiff's employer. It had an obligation to exercise reasonable care for the safety of the plaintiff while he was carrying out the work allocated to him. That obligation included warning him of unusual or unexpected risks and instructing him in the performance of his work where instructions might reasonably be thought to be required to secure him from danger of injury ( O'Connor v Commissioner of Government Transport (1965) 100 CLR 225 at 229-230). That duty was non delegable and could not be passed on to Oceanic. 

46The fact that the plaintiff was performing work at premises controlled by Oceanic did not relieve Trius of its obligations to him. In Burke v Hassett & Ors (1999) 1VR 189 at [41] - [42], a passage approved by the NSW Court of Appeal in Atkinson v Gameco (NSW) Pty Limited [2005] NSWCA 338 at [19] the Court said: 

""41 ... True it is that, where an employer sends his employee to work at or in premises occupied or controlled by another ... occupation and control by another person may be a relevant fact in considering whether the employer has been in breach of his own independent duty to the employee. But the fact that the employee's work is required to be done on premises of another does not absolve the employer of his duty. Its impact upon whether he has breached his duty will depend upon all the circumstances. As Lord Denning said in Smith v Austin Lifts Limited (1959) 1WLR 100: 

""Notwithstanding what was said in Taylor v Simms and Simms (1942) 167 LT 414, it has been held, I think rightly, that employers who send their workmen to work on the premises of others cannot renounce all responsibility for their safety. The employer still has an overriding duty to take reasonable care not to expose their men to unnecessary risks. They must, for instance, take reasonable care to devise a safe system of work. ... and, if they know or ought to know of a danger on the premises to which they send their men, they ought to take reasonable care to safeguard them from it. What is reasonable care depends of course on the circumstances ..."""" 


(See also Wilson v Tyneside Window Cleaning Co (1958) 2 QC 110 at 121-2 per Pearce LJ; Sinclair v William Arnott Pty Limited (No 2) (1953) 64 SR (NSW) 88 at 91-2 per Walsh J.) 

""42 One can conceive of a multitude of circumstances where workmen are sent to work upon premises controlled by others in which the impact upon the discharge of the employer's duty will vary. It will depend no doubt upon such matters as the employer's opportunity to inspect the premises, the length of time the employer has put his employees to work on the premises, the awareness of the employer of the danger, his capacity to shield his employees from the danger and various other factors."" 

47Similarly, in Czatyrko v Edith Cowan University [2005] HCA 14; (2005) 79 ALJR 839 at [12] the Court said: 

""12 ... An employer owes a non-delegable duty of care to its employees to take reasonable care to avoid exposing them to unnecessary risks of injury. If there is a real risk of an injury to an employee in the performance of a task in a workplace, the employer must take reasonable care to avoid the risk by devising a method of operation for the performance of the task that eliminates the risk, or by the provision of adequate safeguards. The employer must take into account the possibility of thoughtlessness, or inadvertence, or carelessness, particularly in a case of repetitive work. 
... 

14 ... The case for the appellant was not that he should have been warned by his employer that if he fell off the truck he might suffer injury, or that if he stepped off the back of the truck into space he would fall. It was not a question of warning the appellant of a risk. It was a question of creating a risk by failing to adopt a safe system of work. 

15 There should have been in place a system of work designed to avoid the risk that a person required to step backwards and forwards on and from a moveable platform might do so without first looking behind him. The system of work necessarily had also to take into account that the task was a repetitive one to be performed in a diminishing space. Proper account of these matters was not taken by the respondent. It did no more than require that the appellant and Mr Fendick load the truck."" 

48Those same principles apply in relation to the conduct of Trius through its supervisor Mr Barnes. Mr Barnes set up the system of work. While the system of work may have been safe for Mr Barnes, who had worked as a dogman and who had implemented the system on three previous occasions when metal beams were moved into position, it was not necessarily so for the plaintiff. He had not worked as a dogman and his evidence made it clear that he had not worked with a forklift being used as a crane on a previous occasion. He had not observed Mr Barnes when the three metal beams had previously been moved. 

49At the very least, Mr Barnes should have explained the system of work which he had devised and should have pointed out the need to position himself as far away from the forklift as he could, i.e. at the far end of the beam being transported. 

50The vicarious liability of Trius for the conduct of Mr Barnes goes further. Rather than arranging for an orderly handover of his function in walking in front of the forklift and guiding the beam, Mr Barnes simply walked away to answer his phone. There was no attempt to co-ordinate the activities of the plaintiff with those of the forklift driver. What the plaintiff was obliged to do was unexpectedly, without any instruction, without having seen the way in which Mr Barnes had previously carried out the task, do his best to manoeuvre the beam through the door. The liability of Trius for the conduct of Mr Barnes is clear. The culpability of Mr Barnes in the circumstances of this case was high and his negligence made a significant contribution to the occurrence of the accident. 

51This is not to say that the liability of Oceanic for this accident was insignificant. It was not. Oceanic's liability was twofold. It was vicariously liable for the actions of Mr Buckley, the driver of the forklift, who was its employee. It also had a liability based on its own responsibility to set up a system of work whereby industrial forklifts of this kind could operate safely with other workmen who were pedestrians. In that regard, it is trite law that Oceanic as the occupier of the site owed a duty to persons coming onto it to use reasonable care to avoid physical injury to them ( Leighton Contractors Pty Limited v Fox [2009] HCA 35; (2009) 240 CLR 1 at [48]). 

52Mr Buckley was operating a large piece of equipment in circumstances where his view to his right was obscured because his cabin was located on the left side of the vehicle. From the fact that the plaintiff was unable to see Mr Buckley when he was walking next to the forklift on its right side at the rear of the beam, I can readily infer that Mr Buckley could not see the plaintiff. It is clear that Mr Buckley should not have continued to operate the forklift in circumstances where he could not see the plaintiff, yet knew that the plaintiff must be positioned close to the forklift because the plaintiff had moved the beam in such a way as to enable it to pass through the door. By way of contrast, when Mr Barnes was acting as dogman, he had been positioned to the left front of the forklift at the far end of the beam in the clear sight of Mr Buckley. 

53What is also clear from the actions of Mr Buckley and from the post-accident steps taken by Oceanic, was that before the accident Oceanic did not have in place any protocol or procedures for the safe operation of these large forklifts when working with persons who were on foot. This is not an assessment made in hindsight. Placing oneself in the position of Oceanic, and carrying out a risk assessment, as was the usual practice before undertaking a work task at the MCPP, it should have been clear to Oceanic that some protocols needed to be in place when large forklifts worked with persons who were on foot and that in such circumstances it needed to be made clear who was in charge, i.e. the operator of the forklift or a workman on foot. 

54Both these failures contributed to the occurrence of the accident. Both failures involved a significant level of culpability. 

55In apportioning liability between Oceanic and Trius, I have to make an assessment in accordance with the guidance of the High Court in Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel (1985) 59 ALJR 492 at [494] where their Honours said: 

""The making of an apportionment is between a plaintiff and a defendant of their respective shares in the responsibility for the damage involves a comparison both of culpability, ie the degree of departure from the standard of care of the reasonable man ( Pennington v Norris (1956) 96 CLR 10 at 16) and of the relative importance of the acts of the parties in causing the damage: Stapley v Gypsum Mines Limited (1953) AC 633 at 682; Smith v McIntyre (1958) Tas SR 36 at 42-49 and Broadhurst v Millman (1976) VR 208 at 219 and cases there cited. It is the whole conduct of each negligent party in relation to the circumstances of the accident which must be subjected to comparative examination."" 

56Applying those principles, it seems to me that the level of culpability and causal contribution on the part of Trius as the plaintiff's employer was greater than that of Oceanic as the occupier and controller of the forklift. I would apportion liability as to 60 percent against Trius and as to 40 percent against Oceanic. 

THE CONTRACT BETWEEN TRIUS and OCEANIC 
Implied terms 

57Oceanic sought to rely upon 14 implied terms which were set out in its Amended Cross-Claim. It pleaded that these terms were to be implied in the contract with Trius to give it reasonable or effective operation. 

58In submissions, however, Oceanic reduced the implied terms upon which it sought to rely to the following: 

(i) That Trius would adopt a safe system of work for its own employees. 

(ii) That Trius would only undertake the contracted task with qualified personnel. 

(iii) That Trius would discharge its contractual obligations with reasonable care and skill when on the property of Oceanic. 

59Oceanic put the proposition in its written submissions as follows: 

""55 In the case of the contractor on site who implements a system of work incorporating the actions of the occupier's employees, the contractor has an implied contractual obligation to ensure that a safe system of work is adopted. This includes the adequate instruction of its employees or the provision of employees with adequate experience and/or training or direction so as to ensure that those employees are competent to complete the required tasks in a safe manner. 

56 It is within the contemplation of the parties in such a combined effort that the failure to implement such a safe system may expose all workers to injury particularly from the casual act of negligence of a worker for whose negligence the employer of the worker will be liable."" 

60Oceanic submitted that these propositions flowed naturally from the reasoning in Florida Hotels Pty Limited v Mayo (1965) 113 CLR 588 at 598 and Climax Management v Scansash [2002] NSWCA 167. 

61On the facts of this case it is correct to characterise Trius as the service provider and Oceanic as the recipient of those services. In those circumstances, I would accept that Trius had an implied obligation in contract to carry out its contractual obligations with reasonable care and skill. Included in the fulfilment of that implied term would be the adoption of a safe system of work. If in the discharge of its contractual obligations, by using an unsafe system of work, damage were caused to property of Oceanic or injury to an employee of Oceanic, I would accept that the implied term had been breached. 

62Where I have difficulty is in extending the obligations in the implied term to the provision of a safe system of work by Trius for its own employees. I have difficulty in finding as a matter of fact that the parties' intentions as manifested by the contract, taken in its surrounding circumstances, support the implication of such a term. In that regard, the tests set out in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Limited v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 266 at 282-3 are apposite. 

""... for a term to be implied, the following conditions (which may overlap) must be satisfied: (1) it must be reasonable and equitable; (2) it must be necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective without it; (3) it must be so obvious that ""it goes without saying""; (4) it must be capable of clear expression; (5) it must not contradict any express term of the contract."" 

63A similar test is that proposed by Deane J in Hawkins v Clayton (1988) HCA 15; (1988) 164 CLR 539 at 573 which was endorsed by the majority in Byrne v Australian Airlines Limited (1995) HCA 24; (1995) 185 CLR 410 at 422: 

""In a case where it is apparent that the parties have not attempted to spell out the full terms of their contract, a court should imply a term by reference to the imputed intention of the parties if, but only if, it can be seen the implication of the particular term is necessary for the reasonable or effective operation of a contract of that nature in the circumstances of the case. That general statement of principle is subject to the qualification that a term may be implied in a contract by established mercantile usage or professional practice or by a past course of dealing between the parties."" 

64Applying those tests to this case, I do not think it can be said that the implication of such a term was required for the ""reasonable or effective operation"" of the contract. The substance of the agreement was the fabrication of the steel beams and their installation at Oceanic's premises. It could be carried out perfectly well in the absence of any term requiring Trius to take care for the safety of its own workmen. Conceptually, the fact that Trius had a non-delegable duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of the plaintiff imposed by operation of law is a different matter to the implication of a contractual term to that effect in a commercial agreement between it and Oceanic for the performance of work by it on Oceanic's premises. 

65Put another way, the term sought to be implied by Oceanic fails the test of obviousness. If one asked whether, had Trius directed its mind to the question, it would have consented to the inclusion of such a term, the response would have been in the negative. Trius as the employer of the plaintiff may in that capacity have expected to take reasonable care for his safety while he was on Oceanic's premises, but it does not follow that it would have expected to be contractually bound to Oceanic to take that care. I have concluded that such a term, i.e. that Trius would discharge its contractual obligations with reasonable care and skill, which included the obligation to adopt a safe system of work for its own employees, should not be implied into the agreement between it and Oceanic. 

66If I am wrong in that conclusion, it is clear from the analysis of Sheller JA (with whom Priestley and Powell JJA agreed) in Oxley County Council v MacDonald & Ors; Brambles Holdings Limited v MacDonald & Ors [1999] NSWCA 126 that any damages flowing from the breach of such an implied term are too remote to be recovered by Oceanic. 

67In that case, Oxley County Council (Oxley) and Brambles Holdings Limited (Brambles) were found to be jointly liable in tort to an employee of Oxley who was injured when he was assisting to unload a truck. Oxley had contracted with Brambles for Brambles to transport equipment to the place where the employee assisted in its unloading. The Court found that the contract for carriage between Oxley and Brambles contained an implied term that Brambles would load, secure and transport the goods with reasonable care and skill so that the goods could be unloaded in a safe and proper manner without presenting a risk of injury to the employees who were to assist in the unloading. 

68On Bramble's contractual obligations to Oxley and with respect to any contractual obligation owed by Oxley to Brambles, the Court said: 

""67 ... Brambles' obligation to Oxley flowed from a promise voluntarily made for good consideration. In the absence of some contractual stipulation to the contrary, there is no reason of justice or sound legal policy which should prevent Oxley recovering for all the damage that is causally connected to Brambles' breach of contract even though Oxley's conduct contributed to the damage which it suffered. By its own voluntary act, Brambles accepted an obligation to load and secure the goods with reasonable care and skill so that they could be unloaded in a safe and proper manner at the Oxley depot, without presenting a risk of injury to Oxley's employees there to assist in the unloading, and to pay damages for any loss or damage flowing from a breach of that obligation. ( Astley v Austrust 73 ALJR at 423 para 86; (1999) 197 CLR 1 at [86]). 


... 

69 Brambles' claim in contract is not so clear. It was obliged to carry the goods to the Oxley depot and there deliver them on its truck. Oxley had the obligation of unloading. No doubt it was contractually obliged to do so so as not to damage Brambles' property or injure Brambles' employee or contractor. But the damages for breach of the contract which Brambles now claims to recover, being the amount of its liability to the plaintiff, were, in my opinion, too remote. I say this for the following reasons. The degree of probability that Oxley's breach of the contract would cause Brambles to suffer loss as the result of a claim against it by an employee of Oxley for injuries suffered was such as to make the loss wholly unpredictable; see generally Greig & Davis, The Law of Contract, at 1376. In my opinion, damages for the loss which Oxley suffered as a result of the injury to its employee and its liability as employer to that employee could fairly and reasonably be considered to arise according to the usual course of things from Brambles' breach of its contractual obligation to load and secure the goods with reasonable care and skill. However, I do not think that the possibility of Brambles' liability to Oxley's employee flowing from the consequence of Oxley's failure to unload the goods with reasonable care and skill could fairly and reasonably be considered to arise according to the usual course of things; compare Florida Hotels v Mayo at 598. Nor do I think such damages could reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as not unlikely to occur; compare Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Ex 341 at 355; 156 ER 145 at 151; Koufos v C Czarnikow Limited [1969] 1 AC 350 at 388; Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corporation (1987) 9 NSWLR 310 at 363 and following per McHugh JA."" 

69It follows from that analysis that even if such a term were to be implied in the contract between Oceanic and Trius, Oceanic's entitlement to damages on the basis of the Oxley County Council case would be regarded as too remote. 

70In relation to the term sought to be implied that Trius would only undertake the task with qualified personnel, the facts do not support a breach of any such term. Mr Barnes and the plaintiff were qualified to carry out the contracted task. The injury occurred not because of lack of qualification but because of a failure to properly supervise and the implementation of an unsafe system of work. 

Incorporation of terms by reference and the course of dealing 

71Oceanic submits that either by reference to the notation on the purchase order (see [15] hereof), and/or by reference to the course of dealing between it and Trius since 2001, the terms and conditions in annexure C to the statement of Mr Claridge became express terms in the contract for the fabrication and supply of the metal beams. Oceanic carries the burden of establishing that fact. 

72In order to consider that submission, it is necessary to revisit the evidence relating to the formation of the contract. 

73The evidence of Mr Brittain that Trius had been performing work for Oceanic since 1997 was unchallenged. I have already found that Mr Brittain's evidence as to how contracts were entered into between Trius and Oceanic is to be preferred to that of Mr Claridge, i.e. that in many cases work was commenced before the receipt of a purchase order and in some cases, work was completed before such a document arrived. Mr Claridge had been responsible for the letting of contracts by Oceanic since October 1999. His evidence was that from 2001 in relation to small contracts and procurements the PULSE system was used. As part of the PULSE system the notation referring to ""terms and conditions of Oceanic"" was set out in the bottom left hand corner of purchase orders. 

74Mr Claridge's evidence is important for the matters which it does not cover. There is no evidence about how small contracts and procurements were entered into before 2001. I find it inconceivable that a company such as Oceanic would not have used documents in the nature of a purchase order between 1997 and 2001, although one can infer from the implementation of the PULSE system that there may not have been standardisation in relation to such purchase orders. I have concluded that, although the PULSE system was not in operation before 2001, documents in the nature of a purchase order were used before 2001 in respect of small contracts and procurements by Oceanic. 

75If that is so, there is nothing in the evidence of Mr Claridge about what happened when the PULSE system was introduced in relation to purchase orders. Specifically, there is no evidence that service providers such as Trius were advised that there was to be a change in the contract process and that thereafter all contracts were to include the ""terms and conditions of Oceanic"". I infer that as part of the implementation of the PULSE system, the notation concerning terms and conditions was placed on purchase orders but other than that, no notification was given to service providers and specifically, no notification was given to Trius. That accords with Mr Brittain's lack of recollection of any such notification or as to the existence of such terms and conditions governing agreements between Trius and Oceanic and his lack of recollection of ever having referred such terms and conditions to solicitors for comments. 

76In the absence of any evidence from Oceanic as to notification, other than the notation being placed on purchase orders from some date in 2001, and by reference to the evidence of Mr Brittain, I find that there was no other notification to Trius of any change in the terms of small contracts entered into between it and Oceanic. Significantly, there was no evidence from Oceanic that the General Purchase Order Terms and Conditions were ever provided to Trius at any stage in their commercial relationship before the accident in January 2007. 

77I am fortified in reaching that conclusion by the fact that there was a change in the ""General Purchase Order Terms and Conditions"" of Oceanic between 2001 and 2003. This is clear by reference to paragraphs 8 and 20 in the statement of Mr Claridge. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary from Mr Claridge, who was in the best position to give such evidence, and by reference to the evidence of Mr Brittain, I infer that when this change to the ""General Purchase Order Terms and Conditions"" of Oceanic was made, no notification was given to service providers and specifically, no notification was given to Trius. 

78I appreciate that the evidence on these issues is sparse. Oceanic was in the best position to give further evidence on these matters but it chose not to do so. I infer that such further evidence would not have assisted its position. 

79Doing the best I can, despite the paucity of evidence, I find that as between Trius and Oceanic the situation in respect of contracts was as follows. Between 1997 and 2001 Trius was performing steel fabrication work and installation work for Oceanic. Those contracts were partly oral and partly in writing by the use of some form of purchase order. In 2001 the PULSE system was implemented by Oceanic and as part of that system, a notation was made in the bottom left hand corner of purchase orders issued to Trius ""the above goods are supplied subject to the terms and conditions of Oceanic Coal Australia"". No notification was given to Trius concerning that change in procedure and Trius was not provided with a copy of the terms and conditions of Oceanic Coal Australia to which reference was made. 

80In 2003 Oceanic's terms and conditions were changed in some way but again, no notification was given to Trius of that change and no copy of the altered terms and conditions was provided by Oceanic to Trius. As already indicated, I accept the evidence of Mr Brittain that throughout his dealings with Oceanic, between 1997 and January 2007 when this accident occurred, the existence of these terms and conditions had not been brought to his attention, that he was unaware of their existence and that he did not understand them to form a part of any agreement entered into between Trius and Oceanic during that period. 

81It is against that factual background that the submissions of the parties on this issue need to be considered. 

82Oceanic submitted as follows: 

""57. Purchase orders in the form of PP319522 had been sent on many previous occasions. On the present occasion it was sent in response to a quote sent by Trius. Any prior conversation advising that ""Trius had got the job"" can be ignored for contractual purposes. Trius knew that such a phone call was not intended to create legal relations and that it was not bound to do the job at that stage. The call from Oceanic was merely indicating, as a courtesy, that Oceanic would send an offer in the usual form of a purchase order based on the Trius quote. It was the evidence of Brittain that a purchase order would always be sent for every job to be done by Trius at Oceanic. 

58. If Trius accepted the purchase order it would then provide the goods and services that had been ordered. It is not precisely clear when the purchase order was accepted in the present case but it must have been by the time Trius commenced work at the washery. In any event, Trius does not dispute that it entered into a contract with Oceanic based on PP319552."" 

83As already indicated, that analysis is not only artificial, it fails to have regard to the evidence as to the relationship between Oceanic and Trius leading up to the performance of this contract. An agreement had been reached between Mr Brittain and Mr Muller confirming the fabrication and installation of the metal beams and that agreement had been partially performed by Trius when PP319522 arrived. If this were the only transaction between Oceanic and Trius, it is difficult to see how in those circumstances PP319522 could have formed any part of the contract. 

84Such, however, is not the case. Trius and Oceanic had been dealing with each other for almost 10 years. Since the adoption by Oceanic of the PULSE system in 2001, purchase orders had always been sent by Oceanic in respect of contracts performed by Trius, even when the work referred to in those contracts had been completed before the purchase order was sent. Clearly, therefore, the provision and existence of the purchase order PP319552 in this case was an important part of the contract between them. This is so because of the part played by purchase orders in their course of dealing since 2001. 

85That being so, the question is what effect is to be given to the notation in the bottom left hand corner under the heading ""Terms and Conditions""? 

86On this issue, Oceanic submits that the notation can only refer to the ""Oceanic Coal Australia Limited General Purchase Order Terms and Conditions"" which are contained in annexure ""C"" to the statement of Mr Claridge (see [16] - [18]). It submits that this notation has appeared on purchase orders on so many occasions, including this occasion, that those General Purchase Order Terms and Conditions must be regarded as having been incorporated into the contract between Trius and Oceanic on this occasion. Oceanic relies upon Smith and Ors v South Wales Switchgear Limited [1978] 1 All ER 18 where the House of Lords held the reference in a purchase order to ""General Conditions of Contract 2401 obtainable on request"" was sufficient to incorporate those general conditions of contract into the contract. 

87To the extent that the purchase order was received after work on the contract had been commenced, Oceanic submits that a term can be incorporated into a contract by a course of dealing, even where the term is received after the oral contract. It submits that although actual knowledge of the term needs to be shown, it is sufficient simply to refer to the existence of the term. It relies upon Hardwick Game Farms v S.A.P.P.A. (1969) 2 AC 31 at 90 and 104E-105B to support that proposition. 

88The parties accepted that a term can be incorporated into a contract by a course of dealing. However, there is an initial difficulty with the wording of the notation as to terms and conditions on purchase order PP319522. The notation refers to the supply of goods and not to the supply of services. That creates a real ambiguity and to that extent, should be read against Oceanic. Although there is no reference to where or how the ""terms and conditions of Oceanic"" can be accessed, I accept that had Trius wished to, it could have requested a copy of the terms and conditions then in force and in accordance with the evidence of Mr Claridge, a copy of those terms and conditions would have been provided. 

89I do not consider that the two cases upon which Oceanic sought to rely are decisive in determining whether the Oceanic General Purchase Order Terms and Conditions were a part of the contract entered into with Trius for the fabrication and installation of the metal beams. The facts of the two cases are significantly different. 

90In Smith , there was a formal offer and acceptance. South Wales Switchgear sought from Smith the supply of goods and services and specified that the provision of those goods and services was to be subject to its ""general conditions contract 24001, obtainable on request"". Smith accepted that proposal but did not request a copy of the general conditions, nor did it examine one. The House of Lords held that in those circumstances, the general conditions were part of the agreement between the parties. 

91In Hardwick Game Farm v S.A.P.P.A. there was a course of dealing between the parties, which included the sending to S.A.P.P.A. of a contract note on the day the oral contract was entered or on the day following. S.A.P.P.A. would expect to receive such a contract note because it was routine practice between the parties. On the back of the contract note there were certain terms and conditions printed. S.A.P.P.A.'s representative knew that there were such conditions but he had not read them. The court held that S.A.P.P.A. knew that, when they entered into agreements with the other party, they did so on the terms on the back of the contract note which had been continuously made known to it. The House of Lords held that it was reasonable in those circumstances to hold that the terms and conditions on the back of the contract notes formed part of the agreement. 

92The facts here are quite different. Oceanic's General Purchase Order Terms and Conditions were not at any time sent to Trius and the insertion of the notation concerning terms and conditions onto the purchase order appears to have taken place without prior notification to Trius. There was no evidence of any knowledge on the part of anyone from Trius of the content of the ""terms and conditions of Oceanic"". There was no evidence of any attempt by anyone from Oceanic to communicate the content of those terms and conditions to Trius. 

93The principle which appears to emerge from the decided cases, particularly in Australia, is that where there is no signed contract, terms appearing on documents that are not attached to the contract documents, are only incorporated in the contract if reasonable notice has been given of them. This was the basis for the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Hays Personnel Services (Australia) P/L v Motorline P/L [2008] QCA 375 at [10], [14] and [17]. 

94Brennan J in Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Company Inc v Fay (1988) 165 CLR 197 said at 228-229: 

""But where an exemption clause is contained in a ticket or other document intended by the carrier to contain the terms of carriage, yet the other party is not in fact aware when the contract is made that an exemption clause is intended to be a term of the contract, the carrier cannot rely on that clause unless, at the time of the contract, the carrier had done all that was reasonably necessary to bring the exemption clause to the passenger's notice. ... In differing circumstances, different steps may be needed to bring an exemption clause to a passenger's notice, especially if the clause is an unusual one. In the present case, the only step which the defendant took to bring the exclusive foreign jurisdiction clause to the plaintiff's notice before the fare was paid was the note in the brochure that the conditions of carriage were printed in the (unavailable) Passenger Ticket Contract. In Hollingworth v Southern Ferries Ltd (The ""Eagle""), it was held that a mere statement in a carrier's brochure that the carrier contracted on its conditions of carriage was not enough to make those conditions terms of a contract of carriage subsequently made with an intending passenger who had read the brochure."" 

95Implicit approval of the approach of Brennan J was given by the High Court in Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52, (2004) 219 CLR 165 at [54] - [55] when the court was drawing a distinction between signed contracts and those where a document had not been signed but purported to incorporate other terms not forming part of it, into a contract. There the court said: 

""54 It appears from the reasoning of the primary judge and the Court of Appeal that the proposition was given a narrower focus, and was limited to exclusion clauses, or, perhaps, exclusion clauses which are regarded by a court as unusual and onerous. The present happens to be a case about exclusion clauses, but there is no apparent reason why the principle, if it exists, should apply only to them. Nor is the criterion by which a court might declare a contractual provision to be unusual or onerous always easy to identify. The origin of the proposition, clearly enough, is in the principles that apply to cases, such as ticket cases, in which one party has endeavoured to incorporate in a contract terms and conditions appearing in a notice or an unsigned document. When an attempt is made to introduce the concept of sufficient notice into the field of signed contracts, there is a danger of subverting fundamental principle based on sound legal policy. ... 


55. In L'Estrange v Graucob Scrutton LJ said that the problem in that case was different from what he described as ""the railway passenger and cloak-room ticket cases, such as Richardson, Spence & Co v Rowntree , where ""there is no signature to the contractual document, the document being simply handed by the one party to the other."" His Lordship said: 

""In cases in which the contract is contained in a railway ticket or other unsigned document, it is necessary to prove that an alleged party was aware, or ought to have been aware, of its terms and conditions. These cases have no application when the document has been signed."""" 

96In Toll the High Court referred without disapproval to the Court of Appeal decision in Remath Investments No 6 Pty Ltd v Chanel (Australia) Pty Ltd [1992] NSWCA 208. There the Court (Kirby P, Handley and Cripps JJA) was considering submissions by a bailee to the effect that the bailor was bound by its ""conditions of contract, copies of which are available on request"". The bailee sought to argue that this notation on its invoices incorporated into the agreement between it and the bailor those ""conditions of contract"". The bailee relied upon that statement at the foot of its invoices because it had come to the notice of the bailor in the course of previous dealings between them. 

97In relation to the question of incorporation of those terms into the contract the Court said: 

""In the light of this evidence Remath is left only with the statement on the foot of its invoices. It was not suggested that either Mr Hewett or Mr Valentine were aware or should have been aware of this statement prior to the burglary. Mr Borwick who initiated all but two of the bond storage contracts between July 1987 and August 1988 was aware at the time of the presence of this statement. He processed all incoming invoices from Remath, not only for bond rent, but also for customs and forwarding agents' services and cartage. All contained the statement relied upon by Remath. These invoices were received well after the contracts had been made and after performance had commenced and in some cases after they had been completed. However Mr Borwick was not aware of the existence or content of ""the conditions of contract"" relating to storage in Remath's bond. He was never given them, never told about them, didn't see them, and never asked for them. 

... 

The principles of law which this Court must apply in the present case were considered in Liaweena (NSW) Pty Ltd v McWilliams Wines (1991) ASC 56 616. Both parties accepted that the test was whether the appellant ""did what was reasonably sufficient to give the plaintiff notice of the condition"". See at 56 622. As we understand the principle this obligation applies not merely to the existence but also to the content of the condition. 

Remath made no attempt to introduce the storage conditions into any contract with Chanel at or about the time the contract was made. Mr Borwick's letters and phone calls and the phone calls from Mr Valentine never once elicited a reference by Remath to the existence of its storage conditions. The invoices for bond rent which Remath relies upon arrived at Chanel after the storage contracts had been made and wholly or partly performed. Why should Mr Borwick at that stage be expected or required to do anything to find out more about Remath's conditions of contract? Why should he do what Remath itself could not be bothered doing? In particular why should the law allow Remath to introduce restrictive conditions by stealth when it had made no attempt to introduce them openly and directly at the time the contracts were made. In our opinion in the circumstances of this case there was no onus whatever on Mr Borwick to make any inquiry of Remath simply because he had received and read invoices in this form."" 

98There are a number of important factual similarities between the circumstances considered by the Court of Appeal in Remath and those in this case. Specifically, there is no evidence from Oceanic that, at any time between 2001 and January 2007 in negotiations with Trius in respect of small contracts and procurements, any mention was made by anyone from Oceanic of the terms and conditions now sought to be relied upon. The evidence of Mr Brittain is that so far as he was aware, no-one from Oceanic said anything about such terms and conditions to him or anyone else at Trius. That being so, the Court of Appeal's observations, set out immediately above, would seem to be particularly apposite. 

99In relation to the question of what is required to provide reasonable notice in the case of incorporation of contract terms, the court said: 

""In the light of these authorities we do not accept the appellant's submission that the mere statement on the bottom of its invoices was, in the circumstances, reasonably sufficient to incorporate the storage conditions into the relevant contracts. 

The question of reasonableness may be tested in this way. If in late June 1987 when Mr Borwick first spoke or wrote to Mr Street about the possibility of Chanel making use of Remath's bond storage facilities, or at any time thereafter before the burglary, Mr Street had told Mr Borwick of the storage conditions and their effect, or sent him a copy by mail or by facsimile several courses of action would have been open to Chanel. It might have inspected Remath's bond store, or at least inquired as to the security arrangements. It might have accepted Remath's storage conditions and arranged insurance. It might have shopped around the other bond stores for better terms or better security. It could have delayed its shipments from Britain and if there was space in its own warehouse it may have elected to pay the duty and tax and cleared sufficient goods from its bond store into its warehouse. In our opinion it cannot be said that Chanel was ever given ""a fair opportunity"" of considering these alternatives. This is only another way of saying that it was never given a fair opportunity of considering Remath's storage conditions before the contracts were made."" 

100There are a number of first instance decisions which are consistent with the approach of the Court of Appeal in Remath . In Eggleston v Marley Engineers Pty Limited and BK and JG Mewett (1970) 21 SASR 51, the facts were similar. A firm hired a mobile crane and driver and was given an invoice at the end of the job. The invoice contained an indemnity clause on its back. The firm had been given such invoices on earlier occasions. Hogarth J held at 66 that the firm was aware there were conditions on the back of the invoice, but was unaware of the indemnity clause because notice had not been given as to the existence of the clause, nor had any effort been made to bring it to the attention of the firm, other than the fact that it was contained on the back of the invoice. 

101Chattis Nominees Pty Ltd v Norman Ross Homeworks Pty Ltd (Receiver Appointed) (in Liq) (NSWSC, unreported, Cohen J, 3 August 1992) is useful in a number of respects. Each of the parties was seeking to incorporate into the contract between them their own standard terms and conditions. The attempt by Norman Ross was rejected by his Honour because he was not satisfied that it had ever sent a copy of its standard terms and conditions to Chattis. To the extent that it sought to rely upon a term in its order form, under the heading ""Delivery Instructions"" to the effect ""6.Deliveries are made under Norman Ross Homeworks Condition of Purchase"", his Honour held that the term was ambiguous. It could have been referring back to the preceding paragraphs 1 - 5 which specifically dealt with delivery, or to some other condition. In that regard his Honour said: 

""In either case the plaintiff would have had no notice of any further condition which the defendant was seeking to incorporate into the agreement by including it in its order form. The plaintiff was not required to seek out whether there was a condition of the contract of which it had not been made aware. If a party seeks to incorporate into a contract particular terms it must do so in such a way as to make it clear what the term is to be and in my opinion the defendant failed to do that in respect of sales to the plaintiff."" 

102In contrast his Honour held that Chattis had made it sufficiently clear to Norman Ross that a certain term was to be included in their agreement because it had, over a period of time, included that term on the back of its invoices. In that regard his Honour said: 

""The regularity of those dealings indicates that in the absence of objection the condition must be taken to have been accepted as being incorporated into the contracts which were entered into throughout 1991."" 

103In Barrymores Pty Ltd v Harris Scarfe Ltd (Administrators Appointed) (Receivers and Managers Appointed) & Ors [2001] WASC 210 Roberts-Smith J reached a similar conclusion. In that case a supplier of goods over a period of time had included a ROT (Retention Of Title) clause on its invoices, which it sent to a retailer of those goods. No objection to it had been raised at any time by the retailer to the ROT clause. His Honour held that the ROT clause had been incorporated by implied consent in the contracts for supply of goods by the long course of dealing between them and there having been no objection to the clause. 

104The common theme in those cases, but which was absent in relation to Norman Ross and in Remath , was that a copy of the terms and conditions sought to be relied upon had been sent to the other party to the contract, and during the course of dealing between them, no objection had been made to those terms and conditions. The significant difference in this case, which makes it very similar to that of Remath , is that a copy of the terms and conditions was never provided by Oceanic to Trius. 

105I have concluded that the ""General Purchase Order Terms and Conditions"" of Oceanic did not form part of the contract between Trius and Oceanic for the fabrication and installation of the beams as set out on purchase order PP319522. I have reached that conclusion for the following reasons: 

106The notation on the purchase order upon which Oceanic relies was at best ambiguous. It stated ""The above goods are supplied subject to the terms and conditions of Oceanic Coal Australia Limited"". There is nothing in that notation which clearly and unambiguously indicates the existence of any standard terms and conditions affecting the installation of goods and the performance of services. However, the conditions upon which Oceanic seeks to rely and which it says are incorporated in the contract all relate to the performance of services, not the supply of goods (see [18] hereof). In those circumstances the notation should be read against Oceanic and is not effective in incorporating terms and conditions relating to installation and the provision of services in the contract with Trius. The observations of Cohen J in Chattis with respect to the ambiguity of the term sought to be relied upon by Norman Ross are apposite (see [101] hereof). 

107Additionally, I am not satisfied that reasonable steps were taken by Oceanic to bring the terms and conditions which it says were incorporated in the contract and upon which it seeks to rely, to the attention of Trius. There is no evidence that the terms and conditions were ever provided to Trius before the contract and there is no evidence that Oceanic ever mentioned to Trius the existence of such terms and conditions. Apart from Smith v South Wales Switchgear (which is factually different), the authorities in this area of the law do not support the incorporation of the terms and conditions in the contract. 

The indemnity clause 

108The preceding analysis is sufficient to decide Oceanic's claim in contract. In case I am wrong on the issue of the incorporation of Oceanic's terms and conditions in the contract, it is necessary to construe clause 13 of the General Purchase Order Terms and Conditions upon which Oceanic sought to rely. Clause 13 is set out at [18] hereof. It was common ground that because Oceanic drafted clause 13 any ambiguity in it should be read against Oceanic ( Andar Transport Ltd v Brambles Ltd [2004] HCA 28; (2004) 217 CLR 424 at [17] - [23]). 

109In approaching the construction of clause 13 of Oceanic's General Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, some guidance is provided by Erect Safe Scaffolding (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sutton [2008] NSWCA 114. While Giles JA and McClellan CJ at CL were not entirely in agreement as to how to interpret the indemnity clause there under consideration, both agreed on this principle of construction: 

""5 The operation of any contractual indemnity must be found in the application to the facts of the words of the relevant clause, construed as part of the contract as a whole. Decisions on the operation of contractual indemnities in different words in different contracts are likely to be of limited assistance."" (Giles JA) 

""154 The resolution of any disagreement about a particular clause in a contract must be approached by considering the terms of the relevant document. Although the resolution of disputes in other cases may provide guidance, each dispute must be resolved by the application of the accepted principles of construction to the particular contract."" (McClellan CJ at CL) 

110Leaving out words which are clearly inapplicable, the clauses under consideration provide as follows: 

""13.3 You will be liable for and will indemnify us and keep us indemnified from and against any liability and/or any loss or damage of any kind whatsoever, arising directly or indirectly from: 

(b) The injury of any of your employees arising out of or in connection with this agreement; 

(c) Any loss or damage arising out of, or in connection with any personal injury to any person caused or contributed to by: 

(i) The goods and/or services; 

and/or 

(ii) The activities undertaken on and in our premises by you and/or your employees;"" 

111The first point to be made is that the liability to which subparagraphs 13.3(b) and (c) refer, is qualified by words of causation appearing in the chapeau, i.e. ""arising directly or indirectly from"". While these are very general words of causation, as Erect Safe Scaffolding made clear, they are not unlimited in application and their meaning is ""informed by their presence in an indemnity clause"" ( Erect Safe Scaffolding at [11], [156] - [157]). 

112Sub-clause 13.3(b) makes it clear that the liability must arise from an injury to an employee of Trius. That, however, is not sufficient. Sub-clause 13.3(b) contains further words of limitation. Such ""injury"" must be one ""arising out of or in connection with this agreement"". In the terms and conditions ""agreement"" is defined: 

""Agreement"" means this document and separately, each purchase order."" 

113In order to give the sub-clause meaning, the words ""the performance of"" need to be inserted before ""this agreement"". Even with that addition, however, an ambiguity remains. Is this a reference to the performance of the agreement by both parties, by Trius or by Oceanic? On the basis of what the High Court said in Andar , I have concluded that sub-clause 13.3(b) must be read against Oceanic and refers to performance of the agreement by Trius. 

114If the only words of limitation in sub-clause 13.3(b) were ""arising out of"", I would follow the approach of Giles JA and McClellan CJ at CL in Erect Safe Scaffolding and conclude that it does not provide Oceanic with an indemnity with respect to its liability to the plaintiff. That liability arose out of Oceanic's own conduct and its own direct liability to the plaintiff. 

115That, however, does not resolve the matter. The other words of limitation in sub-clause 13.3(b) are ""in connection with"". These words were considered by the Court of Appeal (Meagher Giles and Hodgson JJA) in State of New South Wales v Tempo Services Ltd [2004] NSWCA 4 in the context of an indemnity clause. There Hodgson JA, with whom Giles JA agreed, said: 

""20 Furthermore, in my opinion the personal injury to the plaintiff in this case was ""in connection with"" Tempo's performance of services. The matters referred to by Mr. Walker, namely that the injury occurred at a work place, during working hours, when the plaintiff was there for the purpose of performing services, had signed on, and was going about the performance of services, gives the injury sufficient connection with the provision of services. There is no need in my opinion to consider on whether the Victorian case of Venturoni was correct or not: in my opinion, it is distinguishable, if only because the words ""in respect of"" can be considered, in this context, as being narrower than the words ""in connection with""."" 

116On the basis of the wide interpretation given to those words in Tempo Services , I am satisfied that sub-clause 13.3(b) is effective to require Trius to indemnify Oceanic in respect of Oceanic's liability to the plaintiff. On my interpretation, the indemnity should read: 

""You will be liable for and will indemnify us from any liability arising indirectly from the injury of any of your employees in connection with the performance of this agreement by you."" 

117In relation to sub-clause 13.3(c)(ii) I have concluded that it is not effective to require Trius to indemnify Oceanic for the injury to the plaintiff. I have reached this conclusion because of the use of the words ""personal injury to any person"" in sub-clause 13.3(c). The reference to ""any person"" is to be contrasted with the specific reference to ""your employees"" in sub-clause 13.3(b) and the specific reference to ""by you and your employees"" in sub-clause 13.3(c)(ii). By reference to the approach in Andar , and by reading the implicit ambiguity against Oceanic, I am not satisfied that the words ""injury to any person"" encompass an injury to an employee of Trius. They must refer to a person other than an employee of Trius who is carrying out the activity which might cause the injury. 

118Although I have found in favour of Oceanic in relation to sub-clause 13(3)(b) of its General Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, this has not altered my overall conclusion in relation to the contract issue. As previously indicated, Oceanic has not satisfied me that its General Purchase Order Terms and Conditions were part of its agreement with Trius for the fabrication and installation of the metal beams at the MCPP, which is referred to in purchase order PP319522. 

Conclusion 

119As indicated to the parties in the course of submissions, I do not propose to make final orders at this stage so as to allow the parties to prepare Short Minutes of Order in accordance with these reasons. 

120While both sides conceded that each of them was liable to the plaintiff in tort, the dispute before the Court was the extent of that liability with each party seeking to persuade the Court that the other should bear a higher percentage of that liability. On that issue, Oceanic has been successful. 

121Oceanic has, however, failed in its claim in contract against Trius. 

122No submissions were made by the parties on the question of costs pending the publication of these reasons. I expect the Short Minutes of Order to include a provision dealing with the making of submissions as to costs. My current inclination, subject to submissions to the contrary, is that the question of costs should be dealt with by way of written submissions with the parties being given the opportunity to briefly respond orally to those written submissions. 

123The only order which I make at this stage is that the parties are to prepare Short Minutes of Order in accordance with these reasons, such Short Minutes of Order to be placed before the Court at 9.30am on Friday 29 July 2011. In default of agreement, each party is to prepare its own Short Minutes of Order to be placed before the Court on that occasion. For this purpose the matter is fixed for directions before me at 9.30am on Friday, 29 July 2011.

2709449,R v McParland; R v Wingate (No 3) [2011] NSWDC 266,"Judgment


1Ms Sullivan who appears for the Director of Public Prosecution in this case has tendered against the accused Luke Wingate a record of interview. Ms Healey of counsel who appears for Mr Wingate objects to its tender. Ms Healey objects to its tender based upon s 135 and s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). In addition she relies on s 85 and s 90 of that Act.

2Ms Healey argued that there is, in terms of s 137, unfair prejudice to her client and, in terms of s 135, danger that the record of interview might be unfairly prejudicial to her client. She played part of the interview and asked me to conclude that her client appeared intoxicated. He may be intoxicated from the use of illegal drugs or indeed prescribed drugs or from alcohol. There was evidence that the accused had been drinking. There is evidence that he had with him at the time of his arrest some syringes and there is evidence that he was being treated for pain and opium addiction. She argued that her client's demeanour in the interview was such that he was not in a fit state to undergo the interview.

3The probative value of the interview is high. Mr Wingate gives an explanation for the allegations which are levelled against him and which are the subject of this trial. However to my mind there is no unfair prejudice or danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to him. To my mind he does not appear to be so intoxicated as not to be in a fit state to be interviewed. I would accept Ms Sullivan's description of him as animated. I do not regard the application under either s 135 or 137 as having sufficient merit.

4Ms Sullivan for the prosecution argues, so far as s 85 is concerned, that the interview was given in circumstances which were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected. I think she is right in that argument. I do not regard him as being demonstrably intoxicated. He seemed fairly articulate, engaged in the process of the interview and, as Ms Sullivan argued, ready to explain his part in the circumstances which led to him being charged.

5Ms Healey's final argument is that having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made it would be unfair to her client to use the evidence. She points to three or four passages in the record of interview.

6In question 4 when asked whether Mr Wingate and the police were the only persons in the room, he answered, ""Yeah. Hold on. Before we get into all this, I am not doing any interview that, what I, what I"". The police officer responded, ""Okay you just have to let me finish this. Okay. So let me finish this and then"".

7A short time later in the interview Mr Wingate's rights were explained to him by the custody manager and he was asked whether he wanted to exercise any of his rights. Mr Wingate's response was ""well, like I just said, me girl was trying to ring up a, a solicitor to find out why I'm actually sitting here, like you said, on an allegation."" The police officer's response was, ""Yeah. You, we can get a chance to ring your solicitor once we're finished."" Mr Wingate acknowledged that he had been given a piece of paper by a custody manager about his rights and when asked whether he wanted to exercise any of them he replied, ""No, I can't remember all the rights off the top of me head, but just continue. You're right. Keep going."".

8Ms Sullivan argues, correctly I think, that Mr Wingate made it clear that in all the circumstances he did not object to being interviewed and that despite his hesitations he was prepared to proceed with the interview.

9The authorities on this question emphasise - for example in R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66 at [30] - that the courts need to ""be vigilant to ensure that evidence is not permitted to be introduced at an unacceptable price"". And in R v Em [2003] NSWCCA 374 at [104] the Court said that the ""purpose of the discretion is the protection of the rights and privileges of the accused.""

10The three qualifications which Mr Wingate attempted to make in response to the police officer's questions concern me. Right at the start when he indicated that he was not doing an interview he was told by the police that he had to ""let me finish this"". When he raised the question of speaking to a solicitor he was told that he would get a chance ""once we're finished"". He then said that he could not remember his rights.

11In my opinion it would be unfair to use the evidence contained in the interview against Mr Wingate in those circumstances. Although I am satisfied he was fit to be interviewed and although I am satisfied that he proceeded to provide an articulate and engaged interview, his attempts right at the start to exercise his rights - his right not to do an interview and to speak to a solicitor -were it seems to me overridden by the police officer's understandable desire to proceed with the interview. The police officer no doubt understood that he would be going through a process of asking whether the person he was interviewing understood his rights but to my mind it would be unfair to use the contents of the interview against Mr Wingate in circumstances where he has given those responses which I have highlighted.

12For those reasons I refuse to admit VDB against Mr Wingate.

2709450,Wagga Truck Towing Pty Limited v O'Toole; IAG Limited t/as NRMA Insurance v O'Toole [2011] NSWCA 191,"HEADNOTE 
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment] 
Facts 
On 28 October 2002, Mr O'Toole, an employee of Mr Russell's company, was returning to Sydney from Melbourne in an Isuzu truck driven by Mr Russell. The truck carried a V8 Holden car owned by Mr Russell that had been raced by his team in Melbourne. Mr O'Toole was a member of this team, but not in a skilled mechanical or driving capacity and not related to or in the course of his employment. In the vicinity of Gundagai the truck developed engine problems, and Mr Russell pulled into an emergency lane on the side of the road. Mr Russell put the truck into second gear and put the handbrake on. After ringing a mechanic, Mr Russell rang Wagga Towing to arrange a tow. During a second phone conversation with Wagga Towing, Mr Cool of Wagga Towing asked Mr Russell to remove the front bumper-bar and tail-shaft of the truck, to avoid delaying the tow-truck when it arrived. It was accepted that during the course of the conversation it was conveyed to Mr Cool that Mr Russell engaged in car racing, had tools available and had some assistance, but that Mr Russell was not familiar with the procedure for removing a tail-shaft. 
Half an hour after parking, Mr Russell began removing the front bumper-bar. Mr O'Toole asked Mr Russell if the vehicle was safe, and Mr Russell replied that the handbrake was on. Mr O'Toole then went under the truck to remove the tail-shaft. After Mr O'Toole undid nuts and bolts, the tail-shaft came away from the truck, and it began to roll forward. The truck had been parked on a slight incline, and the wheels were not chocked. Mr O'Toole was run over by the truck, dragged for some time, and was severely injured. 
The trial judge found both Mr Russell and Mr Cool negligent, and assigned 70 per cent liability to Mr Russell and 30 per cent to Wagga Towing. He found no contributory negligence on the part of Mr O'Toole. Wagga Towing and NRMA appealed, but did not challenge the decision as to contributory negligence.

(1) Whether Mr Cool of Wagga Towing knew or ought to have known that disconnecting the tail-shaft rendered the parking brake inoperative and that Mr Russell was unaware of this fact, and whether, in the circumstances, Wagga Towing owed a duty to warn Mr Russell. 
(2) Whether Mr Russell was unaware that uncoupling the tail-shaft disconnected the brakes, such that Wagga Towing's act or omission caused the accident. 
(3) Whether it was open to the primary judge to find that Mr Russell had more mechanical expertise than Mr O'Toole. 
(4) Whether Mr Russell directed Mr O'Toole to disconnect the tail-shaft. 
(5) Whether a reasonable person in Mr Russell's position would have appreciated that to undo bolts under the truck, on an incline, without chocking the wheels, was a risky undertaking. 
(6) Whether Mr Russell breached a duty of care owed to Mr O'Toole. 
(7) Whether Mr Russell's fault was ""in the use or operation of the vehicle"" so as to satisfy the definitions of ""motor accident"" and ""injury"" in the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (MAC Act), such that NRMA (Mr Russell's insurer) is liable for Mr Russell's breach. 
(8) What apportionment for liability is appropriate between Wagga Towing and NRMA. 
Held (dismissing Wagga Towing's appeal, dismissing NRMA's appeal against Mr O'Toole, allowing NRMA's appeal against Wagga Towing): 
In relation to (1) - Wagga Towing's knowledge and duty 
It was open to the primary judge to find that Mr Cool knew that disconnecting the drive shaft may have the effect of disabling the parking brake, that Mr Russell did not know this and that a reasonable person in Mr Cool's position would not have assumed that he did. Wagga Towing had a duty of care owed to Mr O'Toole to warn Mr Russell of this risk. 
In relation to (2) - Causation 
Mr Russell was not aware that removal of the tail-shaft would disable the parking brake, and would not have permitted Mr O'Toole to go under the truck without first chocking the wheels, had he been alerted to this by Wagga Towing. 
In relation to (3) - Mr Russell's expertise 
It was not open to the primary judge to find that Mr Russell had any greater mechanical expertise than Mr O'Toole. 
In relation to (4) - Mr Russell's direction 
Mr Russell impliedly directed Mr O'Toole to disconnect the tail-shaft. 
In relation to (5) - Reasonable appreciation of risk 
A reasonable person in Mr Russell's position would have appreciated the risk such that they would not have directed Mr O'Toole to undertake the task without first taking the simple precaution of chocking the wheels. 
In relation to (6) - Mr Russell's breach of duty 
Mr Russell breached the duty of care owed to Mr O'Toole by not chocking the wheels. 
In relation to (7) - MAC Act 
NRMA is liable for Mr Russell's fault, as the fault occurred both in the parking and maintenance of the truck, which both meet the definition of ""use or operation"" under the MAC Act . 
In relation to (8) - Apportionment 
The primary judge erred in giving weight to Mr Russell's mechanical expertise, such that apportionment should be adjusted to 50-50 between Wagga Towing and NRMA. 


			Judgment 

1GILES JA: I agree with Hodgson JA, save that I would prefer not to rest fault in the use or operation of the vehicle on fault in its parking. It is sufficient that the fault was in its maintenance. 

2HODGSON JA: On 30 March 2010, Garling DCJ gave his decision in proceedings in which the first respondent to both appeals (Mr O'Toole) had sued Rhett Russell (for whom the appellant in the second appeal (NRMA) was later substituted) and the appellant in the first appeal (Wagga Towing), and in which Mr Russell had cross-claimed against Wagga Towing. The primary judge found a verdict for Mr O'Toole against NRMA for $782,057 and against Wagga Towing for $788,557, and apportioned liability between the defendants as 70 per cent to NRMA and 30 per cent to Wagga Towing. The appeal papers do not disclose the precise terms of any judgment entered into pursuant to those findings. 

3Each appellant brings an appeal from that decision. 

Outline of facts 

4In early October 2002, Mr O'Toole commenced employment as a courier with a company run by Mr Russell. 

5Mr Russell raced a V8 Holden. Before Mr O'Toole commenced employment with Mr Russell's company, Mr O'Toole accompanied Mr Russell to a race meeting; and after he commenced employment, he attended other race meetings with Mr Russell. At these meetings, Mr O'Toole helped Mr Russell in various ways, for example changing stickers on the car, washing the car, and unloading spare wheels and other things. 

6On the weekend before 28 October 2002, Mr O'Toole accompanied Mr Russell to Melbourne, where there were races on both the Saturday and Sunday in which Mr Russell's V8 Holden competed. On Monday 28 October 2002, Mr Russell drove back towards Sydney, driving an Isuzu truck which he owned, towing a trailer carrying the V8 Holden, with Mr O'Toole as a passenger in the truck. 

7In the vicinity of Gundagai, the truck developed engine problems, and Mr Russell pulled into an emergency lane on the side of the road. According to a finding of the trial judge, not challenged on appeal, Mr Russell put the truck into second gear and put the handbrake on. Mr Russell said he would ring a mechanic, and made a telephone call. Mr Russell then said he would have to call a tow-truck and he called Wagga Towing, and asked that a tow-truck come and tow the truck to Wagga Wagga. Mr Russell and Mr O'Toole then commenced to have lunch by the side of the road. 

8According to a finding by the primary judge, not challenged on appeal, there was then a second phone conversation between Mr Russell and Wagga Towing, in which Mr Cool of Wagga Towing asked Mr Russell to remove the front bumper-bar and the tail-shaft of the truck, as he did not want his tow-truck delayed when it arrived. 

9Mr Russell and Mr O'Toole completed their lunch, and about half an hour after they had first stopped, Mr Russell went about taking off the front bumper-bar, and Mr O'Toole went under the truck to remove the tail-shaft. Before doing so, Mr O'Toole asked if the vehicle was safe, and Mr Russell told him the handbrake was on. 

10Mr O'Toole went under the truck to remove the tail-shaft. He undid nuts and bolts, and the tail-shaft came away from the vehicle. The vehicle then commenced to roll forward. It had been parked on an incline, and the wheels had not been chocked. Mr O'Toole was run over by the truck, was dragged along under it for a time, and was severely injured. The truck went on down the hill, crossed to the other side of the road and ultimately crashed into the bank at the side of the road and stopped. Fortunately, it did not collide with any other vehicle. 

Statutory provisions 

11The case against Mr Russell (and thus NRMA) required consideration of the definitions of ""motor accident"", ""use or operation of a motor vehicle"", ""driver"" and ""injury"" in s 3 of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 ( MAC Act ) as in force at 28 October 2002: 

motor accident means an accident or incident caused by the fault of the owner or driver of a motor vehicle in the use or operation of the vehicle which causes the death of or injury to a person. 


use or operation of a motor vehicle includes: 

(a) the maintenance or parking of the vehicle, or 

(b) in the case of a motor vehicle that is not a trailer-the use or operation of a trailer attached to the motor vehicle and a trailer running out of control having become detached from the motor vehicle towing it, or 

(c) in the case of a motor vehicle that is a tow truck-the use or operation of an uninsured motor vehicle that is being towed or carried by the tow truck. 

Note . As a result of the above definition, a third-party policy for a motor vehicle extends to cover the matters mentioned in the definition. 


driver means a person driving a motor vehicle, and includes: 

(a) a person riding and operating a motor cycle, and 

(b) a person for the time being in charge of a motor vehicle. 


injury : 

(a) means personal or bodily injury caused by the fault of the owner or driver of a motor vehicle in the use or operation of the vehicle if, and only if, the injury is a result of and is caused during: 

(i) the driving of the vehicle, or 

(ii) a collision, or action taken to avoid a collision, with the vehicle, or 

(iii) the vehicle's running out of control, or 

(iv) such use or operation by a defect in the vehicle, and 

(b) includes: 

(i) pre-natal injury, and 

(ii) psychological or psychiatric injury, and 

(iii) damage to artificial members, eyes or teeth, crutches or other aids or spectacle glasses, 

Decision of primary judge 

12Neither Mr Russell nor Mr Cool gave evidence, but statements made by them were admitted into evidence (in the case of Mr Cool, by way of an investigator's transcript of an interview with him). 

13The primary judge accepted that Mr O'Toole was not a mechanic and had little knowledge of the mechanical side of motor vehicles. He found that the removal of the tail-shaft meant that the handbrake had no effect. 

14He found that, at the time of the accident, Mr Russell was the driver of the vehicle; and that Mr Russell owed Mr O'Toole a duty of care, and was at fault in directing Mr O'Toole to get under the vehicle to remove the tail-shaft without chocking the wheels, when the vehicle was parked on a slope. 

15In terms of the MAC Act , the primary judge held: 

(1) Mr Russell was the driver of the vehicle, and also the person for the time being in charge of it. 

(2) His fault was in the use or operation of the vehicle, namely the parking and maintenance of the vehicle. 

(3) Mr O'Toole's injury was caused by the vehicle running out of control. 

16The primary judge found no contributory negligence by Mr O'Toole. 

17As regards Wagga Towing, the primary judge found that Mr Cool was an expert in this area. He referred to the Civil Liability Act 2002, and found that Wagga Towing owed a duty of care to Mr O'Toole. He found that Wagga Towing breached its duty of care by providing advice to Mr Russell to remove the tail-shaft, without warning Mr Russell of the dangers of doing so. 

18On the question of contribution, the primary judge considered Mr Russell to have been significantly negligent, being on the site, seeing the slope of the land, being a person who was quite adept at mechanical matters, and being the person who should have ensured that the truck would not have moved forward. He held that Mr Russell should carry the greater burden, and assessed his negligence at 70 per cent and that of Wagga Towing at 30 per cent. 

Wagga Towing's grounds of appeal 

19Wagga Towing did not press grounds 1 to 3 in its amended notice of appeal; and it relied on grounds 4 and 5: 

4. If contrary to grounds 1-3, the trial judge was able on the evidence to find that the tailshaft's disconnection did render the parking brake inoperative in the absence of expert evidence: 

(a) the trial judge could not find that this is something which the Appellant knew or ought to have known; 

(b) the trial judge could not find that this is something which the Appellant knew or ought to have known that the Second Respondent was or might be unaware of; 

(c) in all the circumstances, the Appellant owed no duty to warn of the fact that disconnection of the tailshaft had such an effect. 

5. The Respondent failed to prove that the Second Respondent Russell, was unaware that uncoupling the tailshaft disconnected the brakes. For this reason, the Respondents failed to show that the Appellant's acts or omissions caused the accident. 

Wagga Towing's submissions 

20The submissions for Wagga Towing were summarised as follows in its written submissions in reply: 

2. In order to succeed against the Appellant, the Respondents had to prove that the Appellant:- 

a) Knew or ought to have known that uncoupling the tailshaft disabled the handbrake, and 

b) Ought to have warned the Second Respondent of this fact. 

3. In this regard:- 

a) There was no evidence that the Appellant knew the make and model of the truck. 

b) There was no evidence that the Appellant knew or ought to have known that trucks sometimes have transmission brakes, and that this was in fact the case. The truck here was old and its braking system may have been very rare or unique. 

4. Alternatively, no warning was in any event required on the facts here as 

a) The Second Respondent indicated that he owned and drove the truck and could reasonably be expected to be aware of its mechanical design. 

b) This was especially so as he represented himself as owning a racing team, and having a mechanic with him. 

c) He did not demur at the suggestion that he was capable of disconnecting the tailshaft, or request that it be done, and did not ask the Appellant for advice or assistance in the performing of the job, and elected to do it himself. 

5. A duty of the kind claimed to exist here, to warn of a risk, is not owed to someone in a class of persons who might reasonably be expected to be aware of the risk, Stephens v Giovenco [No.1] [2011] NSWCA 53, Allsop P at [3]-[8] and Tobias JA at [135-139]. 

To the same effect is Fleming Law of Torts paragraph 8.40. 

6. The fact that the vehicle was parked on a slope was not shown to be known to Mr Cool, but it was reasonable for him to assume that if it was so parked, the Second Respondent would chock the wheels of the vehicle since it would be obvious to him that in uncoupling the tailshaft he would remove the braking effect of locating the vehicle in gear. 

7. For these reasons no duty was owed to warn the Second Respondent. 

21In oral submissions, Mr Hewitt SC for Wagga Towing pointed to the evidence from Mr O'Toole that he knew that the handbrake on a motor car operated on the back wheels (Combined Book 37J), and he submitted that this confirmed the absence of evidence to show that the operation of the parking brake on the transmission was not unique to the particular type of truck involved in this case. 

22Mr Hewitt also submitted that, in circumstances where Mr Russell was not called to give evidence, it was not shown that Mr Russell in fact did not know that the uncoupling of the tail-shaft would disable the braking system; so that causation was not proved. 

Decision on Wagga Towing's appeal 

23In my opinion, in circumstances where the truck was parked on an incline, where the primary judge accepted that Mr Russell had engaged the parking brake and put the truck in gear, where the truck did not move for at least half an hour, and where it did move immediately after the tail-shaft was uncoupled, it was clear that the parking brake of this truck did not engage directly with its wheels but rather engaged somewhere with the transmission between the engine and the wheels. (Indeed, at the hearing of the appeal, this was common ground.) If this was the case with this truck, then in my opinion plainly it could have been the case with other trucks. Mr O'Toole's acceptance that he ""knew"" that the handbrake of a motorcar operated on the back wheels could not detract from this. 

24Although neither Mr Russell nor Mr Cool was called, the primary judge preferred the version of Mr Russell as to the circumstances and content of the conversation between them; and there is no suggestion that there was any error involved in this. Accordingly, this Court should proceed on the basis that the circumstances and content of the relevant conversation were as set out in Mr Russell's statement as follows (the reference to ""Royans"" being a reference to Wagga Towing, and the reference to ""the guy"" being a reference to Mr Cool): 

8. About 15 minutes after the first call to Royans, I got a phone call from Royans Towing and they asked if the truck had a bulbar. I said no. He then asked me to remove the front bumper bar and the tail shaft for towing as he did not want his tow truck delayed when it arrived. Basically they said if the bumper bar and tail shaft was taken off, he would just have to tow the truck into Wagga. I recall the guy on the phone from Royans said along the lines of, 'you're [sic] a race team aren't you, you've got tools, you can take them off' I said, 'yes, I suppose so'. After the second phone call I turned around to Dean and told him they wanted us to take off the front bumper and tail shaft for towing. We continued to eat our lunch and sat there for about another 10 and 15 minutes and then we decided to get up and do it. 

25In my opinion, it can be inferred from the circumstances and content of this conversation that Mr Cool was a person very familiar with the towing of trucks and with the effect of removing the tail-shaft of a truck. In circumstances where there was no evidence that trucks generally have parking brakes operating directly on the wheels, an inference was open that the feature of this truck, that its parking brake operated on the transmission, was a feature shared with other trucks, and that this was known to Mr Cool. Since Mr Cool was not called, in my opinion these are inferences that could confidently be drawn, and should be drawn. There is in my opinion no basis for any conclusion that this feature was unique to this one particular type of truck or that Mr Cool did not know that some trucks had this feature. 

26In my opinion, it can also be inferred from the circumstance and content of this conversation that it was conveyed to Mr Cool that removal of the tail-shaft was not something with which Mr Russell was familiar. Although it had apparently been conveyed to Mr Cool that Mr Russell engaged in car racing and had some assistance, it was Mr Cool who raised the issue of removal of the tail-shaft and who pressed the point of Mr Russell being ""a race team"" and having tools; and Mr Russell's response ""yes, I suppose so"" conveyed unfamiliarity with the task. 

27It is true that Mr Cool was not told that the truck was on an incline, but Wagga Towing had been told where the truck was to be collected, and Mr Cool must have known that it may have been parked on an incline. In my opinion, a reasonable person in Mr Cool's position would not assume that a truck owner (even one who raced cars) would be aware of the consequences of removing the truck's tail-shaft. 

28In terms of s 5B of the Civil Liability Act : 

(1) Mr Cool should have known of a risk that, if he did not alert Mr Russel to this, removal of the tail-shaft of the truck, which he was requesting of Mr Russell, might disable the parking brake and gears of the truck and thereby permit the truck to move out of control. 

(2) Although the likelihood of this happening might have been very small, the consequences if it did happen could be horrendous, so that the risk was not insignificant. 

(3) A reasonable person in Mr Cool's position would have alerted Mr Russell to the risk, having regard to the extent of the risk and the minimal burden of the relevant precaution. 

29As will be seen later, I accept that a reasonable person in the position of Mr Russell would have realised that removing the tail-shaft would disable any braking effect of the truck being in gear, and would not have directed Mr O'Toole to remove the tail-shaft, with the truck on an incline, without chocking the wheels. However, this is just one factor suggesting that the likelihood of the risk eventuating was small. In circumstances where, in my opinion, Mr Cool could not assume that Mr Russell was aware that removing the tail-shaft would also disable the parking brake, the risk was still there; and as mentioned above, the consequences could be horrendous if the risk eventuated. 

30In my opinion, this is not a case like Stephens v Giovenco [2011] NSWCA 53, in that neither Mr Russell nor Mr O'Toole was in a class of persons who might reasonably be expected to be aware of the risk that the parking brake would be disabled. 

31In these circumstances, in my opinion Mr Cool did owe a duty of care to Mr Russell and to Mr O'Toole, and breached that duty of care by not alerting Mr Russell to the risk that removing the tail-shaft would disable the parking brake. 

32In my opinion also, even though Mr Russell was not called, it can and should be inferred from the content of his detailed statement and from his actions that he was not aware that removal of the tail-shaft would disable the parking brake; and it can and should be inferred that, had he been alerted to this by Mr Cool, he would not have permitted Mr O'Toole to go under the truck to remove the tail-shaft without first chocking the wheels. 

33Accordingly, I would dismiss Wagga Towing's appeal. 

NRMA's grounds of appeal 

34NRMA relies on the following grounds of appeal: 

1. The Trial Judge erred in finding that the Appellant breached any duty of care owed to the First Respondent. 

2. The Trial Judge erred in considering and finding breach of duty of care with the benefit of hindsight rather than by the application of foresight. 

3. The Trial Judge erred in finding that when it came to removing the tailshaft from the vehicle by the First Respondent, the Appellant's driver was "" the one who determined what should be done "" in circumstances where the driver was doing no more than relaying directions received from the Second Respondent. 

4. His Honour erred in concluding that the First Respondent's Injuries were sustained in a ""motor accident"" falling within the terms of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (""the Act ""). 

5. His Honour erred in failing to identify adequately or at all the act of negligence by the Appellant's driver establishing ""fault"" on his part in the use or operation of the vehicle. 

6. His Honour erred in failing to determine whether there was ""fault"" on the part of the Appellant's driver in the use or operation of the vehicle which caused the First Respondent's injuries. 

7. His Honour erred in failing to conclude that there was no fault on the part of the Appellant's driver in the use or operation of the vehicle which caused the First Respondent's injuries. 

8. The Trial Judge erred in finding that the Appellant was "" a person who was quite adept at mechanical matters "". 

9. Alternatively, in circumstances where the Appellant's driver did no more than relay an instruction provided by the Second Respondent (who did have expertise in matters mechanical) the Trial Judge erred in apportioning 70% of the responsibility for the injuries to the Appellant and only 30% of the responsibility to the Second Respondent. 

NRMA's submissions on liability 

35Mr Deakin QC for NRMA submitted that the primary judge had erred: 

(1) In certain factual findings; and 

(2) In finding fault on the part of Mr Russell; and 

(3) In finding that any such fault fell within the scope of the MAC Act . 

36As regards (1), Mr Deakin submitted that the primary judge was in error in finding that Mr Russell was ""quite adept at mechanical matters"" (Red 40N); and in finding that Mr O'Toole's evidence was that Mr Russell had told him to remove the tail-shaft (Red 31C), this evidence not being in dispute (Red 31H). 

37As regards (2), Mr Deakin submitted that there was no finding by the primary judge that Mr Russell had any knowledge that removal of the tail-shaft would disconnect the handbrake or that the ordinary prudent driver would have such knowledge. It was only with hindsight that the primary judge found that the precaution of chocking the wheels was required. The finding of fault in Mr Russell was inconsistent with the finding that Mr O'Toole was not guilty of contributory negligence. On the evidence, neither Mr O'Toole nor Mr Russell had greater mechanical knowledge than the other, each acted on the basis of a request by Mr Cool, and neither foresaw any risks in the removal of the tail-shaft. 

38As regards (3), Mr Deakin submitted that the primary judge made no finding that the fault of Mr Russell was in the use or operation of the vehicle, as required by both the definition of ""motor accident"" and the definition of ""injury"" in the MAC Act ; or alternatively, did not justify any such finding and was in error insofar as such finding was made. At the time of any fault by Mr Russell, the vehicle had been parked for at least half an hour, so the fault could not be in parking the vehicle; and the fault was not in the maintenance of the vehicle, because no maintenance of the vehicle was then being undertaken. If there were any fault, it was in the system of work being undertaken, which was not sufficient: Nominal Defendant v GLG Australia Pty Limited [2006] HCA 11; (2006) 228 CLR 529 at [27] and [41], Brambles Australia Limited v Sandy [2006] NSWCA 357; (2006) 47 MVR 207, JA & BM Bowden & Sons Pty Limited v Doughty [2009] NSWCA 82; (2009) 52 MVR 552. 

Decision on NRMA's appeal on liability 

39I note that the primary judge made a finding that Mr O'Toole had no particular mechanical expertise. I agree with the submission for NRMA that there was no basis for the primary judge to conclude that Mr Russell had greater mechanical expertise than Mr O'Toole. He did race a car, but there was no evidence that he performed mechanical work on it. He did not attempt to see what was wrong with his truck. Although he had a shed for his car to go into, the evidence as to that matter did not suggest that he himself did any substantial work on the car, but rather that he with the help of friends did some unspecified work on it. Accordingly, in my opinion there was no adequate basis for the finding in question, at least to the extent that it conveyed anything more than that Mr Russell raced a car and (with the help of friends) did unspecified work on it. 

40On the question whether Mr Russell directed Mr O'Toole to disconnect the tail-shaft, I accept that the evidence does not express an explicit instruction to that effect. In his evidence in chief, Mr O'Toole said this: 

Q. At the conclusion of the telephone conversation did Mr Russell say something to you? 
A. He said he was advised to take the tail shaft out of the vehicle and the bull bar off the front. 

Q. And what happened then? 
A. From that stage there he went to the tool box pulled out some tools, handed them to me and then he proceeded to the front of the vehicle. 

In his cross-examination by counsel for Wagga Towing, Mr O'Toole said this: 

Q. My learned friend Mr Morris has asked you a number of questions, I don't want to repeat them, but it appears from your evidence that you were just given the instruction to do the work on the tail shaft, and then you did it. Is that right? 
A. Yes. 

Q. You didn't need any instruction? 
A. No, well he walked to the front of the vehicle so I just assumed I was given that task to do that job. 

Q. I am asking this question from a person who has no mechanical knowledge, but you were just given the instruction and you went and found the relevant place to undo the bolts? 
A. Yes. 

41In circumstances where Mr O'Toole was the employee of Mr Russell's company, and was present in the role of assisting Mr Russell, in my opinion this shows, if not an explicit instruction, at least an implied direction by Mr Russell to Mr O'Toole to disconnect the tail-shaft. 

42Taking these matters into account, my opinion is that a reasonable person in Mr Russell's position would have appreciated that disconnecting the tail-shaft would remove any braking effect from the engagement of the gears, and (even without any actual knowledge that disconnecting the tail-shaft would disable the parking brake) would have appreciated that to undo bolts under the truck, on an incline, without chocking the wheels, was a risky undertaking. In terms of s 5B of the Civil Liability Act : 

(1) Mr Russell should have appreciated that there was some risk, even without understanding precisely how that risk might eventuate. 

(2) The likelihood of the risk eventuating might, to his understanding, be quite small, but the consequences if it eventuated could be horrendous, so the risk was not insignificant. 

(3) A reasonable person in Mr Russell's position would not have directed Mr O'Toole to undertake the task, at least without first taking the simple precaution of chocking the wheels. 

43It may be said that much the same considerations apply to Mr O'Toole himself, so that the primary judge's finding that there was no contributory negligence was an error; but no appeal has been brought against that finding. 

44In my opinion, Mr Russell did have a duty of care to Mr O'Toole, which obliged him not to direct Mr O'Toole to undertake the task of disconnecting the tail-shaft, without first taking the simple precaution of chocking the wheels. In my opinion, Mr Russell did breach that duty of care, and the injury to Mr O'Toole resulted from that breach. 

45Turning to the question of whether NRMA is liable, because the case falls within the MAC Act , there is no question but that Mr Russell was the owner of the motor vehicle in question and that the injury to Mr O'Toole was a result of and was caused during the vehicle running out of control. The only question is whether Mr Russell's fault was ""in the use or operation of the vehicle"", so as to satisfy the definition of ""motor accident"" and the definition of ""injury"". 

46The definition of ""use or operation of a motor vehicle"" includes the maintenance or parking of the vehicle. Although the vehicle was parked at least half an hour before the fault occurred, the changed circumstances meant that the vehicle became inadequately parked, in the sense of being insufficiently held in its stopped position. In my opinion, this does mean that the fault was in the parking of the vehicle. Also, the arranging and preparing for the towing of the vehicle was part of a process of effecting the maintenance of the vehicle; and in my opinion the fault was also a fault in the maintenance of the vehicle. 

47It follows that NRMA's appeal against liability to Mr O'Toole should be dismissed. 

Apportionment 

48It was submitted for NRMA that the apportionment of responsibility of 70 per cent to Mr Russell and 30 per cent to Mr Cool was vitiated by the erroneous finding that Mr Russell was quite adept at mechanical matters; and in any event that it was appellably disproportionate, having regard to Mr Cool's expertise and his role in initiating the train of events without giving any warning. 

49It was submitted for Wagga Towing that the apportionment should not be altered in Mr Russell's favour. Mr Russell knew, as Mr Cool did not, that the vehicle was actually parked on a hill, described as quite a steep hill; and knew that the vehicle was not chocked. 

50In my opinion, the appropriate finding as to the slope where the vehicle was actually parked was that it was slight: it was stopped at the top of a slight to medium hill (shown in photographs in evidence) ""just as it started to go downhill"" (Combined Book 134M). In my opinion, there was error in the primary judge's giving weight to the consideration that Mr Russell was quite adept at mechanical matters, such as to justify this Court considering itself how responsibility should be apportioned. 

51I would not differentiate the degree of responsibility of Mr Cool from that of Mr Russell: Mr Cool was the expert who initiated the process without warning; while Mr Russell was on the site, knew of the slope and knew that the vehicle was not chocked, but still directed Mr O'Toole to undo bolts under the truck. I would adjust the apportionment to 50-50. 

Conclusion 

52Both appeals against liability to Mr O'Toole should be dismissed, and both appellants should pay Mr O'Toole's costs (apportioned 50-50 as between themselves). NRMA's appeal on apportionment should be allowed. I think this modest success in NRMA's appeal would justify an order that Wagga Towing pay one-third of NRMA's costs of both appeals. Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 

(1) Wagga Towing's appeal dismissed. 

(2) NRMA's appeal against Mr O'Toole dismissed. 

(3) NRMA's appeal against Wagga Towing allowed, and: 

(a) Decision to apportion responsibility 70 per cent to NRMA and 30 per cent to Wagga Towing and any consequential order set aside. 

(b) Declare that the liability be apportioned as to 50 per cent to NRMA and 50 per cent to Wagga Towing. 

(c) Liberty to either party to apply to the District Court for any appropriate consequential order.

		15 July 2011",2011-07-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2709452,R v Perish; R v Lawton; R v Perish [2011] NSWSC 1155,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: The members of the jury have asked for a copy of the transcript ""...of the opening statements of Crown and defence"". Counsel for the accused object to the jury's request being met. The Crown, on the other hand, submits that the material requested should be furnished to the jury. 

2Section 55C Jury Act 1977 provides: 

""A copy of all or any part of the transcript of evidence at a trial or inquest may, at the request of the jury, be supplied to the members of the jury if the judge or coroner considers that it is appropriate and practicable to do so."" 

3It is well established that the court has, apart from the operation of s 55C Jury Act , the discretionary power to make available to the jury a transcript of any part of the record of the proceedings that has been conducted before them. The discretion extends to opening addresses and opening statements: R v Taousanis [1999] NSWSC 107; (1999) 146 A Crim R 303, and to final addresses of the Crown and counsel for the accused: R v Bartle & Ors [2003] NSWCCA 329. 

4Ms Davenport SC, in opposing the grant of the jury's request, expressed a concern that the Crown's opening puts the Crown case at its highest. Ms Davenport submitted the jury might use the opening as being the truth of what was said to them. She pointed to the conflict between what was said by Mr Crown in his opening to be the reaction of Andrew Perish when shown the document, Exhibit H, and Mrs Falconer's evidence. Ms Davenport anticipated that there might be other aspects of the evidence, which might fall from a witness in a different way to that upon which the Crown opened. 

5Mr Hanley SC submitted that should the jury be provided with a copy of the opening addresses and statements, the jury should be informed of limits imposed by s 159 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 upon an opening statement made for an accused. 

6I am not persuaded that the jury will misuse the Crown's opening address. Prior to the opening address being delivered, the members of the jury were instructed as follows: 

""I will now ask Mr Crown to give an outline of the case the Crown anticipates establishing by the evidence. Mr Crown's opening is intended to assist you in understanding the evidence as it is produced. What Mr Crown will say to you is not evidence. It is no more than an outline of what the Crown expects the evidence will establish."" 

7There is nothing to suggest that the jurors will not accept and conform with these directions. The jury is well aware that the Crown's opening address is merely an outline of what the Crown expects or anticipates the evidence will establish and is not evidence. Should the evidence or part of the evidence fall short of that expectation the jury will have, by the provision of the transcript, an accurate and complete record as to the way in which the Crown's expectation was not fulfilled by the evidence given in the trial. To my mind, this is a consideration that could advantage the accused by the addresses of their counsel that are to come. 

8I also agree with the observations of Sperling J in R v Taousanis at 308 [21]: 

""If the purpose of providing a transcript of evidence is to remind the jury, accurately and in a complete way, of what was said in a part of the proceedings before them - as it is - consistency requires that the record of other parts of the proceedings conducted before the jury should also be provided, at request, for the same purpose."" 

9The members of the jury would be entitled to be perplexed if their request for the opening addresses and statement is denied whereas other requests are met. 

10I consider that it is appropriate and practical to meet the jury's request. 

11As to Mr Hanley's concern that the jury should be apprised of the limitations imposed upon defence opening addresses, the members of the jury have been informed that Ms Davenport's and Mr Hanley's openings were intended to assist them in understanding the issues in the trial. I will expand upon this explanation when copies of the transcript are given to the jury.

		08 March 2012",2011-07-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709456,R v McParland; R v Wingate (No 2) [2011] NSWDC 265,"Judgment

1Troy McParland and Luke Wingate have been jointly charged with the offence of aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence in company.  Briefly, the circumstances are that they were found by the police in the early hours of the morning near some equipment which had been recently stolen from a site in the vicinity of where they were found.  Each of them was arrested and interviewed.  Each of them gave an account of what they were doing at the scene at the time.  Those accounts, I accept, were inconsistent.
2Ms Healey of counsel who appears for Mr Wingate has applied for a separate trial on behalf of her client.  Her application, which was made by notice of motion, is supported an affidavit of Matteo Russoniello.  Ms Keay who appears for the co-accused Troy McParland supports the application of Luke Wingate.
3The application is made under s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).  I may make an order for a separate trial if I am of the opinion that it is desirable to direct that one accused be tried separately for the offences charged on the indictment.  
4The law regarding separate trials was set out in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Baartman (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 6 October 1994, unrep), which in turn applied the judgment of the then Chief Judge at Common Law, Hunt J in R v Middis (Supreme Court (NSW), 27 March 1991, unrep).
5Ms Healey argues that the different account given by Mr McParland and her client in the record of interview will mean that the jury will take into account impermissibly the inconsistencies in their accounts.  That is in admissible and prejudicial material.  She also argues that there were some items found in the car driven by Mr McParland which, she says, are not admissible against her client.
6Ms Keay in supporting the application argues that the inconsistent accounts given by both accused to the police will lead the jury inevitably to the conclusion that one of them is lying, that there is a real risk that the jury will act upon that conclusion and take those inconsistencies into account impermissibly.
7Ms Sullivan who appears for the prosecution claims that this is a classic case for a joint trial because a common purpose is alleged between the accused.  The law is that they should be tried jointly.  That is desirable as the High Court said in Webb and Hay v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41.  She argued that any impermissible prejudice can be fixed by directions from me.
8I do not propose to separate the trials.  I consider it desirable in a case such as this that there be a joint trial of the two accused.  There is a risk, as Ms Healey and Ms Keay say, that there is exposed to the jury impermissible and prejudicial material, namely the inconsistent accounts given by them and not admissible against the other.  However, the courts have long regarded juries as not only capable of taking into account directions given by trial judges, but as acting upon those directions.  It seems to me that the risk of prejudice in this case is more appropriately dealt with by very clear directions from me as to what may and may not be taken into account against the respective accused.
9There is no real risk, in my opinion, that the case against Mr Wingate will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material.  That is substantially because of the directions which I will give the jury.  
10For those reasons I propose to reject the application.

		06 February 2014",2011-07-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709459,R v McParland; R v Wingate [2011] NSWDC 264,"Judgment

1Troy McParland and Luke Wingate have been charged with aggravated break and enter commit serious indictable offence in company.  The case against them is largely circumstantial.  They have been listed for trial before me and a jury today.  
2Ms J E Healey of counsel and Ms N E Keay who appear respectively for Mr Wingate and Mr McParland have applied for a trial by judge order.  Effectively that means that the trial would be heard before me without a jury.  The application is made under s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).  That section says that I ""may make a trial by judge order"" if I consider ""it is in the interests of justice to do so"".  
3Ms Healey and Ms Keay rely on the fact that each of their respective clients gave a record of interview to the police after they were arrested.  They gave what are described as inconsistent accounts of where they had been and why they were in the car.  They had been detected at about 3.00am near the site of a break and enter.  Both point out, which of course is correct law, that the admissions made by their respective clients are admissible only against that client and not against the other accused.  There is a real risk, both of them say, that the jury may impermissibly take into account the fact of the inconsistencies in the explanations which each of them has given.  
4A second argument by Ms Healey specifically is that the case against her client is weaker than the case against Mr McParland because Mr McParland had a greater knowledge of the alleged victim of the break and enter than Mr Wingate did.  
5Both Ms Healey and Ms Keay argue that this is not a case which is provided for by s 132(5) which would ""involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards"".  
6Ms F M Sullivan who appears for the Crown agrees that the case does not appear to fall into the kinds of categories which that provision envisages.  Ms Healey argues that it is apparent from Mr Wingate's record of interview that he is intoxicated but that is not conceded by Ms Sullivan.  Mr Wingate also, Ms Healey argues, gives what she describes as an implausible account.  Specifically Mr Wingate gave some answers in his record of interview which explain why he was nervous and perspiring when he was arrested.  The answers involve him pointing out that he was trying to bring his life together after committing offences and being on a suspended sentence. There were also some gloves found which he said he used on work which he was doing under, by the sounds of it, a community service order.  
7Ms Sullivan did not oppose the leave which is required for me to make such an order because it has not been made within the time specified by s 132A of the Criminal Procedure Act.  However, she argues that any potential prejudice to other accused can be overcome by careful directions from me about what evidence the jury may take into account against the respective accused and what they may not take into account.  She points out that both men had a common explanation as to why they were where they were when the police stopped them.  She pointed out that the gloves can be explained by the work that Mr McParland was doing without referring to the community service order and that the nervousness or rather the explanation given by Mr McParland about his suspended sentence does not really prejudice him because in fact he was being pulled up by the police at 3.00am in the morning.  
8This is a discretionary decision by me.  Juries, the higher courts say, are able to make distinctions between what evidence is admissible against respective accused.  The assumption on which the justice system operates is in fact that they comply with directions.  I think that any potential prejudice would be overcome by clear directions from me about what evidence may be admissible against a respective accused and what is not.  
9Although the case may not involve what the statute describes as ""a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards"" it very much involves a question of why two men may be at a particular place in the early hours of the morning and the weighing up of their respective explanations against the circumstantial case presented by the Crown with the clear directions about what may or may not be taken into account.  On balance I propose to refuse the applications.

		06 February 2014",2011-07-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709485,STATE of NEW SOUTH WALES v SCERRI [2011] NSWSC 683,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: 
Nature of proceedings 
By summons filed 6 June 2011 the plaintiff, the State of New South Wales (NSW) seeks orders under the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (the Act) with respect to the defendant, Mark Anthony Scerri. The defendant is presently serving a sentence of imprisonment for 8 years, having been convicted in 2003 of the offence of sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to s61I of the Crimes Act 1900. The defendant was released on parole on 10 February 2011. The defendant's sentence and his parole order will expire on 11 September 2011. 

2The summons, as final relief, seeks the making of an extended supervision order under s9(1) of the Act. A preliminary hearing proceeded on 1 July 2011 under s7(3) of the Act. NSW seeks an order under s7(4) appointing psychiatrists to examine the defendant and requiring his attendance for that purpose. NSW does not seek an interim supervision order under s8 at this time. It is apparent that the defendant is presently subject to conditional liberty on a range of conditions as part of his parole. 

3In view of the material served by NSW for the purpose of the application, counsel for the defendant concedes, for the purpose of the preliminary hearing and on the basis of supporting documentation now before the Court, that the Court is likely to be satisfied of the threshold test that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a supervision order for the purpose of s7(4) of the Act. However, counsel makes no concession concerning the position of the defendant at a final hearing, particularly in relation to s9(2) of the Act. On the basis of this concession, the defendant does not oppose the Court making orders appointing two qualified psychiatrists to examine the defendant. The defendant, subject to his current supervision conditions, will comply with any direction to attend examinations. 

4Given the terms of s7(4) and (5) of the Act, however, it remains a matter for the Court to determine whether the statutory criteria have been satisfied. In this respect, I agree with the approach of Price J in Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Hayter [2007] NSWSC 983 at [4]. That process, however, is facilitated by the fact that there is no controversy between the parties to be resolved in this respect; rather, it remains for the Court to consider the supporting documentation tendered on the application and then apply the test under s7(4) of the Act. 

Evidence on application 

5NSW has read affidavits and tendered other documents in support of the application. The affidavits read are those of Narci Sutton, affirmed 17 June 2011, together with ""NS1"" to that affidavit, two affidavits of Ian Fraser, affirmed 9 June 2011 and 17 June 2011, together with three folders of documents which are exhibit ""IF1"" to the second affidavit of Mr Fraser. The defendant did not object to the tender of that material in the application under s7(4). 

Statutory test 

6The objects of the Act are set out in s3 which states, in summary, that the primary object of the Act is to provide for extended supervision and continuing detention of serious sex offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community. The further object of the Act is to encourage serious sex offenders to undertake rehabilitation. 

7On the present application by way of preliminary hearing, the Court must consider whether, for the purposes of s7(4), it is satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order with respect to the defendant. If so, the Court must make orders appointing psychiatrists or psychologists to undertake examinations. If, following the preliminary hearing, the Court was not satisfied in accordance with s7(4), the Court must dismiss the application: s7(5). Thus it falls to the Court to apply that test in the circumstances of this case. 

8In Attorney-General for the State of NSW v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119 at [98], the Court of Appeal emphasised that the task of the Court, at the preliminary hearing stage, was not to weigh up the documentation, or to predict the ultimate result or to consider what evidence the defendant might call at the final hearing. It has been said that the test to be applied at this stage is similar to the prima facie case test applied by Magistrates as part of committal proceedings: Attorney-General for the State of NSW v Hayter at [6]; State of NSW v Brookes [2008] NSWSC 150 at [13]. 

9One purpose of the preliminary hearing procedure is to allow the Court to filter out unmeritorious applications at an early stage. Another purpose is to give the Court the benefit of the expert opinions of two independent witnesses before making a final decision. 

10Section 9(2) provides that an extended supervision order may be made if, and only if, the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision. The application for final relief requires consideration of the factors contained in s9 of the Act. It is necessary, for the limited purposes presently required, to refer to s9 factors and their application to this defendant. 

11Section 9(2) in its present form is of recent origin. It was inserted into the Act with effect from 7 December 2010, replacing a formulation which used the words: ""Is likely to commit a further sex offence"". 

12Given that at this stage in the proceedings the Court is applying a test similar to the prima facie case test applied by Magistrates in committal proceedings, I am content to rely upon the interpretation of ""unacceptable risk"" set out by Davies J in State of New South Wales v Richardson (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 276 at [20] where his Honour said: 

""[30] ... 

[20] Whilst bearing in mind the second of those two objects, I would regard the test in s 9(2) as being satisfied if there is a risk that the person will commit a serious sex offence which is present to a sufficient degree so that the safety and protection of the community cannot be ensured unless an order is made."" 

I note that I applied that test in making a final order in State of New South Wales v Bastian [2011] NSWSC 641 at [72] - [73]. 

Statutory criteria 

13There are certain threshhold criteria which the plaintiff must satisfy. I am satisfied that the defendant falls within the definition of ""sex offender"" and that he is serving a relevant sentence for a ""serious sex offence"". I note, in this respect, the extended definition in s6(1)(a) which provides that the term ""current custody or supervision"" in the Act includes a person who is on release on parole whilst serving a sentence of imprisonment. The defendant is presently on parole as part of the sentence of imprisonment passed upon him on 12 September 2003. 

14The defendant has been on parole since 10 February 2011. The present application was commenced by NSW on 6 June 2011. NSW is prevented, by s6(2) of the Act, from making application under the Act until the last six months of the current custody or supervision of the relevant offender. Thus, although the present defendant has been at large in the community since 10 February 2011, albeit subject to a number of conditions, NSW was prevented from bringing this application until a date after 11 March 2011. 

15I am satisfied that the application is supported by documentation which meets the requirements of s6(3)(a) of the Act, in that the documentation addresses each of the matters referred to in s9(3). I am also satisfied that the documentation satisfies s6(3)(b) of the Act in that it includes reports from Dr Barbara Sinclair of 24 August 2010 and from Dr Jonathan Adams of 5 October 2010 (psychiatrists) and of Ms Narci Sutton of 21 March 2011 (psychologist) which assess the likelihood of the defendant committing a further serious sex offence. 

Section 9(3) criteria 

16I now consider the factors referred to in s9(3) of the Act, for the limited purpose required on a preliminary hearing. I refer to a number of these factors out of their statutory order. 

17Section 9(3)(h) requires the Court to consider the defendant's criminal history, including prior convictions and findings of guilt, in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history. The Court has been assisted by helpful written submissions provided by counsel for NSW which summarise material contained in the supporting documents with respect not only to the defendant's criminal history, but to other features which arise for consideration under s9. 

18The defendant was born in 1964 and is now aged 46. He has convictions for eight serious sexual offences committed on four separate occasions in June and September 1989 and May 2002. The sexual offences were committed against four separate victims. 

19On 12 September 2003 the defendant was sentenced by Phelan DCJ in the Wollongong District Court for the offence of sexual intercoruse without consent, being an offence contrary to s61I of the Crimes Act . The defendant pleaded guilty. The victim (JS) was a 26 year old male. The defendant committed the offence in Wollongong on 12 May 2002. In sentencing the defendant, Judge Phelan took into account a charge on a Form 1 of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to the victim. The defendant committed the sexual offence less than six months after having been released on parole in respect of a sentence imposed by Justice James in 1993 for one of the seven sexual offences that the defendant committed in 1989. 

20Judge Phelan noted that the index sexual offence was carried out in circumstances ""remarkably similar"" to the sexual offences carried out against the three separate male victims in 1989. 

21In his Remarks on Sentence Judge Phelan described the factual circumstances of the offence. At about 5am on Sunday, 12 May 2002 the 26 year old victim left licensed premises in the Wollongong CBD with the intention of either catching a taxi or train to his home. While walking along a street, the victim was grabbed from behind by the offender who placed a stranglehold on him. Eventually the victim was forced to the ground in an isolated grassed area. 

22The offender undid the victim's jeans and pushed them down to his knees. While the victim was continuing to struggle and yell for help, the offender punched him to the face before sucking his penis. The victim managed to reach for the offender's eyes which he gouged with both of his hands. The offender reacted to this by pulling hard on the victim's penis. The offender eventually let go of the victim and stood up holding his eyes. The victim ran away from the offender and went to the Wollongong Police Station. He was in a distressed state with an amount of blood on his clothing. Ambulance personnel were summoned and attended to his facial injuries. Apart from being emotionally traumatised, the victim suffered a broken nose, two black eyes, abrasions and tenderness about his body, was coughing blood and had trouble swallowing as a result of the offender holding him by the throat. 

23Judge Phelan sentenced the defendant to imprisonment for 8 years, commencing 12 September 2003 and expiring 11 September 2011 with a non-parole period of 6 years, commencing 12 September 2003 and expiring 11 September 2009. In sentencing the defendant, Judge Phelan had regard to a pscychiatric report dated 3 September 2003 from profession Greenberg, who diagnosed the defendant as having a chronic and severe paraphilic disorder, namely a sexual sadism disorder. 

24On 19 February 1993 the defendant was sentenced by Justice James in the Supreme Court in respect of seven sexual offences committed against three separate victims on different occasions in 1989. The defendant had been found guilty of the offences, following a trial before a jury. Justice James imposed an effective total sentence of 16 years imprisonment comprising a minimum term of 12 years with an additional term of 4 years. 

25Six of the counts on the indictment and in respect of which the defendant was convicted, charged an offence under s61D of the Crimes Act of sexual intercourse without consent. Another count was inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse, contrary to s61C of the Crimes Act and the other count was inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse, contrary to s61B of the Crimes Act . The defendant was 25 years old when he committed the 1989 offences. Each of the victims was a young adult male. In the hearing before James J, there was no issue that the offences had been committed, the only issue was the identification of the offender. 

26PSM, a 21 year old male, was one of the 1989 victims. On 11 June 1989 he was walking home in Wollongong. The defendant grabbed the victim from behind and committed two offences of sexual intercourse without consent. The sexual assaults comprised oral sexual intercourse and penile anal sexual intercourse. The sexual assaults were accompanied by threats by the defendant to kill the victim and members of his family. 

27The defendant grabbed PSM from behind and knocked him over a low boundary wall about a metre high running along the side of the street. The defendant then pushed PSM across part of a vacant property into a shed. Inside the shed, the defendant took PSM's pants down and made him lie on his stomach. The defendant rolled PSM onto his side and sucked his penis. The defendant then told PSM to turn towards the wall of the shed and having made threats to kill him and members of his family, had full anal sexual intercourse with him. The defendant told PSM to remain lying in the shed. Some hours passed before PSM reported the offence to the police, because he was terrified that the defendant might kill him or members of his family. It was common ground that PSM was physically very small and slender. 

28DWL, a 22 year old male, was another victim. On 25 June 1989 he was walking along the same street in Wollongong, having been out to a number of nightspots. The defendant tackled DWL from behind and hit him three or four times on the back of his head with a rock. The defendant pushed DWL in a westerly direction, past the shed in which he had assaulted PSM, and into a toilet block in a park. In a cubicle in the toilet block, the defendant told DWL to take his pants down and he then took DWL's penis in his mouth. The defendant then told DWL to get down on his knees and put his chest on the ground. The defendant then inserted his penis into DWL's anus and had anal sexual intercourse with him. DWL bled profusely while he was in the cubicle. When the defendant left, DWL was able to get a lift from a passing motorist who took him to hospital. 

29The third victim was a 29 year old male, AEC. On the night of 21 September 1989 AEC was one of a group of men celebrating the recent birth of a child. He had consumed a very large amount of alcohol and early in the morning of 22 September 1989 left a nightclub in Wollongong grossly intoxicated. The defendant and AEC left the nightclub together, but when they were next to a site on which a building had been demolished, the defendant punched him on the nose several times, breaking it. The defendant then hit AEC on the side and back of his head several times with a rock. The defendant removed AEC's pants and while he was on his hands and knees, he inserted his penis into AEC's anus and had anal sexual intercouse with him. He said to AEC ""Shutup or I will keep bashing you"". When the defendant left the area, AEC was disoriented and wandered about until he was able to get to the Wollongong Police Station a few hundred metres away. He was wearing a Tshirt which was covered in blood and he was naked from the waist down. He spent a week as a patient in the Wollongong Hospital and 40 stitches were inserted in wounds in his head. 

30On 28 June 1994 the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed an appeal by the defendant against the severity of the sentences imposed by James J. 

31As can be seen from the circumstances relating to all of the offences, a common scenario emerged. In that regard, Professor Greenberg in 2003 made the following observations in relation to the 1989 sexual offending: 

""He (the defendant) states that the modus operandi with all three victims was the same. They were all between the ages of 20 and 40. He would follow the victim from the hotel and subdue the victim with threats of intimidation and physical assault. He would then pull down their pants and perform fellatio on them. If they hadn't obtained an erection, he would humiliate them further and physically abuse them. He states that his abuse would sexually arouse him and he would rape the victim by anal penetration with his erect penis. He admits to inducing suffering and humiliating the victim and subjecting them to physical assault which sexually aroused him. He states he would then remove their wallets and pretend that he had noted their address. He would threaten the victims that if they reported the incident he would ""come and get them"". He denies he stole any wallets from the victims."" 


32Section 9(3)(h1) requires consideration of the views of the sentencing court in relation to the index offence. In his Remarks on Sentence, Judge Phelan referred to the remarkable similarity between the index sexual offence and the prior sexual offences for which the defendant convicted when sentenced in 1993. Judge Phelan also extensively referred to the report of Professor Greenberg and the diagnosis of paraphilia (sexual sadism) in respect of the defendant. He noted that the index offence was committed whilst the defendant was on parole, following his 1993 conviction. His Honour also noted the stated need for the defendant to again undertake the CUBIT program (Custody Based Intensive Treatment program). 

33In his Remarks on Sentence, Judge Phelan said: 

""The matters which render this particular charge serious refer specifically to the earlier charges of almost identical kind. Add to that the fact ... that he has undergone substantial rehabilitation but despite the clear warnings, particularly those related to alcohol, in the end result he ignored them to his own cost and that of the innocent victim. 

The offence was committed whilst on parole after he had spent a very long period in gaol."" 

34Section 9(3)(f) relates to the defendant's compliance with obligations while subject to parole. In relation to the 1989 offences, as has already been indicated, the defendant was released on parole on 24 November 2001 and committed the index sexual offence on 12 May 2002. On 16 October 2002 he was arrested and charged with the index sexual offence. Following the receipt of a breach of parole report, on 31 October 2002 the Parole Board ordered that the defendant's parole be revoked with effect 12 May 2002 for breach of parole condition number 3, i.e. unable to adapt to normal community life. 

35When he committed the index sexual offence in May 2002 the defendant had been attending FPS Psychological Maintenance Sessions on a weekly basis since November 2001. The fact that, in such circumstances, he nonetheless committed the offence was described in the CUBIT treatment report of 21 October 2010 as ""suggesting some difficulty being open with staff and working through any risk situations effectively"". 

36On 10 February 2011 the defendant was released on parole and taken to reside at Nunyara COSP Centre. He is being case managed and supervised by the Community Compliance and Monitoring Group (CCMG). As part of his parole conditions, the defendant is subject to electronic monitoring and scheduling obligations. 

37Section 9(3)(e) requires consideration be given to any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the defendant has had an opportunity to participate, his willingness to participate in such programs and the level of his participation in such programs. While incarcerated for the 1989 sexual offences, the defendant participated in the Sex Offender Psycho-Educational Group Program (SOPE) from 28 October 1999 to 23 December 1999 at the John Moroney Correctional Centre. The SOPE was described as an educational group which aims to assist offenders to overcome common misunderstandings about sexually abusive behaviour, to challenge their thinking errors and to motivate them to enter treatment. 

38The defendant received individual counselling sessions from Graham Rendell, psychologist, for approximately a year on a fortnightly basis at the John Moroney Correctional Centre prior to undertaking CUBIT for the first time. Mr Rendell described the defendant as having ""made significant gains in addressing those issues contributing to his offending"". 

39From 21 January 2001 until 2 November 2001 the defendant undertook the high intensity CUBIT program at the Long Bay Correctional Centre. The defendant's participation in CUBIT is detailed in the final treatment report dated 6 November 2001. The report spoke positively of the defendant's participation in the program. He completed the disclosure component of treatment ""satisfactorily""; his progress in the victim empathy section of treatment was ""pleasing"" and his written work (apology letters) reflected a genuine empathy for his victims. In addition, he satisfactorily completed the offence cycle component; and during treatment he developed a relapse prevention plan based on his risk factors that he identified when he completed his offence cycle. However, he failed to complete the sexual self-regulation component of the treatment. It was recommended that the defendant participate in the maintenance program, whether in custody or in the community. 

40Having regard to both static and dynamic risk factors, the Final Treatment Report (FTR) recorded the defendant's overall risk of sexual recidivism as being ""moderate"". 

41Following his release from custody on parole in November 2001, the defendant attended the Community Management Program on a weekly basis until his arrest, missing only three sessions (on each occasion phoning with a reason for his non-attendance). Mr Rendell was again the defendant's therapist. In a report dated 6 November 2002 Mr Rendell referred to the defendant's participation in the maintenance program in generally positive terms. 

42While subsequently incarcerated for the index sexual offence, the defendant again undertook the CUBIT program at the Long Bay Correctional Centre. Prior to undertaking the program, the defendant participated in the Custodial Maintenance program at Kirkconnell Correctional Centre. 

43The defendant participated in the CUBIT program (second time) from 23 April 2009 to March 2010. In the Treatment Report, dated 21 April 2010, Ms Senior reported that, overall, the defendant's participation within treatment groups was positive in terms of the contributions he made to discussions and the completion of task related work. However, a number of challenges were noted and it was recommended that the defendant participate in the Community Based Maintenance program until parole was granted and thereafter continue in the Community Based Maintenance program. In this respect, continued psychological work required with the defendant was identified as including: 


Working on modifying the ""all or nothing""/""black-white"" thinking and continue to challenge unhelpful or distorted thinking, tied to his offence. 

Modifying behaviour suggesting he is trying to impress others by addressing self-esteem. 

Increasing his ability to show care and concern for others and building positive relationships. 

Developing a clearer understanding of his offence process (offence cycle) to assist in further understanding the risk factors related to his offending and how to intervene and modify these. 

Exploring the defendant's victimisation of sexual abuse with an experienced psychologist trained in victim treatment. 

Continue developing intimacy skills. 

Continue to strengthen professional and personal support. 

Continue to address difficulties with sexual self-regulation as they arise. 

44The Treatment Report highlighted concerns about the defendant's ability to comply with supervision requirements. The report also stated that: 

""Mr Scerri has a tendency to behave in a compliant manner and can appear to be managing well even at times of extreme distress. This is easy to misinterpret. At such times, Mr Scerri appears able to detach from his emotional experience and suppress his needs and emotions. These needs then build up and are more explosively expressed at a later point."" 

45Following his completion of the CUBIT program in March 2010, the defendant attended Custodial Maintenance sessions until his release on parole in February 2011. The defendant commenced attending the Community Maintenance program at FPS on a weekly basis from 3 May 2011. 

46Sections 9(3)(c) and (i) require consideration of other psychiatric or psychological assessments of the defendants and any other information relevant to the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence and the willingness of the offender to participate in such assessments. 

47In a report dated 3 September 2003 Professor Greenberg diagnosed the defendant as having a sexually sadistic (paraphilic) disorder defined in DSM-IV, of a chronic and severe nature. 

48Professor Greenberg described the defendant's paraphilic disorder in the following terms: 

""This is a paraphillic (sexually deviant) disorder where the individual derives sexual excitement from the psychological or physical suffering of the victim. This usually includes the humiliation of the non-consenting victim. Sexually sadistic fantasies usually involve complete control over the victim who is terrified of the impending sadistic act. Although sexual masochism is commonly associated with this disorder, Mr Scerri denies any masochistic fantasies, sexual urges or sexual acts. His erotic sexual fantasies involve dominance of the victims. Mr Scerri denies any previous sexual fantasies, sexual urges or sexual acts involving sexual sadistic themes prior to the age of 24. However, most people with this diagnosis usually have sexually sadistic fantasies which begin during the teenage period. The onset of sexually sadistic acts is more variable but commonly in early adulthood as in the case of Mr Scerri. ... These sexual disorders are chronic and should be regarded as a severe disorder in view of his criminal sexual activity."" 

49In a report dated 24 August 2010 Dr Barbara Sinclair, psychiatrist, described the defendant as having a significant paraphilia. She said: 

""I believe Mr Scerri has a significant paraphilia which is currently suppressed in his controlled environment. I also consider he has a substance use disorder that is currently in remission. However, because I consider his risk of re-offending to be extremely high I think that a subsequent report will need to be done within six months by the Community Forensic Mental Health Service (CFMHS) or a forensic psychiatrist, specialising in sexual offending disorder."" 

50In a report dated 5 October 2010 Dr Adams, psychiatrist, recorded the defendant as denying having experienced any sexual fantasies of a homosexual or violent nature prior to these offences, and also denying any arousal related to violent acts or the humiliation of victims. However, Dr Adams noted that the defendant's account seemingly contradicted that recorded by Professor Greenberg in his report of September 2003 and also that contained in the CUBIT treatment report dated 21 April; 2011. The latter referred to the defendant's previous ""sexual fantasies involving sex with men and strong feelings of sexual arousal towards men"". 

51With regard to the defendant's ongoing treatment and noting the apparent contradictions referred to, Dr Adams said that it was paramount that additional assessment be targeted at the defendant's sexual thought processes and fantasies preceding his offending behaviour. 

52Section 9(3)(i) requires consideration of any other information relevant to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature. The defendant reported abusing alcohol at the age of 14. This included significant binge drinking and instances of blackouts. He also reported heavy drinking on the night of the index sexual offence and at the time of the earlier sexual offences. The defendant identified alcohol as the key factor in his sexual offending. Following his most recent release on parole, the defendant is reported to be voluntarily taking Antabuse, anti alcohol medication. The State Parole Authority made it a condition of the defendant's current parole that he not consume alcohol. 

53Section 9(3)(c) and (d) require consideration of reports and statistical and other assessments dealing with the likelihood of the defendant committing a further serious sex offence. Ms Narci Sutton, senior psychologist with Corrective Services NSW, carried out a psychological risk assessment for the purposes of a potential application under the Act. For this purpose Ms Sutton interviewed the defendant on 2 and 10 march 2011. She assessed the defendant's risk of sexual recidivism by reference to both Actuarial Risk Assessment (STATIC-99R) and dynamic risk factors. 

54Ms Sutton scored the defendant as a ""nine"" on the STATIC-99R, thus placing him in the high-risk category relative to other adult male sex offenders. Ms Sutton pointed out: 

""The rates of sexual recidivism for sexual offences within the normative samples who have the same total score as Mr Scerri were between 29.5 percent and 52.4 percent over 5 years and 53.1 percent and 61.9 percent over 10 years."" 

55In terms of relative risk, Ms Sutton said that in the STATIC-99R sample population, sexual offenders with a score of nine showed 6.48 times higher than the recidivism rate of a ""typical"" sexual offender. Ms Sutton acknowledged the inherent limitations of the STATIC-99R as a tool for predicting individual behaviour. 

56In relation to the dynamic risk factors, Ms Sutton utilised the Risk of Sexual Violence Protocol (RSVP) as a structural clinical tool to assist in the assessment of risk of sexual violence. Ms Sutton reported that the defendant exhibited relevant risk factors in all five domains of the RSVP. The relevant RSVP dynamic risk factors include the following: 


Chronicity of sexual violence. Ms Sutton said ""His sexual violent offending has involved multiple assaults over a relatively short time period and a new assault a short time (six months) after release from gaol."" 

Physical coercion: The defendant used violence in carrying out the sexual assaults. 

Problems with self-awareness: As evidenced by the defendant's confusion as to the dynamics of his offending behaviour. 

Problems with stress and coping: As illustrated by the dysfunctional coping strategies discussed in treatment and his use of alcohol to deal with stress. 

Problems resulting from child abuse: The defendant has been diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder associated with his reported experience of being abused by a paedophile ring when he was a child. 

Sexual deviance: As evidenced by the defendant's repeated offending behaviour. Ms Sutton stated that sexual deviance is strongly associated with sexual violence, although on its own may not be sufficient for the perpetuation of sexual violence. 

Problems with substance abuse. 

Problems with intimate relationships: As documented in the CUBIT treatment report. 

Problems with treatment while participating in treatment: Seemingly wholeheartedly the defendant had continuing difficulties in being able to gain a clear understanding of his offending process - being a specific area of treatment that impacts directly on his offence behaviour. 

Problems with planning: Poor self-management which is likely to lead to negative affectivity. 

Problems with supervision: As evidenced by the defendant's past relapse while on supervision. 

57In relation to the last mentioned RSVP factor, i.e. problems with supervision, Ms Sutton said: 

""Mr Scerri's relapse while on supervision indicates past problems in this area. I am aware that he is currently considered to be co-operative, even enthusiastically so, with his supervising officer. However, given this was also the case in the early stages of his parole order, just before he re-offended, it needs to be considered as a possible risk factor until better tested."" 

Ms Sutton reported that taken together, the risk factors of the RSVP suggest that the defendant still had a moderate to high level of risk for sexual re-offending with risk factors of each of the five sub-categories present. 

Conclusion 

58Having considered the factors applicable to this application under s9(3) of the Act, I express the conclusion that I am satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an Extended Supervision Order. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the order should be made for the appointment of psychiatrists to undertake examinations of the defendant so that this application may proceed to its next phase. 

59I make the following orders: 
(1) I order pursuant to s7(4) of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 that: 

(a) Dr Jeremy O'Dea and Dr Anthony Samuels be appointed to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the defendant and that reports be furnished to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations on or before 8 August 2011; and 

(b) I direct the defendant to attend those examinations. 

(2) I list the matter for further mention on 12 August 2011 before the Duty Judge. 

(3) I grant liberty to the parties to apply on 2 days' notice. 

(4) I direct that access to the Court file in respect of any document should not be granted without the leave of a Judge of the Court. If any application for access is made by a non-party in respect of any document, the parties are to be notified by the Registrar so as to be given the opportunity to be heard. 

(5) I fix the matter for hearing with an estimate of 2 days on 8 and 9 September 2011.

		08 July 2011",2011-07-06 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709493,Police v Ryan Benjamin CASTLE [2011] NSWLC 22,"JUDGMENT 

1The accused is charged with failing, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the direction of a police officer and with causing timber to be cut on Crown timber lands. Early in the prosecution case an objection was taken by the police prosecutor to a line of questioning which had been taken by the accused's solicitor. Because of the importance of the issues which were raised at that time, I gave a written judgement in which I indicated that I considered that the line of questioning was appropriate. Much of the contents of that judgement is repeated in this judgement. 

Background 

2At about 8am on 27 April 2010, Senior Constable Westaway attended Clarkes Road, Greendale, at the request of an officer of Forestry NSW. Clarkes Road is a minor road in the forests of southern New South Wales. The officer came across a group of people near a timber tripod which spanned the entire carriageway. The accused was on top of the tripod. He was asked if he realised that he was in a prohibited zone and that he was obstructing forestry personnel and contractors attending to their work. He replied ""yes"". He was told that if he remained in the tripod and disobeyed the officer's direction to come down he would be continuing to commit offences. The accused did not descend. Later in the day the accused was told by a police officer ""we'll come and get you down"". He said ""I don't want to"". At around 4.30pm two police officers used a cherry-picker machine to remove the accused from the tripod. The accused was arrested and was subsequently charged, among other things, with the offences that he: 




""did, without reasonable excuse, refuse or fail to comply with a direction given in accordance with Part 14"" (s 199(1), Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002) 




""did cause/knowingly suffer timber, to wit, three green saplings, to be cut/obtained/destroyed on Crown-timber lands, to wit, Mumbulla State Forest old growth forest"" (s 27(1)(a)(iii), Forestry Act 1916). 

3The tripod consisted of three logs which met at the apex of the tripod. The stumps of three small trees were located quite close to the tripod. The trees had been freshly cut and the logs which formed the tripod appeared to have come from the three small trees. The stumps were located on Crown timber land. 

Logging activities 

4Lee Blessington is a Team Leader employed by Forests NSW. He outlined the procedures relating to the harvesting of timber in State Forests. A harvest plan is prepared by a harvest planning forester, is reviewed by a harvest planning manager and is then considered by the regional manager. Logging cannot take place unless the plan is approved by the regional manager. One of the issues that must be considered during the process relates to heritage factors. As it turned out, the people who prepared and reviewed the harvesting plan which permitted the logging operation which was taking place on 27 April 2010 had failed to realise that the land upon which the logging was taking place had been gazetted in 1984 as an ""Aboriginal place"" (a formal phrase which is defined in the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974). Mr Blessington indicated at one stage in his evidence that, because of that failure, the logging operation was unlawful. He corrected that evidence indicating that he could not say if the logging was unlawful but it was certainly taking place on a gazetted Aboriginal place and that fact had not been mentioned in the harvest plan. 

5The logging operations had commenced in late March and continued (with a break at one stage) until about 4.30pm on 27 April. At that time Mr Blessington received a telephone call from the regional manager telling him to stop the operation as Forests NSW had realised the area of operations was an Aboriginal place. In June 2010, a letter of explanation and apology was written by the regional manager to the chairman of the Biamanga Board of Management. 

Evidence of the accused 

6The accused indicated that he had come down to the area about six weeks before his arrest. He was worried about the logging activities on Mumbulla Mountain. He believed that Mumbulla Mountain was a ""sacred"" mountain, that Forests NSW were not considering that fact and he decided he would protest. He left the area and returned on the Friday before his arrest. He knew that there had been blockades each day and he wanted to be involved in something that would have an impact upon the logging. He had made contact with other protestors and he understood that the area in which the logging was taking place had been gazetted as an ""aboriginal sacred place"". He was advised that approaches had been made to Forests NSW and to the Environment Department to have the logging stopped but got the impression that things had stalled. He went to the logging compartment over the weekend to see for himself what was happening. He decided that he would try to prevent the logging from continuing. He was ""was prepared to break the law to prevent a serious crime from being committed"". 

7The construction of a tripod had been discussed by protestors on the Sunday. The accused went to Clarkes Road on the Monday morning, arriving before first light. There were some logs on the road. The accused did not know where the logs had come from. Other people constructed a tripod using those logs. The accused volunteered to sit on the tripod. 

Other evidence 

8There was evidence that there had been protests against the logging operation on a number of days prior to 27 April. Protestors had claimed that the area in which the logging was taking place was an Aboriginal place and there had been some correspondence with government authorities in relation to that fact. 

Conclusion as to the charge under the Forestry Act 

9This matter is quite straightforward. It is, in general, an offence to cut down trees in State forests. The prosecution submits that as the accused was complicit in the planning and execution of the enterprise of using the tripod, he is therefore responsible for the cutting down of the trees which formed the tripod and it is clear that those trees were on Crown timber land. The defence submits that guilt can be established only if I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused either cut down the trees himself or was a member of an enterprise which contemplated the use of trees situated on Crown timber land. I accept the thrust of the defence submission. There is no evidence that the accused cut down the trees and there is no evidence to indicate that he had planned with others a course of conduct which involved the taking of logs in Crown timber lands. I cannot reject his evidence that he had no knowledge of the source of the logs which were used to construct the tripod. That charge will therefore be dismissed. 

Conclusion as the charge under s 199(1) Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 

10The powers of a police officer to give a direction to a person in a public place are found in Part 14 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act . Some of the legislation is as follows: 

197 Directions generally relating to public places 
(1) A police officer may give a direction to a person in a public place if the police officer believes on reasonable grounds that the person's behaviour or presence in the place (referred to in this Part as "" relevant conduct "" ): 

(a) is obstructing another person or persons or traffic, or 
(b) constitutes harassment or intimidation of another person or persons, or 
(c) is causing or likely to cause fear to another person or persons, so long as the relevant conduct would be such as to cause fear to a person of reasonable firmness, or 
(d) is for the purpose of unlawfully supplying, or intending to unlawfully supply, or soliciting another person or persons to unlawfully supply, any prohibited drug, or 
(e) is for the purpose of obtaining, procuring or purchasing any prohibited drug that it would be unlawful for the person to possess. 
(2) A direction given by a police officer under this section must be reasonable in the circumstances for the purpose of: 

(a) reducing or eliminating the obstruction, harassment, intimidation or fear, or 
(b) stopping the supply, or soliciting to supply, of the prohibited drug, or 
(c) stopping the obtaining, procuring or purchasing of the prohibited drug. 
(3) The other person or persons referred to in subsection (1) need not be in the public place but must be near that place at the time the relevant conduct is being engaged in. 
(4) For the purposes of subsection (1) (c), no person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene. 

199 Failure to comply with direction 
(1) A person must not, without reasonable excuse, refuse or fail to comply with a direction given in accordance with this Part. 
Maximum penalty: 2 penalty units. 
(2) A person is not guilty of an offence under this section unless it is established that the person persisted, after the direction concerned was given, to engage in the relevant conduct or any other relevant conduct. 

200 Limitation on exercise of police powers 
This Part does not authorise a police officer to give directions in relation to: 
(a) an industrial dispute, or 
(b) an apparently genuine demonstration or protest, or 
(c) a procession, or 
(d) an organised assembly. 

11The evidence establishes (and it is not contested) that the accused was sitting on top of a tripod, the tripod was blocking the free flow of traffic, the accused was given a direction to come down from the tripod and he failed to comply with that direction. 

12It is the prosecution submission that the elements of the offence are made out and the accused had no reasonable excuse for failing to comply with the direction. It is the defence submission that the direction was not one which could be given under the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act because the accused was involved in an apparently genuine demonstration or protest but, even if that submission is rejected, he had a reasonable excuse for his failure to comply. 

13Was the direction one which was authorised by the legislation?: the defence submission is as follows. Section 200 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act places limits upon the power of a police officer to give a direction, s 200(b) stating that an officer has no authority to give a direction in relation to an apparently genuine demonstration or protest. There is no doubt that a demonstration or protest was taking place on Clarkes Road on 27 April 2010. Sgt Abbott referred in his statement to the presence of ""about ten logging protestors and their vehicles"". Snr Const Westaway referred to ""Lisa Stone, a protestor"". Const Quick referred to the fact that he had been advised by a superior ""to attend Clarke Road Greendale which is situated in the Mumbulla State Forest and help with protestors, one in particular who was sitting in a tripod 12 to 16 feet off the ground"". Const Hancock referred to ""the protest site"". Retired Inspector Megay referred in his evidence to ""a number of people around those vehicles and a number of signs protesting against the timber harvesting"". Although no evidence has been given by any of those persons, it is reasonable to conclude that the demonstration or protest was apparently genuine. The accused told Snr Const Westaway that he did not want to answer ""legal questions"" but he has given evidence that he was concerned about the logging operation and it was his intention to have an adverse impact upon the operation. He was, therefore, a part of the demonstration or protest. I am of the opinion that, in such circumstances, the direction given by Snr Const Westaway was not a direction authorised by the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act and the accused cannot therefore be convicted of failing to comply with it. 

14Reasonable excuse: having reached the conclusion which is outlined in the prior paragraph, it is not necessary for me to consider this issue as the charge must be dismissed for the reasons set out in that paragraph. As the issue is, however, one which was the subject of a lot of debate during the hearing, I will now address it. 

15It is convenient to indicate at the outset that a person is not entitled to take the law into his or her own hands. If I see a car which is illegally parked I would not be entitled as a private citizen to move that car. There are, however, circumstances in which a private citizen may justifiably do something which, in the absence of those circumstances, would be a crime. 

16Some, but not all, of those circumstances are as follows: 



a person is entitled to use force to defend himself or herself (there are some limitations upon the force which may be lawfully used depending upon the circumstances but I am stating the principle of self defence in a general way) 

a person is entitled to use force to arrest a person who is committing a crime (a ""citizen's arrest"") 

a person is entitled to use force against someone trespassing upon the person's property 

a person is entitled to break the window of a house which is on fire in order to attempt to rescue a person or property inside the house 

a person is justified in committing a crime, e.g. a theft, if under some form of dire threat, e.g. ""if you do not go and steal those jewels I will shoot your spouse"" (duress). 

a person is justified in committing a crime in circumstances of necessity (e.g. speeding to take an injured person to hospital). 

17There are, as previously indicated, limitations upon what a person can do when embarking upon actions which otherwise would be a crime. In almost all of these situations the person's action must be reasonable. For example, a person who was being stabbed by another might be entitled to hit that other on the head with a hammer in self defence; a person who was being poked in the chest by the finger of another who was engaging in a nasty argument would be entitled to push that other person away in self defence but would not be entitled to hit that other person on the head with a hammer. In almost all of these situations the accused must raise the issue (there is said to be an ""evidentiary onus"" upon the accused). If a person, for example, commits what otherwise would be a crime because he or she is under duress, it is the obligation of the accused to raise that issue - once raised, it must then be negatived beyond reasonable doubt if there is to be a conviction. If the issue is not raised then it obviously cannot and does not need to be addressed. In almost all of these situations the concern of the person must relate to something which is imminent. If a person applies violence to someone assaulting the person's spouse, for example, such use of violence may well be justifiable; if, on the other hand, the person applied violence to someone whom the person believed was going to assault the person's spouse tomorrow, such use of violence would almost certainly be unjustifiable. 

18There is quite a number of authorities relating to the concepts of lawful and reasonable excuse. I consider, however, that cases which involve an element of protest activity are the most helpful when dealing with this issue. The cases include: 

19R v Bacon & ors [1977] 2 NSWLR 507: the accused in that case had remained in buildings at Victoria Street, Darlinghurst. The buildings were due to be demolished and the area re-developed. The accused were concerned for the rights of the few people who were still resident in the buildings and were concerned about the methods being used by the owner to oust those residents. The accused therefore decided to ""squat"" in the buildings. They were convicted of trespass and the matter came before the Court of Criminal Appeal. Although the appeals were (in all but one case) dismissed, the court held that the genuine beliefs of the accused were matters relevant to be considered on the issue of ""without reasonable cause"". 

20Devlin v Armstrong [1971] NILR 13: the accused in that case was Bernadette Devlin who was at the time a Member of the House of Commons. She was one of a number of people who had built a barricade in order to keep police officers from entering Bogside, an area in Londonderry in Northern Ireland. She did so because she maintained that, had the officers entered that area, they would have assaulted people and would have unlawfully damaged property. She was convicted of various offences and appealed to the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal. There was a suggestion from the court that a citizen might have the right to take action which would otherwise be criminal in some circumstances. The court referred to a comment by Lord Mansfield in a case from 1779 in which he said "" you may suppose a possible case, but ... it must be imminent, extreme, necessity; there must be no other remedy to apply to for redress; it must be very imminent, it must be very extreme ...."" The court in 1971 said "" it is one thing to act for the best in some case of extreme necessity, where the forces of law and order are absent .... It is quite another to fight against and seek to expel a lawfully constituted constabulary while acting as such in the execution of its proper functions "". 

21Darcey v Pre-Term Foundation Clinic [1983] 2 NSWLR 497: the accused in that case had been charged with trespass. He was found on the premises of a clinic in which he believed unlawful abortions were being carried out. He refused to leave when directed to leave. His motive for being on the premises was to collect evidence. Hunt J indicated that the appellant had no right to enter or remain on the premises for that purpose but suggested that a person might have the right to enter or remain on the premises "" to prevent the commission of a felony "". 

22R v Hewke & ors (unrep., Maidstone Crown Court, 8/9/08 per Caddick J): the accused in that case were Greenpeace protestors who had entered a power station in Kent because of their belief that the station was emitting carbon dioxide at a rate which was endangering the environment. They committed some damage while in the power station, mostly by painting political slogans on parts of the power station. Caddick J was the trial judge. His Honour made the following comments in his summing-up: 

""in this country we have a long and honourable history of not just free speech but accommodating protests and demonstrations by those who, on conscientious grounds, wish to affirm and draw attention to their belief in a cause ... This is so even though such protests may involve considerable nuisance and inconvenience to other citizens, but it does not extend to breaking the law. So if the defendant goes over the permissible line, then he is still guilty of the relevant criminal offence, conscientious protestor or not"". 

Caddick J indicated that, for a defence to be available, the accused would need to hold an opinion that what he or she was doing was necessary to provide the environment with immediate protection and that the opinion was, in the circumstances, reasonable. 

23Taikato v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 454: the accused in that case had carried a pressurised canister of formaldehyde in her handbag. She carried the canister in order to defend herself if someone attacked her. A person possessing such an item was guilty of a crime unless the person satisfied the court that the person had a reasonable excuse for possessing it or possessed it for a lawful purpose. The majority held that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for the possession nor did she carry the item for a lawful purpose because the existence of a right to self defence cannot be determined until after the fact of a particular attack or threatened attack and there was no attack or threat of attack when the accused was carrying the canister. 

24DPP v Wille & Others (1999) 47 NSWLR 255: in that case the accused had entered a work site relating to the construction of Sydney's Eastern Distributor and had chained themselves to a crane. They had done so because they wished to protest against the construction of the road and in particular the fact that it involved the destruction of trees in Moore Park and a loss of part of the park for public recreational purposes. In holding that the accused had not acted lawfully, Kirby J. said: 

""entry to the premises by these defendants was not necessary to accomplish their purpose. Their purpose was to show their opposition to the proposed road. They could have protested outside the perimeter fence. Such a protest may not have been as dramatic, but that cannot matter. Were it otherwise, a person could invade another's property because their purpose might be better accomplished in that location rather than elsewhere. Upon that basis someone would be entitled to enter inclosed land, publicly or privately held, to sunbathe, or hold a dinner party, because they preferred that location to another area, not enclosed. 
 
... the person who entered the land, in each of the cases referred to, did not have a criminal purpose. That, however, is not determinative, although it is relevant. Effecting entry itself may involve a crime (such as malicious damage to the fence). It would obviously be relevant for the prosecution to prove that the defendants had committed a crime in gaining entry, or intended to commit a crime once on the premises. In either case, and certainly in the latter case, it is difficult to see how a person who entered in such circumstances could assert that they had a lawful excuse. It is possible, perhaps, to imagine circumstances of necessity where beyond the fence there is a person in distress, such that damage to the fence, and entry, is necessary to alleviate that distress. Damage to the fence in such circumstances would not be malicious. Such person, in any event, would have lawful excuse for entry (cf the defence of necessity)"" 

25The logging operation which is the subject of the current case had been approved and undertaken on a flawed basis as the National Parks and Wildlife Act imposes certain restrictions upon activities which may be undertaken in Aboriginal places. The accused suspected that the logging operation was unlawful and his action in sitting upon the tripod was intended to impede the operation. The operation was taking place when he was on the tripod. Earlier in this judgement I quoted the words of Lord Mansfield who said in 1779: 

""...you may suppose a possible case, but ... it must be imminent, extreme, necessity; there must be no other remedy to apply to for redress; it must be very imminent, it must be very extreme ...."" 

and the words of the Northern Ireland Supreme Court in 1971 which said: 

""it is one thing to act for the best in some case of extreme necessity, where the forces of law and order are absent .... It is quite another to fight against and seek to expel a lawfully constituted constabulary while acting as such in the execution of its proper functions"". 

It would, in most circumstances, be unreasonable to erect and mount a tripod and fail to comply with the direction of a police officer on the basis that it was necessary to remain on the tripod to prevent an unlawful action from taking place. Law enforcement is, in essence, a matter for police and/or other properly accredited and authorised persons and if those persons are present or can easily be called it would ordinarily be unreasonable for a person to take action to stop the activity. The legality of matters relating to logging in State Forests is obviously a complex issue. It would, in my opinion, be reasonable for a police officer to accept the proposition that, if a Forests NSW representative was indicating directly or by inference that a logging operation was lawful, the operation was indeed lawful and had been properly approved. In the present case there is evidence that the proper authorities had been alerted to the questionable legality of the logging operation but the operation was continuing. The fact is that shortly after the accused's arrest the operation was halted. Under such circumstances, I accept that the accused's action was reasonable and he therefore had a reasonable excuse for doing what he did.

		10 August 2011",2011-07-07 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2709508,Hawkins v R [2011] NSWCCA 153,"Judgment 

1ALLSOP P : I have had the advantage of reading the reasons to be delivered of Hidden J. I agree with them and in the orders he proposes. 

2I would only add the following by way of elaboration only. In my view, the clear likelihood is that the sentencing judge, to a degree misled (no doubt unintentionally) about the timeliness of the applicant's plea in the Local Court, failed to have regard to the true history of the matter in that court. As to ""tinkering"", this was not an appeal based on alleged overall severity. The precise terms of the sentencing judge's views were clear and subject to a discount. Her Honour erred in relation to that discount. Though the change suggested is modest, it flows from the recognition of a discernible and discrete error. In all likelihood, error caused a sentence to be imposed in the order of three months longer than would have been imposed had the error not been made. In particular in the circumstances of the history of mental illness of the applicant, such a period is not to be considered minor or inconsequential or the product of ""tinkering"". 

3HIDDEN J: The applicant, David Ronald Hawkins, pleaded guilty in the District Court to the following charges: 

(1) detaining for advantage in circumstances of aggravation, being actual bodily harm, an offence under s 86(2)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment; 

(2) attempting to administer poison with intent to cause distress, an offence under s 41 of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 5 years. 

4On the first charge he was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years, comprising a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance of term of 2 years, commencing on the date of his arrest, 12 April 2008. On the second charge he was sentenced to a concurrent term of imprisonment for 12 months. He seeks leave to appeal against the sentence on the first charge. 

5The only ground of the application relates to the discount which the sentencing judge allowed for the applicant's pleas of guilty. That being so, it is unnecessary to recite in any detail the disturbing facts of these offences. It is sufficient to say that the victim of both of them was a young woman who had been the applicant's partner for about 2 years. He had a long history of mental illness, they both used illicit drugs, and the relationship had been a volatile one. From the afternoon of 10 April 2008 until the morning of 12 April, he detained her in the home unit where they lived. He entertained a delusional belief that she was being unfaithful to him. Over that period he threatened and assaulted her, in bizarre and frightening ways, on a number of occasions. On one occasion he threatened her with a syringe filled with a dry cleaning fluid, Murlex. He pricked her on the back and arms several times with that syringe. 

6She escaped early on 12 April 2008 by smashing a bedroom window and jumping out. She sought help from a neighbour, the police were called, and the applicant was arrested that day. 

7The first charge, detaining for advantage in circumstances of aggravation, was constituted by her detention over that period and the various assaults which caused her physical injury. His pricking her on the back and arms with the syringe containing the dry cleaning fluid gave rise to the second charge, attempting to administer poison with intent to cause distress. The judge fairly described the offences as ""a terrifying and protracted ordeal"" for the victim. 

8There is also no need to recite in detail the applicant's background, which itself is disturbing. Her Honour described his upbringing as ""dreadful."" He suffered mental illness from an early age, and abused alcohol and a variety of illicit drugs. The effect of the reports of two forensic psychiatrists is that he has suffered from schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, exacerbated by his consumption of alcohol and drugs. He was 26 years old at the time of the offences, and is now 29. He had no criminal history of any significance. 

9Her Honour found that his mental illness contributed materially to his criminal behaviour. She also found that he had benefited from treatment and abstinence from alcohol and drugs during his period in custody and, while he continued to exhibit some psychotic symptoms, he had come to appreciate the seriousness of his mental illness and to recognise that it was exacerbated by drug and alcohol abuse. She found special circumstances justifying a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. 

The application 

10Her Honour allowed a discount of 20% for the utilitarian value of the applicant's pleas of guilty. The ground of the application is that it should have been 25%, the maximum for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty envisaged in R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. To understand the argument, it is necessary to examine the procedural history of the matter. 

11As I have said, the applicant was arrested on 12 April 2008 and remained in custody thereafter. He was observed to be mentally ill and on 14 April police took him to Manly Hospital. He was discharged the same day and returned to prison. On the next day, 15 April, he was charged with: 

(1) detaining for advantage in circumstances of aggravation (s 86(2)(b) of the Crimes Act ); 

(2) assault occasioning actual bodily harm (s 59(1) of the Crimes Act ); 

(3) administering an intoxicating substance with intent (s 38(a) of the Crimes Act ); 

(4) sexual intercourse without consent (s 61I of the Crimes Act ); 

(5) administering poison with intent (s 41 of the Crimes Act ). 

12On a number of occasions between then and November 2008, he exhibited psychotic symptoms and was examined by psychiatrists, who prescribed medication. At the end of September 2008, his solicitor initiated negotiations with the Crown about pleas of guilty to a reduced number of charges. It was proposed that he plead guilty to the first charge, aggravated detaining for advantage and the fifth charge, administering poison with intent, and that the remaining charges not be pursued. The Crown accepted that offer, and on 13 November 2008 he was committed to the District Court for sentence on those two charges only. 

13In preparation for the sentence proceedings, his solicitors obtained a psychiatric report from Dr Stephen Allnutt. The sentence hearing was listed for 9 October 2009. However, on that day Dr Allnutt assessed him in the cells and noted some symptoms of mental illness. During that consultation, he told Dr Allnutt that when he was arrested he wanted to plead not guilty but decided to plead guilty in the expectation of a 25% discount of sentence. Dr Allnutt explained to him the defence of mental illness, and observed him to become ""very ambivalent"" about his decision to plead guilty. In the light of that ambivalence and those psychotic symptoms, the doctor questioned whether he was fit to plead. 

14Accordingly, the proceedings were adjourned that day. Further reports were obtained from Dr Allnutt and, for the Crown, from Dr Samson Roberts. On 31 May 2010, a fitness inquiry was conducted before the Chief Judge, Blanch J. Supported by the psychiatric evidence as it then stood, his Honour found the applicant fit to plead (although apparently only ""just"" so). 

15In the meantime, the Crown had changed its position about the appropriate charges. It became necessary in the District Court to present an indictment because there was a procedural defect in the committal document. A fresh indictment was prepared containing three counts, aggravated detaining for advantage, attempting to administer poison with intent and aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. The first two charges were the committal charges, except that the second charge was not administering poison with intent but attempting to do so. For present purposes, nothing turns on that difference. 

16Following further discussions between the applicant's solicitor and the Crown, it was agreed that the charge of aggravated sexual assault would not be proceeded with if he pleaded guilty to the other two charges. That is what happened when the matter came back before Blanch J on 4 June 2010. Accordingly, the position following the applicant's committal for sentence was restored. There were two related charges on a certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which were also not proceeded with. 

17The matter did not proceed to hearing on 4 June, and it came before the sentencing judge on 30 July 2010. Both the Crown and the applicant were represented by counsel other than those who appeared in this Court. On that day, the Crown prosecutor sketched the procedural history of the matter in the Local Court and the District Court. She started by recording that the applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court, but not until after several months had elapsed during which there were several adjournments. Asked by her Honour whether the pleas qualified as having been entered at the earliest opportunity, the Crown prosecutor submitted that it was not the earliest and that they should entitle the applicant to a discount in the order of 20% rather than 25%. Counsel then appearing for the applicant made no comment at that point, and he put no submission about the appropriate discount at any stage of the proceedings. 

18In her remarks on sentence her Honour made no reference to the pleas of guilty entered in the Local Court. In allowing the 20% discount, she said no more than that the applicant had entered an early plea of guilty immediately after the issue of his fitness to plead was resolved. 

19Counsel for the applicant in this Court, Mr Carroll, submitted that he was entitled to a discount of 25%. He noted that the pleas of guilty entered in the District Court on 4 June 2010 were, effectively, the same as those which he had entered in the Local Court on 30 November 2008. Accordingly, he argued, they should have been treated as having been entered in the Local Court, a fact which her Honour appeared to have overlooked. What her Honour's remarks convey, Mr Carroll submitted, is that she mistakenly treated them as having been entered for the first time in the District Court after the issue of fitness to plead had been resolved, and her discretion in assessing the discount for their utilitarian value thereby miscarried. 

20Insofar as there was delay between the applicant being charged and his pleading guilty in the Local Court, Mr Carroll noted that for much of that period he was being treated for his mental illness and, no doubt, was not in a position to make an informed decision about how to plead. For him, Mr Carroll submitted, the earliest opportunity to enter a plea was the time at which his mental illness was sufficiently resolved to be able to do so. The delay in the progress of the matter in the District Court, he added, was also attributable to the applicant's mental illness and the need to determine his fitness to plead. 

21Reference was made to the remarks on sentence of Whealy J in R v Sharrouf [2009] NSWSC 1002. In that case the offender suffered from chronic mental illness. He was arrested in November 2005 for offences of a terrorist nature under Pt 5.3 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995, was committed for trial in the Supreme Court at the end of April 2007, was found unfit to be tried in mid 2008, after treatment in custody was found fit to be tried in early 2009, and pleaded guilty to the offence for which he stood for sentence early in August 2009. The charge to which he pleaded guilty followed negotiations between his representatives and the Crown. Although he was being sentenced for a Commonwealth offence, Whealy J decided to quantify the discount he would allow for the plea of guilty. He specified a discount of 25%, noting that it was common ground between the Crown and the offender's counsel that the plea was entered at the first available opportunity. His Honour added, ""In view of the offender's mental illness at the time of his arrest and during the following years, that must be so"": [67]. 

22Howie J adopted a similar approach in his remarks on sentence in R v Zeilaa [2009] NSWSC 532. That offender was committed for trial for the murder of his wife. He suffered from a mental illness. A question arose as to his fitness to plead but, upon a trial of that issue, his Honour found that he was. He was then arraigned for murder, but the Crown accepted his plea of guilty to manslaughter in discharge of the indictment on the basis of substantial impairment. His Honour noted that the offender had always acknowledged criminal responsibility for the death of his wife, and that a plea of guilty to manslaughter had been foreshadowed before he was committed for trial. He found that, in the circumstances, the plea was entered at the first reasonable opportunity and allowed a discount of 25%. In this case also, the Crown prosecutor had conceded that that was the appropriate course. 

23At [17] and [18] of the remarks, Howie J said: 

""17 The offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter when first arraigned. The arraignment was deferred because of genuine questions raised about the offender's fitness to plead. It was not until that issue could be determined, through evidence given at a hearing, that any question of the nature of his plea could realistically be considered. 

... 

18 A plea of guilty at arraignment will not normally result in the maximum discount for the utilitarian value of the plea: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102. The Court of Criminal Appeal has expressed the view that a delay in the plea will usually impact upon its utilitarian value whatever the reason for the delay: Tazelaar v R [2009] NSWCCA 119. But the amount to be awarded by way of discount is discretionary and it is accepted that there can be unusual situations where fairness may impact upon the determination of the appropriate discount."" 

24The Crown prosecutor in this Court emphasised that the assessment of the discount for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty is discretionary, and submitted that it was open to her Honour to arrive at the discount she did. He noted that, while her Honour did not refer to the pleas of guilty entered in the Local Court, she was told by the prosecutor that that is what had happened and could not have been unmindful of it. He argued that her Honour should be seen as having arrived at the discount of 20% after consideration of all the circumstances, and that she did not merely adopt the unchallenged figure contended for by the prosecutor. He noted that the psychiatric material conveys that the applicant was in two minds about whether to maintain his pleas of guilty in the Local Court, and that he gained a forensic advantage by ultimately pleading guilty to the present two charges because other charges which might have been available were not proceeded with. 

25Of course, the assessment of a discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty is discretionary and depends upon the circumstances of the case at hand. However, in my view, the fact that the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court, and effectively to the same two charges for which he was dealt with in the District Court, was an important matter in determining the appropriate discount. I think it likely that her Honour overlooked it. She reserved judgment at the end of the sentence proceedings and passed sentence two weeks later. However that may be, I am satisfied that in arriving at the discount she did her Honour failed to have regard to that relevant matter. Accordingly, her discretion miscarried and it falls to this Court to determine whether some other sentence should be passed. 

26In my view, the Court should intervene and re-sentence the applicant. The delay in the entry of the pleas of guilty both in the Local Court and again in the District Court can fairly be attributed to his mental illness. I do not consider that the utilitarian value of those pleas is reduced by the fact that they were the subject of negotiation whereby other charges were not pursued. That was also the case in both Sharrouf and Zeilaa . As in those cases, the charges to which the applicant pleaded guilty were appropriate to reflect his criminality. 

27Mr Carroll calculated the figures which would be produced if the 25% discount were applied to both the head sentence and the non-parole period which her Honour imposed. The head sentence would be reduced from 5 years to a little under 5 years and 2 months, and the non-parole period from 3 years to a little over 3 years and 3 months. Given that this Court must re-sentence in the exercise of its own discretion, it is not necessary to approach the matter in a mathematical way. What those figures demonstrate, however, is that to allow the additional 5% discount would lead to no more than a modest adjustment of her Honour's sentence. The question arises whether such an adjustment would amount to no more than tinkering. However, the Crown prosecutor in this Court, fairly, did not submit that it would. The reduction of sentence which I propose, though modest, is not insignificant. 

28Rounding off the figures, I think that the appropriate sentence is imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months. 

29Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. On the charge of detaining for advantage in circumstances of aggravation, I would quash the sentence passed in the District Court and, in lieu, I would sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months, commencing on 12 April 2008 and expiring on 11 July 2011, and a balance of term of 1 year and 9 months, commencing on 12 July 2011 and expiring on 11 April 2013. 

30HALL J: I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by Hidden J.

		19 August 2011",2011-07-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2709509,R v Scott GOLDING [2011] NSWDC 104,"SENTENCE 


1. Scott Golding has been drunk and committed crimes before. I am sentencing him for a very serious crime which he committed whilst he was drunk. It resulted in a teenager having to be taken to hospital for emergency surgery because of a stab wound inflicted by Mr Golding. 

2. Mr Golding has been charged with the offence of reckless wounding. He has pleaded guilty to that offence at the earliest available opportunity. The offence is made a crime by s 35(4) of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament has fixed a maximum of seven years imprisonment to the crime. Parliament regards it as so serious that it has also fixed a standard non-parole period of three years to the crime. 

3. When I am sentencing Mr Golding for the crime, he has asked me to take into account another offence of common assault committed on the same occasion. I will take that into account when I am sentencing him and I sign a form comprising that additional charge, provided under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

4. It is important for a judge in sentencing a person to briefly describe what happened so that the basis of the sentence can be understood. Mr Golding, who is now thirty-four, was working on fishing boats in the Northern Territory. He came to Sydney on 11 January last year on a break from work and in order to stay at a friend's house in Surry Hills. 

5. Mr Stewart of counsel called his client to give evidence. Mr Golding described how he had been drinking before he left Darwin and on the plane flight to Sydney, so that when he got off the plane he was, as he described, "" blind drunk "". He got to his friend's place in Surry Hills and started drinking again straight away. They and others were drinking all day. 

6. There was a young woman who lived at the same place who was in the group. Some sort of argument developed and the young woman left. 

7. But the young woman came back with a group of men who appeared at the front gate of where Mr Golding was staying and drinking. One of the men who had turned up said that he wanted to "" confront "" the people in the house about what had happened. A couple of people from inside went outside and asked the group to leave. They did not. 

8. Then Mr Golding came out. The main man in the group outside invited Mr Golding to fight him. According to the summary of facts, Mr Golding then shouted, "" I'll sort this ,"" and ran back into the house. He returned a moment later with a knife. He had brought the knife with him from Darwin and it was his filleting knife which he used for fishing. Mr Golding in evidence said that he had not said "" I'll sort this "" but that he had said, "" We can sort this out ."" I will accept for the purposes of sentencing that he said what he claimed he said in evidence before me. It does not make, in my opinion, a lot of difference to the seriousness of what then happened. 

9. The men outside were accompanied by a girl who was a teenager. She was sixteen. Mr Golding was outside wielding his knife around. He ran towards the man who had invited to fight him and stabbed towards his stomach and chest area. Fortunately he missed. He tried again to stab or slash this man, but the man jumped back. At this stage the teenage girl, as the summary of facts says, "" jumped between "" the man and Mr Golding, and Mr Golding "" stabbed her in the left side of her chest, below her armpi t"". The girl cried out and doubled over in pain, staggered a short distance and collapsed. She was bleeding heavily. 

10. Police and ambulance were called. As it happened the teenage girl suffered what the facts describe as a "" deep penetration wound that punctured her left lung, causing it to collapse and causing breathing difficulties "". She required immediate surgery. She stayed in hospital in the intensive care unit for recovery. She required a tube for several days from her chest to provide fluid. 

11. Mr Golding's response to this predicament was to take himself to Adelaide. From there he took himself on to Perth and then back to Darwin. Police tracked him down in Darwin in the following month and he was arrested on 21 February 2010. 

12. As I said, he pleaded guilty to this crime at the earliest available opportunity. 

13. Mr Golding has a criminal record. He has a couple of offences which he committed as a child, but he has also served gaol time as an adult between 1996 and 2006 for offences involving violence. These offences include assault occasioning actual bodily harm and intimidating or assaulting a police officer. In other words I am sentencing a man who has previously inflicted his violence on members of the community, and has once again done exactly the same, but with far more serious consequences. 

14. There is a helpful presentence report prepared by the Probation and Parole Service. It summarises Mr Golding's position in the following terms- 
"" Mr Golding is a 34 year old male who is currently single and has no dependants. 

His childhood has been described as dysfunctional and he grew up in a home where he was witness to physical and alcohol abuse, and did not have a positive male role model in his life as he was growing up. 

Although describing a pattern of binge drinking and abuse of illicit drugs, Mr Golding has expressed resistance towards addressing his abuse, having participated in numerous past interventions. The fact that he does not believe he requires assistance to address his substance abuse is of concern. Whilst the offender admits to the offences, he claims to have limited memory due to his level of intoxication. It is concerning that he has in the past advised this service that he has had limited memory of his offending due to being affected by substances ."" 


15. The report noted that he had been assessed in previous periods of supervision as performing unsatisfactorily. He left school when he was about fourteen, but completed, to his credit, his school certificate at some stage when he was in custody. The Probation and Parole Service records indicate "" a history of offending related to abuse of alcohol and illicit drugs"". The report assessed him "" as unlikely to benefit from supervision by this Service, that is because of his past poor response "". 

16. Mr Stewart tendered a report by Tim Watson-Munro, a consultant forensic psychologist. Mr Watson-Munro recorded a history for Mr Golding and then concluded that Mr Golding "" requires ongoing psychological assistance to reinforce the progress he has made to date "". He thought he needed one-to-one psychotherapy which should focus on depression and anxiety. He also needed to deal with relapse prevention strategies. Dr Watson-Munro thought that working as a fisherman was integral to his recovery. He thought that Mr Golding had a substantial and protracted polysubstance abuse disorder. 

17. In his evidence Mr Golding had said, so far as the offence was concerned, that he was too drunk to defend himself and went to get the knife in order to protect himself and the others. He acknowledged that use of the knife was wrong and the recklessness involved in him waving it around. He acknowledged it was a shocking thing to do and indicated that none of the offences he had committed before involved violence. He said that there was a lot of violence and alcohol around when he was growing up and that he really had to fend for himself from the age of thirteen. As it happens in recent years he has met his biological father, who left his mother before he was born. He stays in touch and finds it helpful. 

18. His history of drug abuse includes ecstasy, cocaine and cannabis. He used heroin on one occasion for the first time since this offence. He stopped cocaine use at one stage when he was in custody. He acknowledges an ongoing problem with alcohol abuse. He has undertaken a program whilst in custody. He acknowledged that he thought it was better for him to remain away from alcohol. He has a close relationship with his sister Stacey and with his mother. Fishing is a job which he very much enjoys and is good at. However what happens is that when he comes back ashore he tends to binge drink. This is obviously what happened on this occasion. He said he can get a job in the fish markets around Sydney. 

19. In cross-examination by Mr Robinson, who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, he acknowledged that it was a sharp knife which would not have required much force. He denied that he got the knife because he wanted to fight or wanted to escalate what was going on. He thought he was older and wiser now. 

20. Mr Stewart also called as a witness Stacey Auld, Mr Golding's sister. She said that as a child Mr Golding was just left to cope for himself. There was never anyone there for him. Their parents were quite aggressive towards one another and there was violence. There is some seven or eight years difference between Ms Auld and Mr Golding. She has a successful hairdressing business. She has always stayed in touch with her brother. She describes him as very caring and he gets on very well with her four young children. She regards fishing as a very positive experience for him because he has always loved boats. 

21. Mr Robinson provided some helpful written submissions. He acknowledged that Mr Golding was entitled to the maximum of twenty-five per cent discount because of his early plea of guilty. He also acknowledged that the offence was clearly not part of any planned or organised criminal activity. He argued that the offence, carrying as it does a standard non-parole period, lies within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Mr Robinson pointed to the use of a knife and that the victim was sixteen years old, and in particular the seriousness of the injury. He argued that Mr Golding had limited prospects of rehabilitation because of a limited insight and his lack of accepting responsibility and an expressed reluctance to participate in further efforts to rehabilitate himself. 

22. Mr Stewart argued that the offence which his client committed in fact fell below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. He argued this for a number of reasons. He said the offence was not brought about by his client, it was totally unexpected. That might be right, but in fact it was his client who went back into the house to get the knife. No knife had been involved at the start, said Mr Stewart. That is also right, but his client then introduced the knife which significantly increased the potential for serious damage. 

23. His client was heavily intoxicated which I take into account, but not as a mitigating factor. Mr Stewart did not suggest it was, but as indicating the context or circumstances in which it happened. I accept that in these circumstances the age of the victim was not an aggravating factor under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, but it needs to be taken into account that the victim of his reckless behaviour with the knife happened to be a teenage girl. 

24. I accept that there was no history or pattern of use of weapons, although that is not directly relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness. If there was a degree of excessive self-defence, as Mr Stewart argued, I do not regard that as a very helpful way of classifying the crime. The crime was reckless wounding, which occurred because Mr Golding introduced a knife into an already volatile situation. 

25. I regard the offence as lying in the middle of the range of objective seriousness and towards the middle of that range. The main reason for making that finding is the seriousness of the injury in this case. It was a very serious injury to be inflicted, with significant immediate consequences. Mr Golding is lucky not to be standing in the dock in the Supreme Court facing a murder trial. In addition, it was Mr Golding who introduced a knife into the situation and there was nothing mitigating about the circumstances of his use of the knife so far as the context in which the offence occurred. 

26. The common assault, which I take into account in sentencing Mr Golding, is his attempt to stab at one of the men in the group. 

27. I will take into account and make allowance for his plea at the earliest available opportunity. 

28. I take into account his background, but there must be a limit to the extent to which I can take that into account for a man who is now thirty-four years of age. 

29. I take into account that he has secured very good employment. He is obviously a hard and well-regarded worker. His prospects of rehabilitation however must be, at best, guarded. I do not regard them as good. 

30. Mr Stewart argued that there are special circumstances for adjusting the relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of the term. He pointed to the assistance which he would need in dealing with alcohol. Mr Robinson argued that that alone is not sufficient to amount to special circumstances. I accept that argument in the circumstances of this case. Given the age of Mr Golding and his attitude in the past, I do not propose to adjust the ratio. I would regard, as it happens, the period I have and will allow as appropriate. 

31. I regard an appropriate overall sentence in this case for the crime committed by Mr Golding as four years imprisonment. However, he has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. I will therefore discount that sentence by twenty-five per cent, so the sentence which I propose to fix is three years imprisonment. I will fix a non-parole period of three-quarters of that, which will be two years and three months. 

HIS HONOUR: I am going to sentence you now, Mr Golding, if you would stand up. 

32. I fix a non-parole period of two years and three months, to commence on 21 February 2010 and to expire on 20 May 2012. The balance of the term is nine months, to commence on 21 May 2012 and to expire on 20 February 2013. I make an order directing your release on parole on 20 May 2012. 

HIS HONOUR: Mr Robinson and Ms Elamrousy, first if you would check the figures, and secondly, because I've ordered his release on parole, I'm wondering whether there are any parole conditions, apart from good behaviour. I indicate as well, which will be noted on the document I sign, that I have taken into account the offence on the Form 1. Mr Robinson? 

ROBINSON: Your Honour, I can't see any issue with the figures, firstly. Secondly, with regard parole conditions, I know the presentence report says that he will be unlikely to benefit and I note my written submissions, but I now submit, your Honour, that you might consider drug and alcohol counselling as a condition, on the basis of Mr Golding's evidence in the witness box that he might benefit this time around. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes, okay, I will consider that. Anything else? 

ROBINSON: Those are my submissions, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: What do you say, Ms Elamrousy? 

ELAMROUSY: I agree with my friend, your Honour, to undertake a suitable drug and alcohol course. 

HIS HONOUR: Okay, and the figures, no error? 

ELAMROUSY: I have no problems with the figures, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Okay. 

33. The conditions of Mr Golding's parole are these- 
1. That he be of good behaviour; 
2. That he submit to the supervision of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service, and accept its reasonable recommendations and directions so far as drug and alcohol rehabilitation are concerned. 

HIS HONOUR: Anything else? 
ELAMROUSY: No, your Honour. 

ROBINSON: No, your Honour. 


34. Mr Golding, you have got a three year sentence for this crime. I have taken into account the assault wielding the knife at the fellow called Ryan. It is included in the three years. I have fixed a non-parole period of two years and three months, that starts when the sentence starts. I have backdated it to 21 February last year when you were arrested. Your non-parole period expires on 20 May 2012, 20 May next year. I have ordered that you be released on parole on that day. You are still under sentence, as you know. You have got another nine months that you are still under sentence and that sentence expires overall on 20 February 2013. You know that during your parole you have got to behave yourself. You know that if you misbehave you are back in court, or the Parole Authority will simply remove your parole and you are back in prison serving the balance of the term. You know that, don't you? 


OFFENDER: Yes. 


35. I have made it a further condition of your parole that you subject yourself to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service. That will be here in Sydney. I have taken into account your evidence that you can find work out of Sydney, and I have recommended that you accept their advice so far as drug and alcohol. Do you understand that? 

OFFENDER: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: Did you want to have a word to your client at all, Ms Elamrousy? 

ELAMROUSY: Yes, thank you, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Have a word to him now before he goes down. Mr Robinson thank you, Ms Elamrousy, thank you, you are both excused.

		22 August 2011",2011-07-10 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709515,R v PERISH; R v LAWTON; R v PERISH [2011] NSWSC 1101,"Judgment 

1By notices of motion dated 4 July 2011, Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton (the applicants) seek orders that the following articles be removed from the internet: 

(1) the article Accused win battle to delete web history under the authorship of Geesche Jacobsen dated 17 February 2011; and 

(2) the article Judges who apply gag patronise jurors under the authorship of Tim Dick dated 18 February 2011. 

2The orders that Mr Lawton seeks, are framed so as to enable the proper officer of ""Fairfax Media Limited"" to block public access to the articles as an alternative to removing them from any website under its control. 

3These articles were published in the Sydney Morning Herald on 17 February and 18 February 2011 but remain on the website, which may be briefly identified as htt p ://www.smh.com.au (the website). It is from this website or any website under the respondent's control that the applicants ask that the articles be taken down. 

4The respondent to Anthony Perish's motion was identified as ""Fairfax Media"" whereas the second respondent to Mr Lawton's motion was identified as ""Fairfax Media Limited"". Mr Dawson of counsel, who appeared in response to service of the motions, advised the court that the correct respondent is Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited. I grant liberty to the applicants to amend the notices of motion so that the respondent is correctly named as Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited. 

5Matthew Lawton's motion also refers to the ""DPP"" as being the first respondent. I do not know why it was considered necessary to join the Director of Public Prosecutions as a party to these proceedings. In any event, the Director did not appear but Mr Leask, who represents the Crown, apprised the court of the Crown's attitude to the applications. 

6Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton are both charged with the murder of Terrence Falconer and with conspiring to murder Terrence Falconer. Andrew Perish is charged, along with Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton, with conspiring to murder Terrence Falconer. All three are to stand trial together in this court and it is anticipated that a jury will be empanelled today. 

7Anthony Perish is represented by C A Davenport SC. Matthew Lawton is represented by S Hanley SC and Andrew Perish, on the applications, was represented by J D O'Sullivan. 

8Another article is sought to be removed by Anthony Perish from the website. This article, Men accused over drug dealer's murder, was published on 6 August 2010. 

9The article commences by linking the murder of Terrence Falconer with police investigations ""into a string of other slayings and crimes in Sydney and on the Gold Coast"". The article refers to Anthony Perish and witness E being remanded in custody after being charged with conspiring to murder Terrence Falconer and to a police raid on an address linked to them that revealed firearms including ""a machine gun - style pistol"" and a large quantity of ammunition. The article then details ""other crimes, which may be linked"" to Terrence Falconer's murder. 

10Although Mr Dawson did not address the court in relation to this article, he made it clear that the respondent did not consent to its removal from the respondent's website. Mr Dawson sensibly anticipated that the article was of the same kind as those I ordered be removed from various websites on 17 February 2011. 

11The article is highly prejudicial to Anthony Perish because it associates him with crimes for which he has not been charged. For the reasons provided in my judgment delivered on 16 February 2011, I consider that it is necessary to make an order for the removal of this article from the website to ensure that the applicants (and Andrew Perish) receive a fair trial. 

12The argument of counsel upon the motions focussed upon the articles of 17 February 2011 (annex 1 (a)) and 18 February 2011 (annex 1 (c)) to the affidavit of William O'Brien, sworn 4 July 2011. Mr Dawson submitted that these articles fell into a different category to the articles of a ""historical kind"" that were the subject of my orders on 17 February 2011. Before venturing into the competing arguments, it is convenient to refer in a summarised way to these articles. 

The February articles 

13The article Accused win battle to delete web history written by Geesche Jacobsen, the legal affairs reporter for the Sydney Morning Herald, refers to newspapers, including the Herald , being ordered to ""remove old articles from their websites after a court ruled they might interfere with a fair trial"". Ms Jacobsen writes: 

""...the decision has no impact on thousands of other internet hits for the names of one or more of the accused - Anthony John Michael Perish, Mathew Robert Lawton, and Andrew Michael Perish. The court heard a Google search last month found 6930 references to the name of one of the men on Australian sites alone."" 

14Ms Jacobsen, inter alia , refers to the chief executive of News Ltd ""last week"" calling for an end to ""the nonsense"" of take-down orders that are ""the modern equivalent of burning books"". The president of the NSW Council for Civil Liberties is quoted as saying that orders against internet publication appeared to discriminate against the internet ""because courts never ordered the removal of a microfiche from every library in the State"". 

15The article Judges who apply gag patronise jurors was written by Tim Dick, the media editor of the Sydney Morning Herald. Mr Dick, inter alia , writes: 

""This week Justice Derek Price ordered media companies to remove old articles referring to matters set to be tried next week. Against the arguments of Fairfax, publisher of the Herald , and News Ltd he did so to reduce the likelihood of a juror reading those articles or having a busybody share their contents with them - the implication being such talk might distract them from the evidence. That trial date was vacated yesterday for reasons themselves suppressed by the judge."" 

16Mr Dick goes on to refer to the ""practical pointlessness"" of the orders which he states is: 

""... illustrated by searching for the full name of one of the accused in this case, Anthony John Michael Perish. Google said yesterday there were 2380 hits of that exact phrase. There are links on pages such as 123people.co.uk and findagrave.com, both beyond the jurisdiction of the NSW Supreme Court."" 
17The journalist opines that aside from the practical pointlessness, there are larger issues with suppression orders being ""that for too long some judges considered that ensuring a fair trial trumps the legitimate public interest in being able to see the trial"" and ""they flow from a fear of prejudice rather than proof"". 

Argument 

18Ms Davenport submitted that a reader of the articles would conclude that there are a large number of articles on websites which relate to Anthony Perish. Furthermore, the articles seek to denigrate the orders that the court made. Should a juror be made aware during the course of the trial of the articles, Ms Davenport put to me, it would undermine the directions given to the jury. 

19Mr Hanley drew my attention to Ms Jacobsen's mention of 6,930 references on Australian websites without naming the accused against whom the references were found. He said that an available suggestion to a reader of the articles was that there may be thousands of other references on the internet to Mr Lawton which may be prejudicial to him. Mr Hanley submitted that the articles were unfair, improper, patronising and had the potential to undermine directions given during the trial. 

20Mr Dawson contended that the articles did not contain any of the material that led to the take-down orders of 17 February 2011. He argued that the articles presented a report of the court's rulings, albeit unfavourable. Mr Dawson submitted that the real issue was whether the court could be satisfied to a high degree of certainty that the orders were necessary to secure the proper administration of justice. Mr Dawson cited John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 324; (2004) 61 NSWLR 344 and Attorney-General for New South Wales v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCCA 307; (2007) 73 NSWLR 635. It was put to me that, far from denigrating the orders that might be made during the trial, the articles reflect that there are competing views about the extent of free speech and the need to protect the fair trial process. When referring to the principles of open justice, Mr Dawson argued that should the orders be made, the court would in effect be stating that the respondent was not permitted to maintain a report of proceedings that occurred in open court because of a concern that the articles might be accessed in some way by the members of the jury, which would assume defiance of trial directions. Such an assumption was a matter of impermissible speculation. 

21In reply, both Ms Davenport and Mr Hanley pointed out that the articles were neither fair nor accurate reports of what had occurred in this court. 

22Mr Leask told me that the Crown was ""neutral"" about the applications. 


Decision 

23There is no dispute that the court has the inherent jurisdiction to make the orders sought. Furthermore, s 8 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (the Act) relevantly provides: 

""(1) A court may make a suppression order or non-publication order on one or more of the following grounds: 
(a) the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice."" 

24I accept that the February articles are different from the articles that were the subject of the orders made on 17 February 2011. Those articles associated the applicants with crimes for which they have not been charged and are not standing trial. Questions of open justice did not apply. 

25The open justice principle, however, arises in the respondent's opposition to the motions. Ms Jacobsen's article provided in part a report of the evidence given in open court during the application to vacate the take-down orders and of the judgment. Judges who apply gag patronise jurors is a piece of journalism critical of the judgment. In my opinion, the open justice principle extends beyond the reporting of what occurs in the courtroom so as to include polemical debate of a court's decision. The principle of open justice requires ""that once material is given in evidence or otherwise made available in judicial proceedings, an order prohibiting its publication will not be made unless it is found necessary for the administration of justice"": Attorney-General for New South Wales v Nationwide News Pty Ltd per Hodgson JA at [25]. 

26It is well established that the stringency with which the test of necessity is to be applied may vary. In BUSB v R [2011] NSWCCA 3, Spigelman CJ said at [33]: 

""A test of necessity can be applied with varying degrees of strictness. Where, as is the case here, the power said to be implied impinges upon a fundamental principle of the administration of criminal justice - the right to confront accusers - the test must be applied with a higher level of strictness than may be applicable in other circumstances. (See John Fairfax v District Court at [51]) The extent of the power in such circumstances may be ""minimalist"". (See Witness v Marsden [2000] NSWCA 52; (2000) 49 NSWLR 429 at [144].)"" 

27A fundamental principle of the administration of criminal justice is the principle of open justice. Where the application of the power to make a non-publication order conflicts with the principle of open justice the test of necessity must be applied with strictness. A high level of certainty that prejudice of the trial will ensue is required: John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of New South Wales per Spigelman CJ at [51] and [101]. As the Chief Justice said at [51]: 

""Accordingly, it is necessary to determine that the objective of ensuring the fairness of a subsequent trial cannot be achieved in any other way."" 

28The Act came into force on 1 July 2011. The Act does not define the term ""necessary"". Section 6 provides that a court must take into account in deciding whether to make a non-publication order, ""that a primary objective of the administration of justice is to safeguard the public interest in open justice"". It seems to me that the Act does not impact upon the pre-existing law as to the degree of strictness with which the test of necessity is to be applied. 

29The orders made in February did not conflict with any fundamental principle of the administration of criminal justice. The level of strictness with which the test of necessity was applied was not as high as that required in the present circumstances. In the judgment delivered on 16 February 2011, I said at [42]: 

""The term ""necessary"" does not have the meaning of ""essential"", rather it is to be ""subjected to the touchstone of reasonableness"": Pelechowski v The Registrar, Court of Appeal (NSW) (1999) 198 CLR 435 at 452. The concept as to what reasonably is necessary is to be approached in a common sense way: State Drug Crime Commission (NSW) v Chapman (1987) 12 NSWLR 447 at 452 per Allen J. There must be some material before the court upon which it can reasonably reach the conclusion that it is necessary to make an order removing material from the internet and prohibiting publication of that material during the trial. Mere belief that the order is necessary is insufficient."" 

30Accordingly, the test applied was whether it was reasonably necessary to make the orders for removal to ensure that each of the accused had a fair trial: see [49] of the judgment delivered on 16 February 2011. In the present circumstances, the test is whether the court is satisfied to a high degree of certainty that it is necessary to make the orders for removal of the February articles to ensure that each of the accused has a fair trial. 

31Potential prejudice to the applicants (and to Andrew Perish) in Ms Jacobsen's article arises particularly from the heading, the reference to removal of ""old articles"" from websites, the naming of the accused and the detailing of thousands of other internet hits upon which the judgment was reported as having no impact. 

32The publication of the article at a time when a jury panel had been on notice for some two to three weeks and the jury was shortly to be empanelled seriously prejudiced the likelihood of a fair trial. There was a real chance at that time that the publication would come to the attention of at least some of the members of the panel in waiting, either by reading the article in the newspaper's broadsheet or on the website. None of the potential jurors had had the benefit of trial directions. I concluded that it was necessary to adjourn the commencement of the trial. The article is, however, no longer ""today's news"" but is archived on the internet. 

33Potential prejudice to the applicants (and to Andrew Perish) in Mr Dick's article arises particularly from the inaccurate reference to the removal of ""old articles set to be tried next week"", the naming of Anthony John Michael Perish and the detailing of ""6380 hits of that exact phrase"". 

34I mention in passing that contrary to Mr Dick's understanding, my orders did not impact in any way upon ""the legitimate public interest in being able to see the trial"". As I emphasised at [37]: 

""...none of the defence counsel are adverse to accurate reporting of the arrest or charging of the three accused, nor are they adverse to the evidence in the trial being reported."" 

35However, I do not accept the applicants' submissions that the articles, if read, have the potential to undermine my authority as the trial judge. As Kirby A-CJ said in R v Yuill (1993) 69 A Crim R 450 at 453 - 454: 

""There is an increasing body of judicial opinion, lately expressed, to the effect that whatever pre-trial publicity exists, jurors, when they take on the solemn responsibility of the performance of their duties in the courtroom, differentiate between gossip, rumour, news and opinion which they hear before the case and the evidence which they hear in the court in the trial for which they are empanelled."" 

36The jury will be given directions to decide the cases solely on the evidence placed before them in court and of the prohibition upon inappropriately accessing the internet. The possibility that a juror might act in defiance of the court's directions or that there might be inadvertent contact with a member of the public does not satisfy the test of necessity when applied with strictness. The court must assume that jurors will accept and conform with the trial directions. The test of a high degree of certainty rather than reasonableness does not permit the court to remove the February articles in order to assist the jurors by making their task easier. 

37I am not satisfied to a high degree of certainty that it is necessary to make the orders removing the February articles from the respondent's website to ensure that each of the applicants (and Andrew Perish) has a fair trial. The objective of ensuring a fair trial will be achieved by trial directions. I am not satisfied that the orders are necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice. I do not propose to make the orders sought. 

38There is another matter that must be mentioned. Reporting by the media of the evidence and argument upon the present motions and this judgment during the trial is likely to cause prejudice to the accuseds' right to a fair trial. A report will be available to a member of the jury when he or she reads the daily news. As fresh news, such a publication will not be covered by the trial directions. Accordingly, I am satisfied to a high degree of certainty that it is necessary to make such a non-publication order covering these motions to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice during the trial. 

Orders 

39I make the following orders: 

(1)In the motion of Anthony Perish, I order that the article from the Sydney Morning Herald entitled 'Men accused over drug dealer's murder' dated 6 August 2010 be immediately removed from the Sydney Morning Herald website: 'http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/men-accused-over-drug-dealers-murder-20090120-7lbi.html' and from any website under the control of Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited in New South Wales, and not be published on the internet by Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited in New South Wales until after the trial and verdict in the matter of R v Anthony Perish or further order. 

(2)The motion of Matthew Lawton is dismissed. 

(3)The evidence given in these motions before the court, the argument of counsel, and this judgment not be published until after the trial and verdicts in the matters of R v Anthony Perish , R v Matthew Lawton and R v Andrew Perish or further order.

		15 September 2011",2011-07-10 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709522,Hunt v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 152,"Judgment 

1THE COURT : On 14 September 2010, Lee James Hunt (the appellant) was arraigned on two counts both of which were in the same terms, namely, that between 10 March 2006 and 7 March 2007 at Gwynneville, he did indecently assault JH in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that JH was at the time under the age of 16 years, namely, 11 or 12 years. The appellant entered a plea of not guilty to both charges. 

2The trial before his Honour Judge Conlon SC commenced in the District Court at Wollongong on 14 September 2010. The jury was empanelled on 15 September 2010 and the evidence concluded on 16 September 2010. The trial judge commenced his summing up to the jury on 16 September 2010 and concluded his summing up the following morning, Friday. Later on that day, the jury returned a majority verdict of guilty on both counts. 

3On 10 December 2010, the trial judge sentenced the appellant to imprisonment as follows: 


With respect to count 1, a non-parole period of six (6) months to commence on 10 December 2010 and to expire on 9 June 2011 and a balance of term of six (6) months to commence on 10 June 2011 and to expire on 9 December 2011; 
With respect to count 2, a non-parole period of eight (8) months to commence on 10 December 2010 and to expire on 9 August 2011 and a balance of term of 12 months to commence on 10 August 2011 and to expire on 9 August 2012. 

Accordingly, the aggregate term imposed was 20 months commencing on 10 December 2010 and expiring on 9 August 2012, consisting of an aggregate non-parole period of eight (8) months commencing on 10 December 2010 and expiring on 9 August 2011, with an aggregate balance of term of 12 months commencing on 10 August 2011 and expiring on 9 August 2012. 

4The appellant raised five grounds of appeal, namely: 

Ground 1: the verdicts constituted a miscarriage of justice as the appellant did not have a trial according to law; 

Ground 2: the trial judge erred by failing to comply with the requirements of the Jury Act 1977 (the Act), s 55F before accepting a majority verdict; 

Ground 3: the trial judge could not be satisfied that the jury had spent not less than eight hours deliberating; 

Ground 4: the trial judge misdirected the jury by advising that he could take a majority verdict at 5.50 pm; 

Ground 5: the trial judge failed to properly put the defence case. 

5The appeal was heard by the Court on 19 May 2011. In its written submissions at para 54, the Crown stated that in all the circumstances, this Court might consider that Grounds 1, 2, 3 and 4 had been established with the consequence that there had been a miscarriage of justice in that the appellant had not had a trial according to law. The Crown further conceded at para 55 of its written submissions that the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 was not available in a case such as the present where the proceedings had so far departed as to have ceased to be a trial according to law, as a finding in such circumstances that there had been no substantial miscarriage of justice was not open: AK v State of Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; (2008) 232 CLR 438; Cesan v The Queen [2008] HCA 52; (2008) 236 CLR 358. Accordingly, the Crown accepted that in the circumstances and upon the basis the Court upheld any of Grounds 1, 2, 3 and 4, it should order that there be a new trial. 

6In the foregoing circumstances, the Court accepted the concessions of the Crown that the course of the proceedings which resulted in a majority verdict of guilty on both counts was such that the appellant had not received a trial according to law. As the appellant did not oppose the ordering of a new trial, the Court announced the following orders: 

1. Conviction quashed; 

2. The sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Conlon SC on 10 December 2010 be set aside; 

3. That there be a new trial. 

7The Court indicated that it would provide its reasons for the making of these orders in due course. What follows are our reasons for joining in those orders. 

The course of the proceedings leading to a majority verdict 

8The trial judge did not refer to the possibility of a majority verdict either in his opening remarks to the jury or in his summing up. In the latter, he directed the jury that their verdicts were to be unanimous. No reference was made either by trial counsel for the appellant or for the Crown in their addresses to the jury with respect to the requirement of unanimity or otherwise. 

9The jury retired to consider their verdicts at 9.47 am on 17 September 2010. Shortly before 12.10 pm, the jury sent a note to the trial judge, which stated, "" We cannot reach a verdict "". The note was marked MFI 7. The jury returned to the court at 12.10 pm when the trial judge gave a direction encouraging the jury to persevere in their deliberations. That direction reflected the essential requirements for such directions referred to by the High Court in Black v The Queen [1993] HCA 71; (1993) 179 CLR 44 at 51-52. No complaint was made with respect to that direction which generally followed the suggested direction set out at [8-070] of the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book. 

10In response to that direction and while the jury was still in court, the foreman asked if he could be heard. His Honour declined to hear the foreman, but instead invited him to provide a further note which he wrote on the back of MFI 7. The further note stated: 

""We have debated vigorously both sides of the argument. Every juror has had time to present their argument for and against. The strength of convictions for both sides are such that even if we returned to the room, neither side could be persuaded to change their final verdicts. Extra time will not make a difference in this case thank you. Foreman."" 

11His Honour's response to the note was to state the following in the jury's presence: 

""My view is that the direction that I've just given the jury is appropriate and they need to go out to further deliberate the matter. It may well be that there is no movement but in view of the direction which I have given them I believe that I should ask them to retire again to further deliberate in accordance with that direction and if there is movement okay, if there is not well I will deal with that when the matter arises. Do either of you have anything to say about that?"" 

Neither counsel had any comment to make. 

12The transcript then records that the jury retired to further consider its verdict at 12.17 pm. At approximately 1.40 pm, a further note was received from the jury which was marked MFI 8 and which was provided to the court shortly before 2 pm. The note stated, "" We cannot reach a unanimous verdict "". A discussion then took place between his Honour and counsel as to the appropriate response to this latest note. Reference was made by counsel to s 56 of the Act which provides as follows: 

"" 56 Discharge of jury that disagree in criminal proceedings 

(1) Where a jury in criminal proceedings has retired, and the jury consists of 11 or 12 persons, the court in which the proceedings are being tried may discharge the jury if it finds, after examination on oath of one or more of the jurors, that it is unlikely that the jurors will reach a unanimous verdict or a majority verdict under section 55F. 

(2) Where a jury in criminal proceedings has retired, and the jury consists of 11 or 12 persons, the court in which the proceedings are being tried may not discharge the jury under this section if it finds, after examination on oath of one or more of the jurors, that it is likely that the jurors will reach a majority verdict under section 55F."" 

13Section 55F is relevantly in the following terms: 

"" 55F Majority verdicts in criminal proceedings 

(1) This section applies in respect of a verdict in criminal proceedings where the jury consists of not less than 11 persons. 

(2) A majority verdict may be returned by a jury in criminal proceedings if: 

(a) a unanimous verdict has not been reached after the jurors have deliberated for a period of time (being not less than 8 hours) that the court considers reasonable having regard to the nature and complexity of the criminal proceedings, and 

(b) the court is satisfied, after examination on oath of one or more of the jurors, that it is unlikely that the jurors will reach a unanimous verdict after further deliberation. 

(3) In this section: 

majority verdict means: 

(a) a verdict agreed to by 11 jurors where the jury consists of 12 persons at the time the verdict is returned, or 

(b) a verdict agreed to by 10 jurors where the jury consists of 11 persons at the time the verdict is returned. 

unanimous verdict means a verdict agreed to by all members of the jury."" 

14It is at this point that the trial process took a turn for the worse. It appears that the trial judge and counsel considered it necessary, the jury having indicated that it could not reach a unanimous verdict, to engage s 56(2) and, for that purpose, to examine on oath one of the jurors as to whether it was likely that the jury could reach a majority verdict. Although there was some confusion in the exchanges between his Honour and counsel, it appears that the focus of attention at that point may have been upon the discharge of the jury. Hence the enquiry appears to have been for the purpose of s 56(2) although that involved compliance with the requirements of s 55F(2). 

15Accordingly, when the jury returned to court at 2.20 pm, the foreman entered the witness box, was sworn and the following exchange occurred: 

""HIS HONOUR 
Q. Now, your most recent note indicates that you believe that you are unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The first question I need to ask you is that, is that the situation, that you are deadlocked and even if you were to be given more time you believe that you would not be able to reach a unanimous verdict, is that correct? 
A. That is correct. 

Q. The second question is this, in New South Wales there is the provision for a majority verdict. The circumstances in which the Court would be permitted to take a majority verdict have not yet arisen. However, this is a question I need to ask you. The majority verdict in New South Wales is a verdict of - sorry, is a situation where there are eleven persons agree, so it is an eleven to one majority verdict. Without indicating the type of division that exists amongst you by way of numbers, without indicating that, can I pose this question to you. If you were to be given more time to you think there would be any possibility of reaching a majority verdict? 

A. I do. I do believe that."" 

16It is to be noted that at this point (2.20 pm), the jury had been out, but not necessarily deliberating, for only 4 hours and 33 minutes. His Honour then asked the jury to leave the court which it did at some point between 2.20 pm and 2.32 pm. Further discussion then occurred between the trial judge and counsel as to what further direction his Honour should give the jury. Notwithstanding that his Honour was referred to and apparently read the decision of this Court in RJS v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 241; (2007) 173 A Crim R 100, when the jury returned at 2.32 pm, his Honour directed them in the following terms: 

""Sorry to keep you outside, ladies and gentlemen. The next direction I give you you may well find unsatisfactory. However, it is consequent upon the responses to the two questions I asked of your foreperson a few moments ago. The first was that would it be unlikely, extremely unlikely, that given more time you would ever be able to reach a unanimous verdict and you responded yes. The next question I had to ask and advise you that in this state there are circumstances in which a court can take a majority verdict of eleven to one, and in indicating that to you I had to pose the question given more time do you think it would be at all possible whether a majority verdict may be reached, and you indicated in the affirmative that it would be possible. 

As a result of that I have to tell you that the circumstances in which I can take a majority verdict have not yet arisen in this case. Accordingly, the only direction that I can now give you is that you should continue on with your deliberations and you should strive to reach unanimity. Of course, that is subject to the direction that I gave you earlier which is still applicable, that is of course you are to give every consideration to the views and opinions of others. However, consistent with your oath or affirmation as a juror you of course could not join in a verdict if you did not honestly and genuinely think it is the correct one. 

But at this stage, members of the jury, I have to ask you just to continue your deliberations in that vein seeking once again to reach unanimity and I can say nothing further to you at this stage. As I said, that direction may well be unsatisfactory to you, but at law that's the only direction I can give you. Thank you."" 

17The jury retired to further consider its verdict at 2.35 pm. It should be noted that this was the first occasion on which the jury had directly been informed by the trial judge as to the possibility of his receiving a majority verdict, although it was semaphored to them in the second question put to the foreman set out at [15] above. 

18It would appear from the transcript that shortly after the jury retired at 2.35 pm, it sent a further note to the court, which was marked MFI 9 and was timed at 2.50 pm. It stated: 

""Your honour, we cannot reach a unanimous verdict. We have reached a majority 11/1 verdict. With all due respect, we require no more time to deliberate as we have reached a final decision."" 

19There was then further discussion between the trial judge and counsel in relation to the note which revolved around whether the jury should be informed as to when a majority verdict could be taken. Reference was made to the minimum period of deliberation of 8 hours referred to in s 55F(2)(a), it being stated that the 8 hours would expire at approximately 5.50 pm. Discussion then took place as to whether the jury should be required to continue its deliberations until that time, or whether they should be requested to return on the following Monday. 

20Upon the jury returning to court at 4 pm, the trial judge directed them in the following terms: 

""Ladies and gentlemen I can understand your exasperation at this stage of still being kept here. I will try to, as you are probably aware the way in which I have couched the directions to you, the law restricts me as to what can be said to jurors under these circumstances. Now what you will remember is that I said that it is possible for the Court to take a verdict that is not unanimous, that is a majority verdict of eleven to one under certain circumstances and I said on the last occasion that the circumstances in which I could take a majority verdict had not yet arisen. 

As a result of what you have informed me in the note which I marked MFI 9 I think it is only appropriate and we have been discussing this. I think that it is only appropriate that I tell you that what those circumstances are. The law prescribes that a Court cannot take a majority verdict until the jury have been out for what the Court considers an appropriate time for deliberation and that time must be not less than eight hours from the time they first went out to consider their verdict. 

So that has been the problem. I think you went out at ten to ten this morning so that period of eight hours would be at ten to six tonight and this is a mandatory requirement. There is not a thing I or anybody else can do about it. We are not able to accept the verdict until that eight hours has passed, as strange as that may seem to you. So I am only left with the alternative of saying that you can remain here for that further period of time or you can disperse now and come back on Monday morning even at nine o'clock if you like for that remainder which would be about an hour and fifty minutes before I could receive that majority verdict and I appreciate that may cause lots of difficulties. I do not know if you want to just perhaps go outside and have a chat amongst yourselves as to what you think is appropriate as far as your circumstances are concerned."" 

21The jury then left the court at 4.03 pm and returned at 4.06 pm, indicating that they would like to stay until 5.50 pm. They retired again at 4.07 pm, but the transcript does not reveal what thereafter occurred. However, it was generally common ground that at approximately 5.55 pm, the jury returned to court and the foreman of the jury delivered a majority verdict of guilty on both counts. 

22In the absence of a transcript of what occurred after 4.07 pm, affidavit evidence was placed before this Court to the effect that at approximately 5.50 pm, before the jury returned, the trial judge stated words to the effect that he considered 8 hours to be a "" reasonable time "" for the purpose of s 55F(2)(a). However, what his Honour apparently did not consider was whether the jury had in fact been actually deliberating for not less than 8 hours. Certainly, 8 hours had elapsed between the time it first retired to consider its verdict at 9.47 am and the time it returned and delivered its majority verdict at 5.55 pm. However, within that 8 hours, the jury had returned to court on a number of occasions and had had lunch, but no consideration was given by his Honour as to whether he could be satisfied that during those periods, the jury was in fact deliberating. 

23A conflict in the evidence arose with respect to whether, when his Honour stated that he considered 8 hours to be a "" reasonable time "", he had also stated that he considered that 8 hours was reasonable having regard to the nature and complexity of the issues at trial. However, it is unnecessary to resolve that conflict, except to emphasise that when determining whether the court considers that the jury has deliberated for the necessary period, regard must be had to the nature and complexity of the issues which they are required to resolve. 

The appellant did not receive a trial according to law 

24Although, as the appellant submitted, it is not without controversy as to what may be included and excluded when calculating the minimum time span for deliberation, nevertheless judicial consideration is required to establish that the jury has in fact deliberated for not less than 8 hours and, if necessary, for a longer period where the nature and complexity of the issues so requires. Accordingly, the statutory pre-condition referred to in s 55F(2)(a) is not satisfied by a trial judge simply acting upon the lapse of the minimum period of 8 hours, let alone 8 hours since the jury first retired. This point was well made by Grove J, with whom Hulme and Simpson JJ agreed, in AGW v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 81 in the following terms: 

""24 It was observed that in the present case the exchange between counsel and the bench showed an inclusion of the time when the jury were provided with lunch in making the calculation of eight hours. Inclusion of some period during which a meal break is taken is not without possible controversy: R v VST [2003] 6 VR 569. It is of course open to contemplation that jurors may deliberate whilst dining but as no attention at all was paid to making a determination of what period was reasonable, it is not necessary to finally determine the matter. I would comment that, in making a determination of what is a reasonable effluxion of time as is required by the statute, I would be reluctant always to make an assumption for that purpose that a time spent dining was necessarily also a time spent in deliberation. 

25 In making that comment I am conscious that in respect of similar provisions it has been held that the time during which a jury is returned to the courtroom for asking a question of the judge: R v Adams & anor (1968) 52 Cr App R 588 or receiving supplementary directions or reminders of evidence: R v Rodriguez [1998] 2 VR 167, on which occasions the jury is literally not deliberating, are not excluded from the calculation of whether the minimum time point has been reached. It has also been held that when the jury eat a light lunch and remain in the jury room there is no requirement to calculate a period of exclusion: R v Doherty [1999] 3 VR 435. There can be no inquiry for this purpose about what occurred in the privacy of the jury room and in complying with the obligation to determine a reasonable period of deliberation it would be prudent for trial judges to avoid the risk of miscarriage by refraining from acting soon after the estimated expiry of eight hours where there is any ambiguity about a component part of that minimum span of time."" 

25In the present case, it is apparent that neither the trial judge nor counsel exercised the prudence to which Grove J referred in the last sentence of [25] of his reasons. This, of itself, involved a failure to comply with the procedural requirements of a trial as to constitute a miscarriage of justice, in the sense that the appellant did not get a trial according to law. 

26In our opinion, the course taken by the trial judge at [15] above was premature. No enquiry of the jury for the purpose of s 56(2) should have been made by his Honour until the point had been reached at which a majority verdict was capable of being taken. Accordingly, he erred in asking the foreman at the time he did as to whether there would be any possibility of reaching a majority verdict of 11:1. 

27At [16] above, we noted that the first occasion on which the jury was informed by the trial judge as to the availability of a majority verdict was in the direction which followed his Honour's engagement of the requirements of s 55F(2)(b). Given that that possibility had not previously been referred to except when his Honour posed to the foreman the second question referred to at [15] above, this direction when coupled with that question and the foreman's answer would have indicated to the jury that a majority verdict was, in effect, a real possibility, although the time for taking such a verdict had not yet arisen. In our view, the question and the direction which followed it had the potential to distract the jury from its primary obligation to reach a unanimous verdict and thus undermined the Black direction referred to at [9] above. This was sufficient of itself to cause the trial to relevantly miscarry. 

28However, there were other significant problems which lead to the same conclusion. Section 55F(2) provides for two mandatory requirements which are prerequisites for the returning of a valid majority verdict: RJS at [18]-[26]. The relevant principles were extensively discussed by McClellan CJ at CL, with whom James and Davies JJ agreed, in Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88 at [20]-[87]. In particular, that decision was the subject of a Special Bulletin amending the Suggested Direction at [8-070] in the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book. 

29In the present case, the Crown, in effect, conceded that neither limb of s 55F(2) was complied with. As to subpara (a), and apart from his Honour's failure to consider whether any particular periods should have been excluded from the mandatory minimum of 8 hours deliberation, it is clear that in his direction to the jury at 4 pm referred to at [20] above, his Honour, in effect, invited the jury to cease their deliberations at that time and to simply sit out the period from 4 pm until 5.50 pm, at the expiration of which he would receive a majority verdict. We would agree with the Crown submission that the nature of those directions would raise considerable doubt as to whether any deliberations of the jury after it retired at 4.07 pm were likely to have been conducted with a view to achieving unanimity. Rather, they were in effect informed that they should simply wait out the remaining period of 1 hour and 50 minutes and then deliver a majority verdict. 

30The foregoing illustrates the danger of a trial judge prematurely and erroneously engaging with the jury for the purpose of s 55F(2) before the point is reached at which a majority verdict is capable of being taken. As we have already observed, in the present case the course taken resulted, or appears to have resulted, from a misunderstanding by the trial judge and counsel as to the proper time to engage s 56(2). No question of discharging the jury due to their inability to reach a unanimous verdict can arise unless and until the requirements of s 55F(2)(a) have been satisfied. That never occurred in the present case. 

31Of further concern was the trial judge's apparent implementation of s 55F(2)(b) at 2.20 pm, to which reference has been made at [15] above. As the Crown conceded and as we have observed at [26] above, the direction then given to the jury at 2.32 pm referred to at [16] above, may also have indicated to the jury that their deliberations were thereafter affected by the terms of the second question posed by the trial judge, notwithstanding that the direction stated that the circumstances in which a majority verdict could be taken had not yet arisen. At this point, although the jury were directed to continue with their deliberations and to strive to reach unanimity, that direction was given in the context of the foreman making it clear that a unanimous verdict could not be reached, but that a majority verdict could. His Honour informed the jury that he could not take a majority verdict at that time; the implication being that the jury should continue with their deliberations until such time as they were informed by his Honour that a majority verdict could be accepted. The distraction from their primary obligation to which we have referred at [26] above thus becomes apparent, as they knew that it was just a matter of time before such a verdict would be received. 

32We have already observed (at [26] and [30] above) that the exchange between the trial judge and the foreman set out at [15] above was premature. This was because of the trial judge's implementation of s 55F(2)(b) before s 55F(2)(a) had been satisfied. His Honour had given a Black direction at 12.10 pm, but a mere 2 hours later and long before the jury had been deliberating for at least 8 hours, extracted from the foreman that, although the jury was deadlocked and could not reach a unanimous verdict, it could reach a majority verdict. In our view, this clearly undermined the Black direction and was a significant error of process. Although not stated at the same time as that direction was given, it followed relatively soon thereafter and could not have had any effect but to modify the exhortation of the necessity to reach a unanimous verdict which the Black direction was intended to emphasise and encourage. The authorities well establish that once a Black direction has been given, at the very least care should be taken to ensure that it is not thereafter qualified by other directions given to the jury unless and until the mandatory requirements of s 55F(2)(a) have been satisfied. 

33In our view, it follows from the foregoing that when a Black direction is given in response to an indication by the jury that it is deadlocked or otherwise unable to reach a unanimous verdict, it would be prudent that, generally speaking, no subsequent direction should be given which does other than continue to exhort the jury to strive for a unanimous verdict prior to the expiry of a minimum 8 hours of deliberation (and if necessary, a greater period having regard to the nature and complexity of the issues in the case) and that this is so notwithstanding that the jury may continue prior to the expiry of that period to advise the court that it is unable to reach a unanimous decision. In other words, if the jury indicates it is deadlocked before the time has come to consider a majority verdict, it should always be encouraged to continue its deliberations and to strive for a unanimous verdict without being advised that the time for accepting a majority verdict is imminent, or that such a verdict may be taken after the expiry of a particular period of time ( RJS at [23] and note [24]). 

34This is not to say that it is inappropriate for a trial judge to make a passing or brief reference to majority verdicts in the summing up as contemplated by, and in the manner suggested in, [7-020] of the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book. The reasons for this are referred to in Ingham which contains an extensive discussion of the circumstances in which it is or is not appropriate for a trial judge to refer the jury to the possibility of a majority verdict. It is unnecessary to add to that exegesis in the present case where the trial judge's errors are not in issue and, in any event, where he did not include a reference to that possibility in his summing up. 

35In summary, the problem in the present case was that the trial judge, apparently for the purposes of s 56(2), explained to the jury the majority verdict formula and enquired of the foreman as to whether a majority verdict was possible well before a majority verdict was available in law. This error of process was then compounded by his Honour advising the jury as to the precise time when a majority verdict could be taken and inviting them to wait out the expiry of the minimum period of 8 hours upon the implied assumption that no further deliberations would be undertaken and without consideration of whether 8 hours of deliberation by the jury had occurred. These were clear failures to comply with the requirements of s 55F(2) as a consequence whereof the appellant did not receive a trial according to law. 

36It was for the foregoing reasons that we accepted the Crown's concession that the directions of the trial judge to which we have referred constituted a miscarriage of justice and joined ordered that his conviction be quashed. 

The order for a new trial 

37The relevant principles with respect to the ordering of a new trial where an appeal against conviction succeeds were conveniently and accurately summarised by Johnson J, with whom McCallum J agreed, in Haoui v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 209 in the following terms: 

""164 The question arises as to whether this Court should order a new trial: s.8(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 . Section 8(1) confers a broad discretion to be exercised in accordance with settled principles: The Queen v Taufahema (2007) 228 CLR 232 at 249 [35]. It is appropriate to bear in mind (by reference to the separation of powers) the normal primacy of the prosecution authorities, within the executive government, in determining whether or not to put an accused person, whose first trial had miscarried, up for retrial: The Queen v Taufahema at 281 [144]. In determining whether to grant a new trial, the Court should take into account both the objective seriousness of the offence and the penalty likely to be imposed if the accused were again to be convicted: Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru) v Fowler (1984) 154 CLR 627 at 630. A factor which may point against an order for a new trial is whether a significant part of a sentence has been served: The Queen v Taufahema at 256 [55]."" 

38In the present case, at the time we made the orders quashing the appellant's conviction, he had served only two-thirds of the non-parole period of imprisonment to which he had been sentenced. In these circumstances, we considered that it was a matter for the prosecuting authorities to determine whether or not, the appellant's trial having miscarried, he should be put up for retrial. This course was not opposed by the appellant and the Court ordered a new trial accordingly.

2709524,R v JEFFREYS; R v BURFITT [2011] NSWDC 136,"SENTENCE 


1HIS HONOUR: Paul Jefferys and Daniel Burfitt appear for sentence today after they each committed a number of offences on 10 August 2010. They knew each other at that date but not well. There is a significant difference in their ages, but what they had in common was that they were both reasonably heavy users of the drug ice. They also had in common - this is of course related to the fact that they were using that drug - that their lives had taken a turn for the worse. They were at a mutual friend's house using the drug when they jointly decided to commit a crime of some description in order to obtain money so that they could purchase more drugs. 

2The evidence would suggest, and I accept, there was no great plan as what the offence would be. Mr Burfitt, for example, gave evidence that he thought they were going to go and steal some metal for scrap and to that end they took from their mutual friend's home a bag containing some bolt cutters. However, it would seem that once the two offenders left the premises they firstly stole a car and then drove around trying to work out which particular offence they would commit. They came across a supermarket, this was in the early hours of the morning, but the lights were on. The evidence is, and I accept, that both offenders believed that the premises would be unoccupied. They decided to break into the supermarket and that is what they did, using one of the tools that they found in the car they had stolen. They jemmied open a sliding door and went to the service counter where they began to gain access to the locked compartment where cigarettes were stored. They were clearly intending to carry out a few because they had obtained what I would call a wheelie bin on the way and they began putting cigarettes in those packets. In fact, unbeknownst to them, there were people inside the premises. Three staff members were filling the shelves. They approached the offenders, surprising them. Both offenders then ran away leaving behind the wheelie bin and the cigarettes. They then went back to the stolen motor vehicle, a Toyota Hilux. Mr Burfitt entered the passenger side, Mr Jefferys was driving. 

3Police were called and not long afterwards the offenders were detected in the stolen Toyota Hilux in Balmain. The police attempted to stop the Hilux but Mr Jefferys, who I repeat was the driver, did not stop. He drove in a very dangerous manner, driving along the wrong side of the road, in the wrong direction up one way streets, at somewhere between seventy and eighty kilometres an hour in a fifty kilometre per hour zone, performing a U-turn over a median strip, until finally he ended up in a dead end street. Police stopped the vehicle that they were driving. Mr Jefferys and Mr Burfitt got out of the stolen Hilux and ran away. 

4Mr Jefferys did not give himself up quietly either. He was being chased through some streets when he turned around and ran straight at a female constable causing her to fall backwards and causing the offender to fall over. He got up and ran away again but he was caught up by the female constable, who forced him to the ground. Other police arrived. The offender continued to struggle until eventually he gave up. Mr Burfitt on the other hand gave up a bit more quietly after he had been discovered hiding in some residential premises. 

5As a result of all that criminal activity the offenders face a number of offences. Mr Jefferys has been charged with and pleaded guilty at an early opportunity to an offence of stealing the motor vehicle, that carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. He has been charged with the offence of aggravated break enter and steal, the circumstance of aggravation being relied on by the Crown is that he was in company with Mr Burfitt. That is an offence that carries a maximum penalty of twenty years with a five year standard non-parole period. That standard non-parole period is of course not of direct application because of the plea of guilty, but it remains as an important guidepost to the sentence I should impose. Mr Jefferys also pleaded guilty to an offence of not stopping and driving dangerously during a police pursuit, an offence that carries a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment. 

6There is also a matter on a 166 certificate, that is an offence of driving whilst disqualified because Mr Jefferys in fact was a disqualified driver at the time of these offences. As well as those offences there are two offences on a Form 1, that Form 1 being attached to the aggravated break enter and steal offence. Those Form 1 offences are resisting an officer in the execution of her duty and possessing housebreaking implements. 

7Turning now to Mr Burfitt. He also has pleaded guilty to an offence of aggravated break enter and steal. He is not charged with stealing the motor vehicle or driving dangerously during a police pursuit, but is charged with being carried in a conveyance taken without the consent of the owner. That is an offence with a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. He also has two matters on the Form 1 attached to his offence of aggravated break enter and steal, they being possessing housebreaking implements and entering enclosed lands. 

8Mr Jefferys is currently in custody. He was arrested on 10 August but has been serving a sentence for an unrelated matter, that sentence will expire on 8 August this year and so it is agreed that I should commence any sentence I impose upon him from 9 August, of course taking into account the principle of totality. The sentence that Mr Jefferys is currently serving is for a driving whilst disqualified offence. He was in fact on a suspended sentence for that matter at the time of committing this offence as well as being on bail for other offences. Mr Burfitt was also on conditional liberty at the time. In his case he was on a twelve month s 9 bond for two counts of destroy or damage property as well as being on bail. 

9Before I turn to the subjective features of each offender I should say something about the objective gravity of the offence carrying a standard non-parole period. I find that it is significantly below the middle of the range of objective gravity for offences of this type. In that regard of course I take into account in particular that the circumstance of aggravation relied on by the Crown, namely that the two offenders were in company, is one of the least serious of the circumstances of aggravation that can apply, and that the indictable offence the offenders committed, namely stealing, is also one of the least serious offences that can be committed. The two offenders, I have found, did not expect there to be anyone in the premises and they were attempting to take property from non-residential premises, thus the items they intended to take would have had no sentimental value. Another matter of course is that whilst the concept of asportation provides that the offenders committed the offence of stealing, as I have mentioned they had to leave the cigarettes behind when they were surprised by the staff members. 

10There are other circumstances not present which would make the offences more serious, those having been discussed in the case of R v Ponfield [1999] 48 NSWLR 327 . This was not a case of repeat incursions. There was no harm inflicted upon any person and the offence does not appear to have been accompanied by significant damage. The only damage caused seems to have been occasioned when the offenders gained entry to the premises. 

11Mr Jefferys is now forty years of age. He has a lengthy criminal history but for relatively less serious matters, almost all concerning driving. Indeed this appears to be the first occasion on which he has been dealt with in the District Court. He has served sentences of imprisonment in the past, the last sentence before his present period of incarceration ending in 2003. He is a man who, I think it is fair to say, never expected to find himself in his present predicament after leaving gaol in 2003 and doing much that he can be proud of, including setting up his own business. I will return later to the circumstances in which these crimes were committed later. 

12The offender is one of four children. His parents separated when he was about seven and he has only seen his biological father once since then. Mr Jefferys' mother formed a new relationship. Mr Jefferys' stepfather was not only physically abusive but also a gambler and he encouraged Mr Jefferys to commit crime so that he could support his gambling. His mother was also a gambler and at one stage they had to move houses, as his mother had lost the house that they owned. As his criminal history reveals, he commenced committing crimes at a relatively young age. He left school in Year 11 because he realised that he was wasting his time. He was often disciplined at school because of his disruptive behaviour. He has had a number of relationships, some of which have been to Mr Jefferys' detriment. But his children remain very supportive of him, and indeed they are present in Court as I speak. 

13Mr Jefferys commenced drinking alcohol at the age of thirteen at which stage he also first tried cannabis. He has experimented with other drugs, in particular amphetamine in its various guises, including ice. He has perhaps more than most had to deal with some distressing events in his life. Let me illustrate that by explaining what happened after Mr Jefferys left gaol in 2003. He started a business, recognising that he had had enough of committing crimes. Initially he was in fencing but then moved to excavation. He was able to finance some equipment and was earning good money. He did commit a driving offence in 2006 but apart from that he was living a law abiding life and, most importantly, he was staying away from drugs. 

14However, things went dramatically downhill. Mr Jefferys said he simply fell apart when his best mate committed suicide and he split up from his partner. He stopped going to work, eventually selling the machinery at a loss. He now recognises that he should have, despite these challenges, stayed away from drugs, but in the weeks leading up to the offence he said he was on drugs all the time. At that time he had been selling off his tools in order to finance his drug habit, but at the time of the offence he had nothing left to sell. 

15He has plans for his release from custody. He intends to pick up where he left off. There is material before the Court suggesting that Mr Jefferys is a good worker, at least when he is not using drugs, and I expect that if he wanted he would have no trouble getting further employment upon his release from custody. He is remorseful for what he has done. As I mentioned he left gaol in the belief that he would never return, but his remorse is not only for the circumstances that he now finds himself in. I am satisfied that he has accepted responsibility for his offending and its effect upon the victims of it. I cannot say that there are good prospects for the offender's rehabilitation, much will depend on how he responds to the challenges he will no doubt face in the future. The problem with drug addiction is that it is not an easy matter to overcome. There will be aspects of Mr Jefferys' life upon his release from custody which will lead him to be tempted to take drugs again. There are indications that there is substantial hope for the future and substantial hope that Mr Jefferys will respond in a more positive way to those challenges than he did in the time leading up to his commission of these offences. 

16The principle of totality applies, not only to the fact that the sentences I will shortly announce are accumulative on an existing sentence but also as regards each of the offences I must sentence Mr Jefferys for today. Perhaps the best way that I can give effect to that principle is to make the sentences for the driving offences, including the stealing motor vehicle offence, concurrent, but accumulate the sentence for the aggravated break enter and steal on top of those offences. Because of the offender's plea of guilty each sentence will be twenty-five per cent less than it would otherwise had been. 

17I make a finding of special circumstances in Mr Jefferys' case. The fact that in 2003 he was able to work for a number of years and not get seriously into trouble with drugs does suggest prospects for the offender's rehabilitation. But in this regard it more importantly suggests the need for an extended period of supervision whilst on parole. In discussing the appropriate sentence to impose upon Mr Jefferys with his lawyer, Ms Hawkins, attention was focused on the possibility of referring the offender to the Drug Court for assessment as to the possibility that he could be subject to a compulsory drug treatment order. I would not want anyone to think that that was the starting point of the sentence I should impose. It is, of course, my task to determine the appropriate sentence without looking at the criteria for eligibility for a compulsory drug treatment order and only if it turns out that the offender is eligible for such an order should I refer him. Nevertheless, sentences that would make the offender eligible were, in the submission of both the Crown and Ms Hawkins, appropriate in the circumstances of this case. 

18I should say something about parity. It does not really apply at this stage because of the order that I will ultimately make in the case of Mr Burfitt, who will not be finally sentenced today. So I cannot really take into account any question of Mr Jefferys feeling a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence imposed upon him with a sentence imposed upon Mr Burfitt because I do not know what the sentence of Mr Burfitt will be. I will sentence Mr Jefferys at the end of these remarks. 

19I now turn to the case of Mr Burfitt. He has a shorter criminal history than Mr Jefferys but one which has more serious offending on it. In particular, there is an offence of aggravated robbery and inflict actual bodily harm for which he received a significant period of imprisonment in 2007. And given the most serious offence committed by the offender for which I must sentence him today there is the significant circumstance that he has earlier committed an offence of break enter and steal. He received imprisonment for that offence from the Liverpool Local Court. 

20He has been under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service on many occasions. The pre-sentence report tendered in his case reads this way: 

""All sources agree that Mr Burfitt's previous response to supervision has been superficial. His performance has been marked by non-compliance, ongoing drug use and re-offence"". 

21Despite that rather gloomy assessment there is one particular matter which has led to me deciding, without opposition from the Crown or opposition from Mr Fung who appeared for Mr Burfitt, to adjourn this matter under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . That matter is this. The offender was in custody bail refused for seven months and twenty days. He made efforts to find a place in a residential rehabilitation program at the Glen Centre. He was released from custody and commenced the residential rehabilitation program until he was asked to leave because he acted aggressively towards a staff member. Notwithstanding that conduct the evidence is that the Glen Centre will have him back. Indeed, the letter says, ""We are happy to accept Daniel back into our program for another opportunity."" 

22Mr Burfitt is much younger than Mr Jefferys, he is twenty-four years of age. He, as I mentioned earlier, committed this offence in circumstances where he was a heavy user of the drug, ice. The Probation and Parole officer has noted a significant physical change in the offender. Although he says that he was unable to conduct urine analysis, he does note that the offender has gained at least twenty kilograms since his last entry into custody which would support his contention of current abstinence from amphetamines. The offender's desire and willingness and indeed enthusiasm to enter further residential rehabilitation is indicative, I am satisfied, of a genuine wish that he put drug use behind him. If he can do that then not only does Mr Burfitt benefit but so does the community. He is a relatively young man and if I can fashion orders which have the effect of rehabilitating Mr Burfitt then the community benefits to a significant extent. 

23Of course, rehabilitation is not the only matter which I have to consider. I must also ensure that Mr Burfitt is punished not only as a personal deterrent to him but also as a means of general deterrence so that others in the community who might be tempted to commit offences such as this are deterred from doing so. In this regard, I note that the offender has done seven months and twenty days in actual custody, a number of months in quasi custody and it is envisaged that he will do more time in quasi custody by the time he comes back before me to be finally sentenced. It could not be said therefore that the offender has thus far gone completely unpunished for his offending. He too expressed his remorse in evidence today and accepts that he needs to deal not only with his illicit drug use but other aspects of his behaviour, including in particular the need to manage his anger. In this regard it is important to note that whilst the offender's partner has stated her willingness to maintain a relationship if Mr Burfitt remains abstinent of illicit drugs, the offender will need to do more than that. The pre-sentence report says that the relationship has been seen as dysfunctional and characterised by domestic violence and disharmony. The offender will need to work on this aspect of his life as well as his drug use, although in truth they are probably interrelated. 

24I should mention also that the offender also pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity so he is entitled to the maximum discount for the utilitarian benefit of his plea. In his case, I will not quantify it because it is one of the factors that has led to me doing what I will shortly announce, that is, remand the offender pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . 

25The sentences I impose on Mr Jefferys are therefore these. Mr Jefferys would you mind standing up please. For the offence of stealing a motor vehicle, driving dangerously during a police pursuit and driving whilst disqualified, I sentence Mr Jefferys to imprisonment for a fixed term of one year to date from 9 August 2011. That is a fixed term because of the sentence I will announce on the other matter. On the offence of aggravated break enter and steal the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of one year to date from 9 August 2012 and a head sentence of three years. The overall sentence is thus one consisting of a non-parole period of two years with a head sentence of four years to date from 9 August 2011. I refer Mr Jefferys to the Drug Court for consideration as to the making of a compulsory drug treatment order. Thank you, Mr Jefferys, you can sit down. 

26In Mr Burfitt's case, I remand him until, 18 November. 

27I order an updated pre-sentence report for that date. I remand Mr Burfitt under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . 

28The conditions of Mr Burfitt's remand are these: He is to be of good behaviour. Unless he is at the Glen Centre as part of the residential rehabilitation program he hopes to enter he is to live at an address provided to the Court. He is to use all his endeavours to obtain admission to the Glen Centre residential rehabilitation program and if accepted he is to obey all of the requirements imposed upon him by that rehabilitation centre. He is to use no illicit drugs whatsoever. 

29If he is not accepted into the Glen Centre rehabilitation program by 30 July he is to bring this to the attention of the Court and have the matter immediately re-listed before me. 

30Mr Jefferys, I have just got to do one other matter with you that just concerns your disqualification. For the offence of disqualified driver appearing on the 166 certificate and for the offence of not stopping and driving dangerously in the police pursuit the offender is disqualified from driving for a period of three years. That period to be served concurrently and to date from the expiry of the last period of disqualification to which the offender is subject, if that has already expired then the disqualification is to date from today.

		26 September 2011",2011-06-29 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709526,Kizzy McCLAIN v R [2011] NSWCCA 191,"Judgment 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The Court does not want to hear from you madam Crown. We are in a position to give judgement and I will ask Hidden J to give the first judgement. 

2HIDDEN J: The applicant, Kizzy McClain, pleaded guilty in the District Court to attempted armed robbery. She was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months to commence on 4 January 2010. She is to be released on parole on 3 July 2011, that is, in three days time. She seeks leave to appeal against her sentence. 

3She is a young aboriginal woman. She was 21 years old when the offence was committed. On 23 August 2009 she went into a store in Belfield, where she was a regular customer, presented a knife and demanded money. Staff at the store resisted and she was forced from the premises and made her escape. She was affected apparently by a cocktail of drugs, methadone and benzodiazepines. The offence was anything but sophisticated, but was, nonetheless, a serious one. 

4She has a minor criminal history but it is of significance that she was on a s 9 bond at the time for stealing from a dwelling. She has a very disturbed background, which elicits sympathy. It need not be recited. In the light of that background it is not surprising that she developed, from a young age, a major drug and alcohol problem. She has exhibited symptoms of depression and anxiety and, from time to time, has been treated for them. 

5Put shortly, the application before us complained that the sentencing judge failed to give the weight it deserved to evidence of the applicant's mental condition, both as a matter bearing upon the objective gravity of the offence and as a matter in her subjective background properly to be taken into account in mitigation of the sentence. 

6The material bearing upon mental illness is spare, to say the least. There was a psychological report before his Honour, which records that shortly before the offence the applicant had been admitted to Macquarie Hospital, apparently having taken an excess of Xanax tablets. The psychologist suggests that this indicated that her psychological state at the time of the offence may have been unstable and she may have been suffering from mental health symptoms shortly before the offence. To the psychologist the applicant said that at the time of the offence she was ""no way in her right mind,"" her head was ""all over the place,"" it was ""scattered,"" it was ""hopeless."" She described herself as being in a stage of life where she did not know what she was doing. 

7Upon her arrest and being taken into custody, she was placed on anti-depressant and anti-psychotic medication. What is urged upon us is that this material raises the principles governing the bearing of mental illness upon sentence examined in familiar authorities such as R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. 

8The sentencing judge noted that the applicant described experiencing some mental health issues at the time of the offence but expressed himself satisfied, on the material before him, that she committed the offence as a result of her intoxication by the substances to which I have referred. That finding was clearly open to his Honour. 

9It is complained in this application that his Honour did not adequately express his reasons for that finding, given the limited evidence of psychological or mental disturbance emerging from the material. It appears to me that his Honour's reasons were entirely adequate. The material really did not raise the principles of mental health bearing upon sentence. There was no need for his Honour to expand upon his reasons any more than he did, and it is important to bear in mind the pressure under which District Court judges work when dealing with sentence matters and the need for them to be succinct and brief in giving their reasons. 

10His Honour also said that the applicant's use of drugs at the time of the offence was not a mitigating matter, although it provided an explanation of how the offence came to be committed. Again, in my view that was all that was required to be said in the circumstances. No doubt the applicant's addiction to drugs was a matter arising from her personal circumstances and her background, matters outside her control, and entitled her to a measure of mitigation of sentence on that account, but it appears to me, looking at his Honour's remarks as a whole, that he was sensitive to her background and the contribution that it made to the drug and alcohol addiction which bedevilled her at the time of this offence. No more was required in his reasons to deal with that issue, in my view. 

11In other respects his Honour appears to have had appropriate regard to the applicant's background. He noted encouraging signs, notwithstanding that terrible background, pointing to the prospects of her rehabilitation. He took account of her need for counselling and drug and alcohol rehabilitation and found special circumstances, he observed her to be remorseful and he gave appropriate recognition to her plea of guilty. In arriving at the sentence his Honour expressly had regard to the guidelines of R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 and counsel for the applicant in this Court acknowledged that the sentence which his Honour passed is relatively low when one has regard to that guideline. 

12Mr Brady, who appeared for the applicant in this Court, did not appear in the sentence proceedings. He has urged, competently and fully, certain matters on the applicant's behalf and I note that those matters do not appear to have been raised before his Honour by way of submission in the sentence proceedings. 

13Put shortly, I can find no error in his Honour's approach to the question of sentence. I have already observed that the applicant will be released on parole in a matter of days and she will then have the benefit of 18 months of supervision at liberty to aid in her rehabilitation. In no way has justice miscarried in this case. 

14I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 

15McCLELLAN CJ at CL: This is yet another case in which counsel, who did not appear at the sentence hearing, comes to this Court to raise issues which were not raised before the sentencing judge. 

16This Court is a court of error. It has had to make clear on many occasions in relation particularly to sentence appeals that it is important to bear in mind that this Court will be mindful of the way a case was presented to the sentencing judge below. Furthermore, it is necessary to say in this case that the sentencing judge both heard the sentence matters and delivered his remarks on sentence and sentenced the applicant on the same day. In that context his Honour has referred to the relevant material and this Court will assume when reference is made to that material that, having regard to the submissions made before the sentencing judge, the matter has been appropriately considered. 

17This Court will not apply a fine toothed comb approach and ""pick"" over the remarks on sentence delivered by a District Court judge in the course of a day when, undoubtedly, more than one sentence matter came before the judge. Hidden J has analysed the submissions and I am grateful for his reasons in that respect. However, this is an application which, in my view, must be rejected and firmly rejected. It is an application which, in my view, should not be given leave to appeal. I would refuse leave. 

18HALL J: I agree with the order proposed. I would only add the following, that the issue of mental health of the applicant at the time of the offence was one addressed to the court in a report by the psychologist on 21 May 2010. 

19There was evidence, firstly, of the applicant's admission to Macquarie Hospital on two occasions in 2009 and again some days before the offence after the applicant had engaged in what was described as a binge of Xanax tablets, followed by the assessment made by mental health staff at Mulawa Correctional Centre. Additionally, there is the fact that the medical staff prescribed, amongst other medication, antidepressant medication for the applicant. 

20I have been concerned in this application as to whether there was any appellable error and have considered, particularly, whether the failure by the sentencing judge to find mental illness as a causal element was an appellable error and, if so, whether this Court should intervene . 

21It is clear, however, that the sentencing judge did consider the issue of the applicant's mental health at the relevant time and I refer in that regard to the observations made about that subject on p.7 of the remarks on sentence. The brevity of the sentencing judge's reference and comments to the mental health issue is explicable when regard is had to the nature and the manner in which the issues were pursued at the hearing before the sentencing judge. 

22There was no submission made that the sentencing judge was required to apply the R v Engert (supra) principles in favour of the applicant. 

23In all the circumstances I do not consider that appellable error has been made out in respect of Ground 1. 

24In respect of Ground 2 I respectfully agree with the remarks that have been made by Hidden J. Accordingly, I concur with the orders proposed. I would agree that, in the circumstances, leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal dismissed. 

25McCLELLAN CJ at CL: That will be the order of the court.

		19 August 2011",2011-06-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2709528,R v Smith [No 3] [2011] NSWSC 728,"Judgment 

Introduction 

1The accused, Darren Paul Smith, is charged with having murdered Russell Lyons at Fairfield on 3 June 1995. At the end of the Crown case, Ms Yehia SC who appears on behalf of the accused, made an application that I direct the jury to acquit the accused. On 30 June 2011 I refused the application. What follows were my reasons for doing so. 

2The deceased's body was located in a carpark at the end of a laneway which runs off Smart Street in Fairfield at about 8.40 am on 3 June 1995. According to Dr Ellis, who conducted the post-mortem, his death was caused by head injuries with alcohol toxicity said to have been a contributing factor. The deceased was fully clothed but his shoes and wallet were missing. Despite a lengthy police investigation, it was not until 7 June 2009 that the accused was arrested. Indeed, he only came to the attention of investigating police when a DNA profile matching his profile connected him to the crime scene. His DNA profile was only entered on the national database in 2008 following his apprehension in Queensland on a trivial matter. Following analysis, a match was made between his profile and DNA material that was located inside each shoe of a pair of Adidas running shoes. The shoes themselves were located on 5 June 1995 a short distance from where the deceased's body was found. Also found on the shoes was blood staining which matched the deceased's DNA profile. A DNA profile matching that of the accused was also located in the area of the rear right pocket of the jeans which the deceased was wearing when his body was discovered. The Crown case is that the accused killed the deceased during the course of robbing him of his shoes and wallet. The Crown also asserts that the Adidas shoes had been worn by the accused but had then been discarded when the accused realised that the deceased's blood has found its way onto them as a result of the fatal attack. 

3The Crown alleges that some hours prior to the discovery of the deceased's body, the accused had attempted to steal the deceased's wallet during an altercation which had occurred on The Crescent, Fairfield at about 3.30 am. That incident was witnessed by the deceased's friends and drinking companions, John Byrne and Ian Cross. Their evidence was to the effect that they had been out at various drinking establishments that evening in the company of the deceased and that they were making their way home at the time that the incident occurred. The uncontradicted evidence is that each of them was extremely intoxicated at the time. Both gave evidence that the deceased had crossed The Crescent when they heard him call out words to the effect of ""He's got my wallet"". Their evidence is that they then ran across the road in order to assist the deceased. His assailant was described by them as being an Australian with a goatee beard. Shortly thereafter three males described as being of ""Islander"" appearance joined in the altercation. The Crown case is that the deceased eventually ran from the scene of the altercation whereupon he turned into Smart Street. From there he ended up in the carpark to which I referred earlier. It was at that location, the Crown asserts, that the deceased received the fatal injuries having been pursued there by the accused. 

The relevant legal principles 

4In R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74 Gleeson CJ, with whom Maxwell and Wood JJ agreed, determined that a trial judge does not have the power to direct a verdict of acquittal when the trial judge assesses that the evidence is such that a verdict of guilt based upon it would be unsafe and unsatisfactory. 

5In Doney v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207 the High Court approved that statement of principle. The Court went on to say: 

It follows that, if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty. [at 214-5] 

6In R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39 the question which was posed for the Court's determination was ""is a trial judge entitled to direct a jury to enter a verdict of acquittal at the end of a Crown case based on circumstantial evidence on the basis that the Crown could not negative all reasonable inferences which were inconsistent with the guilt of the accused?"" (at 40) 
7Lee CJ at CL, with whom Carruthers and Finlay JJ agreed, said: 

On the view then that a judge in a case of circumstantial evidence cannot direct a verdict of acquittal if there is evidence in support of the Crown case upon which the accused can be convicted, even though a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence can be formulated, the present case requires that the question asked must be answered in the negative. (at 44) 

8For a recent analysis of the relevant authorities see R v JM (2010) 202 A Crim R 465 per Refshauge J at 472-3. 

9For completeness I should observe that Ms Yehia referred in her submissions to a number of other decisions, including R v PL [2009] NSWCCA 256 and R v El Masri (No 2) [2010] NSWSC 1327. I do not regard it as necessary to make any further reference to those decisions because they each proceeded upon the basis of the well-settled principles to which I have just referred. Moreover, each of those decisions ultimately turned upon an analysis of the evidence adduced in the particular case. 

The accused's submissions 

10In advancing the application, counsel for the accused relied upon various parts of the evidence given by three of the Crown witnesses. The first of those witnesses was Ian Cross, who as I have said, witnessed the events on The Crescent. The parts of his evidence upon which reliance was placed are set out below: 

Q. Your group, with these Maori three, are still in the area you say of the Crazy Prices store? 
A. Yes, we were all arguing. 

Q. You, John Byrne, Russell Lyons continued to argue with the three Maori people? 
A. Yes. 

Q. It was then that that Maori fellow with the dreadlocks assaulted Russell? 
A. Yes. 

Q. He punched him a couple of times? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And you could see that Russell was hurt and bleeding? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Is the next thing that you saw of Russell was that he was further down The Crescent near the corner where The Crescent intersects with Smart Street? 
A. Yes. 

Q. So you look up, you see Russell Lyons down near that corner. Correct? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And the islander with the dreadlocks is with Russell near that corner? 
A. Yes. 

Q. You and John Byrne are still up near the area of Crazy Prices store? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And you are still confronted by the other two Maori men. Is that right? 
A. That's right. 

Q. There was an argument still going on between you and Mr Byrne and the two Maori Men. Correct? 
A. Correct. 

Q. When you looked down to the corner of The Crescent and Smart Street and saw Russell Lyons with the Maori man with the dreadlocks, you could see that the Maori man with the dreadlocks was belting into Russell Lyons? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And it was quite a savage attack by the Maori man with the dreadlocks on Russell, wasn't it? 
A. Yes I think so. 

Q. You could see that Russell was bleeding? 
A. Yes, he was bleeding before he left us. 

11The second witness was Dr Ellis. The parts of his evidence which are relied upon are set out below: 

Q. If in this case that (sic) the subdural haemorrhage was caused as a result of somebody punching the deceased, could one punch, one single punch cause that type of injury? 
A. Yes. 
Q. What sort of force would be required if it was one punch that caused that subdural haemorrhage? 
A. A bit difficult to be specific because it's not necessarily the amount of force, but the way it's delivered. Because if I go back to the analogy or the description of the head moving and the brain moving, what you actually have is a (sic) like a rotating motion of the head. The head is obviously fixed on the neck so it can move essentially forwards and backwards, a little less from side to side. It can't move up and down, so it rotates backwards and forwards. 

If the force applied causes the head to move backwards and forwards, that's the force that's most likely to give you a subdural. Clearly, if it was a blow, a punch causing that, then clearly the bigger the blow in that direction, the more likely you are to get a subdural haemorrhage. If you were to strike the head from the side, the motion is not quite the same and you're much less likely to get haemorrhage. It's not so much the amount of the force, but it's the way the force is delivered. 

Q. So if it was a punch that was delivered to the face of the deceased, could that be sufficient to cause a subdural haemorrhage? 
A. Yes it could. 

Q. Is it reasonably possible that the deceased could have suffered the subdural haemorrhage but not immediately become unconscious? 
A. Yes it is. It depends on what's caused the subdural. If a big punch caused the subdural, that big punch may have delivered enough force to actually cause the brain to malfunction by itself, effectively independent of the actual haemorrhage. In which case unconsciousness would occur pretty well straight away. If unconsciousness occurs because of the subdural alone, the subdural can take some time to develop and so we see this in boxers, you see this in other people, they may suffer trauma but then over a period of time which may be hours, they get increasing drowsiness and increasing headache and ultimately, they become unconscious and die. 

The only thing you find at autopsy is subdural haemorrhage. Clearly it can take a long time. There's no way by looking at the haemorrhage, to say how long that took. I don't know how long this haemorrhage took to develop, it could have happened in a small space of minutes, could have happened in half an hour or so, maybe even longer. 

Q. (Dr Ellis shown exhibit A.) What you're being shown in exhibit A is a map of the area depicting The Crescent which is one of the main streets in Fairfield? 
A. Yes. 
Q. And also depicting the location of the car park at the end of the lane way where Mr Lyons was found? 
A. Yes. 

Q. I think you yourself attended at that location, so you're familiar with it? 
A. I did, yes. 

Q. Just to get your bearings, do you see on exhibit A that you have there, an area that's depicted by a red star? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And it is across the road from an area that is labelled ""arcade""? 
A. Yes I can see that. 

Q. Then there is a red dotted line that heads towards The Crescent? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And do you see then that there is a road that intersects with The Crescent which is Smart Street? 
A. Yes. 

Q. The red dotted line continues on into Smart Street, into the laneway and into the car park where the deceased was found? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Firstly, keeping those locations in mind, I want to put this scenario to you Dr Ellis, if there is evidence that the deceased was punched twice at the location where we see the red star? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And we also have evidence that the deceased was punched on a further two occasions at the corner of The Crescent and Smart Street? 
A. I understand. 

Q. If any of those or one of those punches caused the subdural haemorrhage, is it reasonably possible that the deceased could have made his way into the car park area and collapsed there? 
A. By ""made his way"", you mean walk or run? 

Q. Walked or run? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Is that a reasonable possibility? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Is it reasonably possible that having made his way into the car park area, that he could have fallen to the ground in that area causing the broken nose? 
A. Yes. 

Q. I think you saw the deceased in situ with the pooling of blood underneath him? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And the blood that you saw, could that be consistent with the broken nose? 
A. You said the blood I saw. Do you mean blood on the body, blood on the ground or on the wall? 

Q. Blood on the ground? 
A. Because there was some blood on the wall and I made a brief reference to it. It wasn't my job to do a detailed examination of it. But it was certainly on the ground. The other thing we must not forget he was face down and obviously like that since death. That will cause a pooling of blood and if there's an injury, that can continue to ooze even if the heart has stopped. It's certainly consistent with a broken nose, yes. 

Q. Is it reasonably possible that the deceased fell on to the ground in the car park causing the broken nose and bleeding, that he then could have tried to lift himself to get up and fallen again in that area? 
A. I couldn't exclude that possibility, yes. 

12The third and final witness was Detective Flippence, who gave evidence in which he interpreted blood spatter patterns on the ground and on the wall adjacent to where the deceased's body had been located. The parts of his evidence which are relied upon are set out below: 

Q. I give you this scenario. The deceased was bleeding to the face and has simply fallen to the ground without any involvement of any second party. Is that consistent with the blood spatter pattern that you represented in this photogrammetry plan? 
A. It may be. 

Q. Can you explain why it may be? 
A. Well, the deceased would have to have blood on his face and the deceased falling on the ground represents a blood event which is a sudden downward force. 

Q. If there was an absence of blood on the front of the jumper of the deceased but large amounts of blood on the arm, does that affect your answer? 
A. Yes. 

Q. How 
A. I would say for somebody to be standing there and bleeding to a medium to large extent on his face he would almost certainly have blood underneath the chin and collar and upper chest area of the jumper. The blood on the arms is contact staining and is as a result of the deceased, whilst bleeding, having his arms underneath his face as he does when he was found. 

Q. The jumper itself you haven't seen? 
A. No. 

Q. It's the photos that you have seen? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Could you have a look at photograph 76, please. Photograph 76 shows the front of the jumper worn by the deceased. This is one of the photographs you have looked at, is it? 
A. Yes. 

Q. What can you say about the staining, if anything, on the front of the jumper as we can see it there? 
A. The staining is minimal. There is an area up on the right shoulder between the collar and the top of the arm which is a contact stain. And on the upper left chest area there is, what I can easily say is a squarish type contact stain, and there is some minor staining underneath those areas but nothing major. 

Q. Any of those stains caused by blood dripping down the face just as a result of gravity. That is, from the deceased having been in a standing position and bleeding on to the front of the jumper? 
A. One or two may but the rest are contact staining. ... 

Q. Ex G1 is a smaller more manageable photocopy. Use either of the two if you need to answer this. That wall that was in front of the deceased's head has that 'no parking' sign on it, the spatter pattern that was there, what was the blood event that caused that pattern? 
A. On the wall, the blood event was as a result of the sharp downward force of the deceased's head on the concrete. 

Q. Are you able to say what kind of force would have created that pattern? 
A. It could have been a number of things. Could have been somebody stomping on the back of the deceased's head, could have been the deceased lying down trying to get up losing consciousness and coming back down on the concrete, could have been the deceased falling. As long as he had the blood that was evident on his face and/or on the concrete underneath. ... 

Q. Are those two areas that you've described consistent with a movement by the deceased himself, a movement of his arms himself, if the sleeves of his jumper were blood stained? 
A. The stain under the left elbow moving in an upward direction I would say is consistent with that. But the stain on the right, I can't say whether it is consistent with him moving or him being moved. That's what I'm saying. 

Q. So it could be you can't exclude the reasonable possibility that the stain on the right was made as a result of movement by him? 
A. That's correct, yes. 

Q. That's one of two explanations? 
A. Yes. 

Q. But it could be - it's reasonably possible that both the wiped, if I can call them wiped stains that you saw to the left and to the right of his elbows were caused by his own movement? 
A. It could have been. 

Q. That would have had to have been the obviously after he was bleeding? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Because it would mean that his sleeves would have had to have been bloodied, the sleeves of the jumper would have been bloodied; correct? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Can I as (sic) you this Detective Flippence: If the deceased had fallen to the concrete as a result of a sudden movement downward and caused an injury to his face that bled, if he was there for a time so that he was bleeding and the blood pooled on to the ground underneath him and he then tried to move himself so that he could get up and fell again on to the concrete ground, could that have caused the blood to spatter that we see on the ground immediately in front of him and on the Besser block wall? 
A. Yes. 

13The significance of the evidence of Ian Cross, so it was submitted, was that ""the only direct evidence of an assault upon the deceased is that the Islander male punched the deceased a couple of times near Crazy Clints and again at the corner of Smart Street and the Crescent."" (emphasis added) 

14It was then submitted that the evidence of Dr Ellis demonstrated that he was unable to exclude the reasonable possibility of each of the following propositions: 


the punch or punches inflicted upon the deceased on The Crescent could have caused the subdural haemorrhage (which it seems was the fatal injury); 

the deceased may not have fallen into an unconscious state immediately upon being punched; 

the deceased may have then made his way to the car park; 

the deceased may have fallen on to the concrete thereby causing the fracture to his nose; 

the fracture to the nose may have caused the pooled blood which was underneath the deceased's face; and 

the deceased may have tried to raise himself up before once again falling onto the concrete. 

15It was submitted that Detective Flippence had accepted that it was reasonably possible that the blood spatter patterns could be explained upon the basis of the scenario which I have just outlined. 

16The ultimate submission which was advanced on behalf of the accused was couched in the following terms: 

In the present case, it is submitted that there is positive evidence adduced in the Crown case that the deceased was assaulted by another person and that the blow inflicted was capable of causing the fatal injury. 

The Crown case, taken at its highest, is that the accused is the Australian male with the goatee, that he wore the Adidas shoes, and that he robbed the deceased of his shoes and wallet. However, there is no evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed, could find that an act of the accused caused the fatal injury [that is, as opposed to the assault upon the deceased by the Islander male]. 

The Crown's submissions 

17The Crown Prosecutor referred to other parts of the evidence given by Ian Cross concerning his observations of the deceased having been struck. He relied upon the following parts of his evidence in chief: 

Q. What happened then? 
A. I think Russell got hit then. Not sure. 

Q. Do you remember who it was that hit Russell? 
A. The bloke with the dreadlocks. 

Q. Do you remember how he hit Russell? 
A. No, I don't. 

Q. Do you know where he hit Russell? By that I mean, what part of Russell's body was hit? 
A. I think his face. 

Q. Where was Russell standing, relative to that Crazy Prices' store you told us about when he was hit by the man with the dreadlocks? 
A. I think he was in front of Crazy Prices. 

... 

Q. So, after Russell was hit, what happened next? 
A. Just arguing and that and then I noticed Russell was up on the corner of the next pub , that Crescent pub. 

Q. That's the name of the pub, is it, The Crescent? 
A. Yes, on the corner. 

Q. Did you see Russell doing anything up at the corner? 
A. Trying to get away. 

Q. From who? 
A. The dreadlocks bloke. 

Q. And did he get away from the bloke with the dreadlocks? 
A. Yes, he did. 

Q. Where did Russell go? 
A. Around the corner. 

Q. Did you see him again? 
A. No, I didn't. 

Q. The man with the dreadlocks, what happened to him? 
A. Came back to us. 

Q. Where was the man with the goatee beard? 
A. Don't know. 

Q. Did you see him again that night? 
A. No, I didn't. 


18The Crown Prosecutor also relied upon the following parts of his evidence given in re-examination: 

Q. You said that Russell was bleeding ""before he left us"". From where was he bleeding? 
A. His mouth. 

Q. How much blood was there coming from his mouth? 
A. Just like, you know, when you cut your lip and it just bleeds down. 

Q. What about his clothes, did you see any blood on his clothes? 
A. I don't think so. 

Q. It was suggested to you in a question [in cross-examination], that it was a savage attack on Russell by the man with dreadlocks close to when you last saw Russell Lyons. Your answer was I think so. Would you explain what you mean by that answer ""I think so""? 
A . I don't understand , what do you mean by savage and just from getting hit? 

Q. What I'm asking you is what you understand that to mean and why it is that you've given the answer ""I think so"" and what you mean by that? 
A. (No verbal reply.) 

Q. Perhaps if I ask you what is it that you saw, you agreed that you saw something like the man with dreadlocks belting into Russell. What is it you saw? 
A. He gave him a couple more hits up in that corner. 

Q. What part of his body? 
A. Face, I think. 

Q. You said a couple more? 
A. Yes. 

Q. By a couple, do you mean two? 
A. Two. 

Q. Did you see those couple of punches connect with Russell Lyons? 
A. I think they did. 

19The Crown Prosecutor then referred to the following parts of the evidence given by John Byrne, the other eyewitness to the events which had occurred on The Crescent: 

Q. After he kicked the man that tried to steal Russell Lyons' wallet, what happened then? 
A. Then he kicked him, then he got up, the man that had a goatee kicked and said ""no we tried to take his wallet"". 

Q. So the kick, what followed from the kick was that the man fell down? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Where was he when he fell down? 
A. Near the footpath I think. 

Q. If he was near the footpath do you mean he was on the road when that happened? 
A. I can't remember exactly. 

Q. Was there any particular shop that was nearby at the time that you can remember? 
A. In the middle, in the intersection, I can't remember exactly where. 

Q. The entrance to that arcade? 
A. Yeah where the set of lights are, in the arcade-- 

Q. In that vicinity? 
A. Yes in there. 

Q. When that man said what you just told us he said then, about after he was kicked, what was the next thing that happened? 
A. Then the man with the dreadlocks kicked my friend Russell. 

Q. What part of Russell's body was kicked? 
A. In the leg I think. 

Q. What response was there from Russell when he was kicked in the leg? 
A. He went down, he went to the ground a bit and got back up. 

Q. Where was he standing when that happened, was he on the footpath or? 
A. I think on the road. 

Q. When Russell got back up, what did you see him do next? 
A. He ran off. 

Q. In which direction? 
A. Towards the police station. Down to the right, down the side street there is a police station down that way. 

Q. Do you know the name of that street? 
A. I can't remember the street. 

Q. Do you know what is on the corner? 
A. There is a pub on the corner. 

Q. Do you know the name of it? 
A. I am not sure. 

Q. Did you see Russell Lyons again? 
A. No. 

Q. The man with the goatee, did you see him? 
A. I see him run around the corner. 

Q. The same corner that Russell Lyons ran around? 
A. Yes. 

Q. What distance was there between the two of them? 
A. Oh, I am not sure, probably 20, 30 metres? 

Q. In between each other? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did you see that man with the goatee again? 
A. No. 

Q. The three men you referred to as islanders, where were they when Russell Lyons ran around that corner? 
A. They were in the middle of the road. 

Q. Those three Islander men, where were they when the man with the goatee ran around the corner at the same time? 
A. Yeah, middle of the road. 

Q. And what was happening in that middle of the road where those three Islander men were standing when that happened? 
A. They were over towards the taxis, we were on the other side of them, and Ian started walking back towards Hamilton Road and I said ""no I am getting a taxi"" so I turned around to go back to the taxi rank and the guy with the dreadlocks grabbed me and punched me twice. I put my hands up to defend myself and told him ""I don't want to fight I just want a taxi"". He let me go. I turned around and he was still walking towards Hamilton Road. I caught up to Ian, the taxi come round the corner and we jumped in the taxi. 

[...] 

Q. Where did the taxi go? 
A. We got the taxi to drive up the street we seen Russell go up and we got him to go really slow so we could look out for him. 

Q. Did you see Russell? 
A. No. 

Q. What about those Islander men, did you see those three Islander men when you were in the taxi? 
A. No. 

Q. Did you see anyone in the vicinity at the time when you were on that taxi moving along and around the corner? 
A. No. 

Q. What was Russell Lyons wearing the last time you saw him? A. White knitted jumper, and I think a new pair of shoes or something, I can't remember. 

Q. What colour were the shoes? 
A. I think they were white, I am not quite sure. 

Q. The man with the goatee beard, did you see him ever again? 
A. No. 

20The Crown Prosecutor submitted that, given that there were matters which affected his reliability, it was open to the jury not to accept that part of Ian Cross' evidence which concerned the blows that he said that he had witnessed having been administered to the deceased. Moreover, it was submitted that the jury was entitled to accept the evidence of John Byrne upon this aspect of the matter. It was submitted that if the jury proceeded in that fashion then it followed that there was nothing that had occurred during the course of the incident on The Crescent which could have accounted for the fatal injury. Alternatively, it was submitted that even if the jury was prepared to accept the evidence of Ian Cross that the deceased had been struck a blow or blows by the Islander man, then, it still would be entitled to conclude that the blow or blows caused only minor injuries. It was submitted, in those circumstances, that there would have been simply no scope for the scenario which was put to Dr Ellis to have any operation. Furthermore, it was submitted by the Crown that the jury was not, in any event, bound to accept only those aspects of the evidence of Dr Ellis and Detective Flippence upon which the accused sought to rely given the totality of their evidence. 

21The Crown readily accepted that its case was circumstantial in nature, since there was no direct evidence as to how the deceased had met his fate. The Crown submitted nonetheless that there was evidence capable of supporting a verdict of guilty. It relied upon the following strands of evidence in support of its contention: 

(a) the location of material consistent with the accused's DNA profile in three separate areas - namely in each of the Adidas shoes (upon which was also located the deceased's blood) and upon the deceased's jeans; 

(b) the evidence from which it could be inferred that the accused, as at 3 June 1995, matched the descriptions given by the eye-witnesses that the person who attempted to steal the deceased's wallet was an Australian male with a goatee beard; 

(c) the strong likelihood that the deceased was killed during the course of the theft of his property by the person who, only a short time before, had endeavoured unsuccessfully to take it; 

(d) those parts of the evidence of Dr Ellis and Detective Flippence which supported the proposition that the fatal injuries were inflicted in the area in which his body was located rather than on The Crescent; 

(e) the evidence that there was no trail of blood leading from The Crescent to where his body was located which supported the proposition that that is where he met his fate; 

(f) the evidence concerning the severity of the injuries which were inflicted to the deceased's face which were more severe than those that could have been anticipated from Ian Cross' description of the attack upon him by the unidentified Islander; 

(g) the evidence from which it could be inferred that at the time of the fatal incident the accused was living within walking distance of the crime scene with Ms Jodie Pritchard on The Horsley Drive, Fairfield and thus had the opportunity to commit the offence. 


Conclusion 

22Notwithstanding the valiant endeavours by counsel for the accused to suggest otherwise, in my view what has been advanced on this application is the formulation of a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence. That being so, the application must inevitably fail because it falls squarely with the principles enunciated in JMR (supra). Even if I am wrong in so characterising the nature of the application, I would have little hesitation in accepting the Crown's submission that the list of matters to which I have just referred, particularly when considered in combination would, in any event, warrant the matter being left to the jury for its decision.

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Grove AJ. 

2HIDDEN J: I agree with Grove AJ. 

3GROVE AJ: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Colefax DCJ at Sydney District Court. 

4The applicant had been committed for sentence following pleas of guilty in the Local Court to 3 charges of stealing from a person contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act 1900. That provision prescribes a maximum available penalty for a single offence of 14 years imprisonment. Without detailing orders for commencement and expiry, his Honour sentenced the applicant for the first offence to imprisonment for 2 years 3 months with a non parole period of 1 year 5 months 17 days; for the second offence to imprisonment for 1 year 10 months with a non parole period of 1 year 2 months 18 days and for the third offence to imprisonment for 3 years with a non parole period of 1 year 11 months 12 days. 

5It was common ground between counsel for the applicant and for the Crown that, allowing for orders of partial cumulation, the overall effective sentence was 3 years 11 months with a non parole period of 2 years 10 months 12 days. 

6The applicant appeared for sentence with a co-offender Jose Lues Rios and, as his Honour observed, the same facts related to them both. From an agreed statement he extracted this description of the offences: 

""The first offence occurred on 5 June 2008. On that day Mr Naime Mikael was aged seventy-nine years. He was doing his banking at the Commonwealth Bank at the Bankstown Shopping Centre. Mr Mikael withdrew $3,500 in cash from an account that he had at that bank. The money was to assist his son in Lebanon with medical expenses. 

After withdrawing the money Mr Mikael placed it in one of his trouser pockets and left the bank to walk to his car which was nearby. 

Whilst still within the shopping centre Mr Mikael felt a bump and someone touching his right side. He felt in his pocket. The money was gone. 

When police attended the scene they obtained access to CCTV footage which showed the offenders present in that part of the shopping centre where Mr Mikael had been robbed. This footage showed Mr Rios stepping in front of Mr Mikael causing him to stop and Ms Ruano then moving in and stealing the money. A third person (a male) named Carlos was seen to be helping her. A fourth person (Mr Augustine Bolanos who at one point was in the shopping centre with the other offenders) was waiting outside the shopping centre in his motor vehicle and drove the three other offenders from the scene. 

The second offence occurred on 28 May 2009. On that day Ms Fensury Wongjamrat was doing her banking in the St George Bank in Haymarket. Ms Wongjamrat was intending to make a deposit of an amount of $1,600. On entering the bank she sat on a seat in the public waiting area and counted the money she intended to deposit. When she finished that task, Ms Wongjamrat placed the money in an A4 envelope which in turn was placed in a small personal shopping cart. Mr Rios was lurking in the bank and watched Ms Wongjamrat counting her money. Whilst watching her Mr Rios made a mobile phone call to Ms Ruano who shortly thereafter entered the bank and had a conversation with Mr Rios. A third unknown person, a male, who was an associate of Mr Rios and Ms Ruano, also entered the branch at the same time as Ms Ruano. 

Mr Rios and Ms Ruano then made their move on Ms Wongjamrat. Ms Ruano took up a seat directly opposite her and Mr Rios took a seat directly behind her. Mr Rios then engaged Ms Wongjamrat in conversation. Whilst Ms Wongjamarut had turned to face Mr Rios, Ms Ruano reached into her trolley and removed the envelope. Both Mr Rios, Ms Ruano and the unknown male then swiftly left the premises. Ms Wongjamarut almost immediately thereafter realised that her money was missing. This incident was also recorded by CCTV in the bank. 

The third offence occurred on 10 August 2009. On that day Ms Phung went to the Westpac Bank in Haymarket where she withdrew on behalf of her employer the amount of $21,296 in cash. This money was placed in a hessian bag with the Westpac logo on it and given to Ms Phung. She then placed the hessian bag in her handbag and went to the ANZ Bank at Haymarket where it was her intention to deposit the money into another account of her employer. She collected a ticket from the automated ticketing machine and sat in the public area of the bank waiting for the number on that ticket to be called. While she was waiting Ms Phung removed the hessian bag from her handbag and the cash from the hessian bag and began to count it. 

Mr Rios was already in the ANZ Bank at the time Ms Phung entered. Upon seeing Ms Phung counting the money he made a mobile phone call and shortly thereafter Ms Ruano entered the bank with the same unknown man who was involved in the second offence, together with a fourth unknown man. 

All four offenders took up positions in the public waiting areas of the bank. Mr Rios approached Ms Phung and asked her to get up while he searched under her seat, saying that he had lost his credit card. Ms Phung placed the money back into the hessian bag which in turn was placed into her handbag and she moved to another seat. Mr Rios then repositioned himself behind Ms Phung and smeared a quantity of wasabi on her back. Ms Phung felt something touch her and got up from her seat to move away. When she got up the two unknown males approached her and said, ""There is a lot of wasabi on your back and the chair."" These two men then pretended to offer assistance to Ms Phung. Whilst she was distracted by this activity, Ms Ruano arranged to sit beside her. The unknown males continued to distract Ms Phung and in the deliberately designed confusion Ms Ruano reached into Ms Phung's bag and removed the hessian Westpac bag. After covering that bag with a scarf Ms Ruano left the bank, followed swiftly by Mr Rios and the other unknown male persons. 

The entirety of the third offence was also captured on CCTV. 

Both of the present offenders were arrested on 14 August 2009. 

On 19 August 2009 the police gained access to a room at the Westside Motor Inn at Ashfield in which the two offenders had been staying immediately before their arrest. Amongst the items found on that day was $17,000 in cash, $US3,700, 11,800 Euros and a small quantity of Vietnamese and New Zealand currency, some counterfeit Australian currency to the value of $400 and a quantity of jewellery."" 

7The Crown sought an order for forfeiture of the Australian and foreign currency found in the motel room. 

8After some debate, an assertion by the Crown that the offenders were working as part of a highly organised syndicate of thieves across Sydney was acknowledged. 

9The applicant's life had been one of deprivation and tragedy, but also, I regret to observe, of persistent criminal behaviour. His Honour's summary need not be repeated but background included her birth in Colombia, abandonment of her mother by her father whose identity she does not know and subjection to rape after entering domestic service at the age of 11. At 16 she began a relationship with a man over twice her age and they, apparently illegally, entered the United States where he taught her to be a thief, as a result of which she acquired a history of offences in that country, particularly in the New York area. She bore this man two children although he abandoned her before the second child was born and she subsequently learned that he had died. 

10Later in life the applicant bore two more children to another man who also left her. She had become a heavy drinker and gambler and addicted to drugs. During the last decade of the Twentieth Century, she came to Australia with her two youngest children where she met another man whom she married. Following convictions for stealing, the last in 2002, she was deported in 2004 after serving sentences. Her younger children now reside with her eldest child in Colombia and the remaining child lives in Canada. 

11On 12 August 2007 the applicant re-entered Australia under the alias Rosalba Herrera-Padilla. She discovered that her husband had formed a new relationship and subsequently she became associated with her co-offender, Rios. 

12It is expected that she will again be deported when custody is complete. 

13The applicant relies upon two grounds of appeal. Ground 1 asserts that the learned sentencing Judge erred in failing to have proper regard to the fact that each of the counts could have been dealt with in the Local Court and failed to have proper regard to the maximum penalty in such a case. 

14His Honour did not overlook these circumstances. He said: 

""These offences could have been dealt with summarily , however the degree of planing involved and the amount particularly of the third offence meant that in my view it was appropriate for the sentencing process to be undertaken in this Court. But the fact that the Local Court could have been the Court in which the offender could have been sentenced is not irrelevant."" 


15It was submitted that his Honour's remark that the Local Court potential was not irrelevant was opaque and there should have been attention directed to the distinction between the first and the second offences on the one hand and the third offence on the other in that there was a lower Local Court maximum penalty for the first and second than that available for the third. The factor for differential was the amount of money involved. 

16I do not find his Honour's remark opaque. It is consistent with the proposition that the existence of possible Local Court jurisdiction is a matter to be taken into account but not a universal factor for the reduction of sentence: R v Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115. 

17The invitation specifically to advert to the graded penalties in the Local Court implies that they should provide some proportion or scaling to assessment of penalty. So to use them would be erroneous. In the light of the applicant's participation in the offences it could not be contended that it was inappropriate for the Crown to elect to prosecute in the District Court. The summary extracted above shows that on each occasion it was the applicant who physically removed the money from the targeted victim. This is consistent with her frank admission that from an early age in the USA she had been taught to be a thief. Untainted by error, once the election was made to prosecute in the District Court a sentencing Judge would use the maximum penalty prescribed by Parliament for the offence in the same way as it would be used for any offence cognisable within the jurisdiction of that Court. The weight, if any, to be given to the circumstance that Parliament has legislated that in some circumstances offences against a provision might be prosecuted in a Court of limited jurisdiction is a matter for judgment in each case. There was no error in his Honour gauging his assessments, inter alia , against the maximum penalty prescribed, nor in the conclusions as to impositions which he reached. 

18Ground 2 asserted that the sentencing Judge erred in failing to structure the sentences imposed so far as to (i) give proper effect to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, and (ii) to vary the statutory ratio having expressly stated his intention to do so. 

19His Honour made an express finding: 

""I accept that imprisonment for her will be much harsher than for others because of her limited, almost non-existent English and her total lack of social support from friends or family. In these circumstances I am prepared to find special circumstances."" 

20It is not intended as criticism, but the somewhat unrounded terms of specification of non parole periods in particular make exact analysis awkward but the Crown has fairly acknowledged first, that it appears that it was his Honour's intention to depart from the formula in the statute when dividing the term into non parole period and balance term both in respect of the individual impositions and their total effect, second, that that division (to the advantage of the applicant) was not achieved when the total term and total non parole period is calculated and, third, that an adjustment to achieve approximately the same proportions in total term as was used for the individual sentences by reduction of about three months would not be argued against. 

21Ordinarily, an adjustment being sought in the order of 3 months would not attract intervention by this Court but as it is, in effect, agreed that the likely explanation for not carrying out his Honour's intention was arithmetical rather than an error of principle, fairness would dictate that it should now be done. 

22The result apparently intended by his Honour and not opposed by the Crown can, as a matter of practicability, be achieved conveniently by varying the sentence and orders in relation to the third count. 

23I propose the following orders: 

1. Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted and appeal allowed in part. 

2. Sentences and orders in the District Court for offences on 5 June 2008 and 28 May 2009 confirmed. 

3. Sentence and orders for offence on 10 August 2009 quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of 1 year 8 months commencing on 14 July 2010 and expiring on 13 March 2012 with a balance of term of 1 year 4 months commencing on 14 March 2012. 

4. The earliest date of eligibility for release to parole specified as 13 March 2012.

		01 July 2011",2011-06-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2709547,R v NGUYEN; R v TRAN [2011] NSWDC 135,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: It is undeniable that the community has become increasingly concerned about the hydroponic cultivation of cannabis. That concern is reflected in an amendment to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act creating the offence of cultivating a prohibited plant by enhanced means. 

2The concern arises because of a growing awareness that cannabis cannot accurately be described as a soft drug; that it causes substantial harm both to the users of that drug, and to the community in general; and because the enhanced means usually have the effect of increasing the concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol in the plants, which make the drug thereby produced much more potent. 

3In those circumstances it is incumbent upon the Courts to respond appropriately when offences such as those currently before me are detected. 

4I have before me a husband and wife for sentence. The husband, Giang Nam Tran, pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to an offence of cultivating a commercial quantity of a prohibited plant, by enhanced means. 

5His wife, Thi Puong Nguyen, pleaded guilty to knowingly taking part in such an offence. 

6On 15 September last year police executed a search warrant on premises at Rockdale after they had been conducting surveillance there. When they executed the search warrant both the offenders were present. As police gained entry Mr Tran was seen to be wearing gardening gloves. Ms Nguyen ran to the back of the house but was detained. 

7As police examined the inside of the house they found that the vast majority of the space inside had been converted to rooms for the purpose of growing cannabis. Only the lounge and kitchen were habitable, with all other rooms containing cannabis plants at various stages in the growth cycle. 

8The usual paraphernalia was there: high strength halogen lighting; water pumps; and an exhaust system. There were chemicals and length of hose as well. 

9In total 139 cannabis plants were found. To put that in context the commercial quantity is 50 plants, and the large commercial quantity is 200. Also located at the premises were four garbage bags of cannabis leaf in a partly rotting state, that weighed 12.886 kilograms, and also a resealable plastic bag containing 101.1 grams of cannabis heads. 

10Police also discovered that the electricity metre had been by-passed. 

11It is appropriate to note at this stage that Mr Tran asked me to take into account three other offences when I sentence him relating to the circumstances I have just described. He wants me to take me to take into account an offence of using electricity without authority, possessing 101.1 grams of cannabis heads, and 12.886 kilograms of cannabis leaf. 

12Ms Tran spoke to police at the premises. She told them that she knew the cannabis plants were drugs, the plants were watered by her husband, and that this was the first time they had cultivated cannabis. 

13The identification of the role of the offenders in this matter has not been easy. There is, in each case, an agreed statement of facts tendered. As it is agreed I will accept its contents. The agreed statement of facts says that Mr Tran's role was to maintain the crops of cannabis plants by watering, feeding, trimming, and generally tending to the cannabis plants. He was clearly doing that at the time police arrived. 

14The role of Ms Nguyen is said to have been to provide support to her husband in the cultivation of the cannabis to the extent that she maintained the exterior of the premises to look like a legitimate residential premises by moving the lawns, and when required she further assisted with keeping the interior clean and taking away materials associated with the cultivation. 

15The agreed statement of facts continues to note that by actively preventing the premises, and those involved in the cultivation, from coming under suspicion or discovery the offender, that is Ms Nguyen, was knowingly taking part in that cultivation. 

16The rest of the evidence as to the offenders' roles is to be found elsewhere. I was told from the bar table that, by consent of the parties, I should be advised that the people that rented the premises were not these offenders, and that in fact those who did rent the premises had rented three other houses as well. I was also told that the fingerprints of a Mr Hung had been found on items within the premises. But the rest of the evidence about the offenders' roles is contained in statements made by the offenders to either the author of their respective pre-sentence reports, or a psychologist, who prepared a report concerning Mr Tran. 

17In that material it is suggested that Mr Tran and his wife got involved when he was approached by another person with whom he played soccer. That person told him that he had to go back to Vietnam for a short period of time and that he needed someone to look after his plants. The evidence would suggest that Mr Tran at that stage did not know that the plants were cannabis plants, or otherwise illegal, but did discover what they were when he went to the premises. 

18It is to be noted that neither Mr Tran nor his wife, Ms Nguyen, gave evidence in the Court today. The relevance of that of course is that there is no direct evidence as to the hearsay matters to be found in the various reports, nor was the Crown able to test their assertions by way of cross-examination. On the other hand, the Crown well knew, or at least knows now, of the hearsay assertions made in the various reports, and has not called, or tendered evidence to contradict it. These sorts of difficulties have exercised the minds of various judges over the years, including the High Court. 

19I consider that to sentence the offenders on the basis that they were more highly involved than they assert in the various reports would require me to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that their involvement was at a higher level. Quite clearly, in the absence of any evidence to that effect, I cannot be satisfied. I will therefore sentence the offenders on the basis that they did not set up the operation but were assisting others who did so for financial gain. In this respect, although there is no evidence that Ms Nguyen was going to be paid, I will sentence her on the basis that she was involved in this matter because of the prospect of financial gain to her husband. 

20Neither offender is a user of drugs. Just as much as those who supply drugs, who are not themselves users of those drugs, are to be regarded as being in the worst category of drug supplies, those who cultivate drugs but who do not use them themselves, must also be regarded as in the worst category of drug cultivators. This was a cynical exercise in which the offenders were prepared to profit at the expense of other members of the community who suffer through the use of drugs such as those they were cultivating. 

21Although neither offender was a principal, that does not mean that their role was anything other than serious. In each case they performed an essential role. It was Mr Tran's job to cultivate the plants, and it was Ms Nguyen's job to assist him, in particular by making the premises look legitimate. The criminal enterprise was much less likely to succeed if Ms Nguyen did not do what she did, and it was definitely going to fail if Mr Tran had not done what he did. 

22Neither of the offenders has any prior criminal history. They were both hard working and, it would appear, industrious. They do not have any children. 

23Ms Nguyen was born in Vietnam, her formative years were characterised by arguments between her parents until they eventually separated when she was aged sixteen. Ms Nguyen then lived with her mother until her mother came to Australia in 2005, Ms Nguyen following her a year later. 

24Ms Nguyen met her husband, the co-offender, when she was eighteen, and they married when she was about twenty-five. Her husband followed her to Australia in 2009. 

25Ms Nguyen completed schooling in Vietnam but did not go to university. She studied English, tourism, but stopped those studies when she came to Australia. Since then she has worked as a nail technician. A reference tendered on her behalf attests to her being a hard working, efficient, friendly employee, and one who was easy to get along with. 

26A pre-sentence report, again in hearsay form, notes that Ms Nguyen only got involved in this offence after her husband ignored her request that he not get involved himself. 

27Mr Tran is a little bit older than his wife. He too was born in Vietnam and, as I have mentioned, came to Australia after his wife. His mother died whilst he was still living in Vietnam, his father re-marrying, and he had a good relationship with his step-mother. 

28Once he came to Australia he worked in various jobs, he had been trained as a welder in Vietnam, but he worked in various different occupations until his arrest on this matter. There is apparently work available for him on his release from custody. 

29Since being remanded in custody he has continued to show himself as being an industrious person. A substantial bundle of certificates was tendered concerning the education and vocational training he has undertaken whilst in custody. 

30I should have mentioned earlier that both offenders pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so the sentences I will impose upon them are twenty-five per cent less than they otherwise would have been. As there are two offenders I must also take care to ensure that I apply the principles of parity and that neither offender has a justifiable sense of grievance when he or she compares the sentence I have imposed upon the other offender. 

31Mr Jones suggests that a sentence other than full time imprisonment would be appropriate for Ms Nguyen. He relies on a number of matters, including the fact that she played an ancillary role to that of her husband, she has no prior convictions, what he said were compelling subjective features, that she has employment and a good work ethic, that the drug trafficking enterprise would have continued even without her involvement, and that she has spent about three months in custody. He therefore suggests that a suspended sentence or, as a fall back position, an intensive corrections order would be appropriate. I do not agree. 

32As will ultimately appear, I will impose a sentence on Ms Nguyen which is less then two years, that would mean that she would be eligible to be considered by me for a suspended sentence or ICO, or indeed other alternatives such as home detention, but it remains the case that she must be significantly punished for what she has done, even given her good prospects of rehabilitation. 

33General deterrence requires that those who are detected committing offences of the kind Ms Nguyen has committed, even where they perform a subservient role, must receive a sentence which can appropriately be described as punishment, unless of course there are unusual circumstances justifying a less severe sentence. 

34In this regard I was greatly assisted by a table prepared by Mr Jones' instructing solicitors. It is apparent that his instructing solicitors have had a great deal of work involving offences of this kind. I should explain that although almost all of the cases concern offenders with names that are apparently of Vietnamese origin, that is explained by the circumstance that Mr Jones' instructing solicitor speaks Vietnamese and has contacts in the Vietnamese community. 

35Mr Jones took me through a number of cases where sentences of other than full time custody were imposed. It is to be noted that in many such cases, as the table accurately and fairly reflects, there were unusual circumstances not appropriate here, sometimes involving hardship to third parties. In such a case a non custodial sentence could clearly be appropriate, but there is nothing of that kind present in this matter. 

36In Mr Tran's case, Mr Jones concedes that a full time custodial sentence is appropriate, but nevertheless reminds me that Mr Tran also has no priors and a good work ethic, and that his involvement was not that of a principal. 

37In both cases, that is of Ms Nguyen and Mr Tran, I will take into account that this was not a single act. The agreed statement of facts indicates that there were multiple acts, each of a criminal kind. The offenders did not do one thing and then immediately regret it, instead on each occasion they tended the plants - in Mr Tran's case - or assisted with the maintenance of the house to make it look like someone was really living there - as in Ms Nguyen's case, they were committing a criminal activity. There is no suggestion that they would have stopped either, were it not for the intervention of police. 

38As with Ms Nguyen, but even more so in Mr Tran's case a sentence which punishes him significantly is required. 

39The sentences I impose are as follows: Mr Tran is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non parole period of eighteen months, which will have commenced on 15 September 2010, the day on which Mr Tran was arrested. It will expire on 14 March 2012, on which date I order that he is released to parole. The head sentence in that matter will be two and a half years. 

40In Ms Nguyen's case, taking into account two months and twenty-four days pre-sentence custody, I sentence her to imprisonment for a period of ten months. If my mathematics are correct - and I ask the parties to check this - that sentence will have commenced on 6 April 2011. The non parole period of ten months will expire on 5 February 2012, on which day I order that she is released to parole. The head sentence in that matter is one of eighteen months. 

41I should of course indicate that I have taken into account the form 1 matters in sentencing Mr Tran.

		26 September 2011",2011-06-30 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709553,R v Kashif BILAL [2011] NSWDC 76,"SENTENCE 


1. I am sentencing a relatively young man without any prior convictions for a pair of serious sexual offences committed by him on a teenage girl in her home and for an extraordinarily serious effort by him to then arrange for the victim of his sexual assault to be murdered. 

2. It is important for a judge in sentencing any offender to set out briefly what happened which brought about the charges against a person who is being sentenced. Because the victim of the sexual assaults is entitled to have her identity protected I will refer to her simply as the victim. 

3. Kashif Bilal, then aged twenty-two, was working for a company that sold and installed housing insulation. On 15 October 2009 he turned up at the victim's home at about twenty to six in the evening. He asked whether he could come inside to look at the roof cavity. The victim told him that he could not do that because she was at home by herself and she was not allowed to let anyone in the house. Mr Bilal said, "" Just for five minutes "" and he opened the front screen door and walked into the house. The victim felt uncomfortable but did not stop him. She showed him the access to the roof which happened to be outside her bedroom. Mr Bilal took himself into her bedroom and said, "" This is a nice room "". 

4. Then what happened is this. Mr Bilal grabbed the victim. He started kissing her around the neck and her breasts. He tried to pull down her tube top and bra. The victim said "" no "" and puller her top back up. She tried to push him away and understandably felt fearful for her safety. She fell to the floor. 

5. She could feel Mr Bilal rubbing his penis against her. She managed to get up and sat on the bed with her head in her hands. Mr Bilal was trying to pull her pants down. He said it would ""just take five minutes"". He tried to pull her up from the bed but was unsuccessful. She stayed fixed in place, sitting on the bed. The victim heard Mr Bilal take off his belt and unzip his pants. Mr Bilal took out his penis. The victim put her head down. She felt as if she was choking because Mr Bilal's thumb was on her neck as he tried to get her to lift her head up. She felt his penis in her face. He kept saying to her "" five minutes "". He tried to push his penis into her mouth. She closed her eyes and kept her hands over her mouth and her face to prevent that happening. 

6. As a result of that part of the episode which I have just described Mr Bilal was charged with attempting to have sexual intercourse with the victim. 

7. Mr Bilal was unsuccessful in his attempts to put his penis into her mouth. He nevertheless put his penis down the top that she was wearing, in between her breasts. The victim felt his penis rubbing between her breasts and then she felt him ejaculate. 

8. That ejaculation and the behaviour accompanying it brought about a charge of indecent assault. 

9. Mr Bilal persevered, he tried kissing the victim on the lips. He sat on her bed and asked for her phone number. The victim gave him her number as she wanted to get his number. 

10. The police came and spoke with the victim and other neighbours. The next day, at 1 o'clock in the morning, the police arrested Mr Bilal. He had only been in Australia for about eighteen months and an interpreter was needed. He agreed to be interviewed. He agreed that he had entered the house but denied assaulting the victim. 

11. He was charged with the two offences that I have already referred to. He was refused bail. He was then transferred to prison. 

12. Whilst he was in prison the police received what they regarded as credible information that Mr Bilal wanted to have the victim murdered, so that he could be released from gaol. An undercover operative was authorised to engage in conversation with Mr Bilal. That conversation occurred at one of the New South Wales prisons on 9 December 2009. 

13. During the conversation Mr Bilal agreed that the victim would be killed for a sum of $10,000 which he agreed to pay upon completion of the murder and his release from gaol. The conversation was recorded by the undercover operative and I will refer to some of the passages from the transcript of that recording. When the operative arrived Mr Bilal told him that he, Mr Bilal, had a problem. They discussed in general terms that the problem was with the girl. The operative said that there was "" a different price for whatever you need done "". 

14. The operative then asked this specific question, "" Do you want the hospital or do you want the cemetery? "" The recorded reply is, "" The cemetery "". The operative checked by saying, "" Cemetery. A graveyard?"" Mr Bilal answered, "" Yeah "". The operative checked a further time, saying, "" So what do you want? The hospital or the graveyard "". Mr Bilal answered, "" The graveyard "". A short time later in the conversation he gave the victim's name. He spelt out her given name and her surname. He was asked by the operative, "" Whenever we do it, do you want us to torture her?"" Mr Bilal answered, "" No "" adding, "" Just finish "". When the undercover operative asked, "" What about the body?"" Mr Bilal replied, "" I don't know. That's your problem."" 

15. Mr Bilal was alert to the possibility that the police might try to track down himself or the person he regarded as the contract killer and Mr Bilal said to the operative that when "" everything has happened, they might come to you as well, because you visited me."" He said a little later that after the anticipated death of the victim he would "" make sure that the first three or four months, I just, just mostly, I do everything very careful."" He was aware that he would be asked and pushed by the police. 

16. Towards the end of the conversation he was asked by the operative whether he was a hundred per cent sure. Mr Bilal answered that he was waiting for the operative to come so that he could proceed and added, "" I am a hundred per cent sure."" He went further and said that he was, "" More than hundred per cent. I know I don't have any chance."" The operative finally checked again about the cemetery or the hospital and Mr Bilal answered, "" No, cemetery "" and added again that he was one hundred per cent sure. 

17. Interestingly the operative asked whether he would feel guilty about it. Mr Bilal was obviously convinced of his innocence of any sexual assault and replied, "" Look, if I'd really done something to her and then I do something to, wrong again, then I've got chances to get - maybe I feel guilty. But I never tried to hurt anyone. And there is no chance of feeling guilty now."" 

18. At one stage he said he would need to take out a loan to pay the $10,000 and that he could get a job to pay it off. It would have to be in instalments so as to allay suspicion of his involvement given that he would be obviously a suspect. 

19. Mr Bilal was taken to the Parramatta police station from custody on 23 December 2009 where he was formally placed under arrest and charged with the offence of solicit to murder. He pleaded guilty to all three of the offences at what the prosecution agrees was the earliest available opportunity. 20. So he comes to be sentenced by me for three crimes. There was the attempted sexual intercourse. That is against s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. The indecent assault is a crime against s 61L of the Crimes Act and Parliament has fixed a maximum of five years to that crime. Finally there is the solicit to murder which is an offence against s 26 of the Crimes Act . Parliament regards that crime so seriously that it has fixed a maximum twenty-five years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of ten years to that crime. 

21. The prosecution represented by Ms H Roberts of counsel, the Crown Prosecutor, and by Ms C Summerfield from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Ms Roberts called as a witness a prisoner who had been in custody with Mr Bilal when Mr Bilal was first arrested and bail refused. Mr Bilal discussed various aspects of his predicament with this prisoner. He also discussed the idea of avoiding his predicament by arranging for the murder of the victim. The evidence of that prisoner was challenged in various respects by the solicitor then acting for Mr Bilal, Mr Sandilands, who part way through the case had to withdraw for professional reasons and was replaced by Mr M Paish of counsel. It became apparent that the prisoner was serving some twentyfour years for offences including acting with an intention to pervert the course of justice and murder as well as kidnapping. 

22. There were some issues which arose regarding that prisoner's evidence and whether or not Mr Bilal was acting in fear of that prisoner - he claimed he was - and whether or not the initiative for the idea of murdering the victim was suggested by the prisoner or by Mr Bilal. First I should say that where I have any reservations I do not accept the evidence of the prisoner. There were significant restrictions on Mr Sandilands's ability to cross-examine the prisoner because his identity could not be disclosed. In addition he has the convictions which I have recorded. I put the minimum amount of reliance on anything he has said. 

23. Mr Sandilands and then Mr Paish called their client, Mr Bilal, to give evidence. He confirmed that everything he had told the Probation and Parole Service and a psychologist qualified to interview him was correct. He gave evidence that he was from Pakistan and was with the Pakistani Navy when in Darwin he deserted. He was granted a visa as a permanent resident. He had genuine concerns that he would be shot if he returned to Pakistan because of his desertion and there was some evidence that he was the subject of a notice so far as Pakistani authorities were concerned. 

24. Asked about why he committed the offences he said he made a wrong decision. He said he could not face his parents or the community. He claimed that he was in fear of the prisoner whom he had discussed these things with and thought that he might himself become a victim. He may have been in fear of that prisoner but at the relevant time he was in a separate Corrective Services institution and in fact corresponded with that other prisoner. He had never been in custody before and was twenty-two when he first went into prison. He repeated that he was very embarrassed, thinking that he could never be in that situation ever in his life. He could not work out how to tell his parents or his friends. He said that he was on a green card which means that he was on a suicide watch. It was when he was on the green card that he decided to go ahead with the plan to eliminate, so to speak, the victim of the crimes which resulted in him being bail refused and in prison. He said he was very much depressed whilst he was in prison. 

25. At one stage he said he had been assaulted by the prisoner. That may or may not have happened. I do not regard it as necessary to make a finding on that because I do not regard it as relevant because he was separated from that prisoner at the time that he made the arrangement with the undercover operative. Asked by Mr Paish what his feelings were regarding his efforts to solicit the murder of the victim he acknowledged that it was "" totally wrong and I'm very sorry for that."" He said that he was taking responsibility for that crime. 

26. He said that he was under stress at the time that he was in prison and was concerned about his family. He said his mental condition was not stable adding "" in other words on green card and my brain was fully a mess, I couldn't think properly ."" He said that was "" the main reason that everything went like this ."" He acknowledged the conversation which he had with the undercover operative and repeated that he was feeling depressed and his brain was in a mess. 

27. Cross-examined by Ms Roberts he acknowledged that he had corresponded with the prisoner when the prisoner was at another location. He had provided the prisoner with his, Mr Bilal's, MIN number and told him where he was. He repeated that he was in "" that much stressed condition, whatever I did I was ashamed of that I betrayed my religion, whatever I was going to tell the family, friends. The whole thing was messing me up."" He was there referring to the situation he found himself in gaol bail refused on the sexual assault charges. 

28. He acknowledged in cross-examination by Ms Roberts that he had gone to some effort to get the name of the proposed victim correct so that he could pass on the name to the person he regarded as the one he was making the contract with to have her killed. He acknowledged that he, after making the arrangement, did not ring the police and warn them about the arrangement that he had made. He acknowledged to Ms Roberts that that was because his main concern was himself and that he did not want to be in gaol. 

29. Asked by Mr Paish at the end of his evidence how he felt about what had happened he gave this reply "" whatever what happened in the first matter I totally disgust myself in that time. I never thought that I can be lower myself to that level and the second thing your Honour it was totally - I put myself in the situation that I can never put myself now because I was emotionally messed up at the time ."" He said that the other prisoner "" gave me that offer and I took it and I couldn't pull myself out of that, so it is a totally different thing now, I can't think these terrible things anymore ."" 

30. There was a good deal of evidence in the form of exhibits which were tendered by both parties. As I said Mr Bilal has no known criminal record. There was a pre-sentence report prepared by the Probation and Parole Service. It recorded that he was born in Pakistan and raised in a loving, protected and religious family. He was the second youngest. He was given a permanent protection visa in 2008 after deserting from the Pakistani Navy. He completed his responsible service of alcohol qualifications and worked very hard before these offences. The report noted that he had readily admitted responsibility for the sex offences. He added however that he "" cannot fathom the reasons he committed these offences. "" 

31. Mr Bilal told the probation and parole officer ""that he has had no previous sexual experience and he felt the victim showed interest in him ."" He said that it would "" never happen again."" He gave an explanation about the solicit to murder which was exculpatory in a sense that he claimed he thought he was paying the victim's family off and when he realised that it involved a proposal to murder the victim he was too scared to withdraw. 

32. He holds grave concerns for the safety of his family in Pakistan. Some of his family were affected by the floods in recent years. 

33. As part of Mr Bilal's case there was admitted into evidence a report by a clinical psychologist, Peter Champion. Mr Champion noted a history which "" suggested that he may have been experiencing an acute form of PTSD or associated disorder when he came to Australia."" That is a reference to post traumatic stress syndrome. It noted he had experienced some mood disturbance when he was in Australia "" being in a new country and isolated from family, and having concerns for their welfare ."" He became depressed when he went into prison. 

34. Mr Champion "" did not elicit any clear report that at the time of the sexual offences Mr Bilal was suffering from active symptoms of mental illness of a type likely to cause the offending behaviour."" There was a possibility he may have been suffering from some mood disturbance and anxiety at the time because of his recent experiences. He told Mr Champion that when he went into prison "" he had become significantly depressed and out of his depth, and had been subject to suicidal thoughts ."" Mr Champion noted that Mr Bilal was "" unable to account for his actions in relation to the sexual offences ."" 

35. Mr Champion noted that Mr Bilal had "" claimed that his mental state was poor at the time of his entry into prison, and if this is correct his judgment at that time may have been impacted."" He is referring to the arrangements which Mr Bilal thought he was making for the murder of the victim. He accepted responsibility for his actions and regretted them and spoke of a sense of shame. He spoke of having made a "" wrong decision "", "" wrong in part because it was wrong for the victim to have such a thing happen to her, and for her to be 'dishonoured' in this way. "" 

36. Mr Champion tried to assess "" risk factors for sexual offending "". He ranked his prognosis as guarded "" particularly as Mr Bilal struggled to account for his actions in any real fashion."" He said that that was not the same as saying there was a clear risk that he would offend again but "" until if any behaviour and its psychological underpinning is better understood, the level of risk is difficult to judge "". He recommended that Mr Bilal be subject to psychiatric review in prison and psychological monitoring and recommended a referral to a sexual offenders program. 

37. There was material tendered from Mr Bilal's record in the prison system and from the Justice Health records. Mr Bilal wrote a letter to the victim which I expect for very good reason was not passed on to her and served mainly the purpose of demonstrating his own shame and regret for what he had done. Mr Bilal has been very actively involved in improving himself in prison. I get the impression that he is quite an intelligent and articulate young man and this is borne out by a number of qualifications he has received whilst he has been actively involved in various educational and development programs in prison. As some offenders do, he wrote in his own words a letter to me, tendered by his counsel, explaining his circumstances and acknowledging his own fault. I have taken that into account. 

38. There is a reference from a work colleague who speaks very well of Mr Bilal before these offences. He was obviously a very hard worker and a faithful and practising Muslim. He was involved in sporting activities, particularly cricket and was very much attached to his family in Pakistan, contacting them most days. He helped out his family financially. To the author of that, the charges "" were a complete shock"". He thought that Mr Bilal "" was not at all that type of person "". It was uncharacteristic behaviour. 

39. Ms Roberts in helpful written submissions pointed out that the sexual assaults were aggravated by the fact that they had occurred in the home of the victim and that by the fact that the victim was vulnerable being only sixteen years old and alone at home. Those points were not in issue and I accept that the sexual assaults were both aggravated in those respects. 

40. I accept Ms Roberts' description of the circumstances of the sexual offences being ""frightening and humiliating for the victim "". The submission went on to say that "" despite her manifest lack of consent, until he gained sexual satisfaction"" he persisted. 

41. I accept Ms Roberts submission that during the conversation with the undercover operative, Mr Bilal "" does not demonstrate any reluctance to proceed with the plan to have the victim killed "". That to my mind deals with any question of Mr Bilal acting in fear or misunderstanding. 

42. Ms Roberts points out that the intention or motivation accompanying the solicit to murder offence, namely the avoidance of the criminal of responsibility for his crime was a seriously aggravating feature. Ms Roberts went on to argue that Mr Bilal "" sought to arrange the murder of a sixteen year old girl against whom he had already committed a serious sexual offence. Where the motive is to 'derail or pervert' court proceedings, this places the offence in the most serious category of offences "". Ms Roberts referred to a passage in the judgment of Howie J in R v Louizos [2009] NSWCCA 71 in grounding that proposition. I will deal with that submission shortly, but I do accept that the motivation of derailing the course of justice was a significantly aggravating feature of this crime. 

43. Ms Roberts' submission was that the offending behaviour in the solicitor to murder "" falls above the mid range of objective seriousness, motivated as it was by the offender's desire to pervert the criminal process by permanently silencing a Crown witness who was the victim of sexual offences committed by him ."" 

44. Mr Paish focused on aspects of the evidence given by the prisoner called by the Crown and indicated that reliance should not be placed upon his evidence and I accept that submission. Mr Paish drew attention to his client's "" highly anxious mental state "" noting that he was "" susceptible to suggestion and open to considering behaviour that he would not envisage in ordinary circumstances "". 

45. Ms Roberts made a distinction between Mr Bilal having a psychological or psychiatric condition which might reduce the moral culpability of his offence on the one hand and on the hand the fact that he was under great stress with an obsessive focus on his own predicament and that that contributed to his decision making. I accept that distinction. I agree with her that there is no sound psychiatric or psychological evidence that Mr Bilal was labouring under a psychiatric condition which would affect his culpability, but it is clear to me that given his age and his predicament and his background, that he was under a good deal of psychological stress when he was in prison. I am not at all suggesting that that excuses his behaviour of course, but one needs to see the behaviour in context. 

46. Ms Roberts correctly observed or conceded appropriately that Mr Bilal was entitled to the maximum of twenty-five percent discount on his sentences because of his plea of guilty at the earliest available opportunity. 

47. Mr Paish in further helpful written submissions addressed the objective seriousness of the offence of solicit to murder. He took issue with Ms Roberts' argued classification of the offence as falling above the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Mr Paish made reference to various decision by the Court of Criminal Appeal dealing with this particular offence. I accept what Mr Paish says, so far as the observations of Howie J in Louizos , those observations were not necessary for the decision which his Honour made which means in a legal sense whilst relevant they can be regarded as of less weight. I do not take his Honour's observation as saying that a motivation such as an intention to pervert the course of justice alone elevates an offence such as this into the upper range of objective seriousness. The Court of Criminal Appeal has made its views clear, in the various decisions which I was referred to, about how serious this crime is. 

48. I regard the motivation however, as very significant and as a seriously aggravating feature of the crime. Solicit to murder, as I said, is regarded by Parliament as so serious that it has fixed a maximum of twenty-five years and a standard non-parole period of ten years. This was a deliberate and premeditated act, although as Howie J with respect correctly observed in Louizos , "" generally it will be unusual to find a case of solicitation that is not premeditated ."" 

49. Whether or not Mr Bilal acted of his own accord or whether he embraced a suggestion by the other prisoner is not in my opinion to the point. I would not find it mitigating in this case even if the idea was suggested in the first place by the prisoner. The point is, in my opinion, that the idea was embraced by Mr Bilal. There were too many steps which were the sole responsibility of Mr Bilal. He met the undercover operative. He made it very clear to the undercover operative that his intention was for the victim to be killed. He repeated it several times. He provided information about the identity of the victim. He did nothing afterwards to prevent the plan from being executed. 

50. Mr Paish suggested that the planning did not advance far from talk. But that of course was a crime. The fact that it was not implemented is not a mitigating factor. The details provided by Mr Bilal were not minimal. He provided the victim's name and address. He had gone to some trouble to get those. 

51. Mr Paish suggested that there was "" evidence that the offender was not functioning well when he was admitted to custody "" and referred to the green card. I accept Mr Paish's submission. The fact that Mr Bilal was on a green card is some objective evidence provided within the prison system that he was vulnerable. In addition I accept Mr Paish's submission that he was an "" isolated and pliable individual in prison for the first time in a foreign country "". Mr Paish argued, and I think this makes sense, that his client's "" emotional state was one that could readily be believed in all the circumstances "". 

52. In addition there is the evidence from Mr Champion that if his mental state was poor at the time "" his judgment at that time may have been impacted "". His mental state was obviously poor for the reasons which I have referred to and so it seems to me that it is relevant however in the sense that Ms Roberts points out. There is a link between Mr Bilal's emotional instability and the offence. It does not provide and excuse, it does provide context. 

53. Mr Paish highlighted some mitigating factors. His client was twenty-two when the offences were committed and is now twenty-four. I expect that some of his behaviour could be attributed to his youthful immaturity as well as his circumstances that he found himself in. There is limited evidence, but nevertheless evidence, that he was regarded as a person of good character before these offences and had no known criminal convictions. I accept that the sexual offences were aggravated because they were committed in the home of the victim and because she was vulnerable being sixteen and alone. Remorse for those offences must be qualified by his expressed self interest and of course by the plan to have the victim killed. The sexual offences were, I accept, not planned. They were opportunistic but serious. 

54. Ms Summerfield on behalf of the prosecutor acknowledges fairly that the sentences for the sexual offences could be concurrent. Both offences were part of the one relatively short but terrifying episode of criminal behaviour against the victim. There must of course be some accumulation of the sentences so far as the solicit to murder is concerned. Although motivated by the desire to avoid the consequences of the sexual assault, it was a separate and more serious crime committed in a considered way some time later. 

55. I noted that Mr Champion's view that his prognosis is guarded so far as future offending is concerned. I accept that his prospects of rehabilitation are good. That is evidenced by the courses which he has been actively undertaking in prison, and by him being prepared to partake in specific programmes for sexual offenders. I think he is remorseful now for his offending behaviour. I think his remorse is obviously affected by the extreme position that he finds himself in, and by his shame so far as his family are concerned. 

56. I take into account, looking at the appropriate sentence for the solicit to murder, the maximum which Parliament has fixed to this offence. 

57. I would regard an overall commencing sentence, taking into account the serious aggravation of avoiding consequences of charges he faced, but at the same time his personal circumstances, as being fifteen years imprisonment. 

58. I need to consider, because that crime has attached to it a standard non parole period, where it falls within the range of objective seriousness. Ms Roberts argues that it is above the middle of the range of objective seriousness. In my opinion this crime falls in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. It has all of the features which must attach to a crime of solicitor to murder, however it is aggravated significantly, as I have found, by the motivation of wanting to avoid the consequences of the charges. On the other hand, the vulnerable and pliable position which Mr Bilal found himself in is relevant to assessing its objective seriousness. I would regard it, as I said, in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. It is not low or high within that range, it is in the middle. 

59. I would regard an appropriate sentence for the attempted sexual intercourse without consent as seven years imprisonment and an appropriate sentence for the indecent assault as three years imprisonment. 

60. Mr Bilal has pleaded guilty to all of these offences that means, as I have already referred to, he is entitled at law to a discount of twenty-five per cent on the sentences that would otherwise be imposed. 

61. I would propose to discount the proposed fifteen years sentence for solicitor to murder to a sentence of eleven years. 

62. I would propose to discount the sentence of seven years for attempted sexual intercourse to five years and the proposed three years sentence for indecent assault to two years. 

63. I propose to commence the sentences from the date when Mr Bilal went into custody on 16 October 2009. 

64. The sentences for the sexual assaults will be concurrent, for the reasons which I have given. They will be fixed sentences without a non parole period because of the sentence which I will impose for the solicitor to murder. 

65. I will accumulate the sentence for solicit to murder by two years on top of the sentences for the sexual offences. 

66. I regard an appropriate non parole period for the solicit to murder as eight years imprisonment. However because that sentence is a cumulative one, I regard it as a special circumstance and will reduce it to six years. 

67. The overall result will be a sentence of thirteen years imprisonment with a non parole period of eight years imprisonment. 

68. In fixing an overall non parole period, which is somewhat less than the standard of seventy-five per cent relationship between the non parole period and the overall sentence, I bear in mind that there are special circumstances so far as Mr Bilal's age, and the accumulation of sentences. However that adjustment is not significant because the parole period itself is, of necessity, quite long, and will allow plenty of time for him to undergo further rehabilitation. 

69. I am going to sentence you now, Mr Bilal, if you would stand up please. In respect of the offence of attempted sexual intercourse without consent I convict you and sentence you to a fixed term of five years imprisonment, to commence 16 October 2009, and to expire on 15 October 2014. In respect of the indecent assault I convict you and sentence you to a fixed term of two years, to commence on 16 October 2009 and to expire on 15 October 2011. In respect of the offence of solicit to murder I convict you. I set a non parole period of six years, to commence on 16 October 2011, and to expire on 15 October 2017. The balance of the term will be five years, commencing 16 October 2017, and expiring 15 October 2022. Have a seat, Mr Bilal. 

HIS HONOUR: Ms Havryliv and Ms Summerfield, first just check the arithmetic and the commencement dates. The overall intention is 13 years with an eight year non-parole period. Ms Havryliv? 

HAVRYLIV: Yes, I've done the mathematics as well and it's correct. 

HIS HONOUR: Mathematics is all right. Ms Summerfield? 

SUMMERFIELD: It's correct, your Honour. 


70. Mr Bilal, your overall sentence is thirteen years. It commenced when you went into gaol, 16 October 2009, and it finishes on 15 October 2022. Of that you must serve eight years, commencing 16 October 2009, expiring 15 October 2017. The first date on which it appears you will be eligible to be released on parole is 15 October 2017. Whether you get parole is a matter for the Parole Authority. I do not order parole. 

71. Your sentence comprises the five years for the attempted sexual intercourse, two years for the indecent assault - they run together - and then eleven years for the solicit, commencing two years into the sentence, and a minimum of six years for that, making up the overall minimum of eight years, do you understand that? 

HIS HONOUR: Now, Ms Havryliv, I asked my associate to prepare a clean copy of Mr Champion's report because Corrective Services Authorities, I understand, those who classify prisoners, say they are very much assisted by any psychological or psychiatric report. With your permission, if your client is happy with that, I will send this clean copy with him into custody, do you agree with that? 

HAVRYLIV: Yes, I do agree with that.

		25 August 2011",2011-06-30 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709555,Police v Kevin Francis Barlow (No 2) [2011] NSWLC 20,"JUDGMENT 

Remarks on Sentence 

1On 13 May 2011 for reasons given that date the offender was found guilty of two counts of Damage to Property by Fire contrary to section 195(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. The matters were defended, and accordingly there is no discount for a plea of guilty. That is not to say that the penalty is increased because of the fact of the matters being defended, rather there is simply no discount for a plea of guilty. 

Facts 

2The facts are extensively set out in my decision on the issue of guilt of 13 May 2011. However, for the purposes of proceeding to sentence I find the following facts proved beyond reasonable doubt: 

3There were two fires at the dwelling house at the property 'Carinya' on Mitchell's Road, east of Culcairn. The fires occurred on 12 May 2010 and 14 June 2010. The offender was occupying the house as at the date of the first fire. The offender's estranged wife, Sharon Hart (as she now is) was the owner of the premises, which were subject to a mortgage provided by the Commonwealth Bank. Ms Hart now lives in Sydney with a new husband. Obviously there was acrimony between the offender and his estranged wife. 

4For the reasons given on 13 May 2011, I am satisfied that on 12 May 2010 the offender set a fire in the roof cavity of the building before going into the township of Culcairn where he went to the premises of Michelle King. He asked her to drive him to the property. In the meantime neighbours had discovered the fire and the emergency services called, and the fire extinguished. Damage with the first fire was essentially limited to the roof cavity, although the premises would not have been habitable. The scene was examined by a number of experts, who were of the unanimous opinion that the fire was ""not accidental"" in nature. Given the evidence of Mr Barnes, Forensic Consultant, I am satisfied that the offender placed some type of combustible material on the bearers in the roof and setting it alight. 

5The dwelling was completely destroyed in the fire of 14 June 2010. There then arises the value of the damage. It is agreed, and accordingly, I will proceed to pass sentence on the basis that the value of the damage on the first fire was $2,800. To find any further damage would be to ""double count"". 

6The second fire occurred in the morning of 14 June 2010. Neighbours again saw the fire, and the local fire brigade called to the scene, however, they arrived too late to save the building. It has since been demolished. A neighbour, Mr Murray Scholz purchased the land on which the dwelling stood at auction. 

7For the reasons given on 13 May 2010 I am satisfied that on the morning of 14 June 2010 the offender left the address where he was staying in Albury, travelled to the property and set the fire before then proceeding to where he was working for Desmond and Wayne Godde in the Walbundrie area. The dwelling was completely destroyed in the fire. The value of the dwelling was $200,000. I will return to this issue later in these remarks. 

8Although the prosecution brought charges against the accused of Dishonestly for Gain Damage by Fire contrary to s 197(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, for reasons given on 13 May 2011, I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the fire was set for fraudulent purposes, and accordingly the offender was acquitted in respect of those charges. 

Assessment of the Criminality 

9The Sentencing Bench Book sets out: 

Destroying or damaging by fire encompasses a vast array of criminal behaviour, particularly under s 195(1)(b) : R v Pitt [2001] NSWCCA 156 at [29]. Factors relevant to assessing the objective seriousness of a given offence include: 
extent of the damage caused: R v Elzakhem [2008] NSWCCA 31 at [ 45 ]; Porter v R at [ 56 ]. For example, an offence may be considered serious where damage was done to a limited public resource such as public housing: R v Pitt at [27], or where it involved ""substantial loss and personal stress"" to small business owners: Porter v R at [ 83 ]. 
potential risk of injury to other people: Porter v R at [ 80 ]; R v Dinos [1999] NSWCCA 208 at [8]-[10] 
possible spread of the fire: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [16]: Porter v R at [ 80 ] 
offender's knowledge of the financial effects of their conduct. For example, where the property is uninsured: R v Priest [2000] NSWCCA 27 at [14]. 
offender's motive - although the lack of motive does not mitigate the seriousness of the crime: R v Porter at [ 81 ], [ 84 ] 
degree of planning and premeditation: R v Karibian [2007] NSWCCA 334 at [ 28 ], R v VAA [2006] NSWCCA 44 at [ 45 ]. 

10In respect of the second fire (i.e. of 14 June 2010) the property was totally destroyed. As the property was on a farm with no other buildings or other dwellings nearby there was little risk to others. It was unlikely that the fire would have spread. Although there was some obvious planning required in respect of both offences, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the level of planning in respect of either fire was any more than might ordinarily be expected in offences of this type. The evidence is that accelerant was not detected. The evidence was also that in respect of the second fire that had there been accelerant, it would have been totally consumed in the fire. However, in all of the circumstances I could not be satisfied that an accelerant was used in respect of either fire. No other aggravating factor within s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is present. 

11I was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the motive of the offender was to make a fraudulent claim on the relevant insurer. I am not able to find any particular motive beyond reasonable doubt. The actual motive is of little significance in this case. 

12Given my finding of the value of the damage occasioned in the first fire, the matter falls well below the halfway mark on the scale of seriousness of such matters. 

13An issue arose today as to the value of the dwelling that was destroyed in the second fire. The prosecution tendered a report prepared by Mr Robert Bowler of Cunningham Lindsay Australia Pty Limited, Chartered Loss Adjusters. Mr Bowler was one of the witnesses who gave evidence at the hearing. He estimates the value of the Building was $200,000. 

14Mr Quilter, on behalf of the offender, took issue with this figure. He submitted that one need only look at the photographs tendered in the hearing to realise that the value was less than the $200,000. I offered to adjourn the sentence proceedings in order that this issue could be further, explored, but after consulting with his client Mr Quilter indicated that he wished to proceed to finalise the matter today. 

15Given the evidence of Mr Bowler, noting his qualifications, and in the absence of any cross-examination or other evidence I have little alternative but to accept that the value of the building that was destroyed in the fire of 14 June 2010 was $200,000. In respect of the contents, I accept the submission of Mr Quilter that they would have been the property of the offender. I assess the matter relating to the fire on 14 June 2010 to be at or slightly above the halfway mark of objective seriousness. 

Maximum Penalty 

16The maximum penalty for both offences if dealt with on indictment is ten years imprisonment. Accordingly, the principles enunciated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115 apply. In that decision Grove J (Spigelman CJ and Kirby J agreeing) said at [35]: 

The result of true construction of the statutory provisions in New South Wales is that, what has been prescribed is a jurisdictional maximum and not a maximum penalty for any offence triable within that jurisdiction. In other words, where the maximum applicable penalty is lower because the charge has been prosecuted within the limited summary jurisdiction of the Local Court, that court should impose a penalty reflecting the objective seriousness of the offence, tempered if appropriate by subjective circumstances, taking care only not to exceed the maximum jurisdictional limit. The implication of the argument of the appellant that, in lieu of prescribed maximum penalties exceeding two years imprisonment, a maximum of two years imprisonment for all offences triable summarily in the Local Court has been substituted must be rejected. As must also be rejected the corollary that a sentence of two years imprisonment should be reserved for a 'worst case'"". 

17I am of the opinion that the offence relating to the first fire can be conveniently and appropriately dealt with within the Local Court's jurisdictional limit. Given the extent of the damage the maximum penalty in respect of the first fire is 12 months imprisonment. I indicated in the course of taking sentence submissions that I was of the opinion that the first offence could be appropriately dealt with by way of section 9 Bond. Neither advocate sought to be heard in respect of that issue. 

18However, I feel constrained to make clear that I am of the opinion that the appropriate total sentence in respect of charge relating to the fire on 14 June 2010 exceeds by some distance the Local Court's jurisdictional limit of two years. The prosecuting authorities apparently were of the view that the matter could be dealt with by the Local Court. The authorities, and indeed the community, must understand that matters such as this if left in the Local Court are subject to the jurisdictional constraints on the Local Court. 

Matters of General Principle 

19In the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Mazur (2000) 113 A Crim R 67 Winneke P said at [27]: 

""...I agree with Brooking JA that courts imposing sentences for arson will, except in the most exceptional circumstances, regard a sentence of immediate imprisonment as being appropriate"". 

20Brooking JA in that decision considered the earlier (Victorian) case of R v Perrone (1989) 43 A Crim R 366. His Honour said in Mazur at [24] that the decision in Perrone was wrong. However, his Honour went on to say in Mazur at [24] that: 

""To say this, of course, not to touch the proposition accepted in Perrone that in cases of arson a custodial sentence is not inevitable"". 

21My research has not found a decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal that so succinctly states the matter of general principle. Mr Quilter has, however, referred me to the decision of Porter v R [2008] NSWCCA 145. In that decision Johnson J said at [81]: 

The crime of arson may be committed in a variety of circumstances. It is an extremely serious and dangerous crime: R v James (1981) 27 SASR 348 at 351; R v Davies at 358 [44]. The motive of the offender is relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence: Newton v State of Western Australia [2006] WASCA 247 at [13]. Courts have observed that arson is very easy to commit, usually with destructive (if not tragic) consequences: R v Catts (1996) 85 A Crim R 171 at 176; Newton v State of Western Australia at [12]. It has been said that arson is often a difficult crime to detect: R v Davies at 370 [97]. Consideration of factors such as these has led courts to emphasise the importance of general deterrence in arson cases. 

Criminal History of the Offender 

22His record assists the offender. I ignore the matters before 2008. In 2008 he was convicted and placed on a bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for a common assault, and given the benefit of a section 10 bond for a driving offence. 

Subjective Matters 

23On 13 May 2011, I ordered the preparation of a pre-sentence report. I also indicated at that time that I was firmly of the opinion that there was no realistic alternative other than a lengthy sentence of full time custody, at least in respect of the offence relating to the fire on 14 June 2010. Through some administrative failures, the report was not completed. I have decided to deal with the matter in the absence of a pre sentence report. It is my firm view that the non-custodial sentencing options would be a manifestly inadequate disposition of the matter, at least in respect of the offence relating to the second fire. 

24On the subject of Pre-Sentence Reports, in R v Olive [2006] NSWCCA 329 At [13], Bell J (as her Honour then was) (Tobias JA and Grove J agreeing) referred to the previous decision of R v Majors (1991) 27 NSWLR 624, in which Carruthers J observed at 627: 

""Adjournment of the sentencing process to enable the preparation of a pre sentence report should be confined to those cases where it is apparent to the judge that there is a clear and legitimate advantage to be obtained by this course."" 

25Bell J went on to say at [14]: 

""It is appropriate for the Court to direct the preparation of a pre sentence report in a case in which the Judge is of the opinion that an alternative to a sentence of full time custody may be within the range of appropriate sentencing dispositions: a number of sentencing options cannot be imposed unless the Court is satisfied that the offender is a suitable person to undertake them. In deciding whether to sentence an offender to a term to be served by way of periodic detention, or home detention, or to impose a community service order, the Court is required to have regard to the contents of an assessment report, and to such evidence from a probation and parole officer as to the Court considers necessary"". 

26The offender is represented by able and experienced Counsel. Mr Quilter has properly and thoroughly addressed me on all relevant subjective matters, I have proceeded on the basis that those matters also go to the issue of a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I am satisfied that I can pass sentence in this matter without a Pre-Sentence Report. 

27Mr Quilter's primary submission was the second offence could be dealt with by way of suspended sentence. It is implicit in that submission that no other sentence other than a sentence of custody is appropriate - see R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [24]-[25]. It was put that there is no judicial or legislative authority for the proposition that a full-time custodial sentence must be imposed for matters of the type on which I am passing sentence. However, it is obvious from the decisions from which I have extracted above that a sentence of full time custody would be starting point for the consideration of sentence for an offence of arson involving substantial loss or damage. 

28Counsel for the offender advanced four reasons as to why any sentence should be suspended. These were the limited criminal history of the offender, the fact that it was unlikely that he would re offend, the subjective seriousness of the matter was such that a sentence of full time custody was not required and that he was spent a period of approximately 6 weeks in custody, being his first time in custody has been onerous. As I understood the submission, this submission was expanded upon in that that period in custody has served the purpose of specific deterrence. 

29The offender certainly has very limited criminal antecedents. I have set out the relevant antecedents earlier in these remarks, and as found above he is assisted by his criminal record. 

30However, to use an expression of Schmidt J in passing sentence in the matter of R v Williams [2011] NSWSC 583 ""that the offender is unlikely to re offend, is in my view a conclusion that cannot readily be reached"". For whatever reason the offender was prepared on two occasions to destroy the dwelling at ""Carinya"", and succeeded on the second attempt. The nature of the offence is such that some planning was required. There is no evidence from the offender or any expert. 

31The third point essentially goes to the determination of the objective seriousness of the offence. It was put and I accept that so far as the second offence is concerned it was merely a house and not a home. It was essentially uninhabitable after the first fire. It was put and I accept that the Commonwealth Bank had just foreclosed. It was put and I accept (as found above) that there was no danger of the fire spreading. It was put and I accept that there was no ongoing loss as would be case had the premises been business premises and the proprietor precluded from carrying on the business. I have taken all of those factors into account in determining where the matter falls on the scale of objective seriousness. 

32It is accepted that the offender has been in custody since 13 May 2011. A report from Samantha Ainsworth, Intern Psychologist at the Junee Correctional Centre was tendered. It sets out that Mr Barlow was placed on suicide watch from 16 to 20 May 2011, and again recently on 10 June 2011 because of uncertainty over these proceedings. 

33The Report further details that he has been the victim of violence at the hand of other inmates. Mr Quilter informed me that he had spoken to the author of the report who informed him that at the time she spoke to Mr Barlow he had a black eye. There is no reason to doubt this. I briefly explored the issue of the reason for the violence. It was submitted that it was because of calls from outside the gaol. I could not be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the violence inflicted was because of the matter on which I am passing sentence. 

34Mr Quilter expanded the submission in respect of the fourth point he made in that given the age of the offender (55 years), the fact that this is his first time in custody, and that the 6 weeks he has spent in custody have not been easy for him he has undergone a real punishment, and accordingly the issue of specific deterrence has already been addressed. I accept that the offender is 55 and that given that fact taken with this being his first time in custody and what has occurred it has not been easy for the offender. However, it is timely to remind myself of what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354: 

Even so, there is sometimes a risk that attention to persuasive subjective considerations may cause inadequate weight to be given to the objective seriousness of the case: Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594."" 

35The offender was employed in the rural industry at the time of the commission of the offences. It was submitted and I accept that the offender would have little difficulty obtaining work in that industry. Mr Quilter submitted and I accept that Mr Godde, who was the offender's employer at the time of the offence would be prepared to again employ the offender. 

Prosecution submissions 

36As I understood the situation the prosecution did not seek to be heard in respect of the proposed disposition of the first offence. However, the prosecution submitted that to suspend any sentence for the second offence would be to impose a sentence that was manifestly inadequate. 

General Comments 

37Any sentence imposed must reflect the objective seriousness of the offence - see R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354. Dodd was affirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Carroll [2008] NSWCCA 218 at [20]-[21]. Carroll of course successfully appealed to the High Court. However, there is nothing within the judgment of High Court that impacts on the affirmation of the earlier decision of Dodd. 

38I must, offcourse, give proper effect to section 3A and 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The purposes of punishment as prescribed in s 3A are: 

(a)to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
(b)to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 
(c)to protect the community from the offender, 
(d)to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
(e)to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
(f)to denounce the conduct of the offender, and 
(g)to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community. 

39It is an established principle of sentencing that the sentence imposed must be proportionate to the offence. I am of the opinion that given what I have found to be the damage occasioned by the first fire, that matter can be dealt with my a lengthy Bond to be of Good Behaviour pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

40After careful consideration of the all of the objective and subjective material and the helpful and comprehensive submissions by Mr Quilter I remain firmly of the opinion that the only appropriate sentence in respect of the count relating to the fire on 14 June 2010 is a sentence of full time custody. The next issue is the length of the sentence. I have had regard to the statistics of matters dealt with in the Local Court of this type involving damage over $15,000. I have also had regard to the sentences imposed in the District Court for like offences. I caution myself about the use of those statistics - see for example Hili & Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45, R v Ryan (2003) 141 A Crim R 403 at 411, and Han v R [2009] NSWCCA 300 at [2]-[3]. I remain of the opinion that the appropriate total sentence exceeds the jurisdictional limit of this Court. 

41On the issue of whether the sentence should be suspended I return to the decision of Zamagias . Howie J said at [32]: 

""Further, a sentencing court must approach the imposition of a sentence that is suspended on the basis that it can be sufficiently severe form of punishment to act as a deterrent to both the general public and the particular offender. Of course it must also be recognised that the fact that the execution of sentence is to be immediately suspended will deprive the punishment of much of its effectiveness in this regard because it is a significantly more lenient penalty than any other sentence of imprisonment. The question of whether any particular sentencing alternative, including a suspended sentence, is an appropriate or adequate form of punishment must be considered on a case by case basis, having regard to the nature of the offence committed, the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the need for general or specific deterrence and the subjective circumstances of the offender. It is perhaps trite to observe that, although the purpose of punishment is to protect the community, that purpose can be achieved in an appropriate case by a sentence designed to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender at the expense of deterrence, retribution and denunciation. In such a case a suspended sentence may be particularly effective and appropriate."" 

42In the matter relating to the fire on 14 June 2010 I am of the opinion that the need for general and specific deterrence, taken with the seriousness of the offending is such that the sentence should not be suspended. 

43The issue that remains is special circumstances. No specific submission was put on this issue, however, I understood the submission of counsel for the offender that the secondary submission would be that given the matters advanced in mitigation they would amount to special circumstances. In this case where I have found that the appropriate total sentence exceeds the jurisdictional limit of this the issue of special circumstances takes on an added complexity. Given what I have determined to be the situation with the appropriate total sentence the offender has already had considerable leniency extended to him by having this matter dealt with in the Local Court. In R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 Spigelman CJ (Hulme & Admas JJ agreeing) said at [22]: 

""...Simply because there is present in a case a circumstance which is capable of constituting a 'special circumstance' does not mean that a sentencing judge is obliged to vary the statutory proportion. To repeat what was said in Simpson (at [68]) it is necessary that the circumstances be sufficiently special to justify a variation "". 

44In the matter presently under consideration, I am not prepared to make a finding of special circumstances. The period on parole provided by the statutory ratio will in my opinion be a sufficient period for supervision, particularly in light of the fact that supervision by the Probation and Parole Service will also be a condition of the Bond that will shortly be imposed in respect of the count relating to the fire on 12 May 2010. 

Formal Orders 

45In respect of sequences 2 and 4 the offender is convicted. 

In respect of Sequence 2 (count relating to fire on 12 May 2010) consequent upon that conviction: 

The offender is released on a Bond pursuant to section 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for a period of thirty months . Such bond is conditioned: 

(1)He be of good behaviour; 
(2)He appear for sentence in respect of any breach within that period; 
(3)For the period of the bond or such shorter period as might be deemed appropriate, he is to accept the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service; and 
(4)Notify this Court of any change of address. 

In respect of Sequence 4 (count relating to fire of 14 June 2010) the offender is: 

Sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months from 13 May 2011, which will expire on 12 November 2012. 

Thereafter I specify a Balance of Term of 6 months to date from 13 November 2012 and expire on 12 May 2013.

2709556,R v Wendy Lynette NEIL [2011] NSWDC 78,"SENTENCE 


1. Wendy Lynette Neil systematically defrauded the Commonwealth Government of over $75,000 over a period of some eleven years. From 1993 to 2004 whilst she was deriving income from employment she was also receiving certain Commonwealth benefits to which she was either not entitled or to which she was entitled to receive at a smaller rate. 

2. As a result of that behaviour she has been charged with ten offences against s 29B of the Crimes Act 1914 of the Commonwealth and one offence against s 135.1(5) of the Criminal Code of the Commonwealth. 

3. The Crimes Act offences all assert that Wendy Neil by a false representation obtained benefits from the Commonwealth. She imposed upon the Department of Social Security or its successor by an untrue representation by omission with a view to obtaining various benefits. The maximum penalty for crimes committed against s 29B of the Crimes Act is two years imprisonment. 

4. The one offence against s 135.1 of the Criminal Code claims that Ms Neil dishonestly caused a loss to the Commonwealth knowing that such a loss would occur in that she obtained certain benefits when she was in receipt of other income. The maximum penalty for an offence against that section is five years imprisonment. 

5. It is important for a judge in sentencing any offender to set out briefly what happened to bring about the charges and to make some assessment of how serious an example of the crime this particular, or these particular offences are. 

6. In this case the information is conveniently set out in exhibit A which specified that Ms Neil over some two hundred and seventy three payment fortnights between 1993 and 2004 received more than she was entitled to as benefits. This came about because she failed to declare that she was employed by Woolworths during that period. Her benefits from the Commonwealth were paid in the name of Wendy Lynette Neil. At Woolworths she was employed as Wendy Lynette Sawtell. The total amount she wrongly obtained from the Commonwealth was $75,290.40. At various stages she was sent notices asking her to declare whether she was employed or not and she said that she was not employed therefore suggesting that she was entitled to the benefits. 

7. On 25 May 2004 Ms Neil attended an interview at Centrelink about getting a job. The adviser offered her help in seeking to find a job. Of course Ms Neil already had a job but she had not told the department. Two days later Ms Neil phoned Centrelink and told them that she had "" got the job"" and would confirm her earnings. About a week or two after that she asked Centrelink to cancel the payments. In other words she voluntarily stopped the payments, I infer, after she became apprehensive about being detected. 

8. It was not until some four years later in 2008 that the over-payment was detected by Centrelink. Ms Neil was asked whether she wanted to be interviewed but she declined. However she did send a letter to the department admitting effectively her guilt and pointing out that she had been very depressed and was looking after her elderly and unwell mother. She acknowledged that she had done the wrong thing and expressed her sorrow about what she had done. 

9. Then commencing - as exhibit 3 shows - only a few months later, on 18 December 2008, she started to repay the Commonwealth what she owed. She has kept up those repayments regularly over the period of time and has, or had, up to a few months ago paid over $12,000 back to the government. 

10. She has pleaded guilty to the charges and has come before me for sentence. 

11. Mr Krisenthal of counsel in the sentence proceedings on 29 April 2011 called his client who said that she had two children whose father was Paul Sawtell but they had separated, that is, the parents, at an early stage and the relationship was on and off since then. But at this stage he was supporting her so far as this charge is concerned. 

12. She has been working for Woolworths for some eighteen years and explained that she was using the extra money fraudulently obtained from the Commonwealth in her struggle to support herself and her children. She said she was not engaging in luxuries such as holidays or expensive clothes or items but they were basic needs for her and her family. In fact she said that she had never been on a holiday. She has suffered anxiety and depression for a long time. 

13. Her children are now in their twenties, her son is at home and has a job. She told me that she felt very embarrassed and ashamed at what she had done. She had let everyone down and was very sorry. The only people whom she has told are her mother and her brother and, I expect, Mr Sawtell. Her children do not know about her present predicament, nor does her employer. She has been paying off the debt to the Commonwealth at about $100 a week regularly. 

14. Part of exhibit A was a pre-sentence report prepared by Probation and Parole Service. It summarised Ms Neil's case in the following terms: 
"" Ms Neil presented as an individual who internalised her family's financial stress and opted for the seemingly easy, albeit dishonest solution to ease her financial woes, fearing that she would otherwise be regarded less as a provider. She appeared genuinely regretful. She appeared genuinely regretful and extremely ashamed at her actions, though persevering with that habit of trying to support a household budget on her own. Despite her predicament, she advised that she intends to continue the current arrangement of providing for her two adult children, regardless of their employment and financial capacity to meet their own living expenses."" 

15. As additional evidence, Mr Krisenthal tendered a report by a forensic psychologist, Rima Nasr, dated 21 June 2010. Ms Nasr noted a long-term history of depression and anxiety which she thought was "" consistent with a long term depressive disorder "". She thought it might be dysthymia. In addition, Ms Nasr noted that Ms Neil suffered from anxiety, worrying about most things and ruminating about finances which, Ms Nasr noted, "" appears to be related to her offending behaviour and overwhelming concern about relationships ."" Ms Nasr thought that the history she was given was "" consistent with a generalised anxiety disorder "". Ms Nasr expressed the opinion that Ms Neil's excessive worry about finances appeared to have "" been a contributing factor in her offending behaviour, to the point that she reportedly disregarded the law in order to ameliorate her anxious symptoms. "" 

16. In Ms Nasr's opinion she regarded it as essential that Ms Neil have access to consistent psychological treatment in order to address her various concerns. Finally, Ms Nasr expressed the opinion - given Ms Neil's "" presentation of a psychologically fragile woman who was vulnerable in her inter-personal relationships "" - that there were "" concerns that a gaol term may expose her to victimisation or manipulation by more sophisticated offenders' groups, which would significantly exacerbate her already poor mental state ."" 

17. Another exhibit indicates that Ms Neil had commenced to undertake some psychological treatment with a psychologist in Brookvale. 

18. It should be noted that Ms Neil has only one item on her criminal record, which is an offence of stealing which occurred in 1988, and which the law now regards as spent. So I do not take that into account at all and regard her as having a clear criminal record. 

19. Ms Guillen, who appears for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, in her helpful written submissions, made it clear that in all the circumstances "" a sentence of full-time custody is appropriate "". Indeed she went on to argue that a sentence other than full-time custody would involve appellable error because of the period of time of eleven years and the amount involved, as well as the false representations and the fact that Commonwealth benefits were paid to her in a different name than the name in which she was employed. 

20. Ms Guillen argued that little weight should be given to any submissions about good character because of the length of time over which the offences have occurred. I think that submission is right. 

21. She submitted correctly that there were no relationships within the family that would warrant other than a sentence of full-time custody. 

22. The plea of guilty Ms Guillen acknowledged was at the first available opportunity. 

23. The overpayments were raised in 2008 and the court attendance notice was issued one year later, on 26 October 2009. Ms Guillen argues that the delay in those circumstances is not significant. 

24. Ms Guillen argued that Ms Neil had "" engaged in a deliberate and organised fraud on the social security system over a considerable period of time and involving a substantial amount of money "". She drew my attention to the authorities which suggested that this was not a question of temporarily "" dipping into the till "" to overcome a problem, but a consistent and persistent episode of criminal behaviour. She pointed out how important general deterrence was and that must be a correct submission subject to one factor which I will mention shortly. 

25. There was no evidence, Ms Guillen said, of serious health concerns. She submitted that I should put little if any weight on the report of Ms Nasr. These submissions were prepared at a stage before Ms Guillen knew that the offender would be called to give evidence. In light of her evidence verifying much of what she told Ms Nasr, I do put weight on that report. 

26. Ms Guillen acknowledged that in a case such as this, where there is one multifaceted course of criminal conduct or the offending was part of one criminal enterprise, it may be appropriate to make the terms of imprisonment concurrent. 

27. Ms Guillen drew my attention to comparative cases for offences such as these. 

28. Mr Krisenthal drew my attention to the options which were available to me. He realistically acknowledged that his client must receive a sentence of imprisonment, but argued that it could be served in a number of ways, including being suspended or by way of home detention. He added I could also impose a community service order. 

29. I am of the opinion that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances than a sentence of imprisonment. That follows from the matters which Ms Guillen has referred to and, as I said, has been realistically acknowledged by Mr Krisenthal. 

30. Mr Krisenthal drew my attention to the chronology involved in his client voluntarily discontinuing the receipt of pension and also undertaking repayments. He pointed to the delay of a year before charges were laid. He said his client was obviously remorseful and had experienced a very insular existence, and he placed reliance on the report of Ms Nasr. He argued that her long term untreated psychological problems had contributed to his client's behaviour. I accept that submission. They were diagnosed psychological problems, indeed the psychologist went so far as to indicate that they seemed to be psychiatric disorders. 

31. Mr Krisenthal argued that they were relevant in reducing his client's moral culpability and in reducing the significance of general deterrence in making a prison sentence more burdensome, and in reducing the significance of specific deterrence. He urged that I could suspend the sentence. 

32. As I indicated, I do not regard it appropriate for a suspended sentence to be imposed in this case. The sentence needs to be served in a way which is more punitive because of the seriousness of the offending behaviour. 

33. Both Mr Krisenthal and Ms Guillen referred me to authorities about the significance of delay. 

34. I have determined that an overall sentence of two years imprisonment is appropriate in this case and I have decided that it should be served by way of an intensive correction order. 

35. I owe it to Ms Guillen in light of her submissions to indicate why I do not regard full-time custody as appropriate. 

36. In no particular order, first I take into account that Ms Neil voluntarily ceased her criminal behaviour. Such an action is relevant in the way suggested by Harrison J in Regina v Burns [2007] NSWCCA 228. In delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal Harrison J, with whom the Chief Justice and Simpson J agreed, said that such action "" is a significant factor in mitigation for a number of reasons "". His Honour referred to the public policy in providing encouragement to offenders to cease their criminal activities and to the reduction in the significance of specific deterrence. It provides, thirdly, strong evidence of remorse, contrition and rehabilitation and may support the proposition that the offence was committed as a result of need rather than greed. I regard all of those factors as being relevant to this case and therefore, as the Court of Criminal Appeal has said, amounting to a "" significant factor in mitigation "". (I have quoted from [29] of the judgment.) 

37. Next I take into account that a repayment plan had been in place for some time and Ms Neil has repaid a significant amount of money. In many of these cases the offender is in no position to pay any money at all. Ms Neil, whose employment as an assistant in a delicatessen in Woolworths means that her income must be limited, has made a significant effort to repay. 

38. Next I accept the submission that the long term untreated psychiatric and psychological problems contributed to the offence in this case. I accept Ms Nasr's report in that regard. I take into account the moral culpability is reduced and general deterrence is not as significant and, in particular, I take into account the opinion expressed by Ms Nasr about Ms Neil's vulnerability in the prison system. 

39. Next I take into account, although it may somewhat overlap with the voluntary cessation of criminal behaviour, that Ms Neil's prospects of rehabilitation are good. She has commenced a form of treatment. She is, in my opinion, unlikely to re-offend. This offence was not aggravated by greed. 

40. Finally, I take into account the fact that there was a delay of one year between her offending behaviour being detected and charges being laid. I am not critical of the Commonwealth for such a delay, but it is relevant for the reasons which the Court of Criminal Appeal said in R v McGuiness [2008] NSWCCA 80 at [49]. The delay in that case was also about a year and its relevance was pointed out in a joint judgment of Bell JA, as her Honour then was, and Simpson and Rothman JJ where the Court said it is "" because of the impact on the offender, who after making full admissions of guilt and entering into an arrangement to repay the agency, is lulled into a belief that the matter will be resolved without the intervention of the criminal law ."" It is, as the Court said, a factor to be taken into account. 

41. For those reasons, in my opinion, it is appropriate to order that the sentence be served by way of an intensive correction order. 

HIS HONOUR: I will just suspend my reasons there and ask for Mr Guillen's assistance here. There are ten Crimes Act offences and one Criminal Code offence, and I think you acknowledged that, and tell me if I'm wrong, I refer to it in my reasons, that they can be served concurrently. Do you maintain that? 

GUILLEN: Yes, that's correct, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: I have in mind concurrent sentences of 18 months in respect of the Crimes Act offences and a sentence of two years in respect of the more serious Criminal Code offence which carries a maximum of two years. Do you have anything to say about that on the concurrency and accumulation issue-- 

GUILLEN: Your Honour while of the view that because you're imposing a ICO that you don't need to actually specify for each particular offence the amount of time. 

HIS HONOUR: That's a relief, right. 

GUILLEN: I think you just need to say that you're sentencing the prisoner to two years, the date that it will commence and the date that it will expire for all those. 

HIS HONOUR: You both agree on that, do you? 

LYNCH: Yes, I think that is right. 

HIS HONOUR: That's in section what? Where do you get that from? 

GUILLEN: It's not really in any section, your Honour, it's just that under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act when you impose an ICO that's how the other courts have done that. 

LYNCH: The other thing your Honour might do, although I haven't had a judge yet do it, is avail yourself of the recent amendment for an aggregate sentence. 

HIS HONOUR: Is that available for Commonwealth offences? It always has been, hasn't it? 

LYNCH: I don't see why it wouldn't be because it's a way of addressing, where your Honour would simply in fact indicate what you've just said but pronounce an aggregate sentence of two years, and it's then that sentence that would be served by way of the Intensive Corrections Order. I think it's 53 or thereabouts, the aggregate sentence. 

HIS HONOUR: And Ms Guillen, that applies to Commonwealth offences, does it? 

GUILLEN: I'm not sure, your Honour. I haven't come across that. 

HIS HONOUR: What we don't do is, I don't fix a non-parole period or whatever it's called, do I? 

GUILLEN: That's right, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: That's right, okay. I think I will conservatively - if I was conservative, I would still sentence in the way I propose, that is, 18 months for each of the ten, and I won't specify, although it might have to be the case in the order, I don't know, and two years for the other. Would that be an error? 

GUILLEN: That's over two years. 

LYNCH: It's not over because the commencement date is the same. 

GUILLEN: Okay, concurrent, yes, okay. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes, commencement date's the same. That wouldn't be an error? 

LYNCH: I don't think so. 

HIS HONOUR: I don't think so. 

LYNCH: The problem is, too, the language of the Act does seem to assume, oddly, a singular sentence, because it talks about an intensive correction order. 

GUILLEN: And it said it must serve the full term of the sentence as well. 

LYNCH: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: It's probably got to be an order in respect of each of the sentences. 

LYNCH: It won't matter because-- 

HIS HONOUR: No, it won't matter. 

LYNCH: --in the same way that a sequence of suspended sentences and bonds attaching to each is really just the same thing X amount of times. 

HIS HONOUR: Okay. 

LYNCH: If your Honour wants to do it that way-- 

HIS HONOUR: I do. Well, I'm just to err on the side of caution. I mean, you don't want to end up in the Court of Criminal Appeal on this point if possible The Crown's made it clear that they have a view about non-custodial--

42. In respect of each of the ten offences against s 29B of the Crimes Act 1914, I sentence Ms Neil to eighteen months imprisonment. In respect of the offence against s 135.1(5) of the Criminal Code , I sentence Ms Neil to two years imprisonment. In respect of each of the sentences I make an Intensive Correction Order under s 7 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, directing that each sentence be served by way of intensive correction in the community. I direct that each of the sentences is to commence on Friday, 15 July 2011. 

LYNCH: I think that's too short, your Honour, and I hate to interrupt. 
HIS HONOUR: Tell me if I'm wrong. 
LYNCH: It's too short. 
HIS HONOUR: I'm looking at s 71. 
LYNCH: 71, no later than 21 days. 
HIS HONOUR: 
"" Having made an Intensive Correction Order, a court is to fix the date of commencement so that the date is no later than 21 days after that on which the order is made."" 

LYNCH: But in relation to exhibit 4, for some reason, they've asked that it be no earlier than in the concluding para, 21 business days. That appears on p 2 just above the signature of the officer that did the assessment. I don't know why, but it might well suit their procedures. 

HIS HONOUR: The Act has to prevail and I guess if there's a problem then you'll have to come back under s 43, is that not right, I mean I can't-- 

LYNCH: Can I suggest this, wouldn't the 21st day--

HIS HONOUR: Yours is 21 business days, that says, is that right? 

LYNCH: Yes, I don't think your Honour can do that, but if your Honour picked the 21st day to comply with s 71, that's as much as your Honour can give them. 

HIS HONOUR: All right. So that'd be 22 July? 

LYNCH: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: I'll revise the last order. 


43. Under s 71 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I fix the date of commencement of each of the sentences as 22 July 2011. 

HIS HONOUR: All right? 
LYNCH: Thank you, your Honour. 
HIS HONOUR: So, so far so good. From memory there are standard conditions. 

GUILLEN: Sorry, your Honour, because it's a Commonwealth matter, you also need to state the expiry date of that ICO. I know you said two years, but 


44. The sentences for the ten offences against s 29, the ten offences under the Crimes Act will expire on 21 January 2013. The sentence for the offence against the Criminal Code will expire on 21 July 2013. 

HIS HONOUR: Now, there's reference to cl 175 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation. I don't happen to have that. 

LYNCH: Neither do I and that's in vol 4. 

HIS HONOUR: I'll have my associate just look that up, cl 175 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008 . 

GUILLEN: I think your Honour just has to specify the local office of the Corrective Services department. 

HIS HONOUR: That may be right, but chances are I've got to specify conditions as well, is that not right? 

LYNCH: I think that's right because under s 72 you've got to explain them. 

HIS HONOUR: Exactly right. And also, I'd like to ask each of you to consider what the consequence of failure to comply is. 

LYNCH: State Parole Authority on advice from the Commissioner of Corrective Services. 

HIS HONOUR: Section? 

LYNCH: Section 88 to 91. 

HIS HONOUR: 88? 

LYNCH: Yes, I'll just check it. 

HIS HONOUR: All right. 


45. The Intensive Correction Orders are subject to the conditions prescribed by reg 175 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008. 


HIS HONOUR: I won't list those in the formal order, but I'll have to read them out to Ms Neil. It says here for such local office of the Corrective Services, would that be a Probation and Parole office? 

LYNCH: It is because they're now called Community Corrections. 

HIS HONOUR: Okay. And what's the nearest? Your client lives at Allambie Heights. 

LYNCH: Allambie. They said you'd have to go to Parramatta. 

GUILLEN: If I can assist, your Honour, you can just say ""specified local office of the Corrective Services department or on such other date as may be determined by the Commissioner for Corrective Services. 

LYNCH: Just so your Honour's aware, as a matter of practicality, Ms Neil says that she was told that in due course if this all went through it'd be Parramatta, but she can certainly report to Brookvale which would be the nearest to Allambie. Dee Why, in fact, no you're quite right, Dee Why, your Honour. 

Just while I'm on my feet, your Honour is probably looking at the fuller version of what I don't have. One of those mandatory conditions I think is the one - at least the bench book notes you've provided - suggests offender is to engage in activities to address factors associated with offending. That is the one that your Honour might have some latitude to address the mental health factor that's identified by the assessing officer as relevant to the offending,. 


46. In respect of reg 175(b), Ms Neil is to report on 22 July 2011 or on such later date as may be advised by the Commissioner, to such local office of Corrective Services NSW or other location as may be advised by the Commissioner. 

HIS HONOUR: Now, how are we going so far? 
LYNCH: Yes. 
GUILLEN: Yes. 
HIS HONOUR: In a moment I have to explain the correction order, and what are the consequences of failure to comply; where do I find those? 

GUILLEN: 88. 

HIS HONOUR: Of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act ? 

LYNCH: Well, unless I've got a really old one, it doesn't match the notes. 

HIS HONOUR: I reckon it's the Crimes (Administration of Sentences), s 88, which my associate will print out in a moment. 

LYNCH: Was your Honour - in relation to that psychological thing - I'm not trying to sound like I'm quizzing, your Honour - cl 175 lists 17 mandatory condition ..(not transcribable).. to be imposed by the court. These include on the dot points the last - I know I'm banging on a big about it, but the mental health one worries me, because if the suggestion is that having been identified in exhibit 4, your Honour must make an order. I don't have the legislation and obviously I'm in your Honour's hands. I'm just concerned - you can see my problem - if the officer raises it as being a factor associated with the offending and if the regulation suggests that your Honour mandatorily has to deal with that if it's identified, that's all I'm asking your Honour to do if that's how you read it. 

HIS HONOUR: And the report identified mental health issues? 

LYNCH: It does, it's the last page. The following factors associated with the offending would be targeted if an Intensive Correction Order is made, dot mental health. I'm putting that together with the bench book extract which seems to suggest that it comes under the mandatory conditions as a - to address the factors associated with his or her offending as identified in the assessment report. So it does seem like if the report identifies it, your Honour has to deal with it somehow. It's only a matter of formality. I'm just concerned that the order not be inadequate for that absence. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes, mental health, the following factors associated with the offending, so that clearly falls within - all right. In a moment I'll explain it. Is there anything - any other formal orders I need to make before I explain? Anything Commonwealth things that I need to do? 

GUILLEN: Your Honour, I'd be seeking orders in relation to court cost, nothing to do with the ICO, though, and a reparation order. 

HIS HONOUR: Reparation order seems appropriate: how much? 

GUILLEN: The amount that's currently outstanding is $62,140.40. 

HIS HONOUR: Does that sound right, Mr Lynch-- 

LYNCH: It did on my maths when I did it-- 

HIS HONOUR: Just say the figure again? 

GUILLEN: $62,160.40. 

LYNCH: Does that include interest or just outstanding? 

GUILLEN: No, just outstanding. 

HIS HONOUR: You'll seek a reparation order in that amount? 

GUILLEN: Yes. And court costs of $76 for filing the court attendance notice, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Court costs $76, okay. I've got power to order that, do I. 

SPEAKER: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: Do you agree, Mr Lynch? 

LYNCH: Yes, your Honour. 


47. I make a reparation order in the sum of $62,160.40 which Ms Neil must repay. In addition, I order that she pay court costs in the sum of seventy-six dollars. 

HIS HONOUR: No other Commonwealth-type orders I need to make? 
GUILLEN: That's all your Honour. 
HIS HONOUR: No? 
GUILLEN: No. 
HIS HONOUR: No. Any other orders before I formally explain it, Mr Lynch? I don't think so. No other formal orders? 

LYNCH: Only if your Honour, with the benefit of the legislation-- 

HIS HONOUR: I will. I'm just about to do that, yes. 

LYNCH: If you cover the mental health aspect I'm happy. 

HIS HONOUR: I will, good, okay. 

LYNCH: Thank you, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Ms Neil, if you'd stand up. Now, you've received a gaol sentence, you understand that, a prison sentence? You're not going to have to serve it in prison, but I've imposed a prison sentence. Do you understand that? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: In fact, I've imposed 11 of them. You've got 18 months for each of the Crimes Act ones and you've got two years for the one under the Commonwealth Criminal Code , do you understand that? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: So the total is two years, and I've directed that it start on 22 July, three weeks from today, so the total of two years will expire on 21 July in 2013, do you understand that? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: So you've got a prison sentence. Now, I've made an order that you serve that prison sentence by way of Intensive Correction Order in the community. So you can stay at home and go to work, but you're serving your prison sentence by way of this Intensive Correction Order, do you understand that? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: It's got certain conditions which are compulsory. There's about a dozen of them and I have to read them out to you, do you understand that? Mr Lynch will probably give you something which - it might be a good idea, Mr Lynch, to print out regulation 175, or I might actually give it to you before you go. 

LYNCH: I can cut and paste it in a file and give it to Ms Neil, thank you, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Good, all right. You've got to be of good behaviour. You've got to behave yourself, stay out of trouble, don't commit any other offences. That's a condition, do you understand? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: The Commissioner of Corrective Services will ask you to report to an office of his somewhere. Sounds like it might be Parramatta, but you'll get a notice about it, do you understand that? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: You've got to report there. You'll have a supervisor and you can only live at a place, reside at premises approved by the supervisor, do you understand that? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: I doubt whether the supervisor will have any problem you living at home, but it's got to be approved by the supervisor. This is why it's an Intensive Correction Order, they really keep an eye on you. You're not allowed to leave New South Wales or stay out of the state - you're not allowed to leave the state without the permission of the Commissioner, do you understand? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: You're not allowed to leave Australia without the Parole Authority giving you permission, do you understand? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Or stay out. You've got to accept visits by your supervisor at any time, provided it has connection with the order. They can turn up at any time and visit you, do you understand that? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: You are required to authorise your medical practitioner, your therapist or counsellor, to provide information to your supervisor about that that's relevant for the order, do you understand that? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: You've got to allow them to search things, places or thing under your immediately control. That's unlikely - this is hardly a drug offence or anything like that - but they've got that power. If they turn up and want to search then you've got to permit it, do you understand that? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: You're not allowed to use prohibited drugs or get drugs or abuse drugs, and I don't think you've ever had an issue about that, have you? 

OFFENDER: No. 

HIS HONOUR: But it's a condition. You've got to submit to breath testing, urinalysis or medical approved tests about drug and alcohol if they require it. Once again, this is not that sort of case, but it's a condition, do you understand it? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: You're not allowed to have any firearm or explosives, do you understand that? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: You've got to agree to surveillance or monitoring. They might have you on electronic surveillance or monitoring, as the supervisor suggest, and you've got to comply with instructions give by the supervisor about operating that surveillance. I don't know how they do that or whether they do it, but if they want to do it you've got to agree, do you understand that? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: You're not allowed to damage or interfere with the surveillance or monitoring equipment if they put it on you, do you understand? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: You've got to comply with any direction given by a supervisor which might require you to stay at a particular place during particular hours or which otherwise restricts your movements during hours. So they might say that you can't go somewhere or you've got to stay at a particular place. As I said, I don't know how these operate, but you've got to agree if the supervisor says so, do you understand? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Now this is important, this one. You have to undertake a minimum of 32 hours of community service work a month as they direct you. So 32 hours a month. So that's about eight hours a week, about an hour a day, so to speak, but you've got to do 32 hours of community service work a month as they direct you, do you understand? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: That's part of the punishment. It's going to be really inconvenient. That's the idea because you've not going into gaol, but your life's going to be interfered with out of gaol, but hopefully you'll be able to keep doing what you're doing so far as living at home and working. 

The second last one is the one Mr Lynch is concerned about, you've got to engage - you've got to do whatever they say to address your offending, to address the reasons that you committed these crimes. You've got to co-operate with them, and if they suggest you do certain things - for example, my guess is counselling - then you've got to comply, do you understand that? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: And they've actually said in the assessment report, the factor associated with offending which would be targeted in your case, mental health issues, do you understand that? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: That was obvious from your psychologist's report, from your evidence which I heard, from Mr Krisenthal's submissions, what Mr Lynch says. You're on the track but they will require you to stay on that track of addressing it, do you understand? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: The last one is you've got to comply with any reasonable directions which the supervisor gives you, do you understand? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: I've got to tell you if you don't comply with any of those. If you mess up and you don't comply with any of those you can get a formal warning or they can make the conditions stricter, you know, make it even tighter and harder for you, they can do that, do you understand that? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Or they can refer it to the Parole Authority if it's a really serious breach, do you understand? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: And if there's a serious breach and you end up in the Parole Authority they can do the same, give you a formal warning, or apply - more strictly, or they can give you up to seven days' home detention and make you stay at home for seven days so you wouldn't be able to go to work, do you understand that? That's the sort of power they have. Or they can actually revoke the order altogether which I've made. Revoking the order means that you - and tell me if I'm wrong - you go to gaol because there's no order directing to serve the gaol by way of intensive correction. You would have to serve the prison sentence which I've given you, do you understand that? 

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Have a seat, Ms Neil. You don't need any of these things, Mr Lynch, you'll cut and paste as you say. 

LYNCH: No, your Honour, thank you. 

HIS HONOUR: Is there anything else I need to do, Mr Lynch or Ms Guillen? 

LYNCH: No. 

GUILLEN: No, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: I'll just tidy up while you look at the-- 

LYNCH: I might just add that on that point about the ultimate breach, as your Honour will be aware, but I will point out to my client, there's no power in the Parole Authority to differentiate the sentence such as there would be on the breach of a suspended sentence. There's no power to set a non-parole so there's significant sting in the tail. 

HIS HONOUR: There's a risk that she'd serve the lot? 

LYNCH: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: I wondered that. I couldn't see anything there. 

LYNCH: I've spoken to Judge Christie and he's confirmed it. 

HIS HONOUR: Is that right? 

LYNCH: There no power to set a non-parole period. 

HIS HONOUR: All right. Now my associate's printed the order; we'll just check it. I think exhibit 1, the report must have gone to the people who assess. 

LYNCH: Does your Honour want a copy? 

HIS HONOUR: It must have gone to the Parole Authority. 

LYNCH: What was it? 

HIS HONOUR: And it'll go with her on her file. 

LYNCH: Did your Honour want a copy for the file? 

HIS HONOUR: Of exhibit 1? No, thank you. That's MFI 1 and we'll just get MFI whatever the other one was back and we'll put a yellow tag on it. And as you know, Mr Lynch, your client will need to turn up at the registry to sign up, I imagine. That's what my associate thinks and she's usually right about these things. 

LYNCH: I think so, your Honour. Yes, I'm running with that. 

HIS HONOUR: And given the time, it's now half past 1, there may not be anyone there, but--

2709557,R v Aslett [2011] NSWSC 650,"remarks on sentence
1HIS HONOUR:  The offender James Aslett was indicted for the murder of Slobodan Simic at Cabramatta West on 2 August 2009.  The Crown accepted his plea of guilty to manslaughter, entered on the first day of his trial on 2 May 2011, in complete discharge of that indictment.
The offence
2The following findings of fact are drawn from an agreed statement of facts tendered by the Crown in the sentencing proceedings.
3The offender and his cousins Douglas Aslett and WA were each charged with one count of murder in relation to the death of the deceased.  They were to be tried separately.  Douglas Aslett and WA are brothers.  At the time of the offence the brothers resided with their mother Kathy Aslett, her boyfriend and their younger sister at Cabramatta West.  The offender lived nearby in Claymore and frequently visited his cousins at their home.
4The property backed onto a vacant block of land, which was itself situated adjacent to a T-intersection in Cabramatta West.  The brothers used the vacant block as a shortcut to their home through a gap in the fence at the rear of their property.
5The deceased was in a relationship with Debra Jones.  She lived approximately 200 metres west of the brothers' house.
6On the evening of Saturday 1 August 2009, someone set fire to a car that was parked upon the vacant block of land.  WA owned that car.  The brothers spoke to each other that evening about waiting until the following day and attacking the person who set fire to the car.  The offender and Douglas Aslett went to the vacant land the next day and spoke to a neighbour about who might have set fire to the car.  During that conversation, Douglas Aslett expressed his belief that the deceased or his associate had done so.  While the offender and Douglas Aslett were still standing on the land, the deceased rode up Sulman Road towards them on his bicycle.
7The offender and Douglas Aslett yelled out threats to kill the deceased.  As he turned to run away, they threw pieces of brick or rocks at him.  These struck the deceased who started bleeding.  He returned to his house to wash the blood off his arm.  The offender and Douglas Aslett returned to Kathy Aslett's house where they armed themselves respectively with a baseball bat and a large black saw-toothed machete.  WA was there as well and he armed himself with a handgun.  The offender and Douglas Aslett then ran about 100 metres up the street towards Sulman Road.  WA followed them.
8The deceased would appear to have heard yelling and emerged from his house onto the street.  He took off his shirt and approached the offender and Douglas Aslett.  The deceased was unarmed.  He encouraged the offender and his cousins to drop their weapons and fight him with their fists.  The offender and Douglas Aslett swung their weapons at the deceased repeatedly.  The deceased was struck by the baseball bat.  At some point a friend of the deceased armed himself with a machete and came to his aid.  Neither the offender nor his cousins was injured.
9WA yelled at the offender and Douglas Aslett who began to run back towards him.  Witnesses to what was happening apparently saw the gun and yelled out a warning.  WA fired a number of shots in the direction of the deceased as he turned away.  One of the shots struck the deceased in the back.
10The offender and his cousins fled through the vacant block into Kathy Aslett's house.  They discarded the baseball bat, the machete, a shirt worn by one of them, as well as the deceased's shirt and singlet, at the rear steps to the premises.  They then left that property and sought refuge at a nearby property.  WA disposed of the firearm in the garden of a nearby house.  He fled from the area.
11Police were in attendance at the scene within minutes of the shooting.  An ambulance also attended and took the deceased to hospital where he died shortly afterwards.  The offender and Douglas Aslett were arrested a few hours later.  The offender was released shortly thereafter but was re-arrested on 12 November 2009 following identification by a witness to the incident.  The offender was interviewed by police and made certain admissions concerning his involvement in the events described above.  He was later charged with the murder of the deceased.  He has remained in custody since that time.
Basis of plea of guilty to manslaughter
12The agreed statement of facts disclosed the following matters.  The offender's plea of guilty to the manslaughter of the deceased was accepted by the Crown on the basis that the offender entered into a joint criminal enterprise with Douglas Aslett and WA to threaten or use unlawful violence against the deceased while each was armed with a weapon.  The offender contemplated the possibility that one of his cousins might do an unlawful and dangerous act toward the deceased carrying with it an appreciable risk of serious injury.  Notwithstanding his contemplation, the offender maintained his participation in the joint criminal enterprise to threaten or use unlawful violence against the deceased.  During the joint criminal enterprise WA shot and killed the deceased, constituting at least an unlawful and dangerous act.
13The offender admitted that he knew that WA had a gun.  He also admitted that he was the person who wielded the baseball bat in the events earlier described, and that he struck the deceased with it in the stomach.  
Sentencing for manslaughter
14In R v Van Xuan Nguyen [2005] NSWSC 600 at [21] - [24], Johnson J set out the relevant sentencing principles in the case of the crime of manslaughter.  In setting out the paragraphs referred to, I respectfully adopt his Honour's summary:
""[21] The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence of manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years: s.24 Crimes Act 1900. The offence of manslaughter involves the unlawful taking of a human life, and as such it has long been recognised as one of the most dreadful crimes in the criminal calendar: R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402. In R v MacDonald (Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995, BC9501664), the Court (Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Hunt CJ at CL) said at page 8: 
'Manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life. This may involve a wide variety of circumstances, calling for a wide variety of penal consequences. Even so, unlawful homicide, whatever form it takes, has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime. (See R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402.) The protection of human life and personal safety is a primary objective of the system of criminal justice. The value which the community places upon human life is reflected in its expectations of that system.'
[22] In R v Blacklidge (Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995, BC9501665), Gleeson CJ (Grove and Ireland JJ agreeing) said at page 4: 
'It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range of degrees of culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied to such cases. Of all crimes, manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability.'
[23] The importance of denunciation in sentencing for manslaughter has been stressed: R v MacDonald, above, at page 9. Little assistance is to be gained by reference to sentencing statistics which encompass all forms of manslaughter, save so far as they disclose a broad range within which sentences have been passed since their compilation began: R v Mohamad Ali [2005] NSWSC 334 at paragraph 61. 
[24] A sentence for manslaughter must reflect the seriousness of unlawfully taking the life of another human being and it is not of great moment whether the killing is characterised as coming within any particular head of manslaughter. Rather, it is a question of what sentence is required to reflect the objective facts by way of retribution and denunciation, the subjective circumstances and, if necessary, deterrence: R v Walsh (2004) 142 A Crim R 140 at 149 (paragraph 40); R v Mohamad Ali, above, at paragraph 56.""
Subjective features
15The offender was born on 11 December 1990 and so was 18 years old at the date of the offence.  Until the age of four he lived in the area around Nowra.  His father died when he was only one or two years old.  He continued to live with his mother, and after a time with her new partner.  He is one of four children born of his parents' union but he has three half siblings.  The period in Nowra was a happy time for him.  However, when he was about 13 the family moved to Sydney.  It was at this time that he started to mix with what he called ""the wrong groups"" and began to get into trouble.
16He started to take drugs and to drink alcohol.  He had not done so previously.  He left school without attaining his School Certificate.  He progressed from smoking cannabis to the use of amphetamines.  That had the result that he became involved in crime to obtain money to purchase drugs.  He said that he had no parental supervision once he moved to Sydney, meaning that he ""got a bit more freedom and [he] abused it"".  His mother and father tried to control him but he ""just went the wrong way"".  He acquired a fairly extensive criminal record at a young age.  He was placed under control orders.  He developed a problem with anger management.
17In this last respect he said that he had trouble controlling his anger when people showed him ""disrespect"".  He said that if that occurred ""I disrespect them back"".  He has undertaken anger management courses when in custody on other occasions with little apparent effect.  He accepted that his anger was a problem that needed to be addressed.  He proposed to enrol in further courses once he is sentenced.  His preference is to undertake the young offenders program rather than the violent offenders course as it is directed to people of his own age.  His hope is to be able to control his anger or even to eradicate it entirely.  
18During his time on remand he has been working fabricating metal products.  Prior to going into custody he had never had paid employment of any sort.  He now earns about $45 per week.  He said that ""it feels good"" to be working for money rather than stealing it.  He enjoys the work, which is the first opportunity he has ever had to do so.  He is also doing a metal fabrication and welding course with a view to attaining a trade certificate as a welder.  He has almost finished that course.  He hopes to make his career in that line of work upon his release from prison.  
19He proposes to live with his mother when he completes his sentence.  He gets on well with her and she visits him regularly in gaol.  His mother and sister attended the sentencing hearing.
20He was asked how he felt about the fact that he had participated in an incident that led to a man's death.  He said that he did not feel good about it.  He said, ""I feel sorry for him and just wish it never happened"".  He apologised to the deceased's family and friends.
Pre Sentence Report
21A report dated 26 May 2011 prepared by Cheryl Robinson, an officer from the Probation and Parole Service, was tendered in the proceedings on sentence.  Ms Robinson noted that even though the offender had had minimal contact with the service, he had a lengthy history with Juvenile Justice, having been sentenced to a number of control orders, bonds with Juvenile Justice supervision and fines for various offences including common assault, aggravated break and enter, larceny, destroy or damage property and drug related offences.
22Ms Robinson reported that the offender was in fact expelled from school due to aggressive behaviour towards a staff member.  He had commenced a TAFE course to complete his School Certificate but did not complete it.  He commenced a panel-beating course but also failed to complete it.
23Ms Robinson's perusal of departmental records indicated a pattern of hostile and aggressive behaviour towards staff and other inmates.  Custodial staff have noted that the offender has on a number of occasions presented as angry and hostile, particularly when he does not get his own way.  He denied making threats to other inmates and reported to Ms Robinson that he was involved with a group of inmates who may have threatened others.  It was the offender's view that because of this he had been unfairly associated with their conduct.  The offender acknowledged that he had certain negative behaviour patterns.
24The offender reported that he commenced consuming alcohol when he was 16 years of age and indicated that that would typically occur as binge drinking one day on the weekend, although not every weekend.  This pattern continued until three months prior to the offence when he stated that his alcohol consumption increased significantly after he ceased using ice.  He was then drinking daily to a level of intoxication.  He reported using cannabis from the age of 14 on a daily basis with a few friends.  That use increased and since 2006 he has been smoking as much as three grams per day.  He reported having smoked half a gram of cannabis on the morning of the offence.  He had smoked ice since the age of 16.  He had a daily habit costing $500.  This continued until three months prior to the offence.  He also used ecstasy.
25Ms Robinson confirmed that the offender appeared to have ongoing issues with controlling his anger, evident not only in the current offence but also with respect to his behaviour generally.  He acknowledged that he had an issue with authority and becomes aggressive ""when he is disrespected"".  He has participated in anger management counselling when in juvenile custody without much success.  He said he had at least learnt ""not to snap before the other person"", but felt otherwise that he was too young and not sufficiently motivated to gain much benefit.
26The report included the following summary:
""Mr Aslett is a young man who by all accounts was afforded a stable and supportive upbringing during his formative years however appears to have been easily influenced by his peer group in his early teens which saw the offender commencing abusing illicit substances and eventually coming to the attention of the law.  His problematic level of his drug and alcohol abuse, his lack of engagement in drug and alcohol interventions and his failure to acknowledge that he needs to continue to address this issue are all highlighted concerns to this Service.
The offender ceased his schooling without any formal qualifications, never having engaged in paid employment and he has typically supported himself and his illicit substance and alcohol abuse through criminal behaviours.  His blatant disregard for the law and society's values from a person of such a young age is also of concern.
Mr Aslett acknowledged his involvement in the commission of the offence however presented as having limited insight into his offending and the consequences of his actions onto others.  As previously noted, this may be due to the offender's age however this may also be due to his inability or unwillingness to explore this at this time.""
27Ms Robinson concluded that the offender was suitable for a medium to high level of intervention by the Probation and Parole Service.
Submissions
28It was contended on behalf of the offender that in assessing the objective criminality of the offence I should find that what occurred was an impulsive act that took place in the heat of the moment and without significant or relevant planning.  It was submitted that there was an incident involving damage to the car, which led to an altercation or argument including throwing of rocks and bricks.  This quickly escalated when the offender and his cousins returned to the house to arm themselves with weapons.  It was submitted that I would find that it was a very short time from start to finish of these events, and that not a great deal of thought was given to what occurred.  It was submitted that the offender acted impulsively.  The offender would appear to have been aggrieved at the burning of his cousin's car.  He did not do what he did with cold consideration or thought.  It was put on his behalf that the offender ""was caught up in his feelings of being aggrieved and he acted impulsively and probably without any thought and consideration... as to what might arise"".
29It was also submitted that the offender was someone, by reason of his age, his experience, his intelligence and level of maturity, who was possessed of limited resources upon which to call in his own life and mind in order to deal appropriately with the situation as it unfolded.  It was conceded that his past criminal behaviour and drug use made an assessment of his rehabilitative prospects somewhat guarded.  It was also conceded that the offender was a person who required a great deal of assistance to keep on the right track.  A somewhat greater emphasis on rehabilitation than usual was therefore appropriate, even though specific and general deterrence could clearly not be disregarded.
30It was submitted that a discount of 15 per cent was appropriate having regard to the timing of the plea.  Whereas it was not a plea at the earliest available opportunity, there was nevertheless said to be considerable utilitarian value in it for the reason that it was proffered on the first day of a trial that was likely to involve as much as, if not more than, three weeks of hearing, with significant prospects that differing witness accounts might potentially extend the course of jury deliberations much beyond that.
31The somewhat limited nature of the offender's expressions of remorse was said to be attributable to his lack of maturity and the inarticulate mode of his delivery, at least in the formal setting of the courtroom.  It was contended that some allowance had to be made for these things as well as his unspectacular intellectual capacity, and that his actual statement of contrition and regret should be treated as extending beyond the literal force of the words that he uttered.
32The Crown contended that the degree of planning was not consistent with a submission that the offence was impulsive.  It was submitted that there was in fact a level of premeditation to some degree.  This was said to arise from the fact that the offender and his cousins were standing around the burnt out car making somewhat desultory inquiries about who may have been responsible.  There was at least some interval between that, and the rock-throwing incident that followed closely upon it, and the subsequent confrontation with weapons, which had been retrieved only when the offender and his cousins retreated to their home to arm themselves for what then occurred.  The Crown submitted that there was in these circumstances a definite level of premeditation and planning in the subsequent criminal activity that included the offence.
33The Crown accepted that an assessment of 15 per cent as an available discount for the plea of guilty was not inappropriate.
34Aggravating factors were said to be the fact that the offender has a record of previous convictions and that the offence was committed without regard for public safety, involving an incident that escalated into an affray including members of the neighbourhood and the discharge of a firearm.  Planning has already been referred to but is specifically mentioned in the legislation as an aggravating factor.  The plea of guilty is a mitigating factor.
Findings concerning the offence
35Having regard to the evidence before me I make the following findings of fact that bear upon the objective seriousness of the offence.  
36First, there was no long-standing enmity or grievance that existed between the offender and the deceased.  Any feelings that developed in the mind of the offender toward the deceased would appear to be those that arose in the limited circumstance that the offender was told and apparently accepted that the deceased had been responsible for burning his cousin's car the previous evening.  
37Secondly, and shortly afterwards, there developed a heated exchange between the offender and his cousins and the deceased in the course of which rocks and bricks were thrown at the deceased.  
38Thirdly, the offender and his cousins retreated to their home to obtain weapons that included a machete, a baseball bat and a handgun.  
39Fourthly, the offender was the person armed with the baseball bat and he used it to strike the deceased.  
40Fifthly, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender knew that his cousin WA was armed with a handgun and that the offender contemplated at least the possibility that WA might use it in the course of doing an unlawful and dangerous act towards the deceased. However, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he knew it would be used in the course of the confrontation with the deceased.  
41Sixthly, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender and at least one of his cousins had agreed that an act, involving at least a minor assault, would be perpetrated upon the deceased in the street and that the offender participated by being present, aiding his cousins or one of them to commit the agreed act.  
42Seventhly, there was a degree of planning on the part of the offender to the extent that following the initial confrontation with the deceased, the offender retreated to his house to arm himself with a baseball bat before returning to confront the deceased again.  
43Eighthly, there was no opportunity for the offender to intervene in any way that could have prevented WA from using the handgun to shoot the deceased.  
44Finally, following the shooting the offender and his cousins fled the scene.
Conclusions concerning objective seriousness of the offence
45There is no standard non-parole period for the offence of manslaughter.  However, the objective seriousness of the offence continues to be a highly important consideration in the sentencing exercise.  A close examination and a qualitative assessment of the level of objective seriousness of the offence should be encouraged.  The objective seriousness of the offence is but one of the factors forming part of the sentencing exercise synthesis.
46Such an approach appears to me to be critical in the present case.  There was a plan to confront the deceased.  It consisted of two stages.  The first was ill-considered and ill-formed.  It was largely, if not entirely, spontaneous, impulsive and sparked by the simple and unfortunate arrival of the deceased upon his bike at a time when the offender and his cousin had formed, or were in the course of forming, a frail conclusion about the deceased's responsibility for the destruction of the car.  The second stage was less spontaneous and more considered.  It involved a temporary cessation of active hostility to acquire weapons further and better to conduct the assault.  It necessarily involved a decision to continue with an attack upon the deceased when the attack had for practical purposes and appearances come to an end.
47The offender did not shoot the deceased.  It is not suggested that any act on his part directly caused or contributed to his death.  I consider that the offence lies somewhere just below the middle range of seriousness for the offence of manslaughter.
The plea of guilty
48The offence was committed on 1 August 2009 and the offender was arrested and charged with murder on 12 November 2009.  He has been in custody since that time.  His plea was entered on the first day of the trial after the jury had been empanelled and the Crown's opening submissions had been concluded.  It followed discussions between counsel that had apparently been initiated only on the first day of the trial.  There was agreement about the likely length of the trial and a significant concession was made by the Crown during her opening address to the jury that they would ultimately be confronted with a multiplicity of witness accounts of what occurred that varied in several respects that were difficult to reconcile.  There was therefore a considerable saving to the Court and to the community in terms of resources and time.  I had had in mind a discount of the order of the figure ultimately promoted by counsel for the offender and the Crown.  I consider that a discount of 15 per cent is appropriate.
Contrition and remorse
49I have already adverted to the fact that the offender is inarticulate in a formal setting.  I accept that there must be circumstances in the normal events of life where his ability to express himself, including matters with emotional overtones, is less constrained than was evident when he gave evidence before me.  I am satisfied that in expressing his feelings for the deceased he was doing the best that he could to state honestly how he felt.  At face value his performance was not terribly convincing.  However, this is not a case of an offender saying one thing to me and doing something else to contradict himself.  The material from the Probation and Parole Service also tends to suggest that the offender may even now be having some considerable difficulty coming to terms with the seriousness of his offence and its consequences for others.  These difficulties should not be mistaken for a lack of contrition or remorse.
Special circumstances
50Counsel for the offender submitted that a finding of ""special circumstances"" for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was justified and warranted by reason of the offender's age, his lack of education, his apparent immaturity, his past drug addiction and the need for the monitoring of anger control strategies and general rehabilitation.  In my view these are all matters that warrant consideration under this head.  However, the last two are to my mind predominant.
51There is clear evidence that the offender has difficulty controlling his anger, or what was once referred to somewhat less euphemistically as an inability to control his temper.  The circumstances that give rise to these proceedings are a significant manifestation of that unfortunate propensity.  There appears to be no evidence of the aetiology of that propensity in this offender, whether in terms of his social, cultural or psychological background.  I have no medical or other specialised opinion evidence that explains this characteristic, if indeed it is explicable.  Its resistance to modification or its anticipated amenability to treatment are therefore matters of speculation.
52Doing the best that I can, I would anticipate that the offender would be likely to require assistance with impulsive aggressive behaviour for some time.  Even if treatment is available during his time in custody, the period following his release on parole is likely to be the most important in this regard if a regression to inappropriately aggressive or combative responses to what he currently perceives as offensive or disrespectful is to be avoided.
53It may be that this inability to control anger is a function of his age, his intelligence, his level of education and his immaturity.  Whatever be the precise contributors to the problem, I consider that the offender has a distinct difficulty dealing with conflict, whether real or merely perceived, that will retard his rehabilitation unless closely monitored and addressed following his release.  I find that there are special circumstances.  
Determination of sentence
54The death of the deceased was a tragic event in every respect.  He was cynically singled out for retribution by a group of self-styled vigilantes whose only motivation was an unverified suspicion that he had set fire to a car owned by one of them.  In the offender's case he gave evidence about his dealings with people who showed him ""disrespect"".  He used that term as a verb in the awkward way of popular contemporary street culture to embrace the notion that a real or perceived lack of respect somehow justified any means at hand to restore it.  It was indicative in my view of a callously judgmental attitude to other members of society, based on an inflated assessment of his own importance.  The word was used in an apparent attempt to justify or rationalise his impoverished ability to control both his emotions and his behaviour conformably with the requirements of civilised life.  Although the offender did not himself shoot the deceased, his narcissistic and self-indulgent behaviour was gratuitous and uncalled for.  I am unfortunately reminded of the words used by Truman Capote, in his famous and tragic account of true events in his book In Cold Blood, which he uses to describe one of the central characters.  Those words are as follows:
""You are strong, but there is a flaw in your strength, and unless you learn to control it the flaw will prove stronger than your strength and defeat you.  The flaw?  Explosive emotional reaction out of all proportion to the occasion.""
55There can never be a valid or acceptable reason for people to resort to violence to settle scores or to seek revenge.  The deceased died as a result of precisely such conduct.  The community will not tolerate it and the courts might be expected to take the same approach.  There emerges in a case such as the present both an opportunity and a need to reinforce the public abhorrence of senseless deaths.
56It was submitted by way of mitigation on behalf of the offender that what occurred in this case happened ""in the heat of the moment"".  I indicated during submissions, and I repeat now, that the only heat that was generated in the circumstances came from the offender and his cousins.  In other words, I am not prepared to afford the offender the benefit of any doubt that might otherwise flow from the consequences of acts performed in response to a threat or a situation beyond his control.  On the contrary, the offender and his cousins were the source of the confrontation and the force behind its continuation and escalation.  There was no moment and no heat that arose or was produced except as the result of their wholly inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour.  
57I have read a victim impact statement from the brother of the deceased.  He spoke of his own reaction to the death, as well as that of the extended family.  His mother in particular would appear to be labouring with the burden of grief in her senior years in a very disabling way.  The death of the deceased is undoubtedly a terrible and unending fact of life for her and the rest of the family.  Nothing that I have said in the course of delivering these remarks should be taken as in any way derogating from or diminishing the importance of the life of the deceased in the eyes of his family and friends who remember him.  I am however mindful of the principles referred to in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 and R v Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim R 510, and I must conform to them.
58Taking into account all of the objective facts and all of the subjective circumstances, and other factors required to be taken into account under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I consider that the appropriate sentence in this case is one of imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months.  It is accepted that the commencement date for any sentence that I impose is 12 November 2009 and I propose to order that the sentence to be imposed will operate from that date.  The sentence as proposed also has regard to my finding of special circumstances.
59James Aslett, for the manslaughter of Slobodan Simic to which you have pleaded guilty you are sentenced to imprisonment.  I set a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months, which will be taken to have commenced on 12 November 2009 and which will expire on 11 May 2014, and a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 12 May 2014 and expiring on 11 November 2016.  The first day upon which you will be eligible for release on parole is 12 May 2014.

		31 October 2012",2011-06-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709560,R (Commonwealth) v Mark William Standen [2011] NSWSC 1047,"JUDGMENT - On application by the defence for a discharge of the jury - see page 3553 of the transcript 

1HIS HONOUR: Today, on the sixty-eighth day of the trial counsel for the accused has made an application for a discharge of the jury. The application has been opposed by the Crown. 

2The application was made as a result of a note received from the jury yesterday, which became MFI 35. The note was in the following terms 

""Dear Sirs, 

We write with extreme concerns about our current situations in relation to how the length of this trial is impacting our lives. Prior to being empanelled each of us was given varying time frames of between 8 to 14 weeks. To date we're sitting in the 15th week and have received no communications from the court regarding this time line. As we go through evidence of telecommunication intercepts, some in greater detail than when initially presented over 8 weeks we can only assume at least another 7 weeks will be spent on these documents. 

This trial is having a serious effects on our lives emotionally, physically and financially, and additional stress is being placed in the current knowledge of being here for an infinite period of time. 

We have outlined some of the issues we're facing below: 

Many of us are forced to work nights and weekends to maintain roles that could not be replaced with one day's notice. We understand our rights when it comes to employment however we're sure you can appreciate the reality is another matter. Pressure from employers when we have no end in sight is increasing. 

Many of us have been denied bonuses, and promotions by not physically being there many of us have been denied bonuses and promotions by not physically being there. 

One juror is unable to maintain the rent on her apartment on the salary paid by the court and is being forced to move. As with two other jurors, she was made redundant prior to this trial and for 4 months each of them have been denied the opportunity to seek/accept employment, are not applicable for unemployment benefits and are only applicable to the lowest rate paid by the court. 

Two of the above were unable to accept job offers when empanelled and one was denied the opportunity to attend a second interview, it was not considered a valid excuse at the selection time. 

One self-employed juror has had to turn down 4 months of work and is now having to cancel work rescheduled for the supposed end of this trial. He is severely financially affected as a result, and is having to support 3 children on the court salary. 

One juror is having to pay for before and after school care that was not previously required or planned for financially. 

One juror suffers chronic back injuries that have been inflamed and requires physiotherapy 1 to 2 times weekly. 

One juror has been denied a vacation booked in 2010 and presented to the court at the time of being summoned but was rejected as an excuse. The commitments involving other family members have meant that the holiday will continue in her absence and faces additional pressure managing her daughter with one less adult. 

Morale is low among all jurors and concerns are held for holidays booked in August with more information to come. 

The above concerns have been difficult to maintain for 15 weeks but we have done so without complaint and offered above and beyond support to see this trial conclude as quickly as possible including longer sitting hours and sitting through illness. These issues cannot be sustained for an indefinite period. 

We do not deny the accused has a right to a fair trial but ask that our rights to earn a living, seek employment, look after our families, go on vacation and plan our lives are taken into equal consideration. 

This trial should never have been speculated as being completed in 14 weeks and our lives cannot continue to be put on hold. Had we been prepared for a longer period from the beginning we wouldn't feel this way. Our lives would have been adjusted to accommodate. 

Sincerely 

The jury"" 

3In the first paragraph of their note the jurors speak of their ""extreme concerns"" about how the length of the trial is affecting their lives. They say that individual jurors, before the jury was empanelled, were given varying estimate of the length of the trial, of between 8 and 14 weeks. The trial is now in its fifteenth week so that the maximum estimate of the length of the trial given to any juror has now been exceeded. 

4In their note the jury say that they have not received any information from the court about how much longer the trial will last. They say that they assume that the further taking of evidence from the accused concerning the telecommunications intercepts will last at least another 7 weeks. The jury have some basis for making an assessment, because they are aware of the extent of the telecommunications intercepts and can see how much of that material has so far been dealt with and how much remains to be dealt with by the accused in his evidence in chief. 

5In the second paragraph of their note the jurors say that serving on the jury at this trial is having a serious effect on their lives, emotionally, physically and financially, and ""additional stress is being placed in the current knowledge of being here for an infinite period of time"". 

6In succeeding paragraphs of the note the jury outline the hardship, and often severe hardship, that individual members of the jury are experiencing from being members of the jury in this trial. 

7The note states that morale is low among all jurors. In the note the jurors indicate that they have ""maintained"" the matters causing them concern without complaint for 15 weeks but ""these issues cannot be sustained for an indefinite period."" 

8In the note the jury acknowledge that the accused is entitled to a fair trial but ask that their own rights to earn a living, seek employment, look after their families, go on holidays and plan their lives be given consideration. 

9The jury conclude by saying that, if they had been told from the beginning that the trial would last longer than 14 weeks, they would have adjusted their lives to accommodate such a longer period, and ""we wouldn't feel this way"". 

10I accept without reservation the truth of the assertions made by the jury in their note. 

11In his submissions in support of the application for a discharge of the jury counsel for the accused referred to the length of the Crown case, which lasted 58 days (ending in the thirteenth week of the trial) and pointed out that only a relatively small amount of that time had been occupied by the cross-examination of Crown witnesses. Counsel for the accused also pointed out that the defence case is now only in its eighth day. 

12In his submissions in support of the application counsel for the accused said that his concern arising from the jurors' note was two-fold and he made two principal submissions. These submissions can be summarised as follows. 

1. As the trial has reached the stage of the defence case, then, if the trial were to continue, the low morale and hardships being experienced by the jurors would ""impact on the intake of evidence in the defence case"", that is would adversely affect the reception and consideration by the jury of the evidence in the defence case. This effect would be aggravated because the accused in much of his evidence would be giving evidence about conversations and communications which had already occupied many hours in the Crown case. 

2. If the trial were to continue, then when the jury are deliberating, there will be a strong temptation for the jury, consciously or unconsciously, to hasten their deliberations so as to put an end to their hardships. The present trial is a complex one with a large amount of evidence and a proper consideration of the evidence and the submissions of counsel might require a lengthy period of deliberation by the jury. 

13It was submitted by counsel for the accused that there were no directions I could give which would adequately address either of counsel's concerns. 

14It was submitted by counsel for the accused that, even if the additional stress arising from the jury's apprehension that the trial might continue indefinitely, was put to one side, the matters in the rest of the jury's note would require a discharge of the jury. 

15As I have already noted, the application was opposed by the Crown. Among the submissions made by the Crown was a submission that the evidence in chief of the accused was being prolonged by the accused's manner of responding to questions asked by his counsel. 

16The note from the jury is a cause of concern. There can be no criticism of the jury. Individual jurors were given estimates of the length of the trial, which have turned out to be under-estimates and are likely to be substantial under-estimates. The matters which the jury say are causing them concern are legitimate matters for concern. 

17After taking into account the submissions made by both counsel, I have decided to refuse the application. 

18It would, of course, be a serious step to abort a trial which has now been conducted for 68 days. I should, nevertheless, be prepared to take that step, if I considered that, were the trial to continue, the trial would not be a fair trial of the accused. 

19I appreciate that in the jury's note the jury's lack of information about how much longer the trial is likely to last and their fear that the trial may continue indefinitely are referred to as sources of ""additional"" stress and that removing or alleviating this additional stress will not remedy the matters the jury first mention as causing the jury concern. I, nevertheless, consider that, if the jury can be given an estimate, which is a realistic estimate, of how much longer the trial will last and, according to this estimate, the trial is likely to finish much sooner than the jury presently apprehend, this will provide some reassurance for the jury and improve the jury's morale. The jury do not say in their note that because of the ""concerns"" or ""issues"" they are no longer able or willing to continue serving as jurors. What they say is that they cannot sustain those issues ""for an indefinite period"". 

20I have not so far provided the jury with an estimate of the likely length of the trial, because it seemed to me to be very difficult to make any such estimate. After receiving the jury's note I had discussions with counsel about the likely further length of the trial. It was suggested by counsel for the Crown, without demur by counsel for the accused, that the further examination-in-chief of the accused could be concluded in a matter of days, rather than taking, as contemplated by the jury, at least another seven weeks, while still permitting the accused to fully make his defence. It was further suggested by the Crown that the Crown's cross-examination of the accused could be conducted in five to seven days and that the addresses of both parties could be concluded by the end of July. 

21On the basis of what was said by counsel and notwithstanding the difficulty in making predictions about how much longer a trial is likely to last, I consider that it can reasonably be estimated that, although the trial is likely to continue into the beginning of August, not taking into account any time for deliberation by the jury, the trial generally is likely to conclude by about mid August. 

22I can inform the jury of this estimate and I consider that the giving of this estimate will be a substantial relief for the jury. 

23In their note the jury recognise the right of the accused to a fair trial. The conduct of the jury so far has been exemplary. Not a single day has been lost through illness of a juror. I have been impressed, from observing the jury in the jury box, by the close attention that jurors have been paying to the proceedings in the courtroom and I consider that it is likely that, if the trial continues, jurors will, notwithstanding any hardship they are experiencing from being on the jury, continue to pay close attention to the proceedings in this courtroom, including the giving of evidence. I consider that, if the trial continues, members of this jury will remain true to their oaths and will deliberate for as long as is required to render true verdicts according to the evidence. 

24I consider that I should refuse the application for a discharge of the jury.

		08 September 2011",2011-06-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709563,McMAHON v R [2011] NSWCCA 147,"Judgment  1HODGSON JA: I agree with Hoeben J.  2I note that the Court received submissions on the question whether ""some other sentence"" in s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is a reference to each individual sentence under appeal or to the overall effective sentence, noting the different views expressed in Arnaout v R [2008] NSWCCA 278; (2008) 191 A Crim R 149 by Basten JA (favouring the former view) and Price J (favouring the latter).  3It is not necessary to resolve this difference in this case; but I would note that, even if the phrase were to be taken as referring to each individual sentence, it is not correct to say that the Court cannot, in considering whether some other sentence is warranted, take into account other sentences imposed on the appellant.  For example:  (1) The other sentences may be directly relevant to the criminality involved in the particular offence (for example, showing it to be part of planned ongoing criminal activity).  (2) If a ground of appeal raises questions of concurrency or accumulation, other sentences must necessarily be considered.  (3) Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 78 ALJR 616 shows that there is not an absolute prohibition on adjusting an individual sentence by reason of considerations of totality.  (4) Where, as in this case, a single non-parole period has been fixed in respect of a number of federal offences, as required by s 19AB of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), consideration of the adequacy of any individual sentence, which would ordinarily take into account the extent of full-time custody involved, must necessarily have regard to the totality.  4Further, if an application for leave to appeal is made, and error in one sentence is shown but no practical result would be achieved because no lesser total sentence would be imposed as a result of a successful appeal, it would be open to the court to refuse leave to appeal on that ground.  5HOEBEN J:  Offences and sentence  On 29 October 2008 the appellant pleaded guilty in the District Court to the following offences:  (a) Five counts of making a false statement in an application for an Australian passport contrary to s10(1)(a) of the Passport Act 1938 (Cth).  (b) Seven counts of departing Australia whilst an undischarged bankrupt without the consent of his trustee contrary to s272(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth).  (c) Two counts of making a statement capable of misleading an identifying cash dealer contrary to s 94(4)(aa) of the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988 (Cth) (the FTRA).  (d) Twenty seven counts of operating an account with a cash dealer in false names, contrary to s24(1) of the FTRA.  (e) One count of attempting to open an account with a cash dealer in a false name contrary to s24(1) of the FTRA and s11.1 Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).  These are collectively referred to as the ""identity fraud offences"".  6On 12 November 2008 the appellant pleaded guilty in the District Court to the following offences:  (a) Fifteen counts of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage from a Commonwealth entity by deception, contrary to s134.2 of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).  (b) Twenty four counts of attempting to dishonestly obtain a financial advantage from a Commonwealth entity by deception, contrary to s11.1 and 134.2 of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).  These are collectively referred to as the ""tax fraud offences"".  7In addition, thirty five summary offences relating to the making of false statements to the Australian Electoral Commission in applications for registration on the Electoral Roll were referred to the sentencing court pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (Cth) to be dealt with as charges related to the identity fraud offences.  8The following maximum penalties apply to the offences:  (a) 2 years imprisonment or a $5000 fine for each of the Passport Act offences.  (b) 3 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $19,800 for each of the Bankruptcy Act offences.  (c) 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $33,000 for each of the s29(4)(aa) FTRA offences.  (d) 2 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $13,200 for each of the s24 FTRA offences.  (e) 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $66,000 for each of the Criminal Code offences.  9On 24 July 2007 the appellant was committed to stand trial on the identity fraud offences following a paper committal.  The appellant on 29 April 2008 waived the requirement for a committal on the tax fraud offences and was committed for trial in the District Court.  On 4 July 2008 the trial was set down to commence on 17 November 2008 with an estimate of 5-6 weeks.  He pleaded guilty to the identity fraud offences on 29 October 2008 and he pleaded guilty to the fax fraud offences on 12 November 2008.  The trial did not commence.  10The appellant was sentenced by Tupman DCJ following a sentence hearing which took place over four days on 6, 7, April, 29 May and 4 September 2009.  During the sentence hearing, the Crown tendered a number of exhibits.  The appellant gave evidence during the sentence hearing and was cross-examined.  11On 25 September 2009 Tupman DCJ passed the following sentences.  The identity fraud offences  (a) 12 months imprisonment in respect of each of counts 1 - 5 inclusive (making a false statement in the course of obtaining an Australian passport), commencing 25 September 2009 and expiring 24 September 2010.  (b) 18 months imprisonment in respect of each of counts 6 - 12 inclusive (leaving Australia whilst bankrupt without consent of trustee), commencing 25 March 2010 and expiring 24 September 2011.  (c) 12 months imprisonment in respect of each of counts 13 - 14 inclusive (making a false statement to a cash dealer when identifying signatory) commencing 25 March 2011 and expiring 24 March 2012.  (d) 12 months imprisonment in respect of each of counts 15 - 35 and 37 - 42 inclusive (opening an account with cash dealer in a false name), commencing 25 March 2011 and expiring 24 March 2012.  (e) 12 months imprisonment in respect of count 36 (attempting to open an account with a cash dealer in a false name) commencing 25 March 2011 and expiring 24 March 2012.  (f) 6 months imprisonment in respect of each of the 35 related summary offences pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (making of false statements to the Australian Electoral Commission in application for registration on the Electoral Roll), commencing 25 September 2009 and expiring 24 March 2010.  The tax fraud offences  (g) 5 years imprisonment in respect of each of counts 1 - 15 inclusive (obtaining a financial advantage by deception) commencing 25 September 2009 and expiring 24 September 2014.  (h) 4 years imprisonment in respect of each of counts 16 - 39 inclusive (attempting to obtain a financial advantage by deception), commencing on 25 September 2011 and expiring 24 September 2015.  12The effective aggregate head sentence was 6 years commencing 25 September 2009 and expiring 24 September 2015.  Her Honour then fixed a single non-parole period of 4 years commencing 25 September 2009 and expiring 24 September 2013.  13The appellant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of those sentences seeking that this Court either re-sentence him in respect of them or that it remit the matter to the District Court so that the appellant can be sentenced according to law.  14At the hearing of the appeal, a number of the grounds of appeal were abandoned.  Those which were pressed were as follows:  Ground 3 - The learned sentencing judge erred:  (i) In failing to set appropriate sentences in relation to the individual counts.  (ii) In failing to properly apply the principle of totality.  (iii) In her approach to accumulation and concurrence.  Ground 4 - Her Honour gave insufficient weight to the full repayment of tax, the subject of the charges.  Ground 6 - In respect to character, her Honour having found that the appellant had an insignificant criminal record, her Honour erred in:  (i) Having regard to findings of an ICAC Commissioner, (being a finding not established to any criminal (or civil) standard by a court of law; and  (ii) Fusing prior relevant good character with her Honour's rejection of the appellant's evidence.  Ground 8 - Her Honour erred in setting the non-parole period by reference to the percentage proportion of 60 - 66 percent.  Factual background  15The appellant came before her Honour to be sentenced in respect of 81 separate charges with an additional 35 summary matters to be dealt with as related offences, i.e. a total of 117 offences.  Like the sentencing judge, I do not propose to go into the facts behind each individual offence but to summarise the facts behind each group of offences as were agreed before her Honour.  16The appellant was an undischarged bankrupt from 23 June 1999 until 6 December 2005.  Between October 1995 and 6 December 2005 he embarked on a course of accumulating false identity documents, some of which were in the names of people who existed but were at the time deceased and some of which were in the names of deceased's children.  This was done to avoid the likelihood of conflicting identity documents.  The first of such documents came into existence in October 1999 with the issue of a ""camouflage passport"" in the name of ""Ian John Lord"" bearing a photograph of the appellant and purporting to have issued from a non-existent country ""British West Indies"".  17By June 2004 the appellant had obtained four false named passports, opened 29 false named bank accounts and registered false names with the Australian Electoral Commission on 35 occasions.  18Twenty nine of the names he assumed were the names of, or derivatives of the names of deceased persons, including names he had obtained from obituary pages and from tombstones.  The appellant then applied to obtain birth certificates in the names of the deceased.  Two of the names he assumed were the names of former associates.  19In addition, he rented premises in false names, leased post office boxes in false names, travelled overseas using false names and opened bank accounts using false names.  20By October 2001 the appellant had commenced using the false names and/or the names of unsuspecting associates to gain control of companies, registered those companies for GST purposes and lodged false BAS forms on behalf of those companies.  In all, a total of 30 companies (the subject of the tax fraud offence indictment), lodged a total of 105 BAS forms falsely claiming GST refunds totalling $676,620 to which neither the appellant nor the companies nor anyone else were entitled.  21In order to carry out the tax fraud offences the appellant obtained control of 32 companies by registering with ASIC the appointment of directors or secretaries, using assumed names, including the names of deceased children and the names of associates and in many cases providing false or non-existent addresses.  22Lodgment of the fraudulent BAS commenced on about 4 October 2001 and ceased on about 26 July 2002, a period of approximately 10 months.  It was necessary for the appellant to maintain extensive records in order to keep track of companies he controlled, the BAS forms he had lodged and the names, addresses and telephone numbers he had assumed.  23It was the Crown's submission that the conduct in which the appellant engaged was systematic, frequent and required a significant degree of planning and sophistication.  The frequency of lodgement of the fraudulent BAS forms can be seen from the following summary:  16 BAS forms were lodged in October 2001;  9 BAS forms were lodged in November 2001;  33 BAS forms were lodged in January 2002;  22 BAS forms were lodged in February 2002;  1 BAS form was lodged in March 2002;  1 BAS form was lodged in May 2002;  3 BAS forms were lodged in June 2002;  5 BAS forms were lodged in July 2002;  17 BAS forms were lodged by telephone on dates which could not be determined.  24The tax fraud offences came to the attention of the Australian Taxation Office in about December 2001 when the content of certain of the submitted BAS forms caused internal ""verification checks"" to trigger.  ATO inquiries in March 2002 led to an associate of the appellant and the associate's accountant.  The offending conduct ceased only when the appellant became aware of the investigation.  Remarks on sentence  25Her Honour reviewed in a general way the factual background to the offences.  She concluded that all of the false identities, false bank accounts and false addresses were obtained by the appellant for fraudulent purposes including to enable him to obtain passports, to travel overseas in contravention of his bankruptcy conditions and to enable him to acquire and gain control of companies which he then registered for GST purposes and in respect of which he lodged the fraudulent GST claims.  26In respect of the appellant's evidence her Honour said:  ""I did not find his evidence compelling and in many respects I found it to have been misleading and intentionally so.  I reject the evidence that he gave that some domestic or urgent need to travel overseas on any of these occasions was the reason for him doing so.  He gave evidence that this was connected either with the implementation of family law orders or something to do with the wellbeing of his children.  The facts surrounding his actual travel during these periods and the application of logic do not support these assertions.  He travelled overseas under these false passports to pursue business interests knowing that this was in contravention of his bankruptcy conditions and that he was doing so using falsely acquired passports.""  (ROS 9.8-10.1)  27Later in her remarks, her Honour said:  ""In his evidence the offender attempted to minimise his role in these offences to an extent, by placing blame on others.  I do not accept his evidence in that regard.  I did not find him to be a reliable witness.  He gave what I find to have been a false or deliberately misleading piece of evidence on at least one occasion when referring to the loss of his passport while overseas and I also found his evidence to be at best unimpressive and more probably than not generally deliberately misleading.  That does not aggravate the seriousness of his offences but to the extent that his evidence was an attempt to mitigate his own involvement and thus the objective seriousness of his fraudulent behaviour I do not accept it.  I accept that he was a principal if not the principal in relation to this overall fraudulent behaviour.""  (ROS 13.8 - 14.1)  28In relation to the identity fraud offences, her Honour summarised her conclusions as follows:  ""They are the very basic facts surrounding each of the false identity charges which are the 42 charges contained in the indictment dated 28 October 2008.  Not one of these individual charges is for a particularly serious offence in relative terms apart from counts 13 and 14.  The maximum penalties are either 2 or 3 years and for counts 13 and 14 the maximum penalty is 5 years.  It appears most often by looking at what statistics there are published by the Judicial Commission for these sorts of similar offences, they are generally dealt with in the Local Court by way of a fine or something other than fulltime imprisonment.  Each of these offences, however, is a relatively serious example of offences which are capable of being committed under the particular section.  They represent an ongoing course of conduct and there is significant planning and organisation, in particular the organisation and planning required to obtain the source documents which enabled the passports to be issued, thus enabling the false bank accounts to be issued or vice versa.  In the case of each of them, they had as their purpose a deliberate fraudulent intent.  The gravamen of these offences is represented not by the individual facts of any one of them but by the course of fraudulent conduct represented by them over a relatively lengthy period of time from 1999 to 2004.""  (ROS 10.3 - 10.8)  29In relation to the 39 charges which formed the tax fraud offences, her Honour said:  ""By way of summary, however, I accept that these 39 counts represent occasions month by month from October 2001 to July 2002 when the offender either did or attempted to defraud the Commonwealth of GST revenue by lodging what were in fact false Business Activity Statements saving GST refunds.  He did this using a total of 30 different companies, lodging 105 different Business Activity Statements all of which are particularised in the individual counts.""  (ROS. 11.6)  30In respect of the tax fraud offences, her Honour noted that fraudulent refunds amounting to $293,772.38 were obtained by the appellant's companies and that those monies ""in one way or the other flowed to the offender"".  In relation to the attempt charges, her Honour noted that the refunds claimed totalled $378,719 which would have been paid to the appellant's companies except that they were stopped by the ATO after investigations had been commenced.  31In relation to the tax fraud offences generally, her Honour said:  ""They were sophisticated and well planned frauds using numerous false identities, but those of people who had once actually existed. The frauds required significant planning on the part of the offender who also used the names and identities of unsuspecting colleagues and acquaintances to further lend credence to some of these claims.  Each charge is a separate offence but they have been grouped in the indictment by company so that in relation to each company either a completed offence or an attempted offence there is only one charge which itself in most cases is in the nature of what has been called a rolled up charge because it covers more than one fraudulent Business Activity Statement in each count.  For example, in count 1, relating to the company Auctionet, the amount of GST fraudulently obtained totalled $10,912 but comprised four individual business activity forms lodged for the period from July 2000 to December 2001.""  (ROS 13.2 - 13.6)  32Her Honour characterised the cash fraud offences as serious offences.  She said:  ""I accept too from the authorities that amongst the reasons why they ought to be treated as very serious offences and why there should be an element of general deterrence involved in the sentence, is that tax collection is essentially based on trust and depends on the honesty of tax payers.  The community as a whole benefits from the collection of tax.  If it were not for tax collection including GST there could be no hospitals, schools, roads and the like. With respect I adopt the reasoning of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Stitt (1998) 102 A Crim R 428) that offences such as those before, committed by this offender, are even more serious than those tax frauds which involve false claims being made to achieve a refund of PAYE tax, that is tax already paid by a tax payer.  In this case the GST, I accept, had never been paid, the companies had never in any real sense traded and were never in a position to charge the GST, let alone had it ever been collected.  The expenses claimed had never been incurred and the offender was paid funds to which he had never been entitled at all.  The honest tax payers of Australia in effect funded his greed and did so at the expense of those things which they expect that their taxes will fund, those things which maintain the common good for the community.  In addition, I accept that the uncovering of these offences, given the complexity of the matters and the sophistication of the fraud must have been at considerable cost to the Commonwealth and thus to the taxpayer.  It is for this reason that taxation fraud is to be treated as a very serious offence, particularly so when it is well planned and sophisticated as it is here.  I do not accept the submission made on behalf of the offender that these GST frauds can be regarded as somewhat less serious because they are limited in time to a period of only 10 months.  Whilst the actual charges cover only a ten month period, in fact I accept the planning for them went back further including the acquisition of those false identities which are the subject of the other charges.""  (ROS 15.3 - 16.2)  33While still on the subject of the seriousness of the offences and general deterrence, her Honour said:  ""So far as these funds actually received by the offender are concerned, I accept that there have been orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Act by consent, for payment by the offender of just in excess of $355,000 by way of pecuniary penalty order.  He has, as I understand the evidence, paid some of that order and it is anticipated that he will pay it all in due course, as I understand the evidence, as a result of the sale of some property in Northern New South Wales.  Whilst this order, if it is paid, has the effect of enabling the Commonwealth to recoup the lost funds, I accept that pursuant to s 320(d) of the Proceeds of Crime Act , I am not entitled to take that fact of itself into account in assessing the appropriate penalty.  I do and am entitled to take into account the fact that the offender consented to these orders when assessing his cooperation and also in relation to issues of contrition and remorse.  Even if it be the case that in due course these funds are paid to the Commonwealth by the offender and he has lost these funds, nonetheless he made personal gain out of these offences and did so over a significant period of time.  He had the funds and he used them for his own purposes.  There has also been further loss to the Commonwealth in the expense it has taken to investigate and prosecute these offences.  For all of these reasons, I accept that these GST fraud offences in particular are serious and there must also be a real element of general deterrence contained in the sentence.  That is because, as I have said, they are easy to commit and hard to detect and the community as a whole should know that tax fraud is not just part of some great Australian game but rather a very serious offence which will give rise to a gaol term for those who commit it.""  (ROS 176.8 - 17.6)  34Her Honour made specific reference to s16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) in relation to the assessment of the seriousness of the offences and general deterrence.  In accordance with s16A, she also had regard to the appellant's subjective case.  Her Honour noted that at the time of sentence, the appellant was aged 49 and had been born one of 5 siblings in Northern New South Wales.  He was qualified as a lawyer but had not practised since 1985.  He had 5 children from h is first wife, who now lives in Sweden.  Those children are aged between 16 and 21.  From about 1985 the appellant had worked in the finance industry in Europe until his return to Australia in about 1996.  35The appellant's first marriage broke up in 1999 and he remarried in 2005.  They live in Northern New South Wales and have a son aged 18 months.  36Her Honour accepted that as a result of a disagreement with a former partner the appellant was severely assaulted in December 2006.  While the appellant recovered from the physical effects of the attack, there was evidence before her that he suffered from post traumatic stress disorder as a result of it.  37In relation to the appellant's character, her Honour said:  ""The offender does have prior criminal convictions so he cannot claim to be a person of prior good character.  They include a conviction in January 2000 and maliciously destroying or damaging property which were dealt with by way of deferred sentence bonds under s558 of the Crimes Act .  These convictions were confirmed on appeal to this court.  There are also two motor vehicle offences, a mid range PCA and a drive whilst cancelled, occurring in December 1998.  They do not aggravate his commission of these offences and in a large part are irrelevant to the appropriate sentence for these offences but they do disentitle him to be treated as a person of prior good character.  In any event there are serious limitations to the extent to which, if at all, any prior relevant good character would have operated as a matter of mitigation in relation to these offences of fraud.  What's more, as I have said, I have found him to be a misleading witness who in fact was prepared to give false evidence in relation at least to his so called lost passport.  I also in this regard take into account the findings made by the ICAC Commissioner in April 1997 as set out by the Crown in their written submissions, which in general terms reflect my own assessment of this offender as a witness.  He thus does not come to court as a person of prior good character and I do not find him to be such.  In fact to the extent that I was able to assess his character at all, either from the material tendered or by my own assessment of his evidence in the witness box, I found him to be a person who can be best described by the Australian idiom as ""conman"" or confidence trickster.  Of course his crimes go beyond mere tricks and amount to serious crimes, but his conduct over a number of years and his evidence in the witness box and conduct generally it seems to me reflect a degree of manipulation commonly seen in the well entrenched confidence trickster.'  (ROS 20.3 - 21.2)  38Her Honour took into account the effect of the appellant's imprisonment on his family but did not regard that as exceptional.  She took into account that the appellant had pleaded guilty to these offences and gave that appropriate weight ( Carter v The Queen (2007) 173 A Crim R 458 at 476).  39Although her Honour gave weight to his remorse and contrition, taking into account the plea of guilty and his consent to the proceeds of crime orders, she noted that she could not give significant weight to those matters.  This was because the appellant continued to give false evidence in his own sentence proceedings and attempted to minimise his role and involvement in the offences.  40Her Honour also had regard to specific deterrence.  She had regard to the appellant's intelligence but noted that this was part of the reason why he was able to commit the offences in such a systematic and calculated way.  Her Honour was of the opinion that his situation upon his release would be somewhat different to when he returned to Australia in 1996.  He would not be under the same financial pressures as he was then.  Her Honour was of the opinion that his fraudulent behaviour and offending would be well known to the community generally and particularly in northern New South Wales.  She thought that the appellant's opportunities to engage in criminal behaviour involving companies and financial transactions would thus be limited upon his release and accordingly that his prospects of rehabilitation were somewhat improved.  She thought that he would benefit from a period of supervision in the community upon his release to improve those prospects of rehabilitation.  41In relation to the difficulties in sentencing for so many offences, her Honour said:  ""It is a very difficult exercise attempting to set appropriate sentences for these offences taking into account the overall criminality represented by them all and also attempting to comply with the dicta of the High Court in R v Pearce .  That and cases following it are authority for the proposition that every sentence imposed by a court should of itself be the appropriate sentence for the particular offence and there should then be consideration of accumulation and concurrency for both traditional reasons and also to give rise ultimately to the principles of totality.  It seems to me that this is not only a virtually impossible task in this case with 81 separate offences and 35 summary offences, but also unnecessary.  There is no benefit either to the individual or to the system in this case in attempting to analyse each of the individual GST fraud cases and then affix an appropriate sentence to each of them.  It would be quite an artificial exercise.  Each of the completed offences counts 1 to 15 was in fact itself a rolled up offence, each for a different amount, some lesser than the others, ranging from $5,528 for count 3 to $42,740 for count 4 and a range in between for each of those 15 offences.  Each, as I have said, involved a different company.  Some were for only one Business Activity Statement claim, others for up to 5.  The same applies to the other counts 16 to 39 for all the attempt charges.  The gravamen of these GST offences is the overall fraudulent conduct.  It seems to me appropriate, therefore, to treat counts 1 to 15 as one group, namely the completed GST frauds and affix the same sentence to each of them, but order that they be served concurrently.  Similarly, to treat each of the attempt offences as one group, affixing a slightly lower penalty because they did not actually lead to any loss to the Commonwealth but ordering that they too be served concurrently with each other."" (ROS 23.4 - 24.3)  42In line with that approach, rather than look at the individual offences, her Honour divided the offences into categories, in relation to which she made an assessment of their relative seriousness.  At the top in level of seriousness were the 15 counts of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage from the Commonwealth.  Next were the 24 counts of attempting to dishonestly obtain such a financial advantage.  The remaining groupings were the Passport Act offences, the Bankruptcy Act offences and lastly, 30 offences contrary to the FTRA.  43Having passed sentences in relation to each group of offences, her Honour applied the principle of totality as follows:  ""That would give rise to an overall total of 12  years imprisonment.  That seems to me excessive both to reflect total criminality and also excessive when compared with the sentences imposes for these sorts of offences in other cases.  I then looked to what the overall sentence should be to reflect the total criminality and I will then effect a degree of partial accumulation to give rise to those findings.  Overall I have concluded that it should be a head sentence of 6 years.  There should be for Commonwealth offences a non-parole period of between 60 and 66 percent.  It seems to me in the circumstances there is nothing in reality to reduce this non-parole period between 66 percent and I am proposing to set a non-parole period overall of 4 years.  In particular I am not convinced by the argument put on behalf of the offender that the fact he gave evidence in the assault trial as the victim of it will lead to his suffering any harsher treatment or conditions in custody than might otherwise be the case.  I propose to give effect to what I then see to be the appropriate overall penalties by way of a partial accumulation of the two major sentences, that is, the 5 year sentences and the 4 year sentences and then setting some partial accumulation of the smaller sentences, but ordering that they be served within the overall non-parole period.""  (ROS 28.2 - 28.8)  Appeal  Ground of Appeal 3 - The learned sentencing judge erred:  (i) In failing to set appropriate sentences in relation to the individual counts.  (ii) In failing to properly apply the principle of totality.  (iii) In her approach to accumulation and concurrence.   44The appellant submitted that in grouping the offences as she did, her Honour had failed to follow the direction of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57, (1998) 194 CLR 610.  The appellant relied specifically on the following passage of the plurality:  ""45 To an offender, the only relevant question may be ""how long"", and that may suggest that a sentencing judge or appellate court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender.  Such an approach is likely to mask error.  A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality.""  45By way of illustration, the Court's attention was drawn to the amounts of money involved in some of the tax fraud offences which because of her Honour's approach, received the same sentence.  In following that approach, the appellant relied upon R v Alimic [2006] VSCA 273 where the Court said:  ""10 ... Ordinarily in a case of this kind the relative gravity of offences of the sort in issue is to be assessed by reference to the amount of money involved in each offence"".  46The specific illustrations to which the Court was taken were:  Count 15 where there was a single act of lodging a false BAS statement for the sum of $488 and in respect of which the appellant received 5 years imprisonment.  Count 11 which involved the submission of two false BAS statements in the sum of $4,733 for which the appellant also received a sentence of 5 years imprisonment.  Count 4 which involved the submission of five false BAS statements totalling $42,740 for which the appellant also received 5 years imprisonment.  Count 16 which was an attempt to defraud for the sum of $5,012 where a single fraudulent BAS statement had been submitted and for which the appellant received a term of imprisonment of 4 years.  Count 32 which was an attempt to defraud the Commonwealth for the sum of $57,060 which involved the submission of six false BAS statements for which the appellant received a sentence of 4 years imprisonment.  47The appellant submitted that because of her Honour's failure to pass sentences for each specific offence, having regard to the relative criminality of each specific offence, it was not possible for her Honour to appropriately determine to what extent the sentences should be made concurrent and should be accumulated so as to achieve a proper result by reference to the principle of totality.  The appellant submitted this was the very kind of error which Pearce pointed out could be ""masked"" by such an approach.  48The appellant's submission misunderstands what was said in Pearce. An application of the principle as submitted by the appellant, would not only produce a result which her Honour correctly characterised as ""artificial"" but could well produce a result significantly more adverse to the appellant.  Given the level of criminality involved in these offences, particularly the tax fraud offences but not excluding the detailed planning over a long period of time involved in the identity fraud offences, passing 81 separate sentences which had regard to those matters could well result in total sentences significantly in excess of the 12  years initially determined by her Honour.  49The proper approach in Pearce was considered by the High Court in Johnson v The Queen [2204] HCA 15, (2004) 78 ALJR 616 where the plurality said:  ""26 The first matter to be noticed in this regard is that the joint judgment in Pearce recognises the currency of Mill by referring to the principle of totality which it reiterates.  The joint judgment in Mill expresses a preference for what should be regarded as the orthodox, but not necessarily immutable, practice of fixing a sentence for each offence and aggregating them before taking the next step of determining concurrency. Pearce does not decree that a sentencing judge may never lower each sentence and then aggregate them for determining the time to be served.  To do that, is not to do what the joint judgment in Pearce holds to be undesirable, that is, to have regard only to the total effective sentence to be imposed on an offender.  The preferable course will usually be the one which both cases commend but neither absolutely commands.  Judges of first instance should be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime unto which the sentencing is effected. ...""  50In a case similar to this, although the facts were not as complex and the planning not as substantial, this Court provided further guidance as to how the principle in Pearce should be applied. R v Knight [2004] NSWCCA 145 involved an appeal from sentences passed in respect of 32 offences, contrary to the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and the Criminal Code (Cth).  For convenience in that case, those offences had been grouped together for the purpose of allowing appropriate sentences to be passed.  51In respect of that process, Howie J (with whom Grove J and Simpson J agreed) said:  "" 31 The contention that in some way the applicant was disadvantaged because of the application of Pearce is in my opinion completely misconceived. The fundamental principle in sentencing for multiple offences is that the overall sentence imposed must reflect the totality of the criminality evidenced by those offences: the totality principle. Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15 makes it clear that this principle was neither established nor affected by the decision in Pearce . The significance of Pearce , in this regard, was to indicate the preferred manner in which sentences are to be structured in order to achieve compliance with the totality principle. In particular this Court has interpreted Pearce as prohibiting the practice of increasing a sentence for one offence merely to reflect the totality of the criminality disclosed by all of the offences for which sentence is being passed. Johnson merely confirms that compliance with the totality principle can also be achieved by decreasing a sentence that is to be made wholly cumulative with a sentence for another offence.""  52The appellant's submission based on examples of particular offences where comparatively small sums of money were involved, takes the offending out of its context and involves, as her Honour appreciated, a high level of artificiality.  53For convenience, the Crown collected the tax fraud offences under the name of the company used for that offence.  In relation to the actual fraudulent receipt of monies, there were 15 such companies.  In relation to each company there were often a number of such fraudulent transactions.  Although the amount of money relating to one particular company might have been modest, the level of criminality, involving as it did planning and the acquisition of companies over a long period of time before the fraudulent claim was made, was in reality the same in respect of each company.  It is not without significance that the 15 sentences of 5 years imprisonment in respect of each company were all to be served concurrently.  This was an entirely appropriate response by her Honour.  It favoured the appellant.  The same situation prevailed in relation to the 24 attempt charges with respect to the tax fraud offences.  Although the amounts of money varied, the level of criminality was identical in relation to each company.  54As indicated, not only was her Honour's approach in accordance with principle, it tendered to favour the appellant.  Ground of Appeal 3 (i) has not been made out.  55Grounds of Appeal (ii) and (iii) raise the same issue and can be dealt with together.  56The appellant submits that her Honour erred in partially accumulating the tax fraud matters.  The appellant submits that because those offences arose out of the same sequence of events, covered the same time period, involved the same offending conduct and involved the same person (the appellant) they should have been made fully concurrent.  57The factual basis for this submission is not correct.  Within the tax fraud offences, the attempt charges generally cover the period 1 December 2001 until 25 July 2002, whereas the charges where monies were actually received, relate to fraudulent BAS lodged with the ATO between 4 October 2001 and 19 February 2002.  Moreover, with some slight overlap, the companies involved in the attempt charges are different from those involved in the offences where monies were actually received by the appellant.  58In any event, the level of accumulation between the attempt offences and those where monies were actually received is quite modest, i.e. 1 year.  There is partial concurrency for the period of 3 years.  This is entirely appropriate when one looks at the differences between the two sets of offences.  59What the appellant is in reality arguing for is that all of the tax fraud offences should be treated as a single course of criminal conduct.  Not only is that inappropriate from a factual point of view but it is inappropriate as a matter of principle.  Just because the appellant had resolved on a particular course of criminal activity through which to obtain money, does not mean every aspect of that activity should be regarded as a single course of conduct.  60Not only did the appellant use a number of different companies but the false claims were made at different times during the course of the criminal enterprise.  To regard those matters as being merely a continuation of the same course of criminal conduct is incompatible both with a proper appreciation of the facts and established sentencing principles.  61In any event, the fact that the offences arose from a single course of criminal conduct does not require a sentencing judge to impose concurrent sentences for those offences ( Wilkins v R (1998) 38 A Crim R 445).  It is erroneous for a Court to impose concurrent sentences on the basis that offences arose from a single course of  criminal conduct where the overall sentence imposed does not reflect the total criminality involved in that course of conduct ( Gorman v R [2002] NSWCCA 516).  62In relation to totality, her Honour did exactly what was recommended by Mill v Queen (1988) 161 CLR 59 and Pearce , i.e. she fixed the sentence for each group of offences before taking the step of applying the principle of totality by determining the extent to which there should be accumulation and concurrency in those sentences.  This had the effect of reducing the head sentence from 12  years to 6 years.  63Grounds of appeal 3 (ii) and (iii) have not been made out.  Ground 4 - Her Honour gave insufficient weight to the full repayment of tax, the subject of the charges.  64To understand this ground of appeal, it is necessary to set out s16A(2)(f) Crimes Act 1914 and s320 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth).  65Section 16A(2)(f) provides:  ""16A(2)  In addition to any other matters, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court:  ...  (f) The degree to which the person has shown contrition for the offence:  (i) By taking action to make reparation for any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence; or  (ii) In any other manner.""  66Section 320 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) provides:  ""320 A court passing sentence on a person in respect of the person's conviction of an indictable offence:  (a) May have regard to any co-operation by the person in resolving any action taken against the person under this Act; and  (b) Must not have regard to any forfeiture order that relates to the offence, to the extent that the order forfeits proceeds of the offence; and  (c) Must have regard to the forfeiture order to the extent that the order forfeits any other property; and  (d) Must not have regard to any pecuniary penalty order, or any literary proceeds order, that relates to the offence.""  67The appellant submitted that the evidence was that through the sale of some property the appellant and his wife were taking steps to pay the amount of a forfeiture order of $355,000.  It was common ground that the appellant had co-operated in this process and that he had paid $100,000 of that amount.  68The appellant submitted that there was no tension between s16A(2)(f) of the Crimes Act 1914 and s320(d) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.  In those circumstances the appellant submitted, that her Honour had failed to have adequate regard to the appellant's expression of contrition by taking steps to comply with the orders under the Proceeds of Crime Act .  69It is apparent from how her Honour treated the appellant's payment that she did take it into account in relation to contrition and that he did obtain some benefit from it.  In accordance with s320(a) her Honour said in relation to that payment:  ""I do and am entitled to take into account the fact that the offender consented to these orders when assessing his co-operation and also in relation to issues of contrition and remorse.""  70However, her Honour qualified the extent to which she was prepared to take those matters into account by reference to:  ""He made personal gain out of these offences and did so over a significant period of time.  He had the funds and he used them for his own purposes.  There has also been further loss to the Commonwealth in the expense it has taken to investigate and prosecute these offences.""  Her Honour also took into account, as a matter tending against genuine contrition and remorse, that the appellant had not been truthful when giving evidence in his sentencing proceedings.  71With the exception of the expense to the Commonwealth of prosecuting the offences, these are all matters which her Honour was entitled to take into account as reducing the extent to which she should take into account the appellant's contrition when doing his best to comply with orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Act .  72It is clear that her Honour took into account the fact that the appellant had consented to orders under the Proceeds of Crime Act to the extent to which she could and that otherwise she appropriately treated the question of contrition.  This ground of appeal has not been made out.  Ground of Appeal 6 - In respect to character, her Honour having found that the appellant had an insignificant criminal record, her Honour erred in:  (i) Having regard to findings of an ICAC Commissioner, (being a finding not established to any criminal (or civil) standard by a court of law; and  (ii) Fusing prior relevant good character with her Honour's rejection of the appellant's evidence.  73The appellant's submission seems to be that her Honour took into account the findings of the ICAC Commissioner in a way not specified and that this was an error on her part.  The appellant does not submit that her Honour should have made a finding that the appellant was a person of good character.  The thrust of the submission seems to be ""his character should not be impeached by findings not made in a courtroom and subject to the rigours of the Evidence Act 1995.""  74The fact of the appellant's previous convictions meant that he could not be regarded as a person of good character.  That is undisputed.  What her Honour said about the findings of the ICAC Commissioner were:  ""I also in this regard take into account the findings made by the ICAC Commissioner in April 1997 as set out by the Crown in their written submissions which in general terms reflect my own assessment of this offender as a witness.""  Her Honour was there referring to the fact that the appellant had been untruthful when giving evidence in the sentence proceedings.  75I do not see how the findings of the ICAC Commissioner were relevant to the task before her Honour.  To that extent, the appellant's submission is correct.  That having been said, the only weight her Honour gave to the findings was that they confirmed the impression which she had already formed as to the character of the appellant.   She had already determined for good and proper reasons that the appellant could not be regarded as a person of good character.  76In relation to offences of this kind where the need for general deterrence is strong, less weight is generally given to evidence of good character.  In R v Williams [2005] NSWSC 315, (2005) 152 A Crim R 548 Wood CJ at CL said:  ""60 Upon any view the evidence as to his character and community contribution is prodigious, and he must be given some credit for it, although as Bray CJ observed in Regina v Thompson (1975) 11 SASR 217 at [222], where the need for general deterrence is strong, the courts generally  give less weight to good character.  61 As was observed in R v El-Rashid NSWCCA 7 April 1995 per Gleeson CJ at 3 and in Regina v Rivkin at (2004) 59 NSWLR 284 at 410) the existence of good character is a circumstance that normally places the offender in the position whereby he or she is in a position to commit white collar crime.  As a consequence the need for general deterrence may displace, to some degree, the benefit which might otherwise attach, although for the reasons identified in Cameron v The Queen (2002) 209 CLR 339, it is not to be ignored.""  77I am not satisfied that the findings of the ICAC Commissioner made any contribution to her Honour's assessment of the appellant's good character.  His previous convictions substantially disqualified him from any such benefit.  There was no evidence of a positive kind as to good character.  He had significantly eroded any reliance which he might be able to place upon good character by being untruthful in his evidence before her Honour.  Finally, the very nature of the offence made considerations of good character of much less weight than would normally be the case.  This ground of appeal has not been made out.  Count 8 - Her Honour erred in setting the non-parole period by reference to the percentage proportion of 60 - 66 percent.  78The appellant submitted that her Honour's reasoning in following a ""norm"" of a ratio of 66 percent between the non-parole period and the head sentence was expressly disapproved by the High Court in Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45, (2010) 85 ALJR 195.  79This ground of appeal has been made out.  In fairness to her Honour, the decision in Hili was handed down well after her Honour sentenced the appellant.  Nevertheless, error has been identified in her Honour's reasoning process.  80The difficulty for the appellant is that he has not put forward any compelling reason why the approach followed by her Honour in fixing the non-parole period, albeit based on faulty reasoning, is not otherwise correct.  81Her Honour gave careful consideration to the rehabilitation of the appellant upon his release and his need for a period of supervision to improve his prospects of rehabilitation.  Her Honour rejected the proposition that the non-parole period should be extended because the appellant had provided assistance to the police when he was assaulted.  In those circumstances, a parole period of 2 years out of a total sentence of 6 years is appropriate.  82The appellant submitted that cases such as R v Corbett (1991) 52 A Crim R 112 at 116-117 suggested that because white collar crime was non-violent when compared with other offences, there should be a substantial gap between the head sentence and the non-parole period.  A similar expression of opinion was given in Stitt v The Queen (1998) 102 A Crim R 428 at 432.  83Such an approach, in my opinion, is quite out of step with current community standards.  The community now views white collar crime very seriously, having regard to the fact that it is easy to commit and difficult and expensive to track down. There is certainly no sentencing principle to the effect suggested by the appellant and by those cases.  84On the contrary, the expressions of opinion in Hili , which was itself a case involving tax fraud, are very much to the contrary.  There the plurality said:  ""63 The applicant's offending was sustained over a long time.  It was planned, deliberate and deceitful, requiring for its implementation the telling of many lies.  The applicants acted out of personal greed.  The amount of tax evaded was not small.  Detection of offending of this kind is not easy.  Serious tax fraud which this was, is offending and affects the whole community.  As was pointed out in Ruha , the sentences imposed had to have both a deterrent and a punitive effect, and those effects had to be reflected in the head sentences and the recognisance release orders that were made.""  85The guidance provided by Hili in relation to the fixing of a non-parole period in relation to the total sentence was that each case depended upon its own facts and that the non-parole period should be fixed accordingly.  ( Hili at [40], [44].)  86Although this ground of appeal has been made out and error has been identified in her Honour's reasoning, no error has been identified in the non-parole period fixed by her Honour.  In my opinion, no less a non-parole period than that imposed by her Honour is warranted.  87The orders which I propose are that leave to appeal be granted and that the appeal be dismissed.  88GROVE AJ:  I agree with Hoeben J.  **********

2709570,R v Smith [No 2] [2011] NSWSC 727,"Judgment 

1The accused, Darren Paul Smith is charged with having murdered Russell Lyons on 3 June 1995. The deceased's body was located in a carpark at the end of a laneway which runs off Smart Street in Fairfield at about 8.40 am on 3 June 1995. According to Dr Ellis, who conducted the post-mortem, his death was caused by head injuries with alcohol toxicity said to have been a contributing factor. The deceased was fully clothed but his shoes and wallet were missing. Despite a lengthy police investigation, it was not until 7 June 2009 that the accused was arrested. Indeed, he only came to the attention of investigating police when a DNA profile matching his profile connected him to the crime scene. His DNA profile was only entered on the national database in 2008 following his apprehension in Queensland on a trivial matter. Following analysis, a match was made between his profile and DNA material that was located inside each shoe of a pair of Adidas running shoes. The shoes themselves were located on 5 June 1995 a short distance from where the deceased's body was found. Also found on the shoes was blood staining which matched the deceased's DNA profile. A DNA profile matching that of the accused was also located in the area of the rear right pocket of the jeans which the deceased was wearing when his body was discovered. The Crown case is that the accused killed the deceased during the course of robbing him of his shoes and wallet. The Crown also asserts that the Adidas shoes had been worn by the accused but had then been discarded when the accused realised that the deceased's blood has found its way onto them as a result of the fatal attack. 

2The Crown alleges that some hours prior to the discovery of the deceased's body, the accused had attempted to steal the deceased's wallet during an altercation which had occurred on The Crescent, Fairfield at about 3.30 am. That incident was witnessed by the deceased's friends and drinking companions, John Byrne and Ian Cross. Their evidence was to the effect that they had been out at various drinking establishments that evening in the company of the deceased and that they were making their way home at the time that the incident occurred. The uncontradicted evidence is that each of them was extremely intoxicated at the time. Both gave evidence that the deceased had crossed The Crescent when they heard him call out words to the effect of ""He's got my wallet"". Their evidence is that they then ran across the road in order to assist the deceased. His assailant was described by them as being an Australian with a goatee beard. Shortly thereafter three males described as being of ""Islander"" appearance joined in the altercation. The Crown case is that the deceased eventually ran from the scene of the altercation whereupon he turned into Smart Street. From there he ended up in the carpark to which I referred earlier. It was at that location, the Crown asserts, that the deceased received the fatal injuries having been pursued there by the accused. 

3The Crown seeks to lead evidence of three telephone conversations in which the accused participated on 6 June 2009, which it may be observed is the day before his arrest. Objection is taken to the admissibility of the conversations. The participants in the first conversation, which took place at 16:01:28, are identified as being the accused (V1), Paul Shephard (V2) and Wayne (V3). The relevant parts of the conversation are set out below: 

V2: Yeah. I've just had the coppers here looking for you. 
V1: You what? 

V2: Had the coppers here looking for you. 
V1: For me? 

V2: Yeah. 
V1: What for? 

V2: Something to do with a serious incident in Fairfield in nineteen ninety five. 
V1: Fair dinkum. 

V2: Something to do with a pub . 
V1: Yeah ? 

V2: Yep. 
V1: Had 'em at your place? 

V2: Yep. 
V1: Oh well, don't know where I am . 

V2: Well I told 'em that. They had, they've got your mobile - they had your mobile number . 
V1: Yeah. Oh well... 

V2: And they got, they got my name because you (sic) an accident years ago and you had the old man's box trailer on your car . 
V1: Oh okay, yep, yep . 

V2: I'm just sort of giving you a heads up, that's why I'm ringing you on Wayne's phone, 'cause they wanted all my phone numbers and shit. 
V1: Oh okay, yeah, yeah. When, when was that? 

V2: Hey? 
V1: When did they turn up? 

V2: They left about five minutes ago. 
Vi: Fair dinkum? 

V2: Yeah . 
V1: Okay, what, are they just looking for me ? 

V2: Yeah. They said they wouldn't ... 
V1: What for ? 

V2: ... tell me, wouldn't tell me what for . 
V1: Yeah . 

V2: They wanted to know if you were a violent person. If you drank. If you were on drugs. 
V1: Don't even smoke any more. 

V2: Wanted to know what sort of people you hung out with ... 
Vi: Yeah . 

V2: ... in ninety five . 

... 

V1: Oh okay, fair enough. No worries. Ninety five? Where was I in ninety five ? 
V2: I have no idea. They said it's something to so with a, supposed to be something to do with a pub in Fairfield . 

V1: (Unintelligible) 
V2: It's something serious. 

V1: Yeah, don't know. Don't know, you've got me worried now. (Laughs). 

... 

V3: Oh well you got me number now too hey. 
V1: Yeah, yeah. I'm probably in WA am I? 

V3: Oh I don't know, I thought, I thought you were fuckin' overseas somewhere. 
V1: Yeah, somewhere there. 

V3: Yeah. 
V1: Yeah. The only thing is I've got a car registered up here to . 
V3: Ah, change that real quick. Sell it . 

V1: No I can't mate. No they'll find me real quick now. Yeah. If it's important, they'll find me pretty quick . (emphasis added) 

4The second conversation commenced at 16:35:32. The participants in it are identified as being the accused (V1) and Dot Sheehan (V2). The relevant parts of this conversation are set out below: 

V2: Listen, I just had the homicide squad here . 
V1: Oh, fair dinkum . 

V2: Um, looking, they want to ask Wayne some questions about you in ninety-five. 
V1: Okay. Yeah, yep. 

V2: Did you have an accident or something in ninety-five ? 
V1: Yeah, me car accident, I, I think was back them days . 

V2: Yeah? 
V1: Yeah, yeah. 

V2: Yeah? 
V1: Yeah, yeah. 

V2: No, well they want to interview Wayne. 
V1: Interview Wayne, okay. 

V2: But that's about fourteen years ago. 
V1: Yeah, yeah, yeah. True. 

V2: Are you going for a claim or... 
V1: No, no I'm not. Nah. I don't know, I don't know what it'd be. 

V2: Well, they're from the homicide squad. 
V1: Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. Fair enough. 

V2: At Parramatta, yeah. 
V1: Okay, fair enough. 

V2: What it says is, ""Unsolved Homicide Team ."" 
V1: Oh okay. Yep, yep, yeah . 

V2: So... 
V1: Oh what, what you got paperwork there or something ? 

V2: No he left his card and what it was about. He wants um, Wayne to get in contact with him . 

V1: Oh, okay. Yeah, yep, yep. Where's where's Wayne? 
V2: Um, Mittagong at the moment. 

V1: Mittagong. 
V2: He'll be back tomorrow. 

V1: Oh, okay. Yeah, yep. No worries. Okay, yeah . 
V2: So, so what was it, you had an accident or something ? 

V1: No. I had an accident back in, back in nineteen ninety something . 

... 

V2: That's okay. I'll get, when Wayne talks to them I'll get him to find you what it's about. 
V1: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Not a problem. 

5The final conversation commenced at 16:41:39. Once again the participants are Dot Sheehan (V1) and the accused (V2). The relevant parts of this conversation are set out below: 

V2: You don't know where I am do you ? 
V1: No . 

V2; Okay, good. (Laughs) Just in case mate, that's all... 
V1: I, oh I wouldn't say anything mate. 

V2: Yeah, yeah, not a problem. 
V1: No, no. 

V2: I knew that, I was just (Untranscribed background conversation) 
V1: I don't know where you are, all I know you're up north. 

... 

V1: Oh no I wouldn't, I, even Wayne wouldn't say - I mean Wayne should ring 'em up and find exactly what it's about . 
V2: Oh let them come to him mate . 

6The Crown in its submissions relied, in particular, upon what the accused said when he rang and spoke to Ms Dot Sheehan in the last of the calls. Attention was drawn to that part of the call in which he suggested to her, by implication, that she should not tell the police where he was in the event that she was asked questions about him. 

7The Crown submitted that, when considered in the context of the totality of the conversations, that utterance revealed a consciousness of guilt on the part of the accused. It was further submitted that sufficient detail was provided to the accused to enable him to determine the precise offence about which the investigating police wished to question him. The only rational interference to be drawn from the conversations, so it was submitted, was his realisation that he was guilty of the offence with which he is charged. 

8It is axiomatic that the Crown may, in appropriate cases, rely on lies or on the provision of false information or on other post offence conduct, such as flight, as giving rise to consciousness of guilt on the part of an accused person. Clearly the impugned evidence does not fall into any of those categories. Nevertheless I have found it instructive to have regard to the principles that were identified in R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 insofar as they pertain to the admissibility of that kind of evidence. Although it was not characterised in this way by the Crown, the impugned conversations were effectively sought to be relied upon as constituting ""implied admissions"". 

9The first matter that needs to be addressed is the Crown's contention that the accused was informed of the precise details of Russell Lyons' death. In my view, the information which was conveyed to the accused in the conversations is at odds with the objective evidence that has been led concerning the circumstances that surrounded the death of Russell Lyons. For example, although there may be some uncertainty as to the exact circumstances in which the deceased met his fate, it is no part of the Crown case that any of the events which culminated in the death of Russell Lyons occurred in a hotel. Nor, is it any part of the Crown case that the accused was involved in some form of accident. 

10Secondly, a number of the accused's utterances do not, in my view, support the Crown's contention. For example, towards the end of the first conversation when the person identified as Wayne suggested to the accused that he should change the registration of his car, the accused replied ""No, I can't mate. They'll find me real quick now. If it's important, they'll find me pretty quick."" That is hardly indicative of an intention on the part of the accused to take steps to avoid the police. Nor of course did he in fact attempt to take flight. Moreover, the accused was made aware that the police had his mobile phone number. 

11Thirdly, as I have said, the Crown limited its submissions to a focus upon the accused's remark in the last telephone call when he said to Ms Sheehan ""You don't know where I am, do you?"" At its highest that would appear to amount to a request that she not disclose his whereabouts to the police. Moreover, his initial response, having been told at the beginning of the first conversation that the police interest in him concerned ""a serious incident in Fairfield in 1995"" and was ""something to do with a pub"", was to say ""oh well don't know where I am"". There had been no suggestion at that stage that their inquiries concerned an unsolved homicide. 

12I should record that I have had the benefit of listening to each of the impugned conversations. That has assisted my understanding of the manner and tone of the accused's utterances which, in turn, has served to confirm the view that I should reach about the matter. 

13I have concluded that the evidence falls well short of being capable of being used in support of the Crown case as an ""implied admission"". In a sense, it could not do so unless one was to first assume that the accused was indeed guilty of the offence. That, as can be readily seen, involves a circularity of reasoning. 

14Were it necessary to consider the issue further, I would also exclude the evidence pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act . I have already expressed a view about the probative value of the evidence. On the other hand, the risk of unfair prejudice is high since, were the evidence to be admitted, the accused would no doubt, in endeavouring to innocently explain his remarks, be obliged to make reference, however veiled, to the fact that he is known unfavourably by the police. 

15In respect of that issue the evidence before me reveals that the accused, who was born on 28 February 1966, has a number of convictions both in this State and in Queensland. His NSW record commenced in 1982 and he was thereafter regularly before the courts in this State until 1988. However, apart from a minor drug matter in 2003, he has not come to attention since then. His Queensland record commenced in 1985 and a number of convictions are recorded against him between then and 1993. Since 1993 he has twice appeared in a Magistrate's Court in that State (in 1999 and in 2007) but on both occasions the penalties imposed suggest that the offences were of a very minor nature. [I observe that none of the matters of which he has been convicted come near to approaching the seriousness of the present charge]. 

16The accused's criminal record reveals that although he has had only limited contact with the courts in the last 15-20 years he had, prior to that time, been in fairly frequent trouble with the police. He is unlikely, in view of his record, to be a person who would wish to speak to police if he could avoid doing so, and particularly in relation to a matter which is said to have occurred many years ago. 

17Moreover, there is in my view, an additional risk of unfair prejudice in that a jury may well misuse the impugned evidence as providing a basis upon which to infer that the accused is guilty notwithstanding the quantum leap that such a line of reasoning would entail. 

Order 

18I uphold the objection to the admissibility of the three telephone calls upon which the Crown seeks to rely. The evidence is, accordingly, excluded.

		19 July 2011",2011-06-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709574,Chen v R [2011] NSWCCA 145,"Judgment 

1SIMPSON J : On 4 April 2008, following a five day jury trial, the appellant was convicted on all three counts on an indictment. The indictment charged the appellant with one count of supply of a prohibited drug (contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (""the DMT Act"")), alleged to have been committed between 27 May 2005 and 7 June 2005; and two counts of supplying not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (contrary to s 25(2) of the DMT Act), alleged to have been committed, respectively, between 9 June 2005 and 26 June 2005 and on 26 June 2005. In each case the prohibited drug was MDMA, the drug commonly known as ecstasy. 

2By s 32 of the DMT Act, the first count carries a maximum custodial penalty of imprisonment for 15 years; by s 33(3)(a), the second and third counts each carry a maximum custodial penalty of imprisonment for life. 

3Following the appellant's conviction, he asked that, in sentencing, two further offences itemised on a Form 1, one of possession of a prohibited drug (1 gram of cannabis), and one of possession of a prohibited drug (6.55 grams of methylamphetamine) be, pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act""), taken into account. 

4On 30 October 2008 Hulme DCJ (as his Honour then was) sentenced the appellant. 

5On the first count he imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for 5 years, commencing on 5 March 2008; on the third count, to imprisonment for 10 years, made up of a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months, commencing on 5 March 2009, and therefore accumulated on the earlier-imposed sentence by 1 year; and on the second count (taking into account the additional offences) to imprisonment for 12 years, made up of a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months, commencing on 5 March 2010 and therefore accumulated by a further 12 months on the previous sentence. The aggregate sentence was of imprisonment for 14 years, made up of a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months, with a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months. 

6The appellant now appeals against the conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentences. 

7The manner in which the Crown sought to (and, to the satisfaction of the jury, did) prove its case, in respect of each of the offences, was slightly different, and depended upon some expansive definitions and deeming provisions contained in the DMT Act. The definition, in s 3, of ""supply"" is important and an extension of the natural meaning of the word. Inter alia , ""supply"" is constituted by: 

(i)having possession for the purposes of supply; 

(ii)agreeing to supply; and 

(iii)attempting to have in possession for the purpose of supply. 

Count 1 

The Crown sought to prove count 1 by proving that, jointly with his step-son Hao Wei Zhang (""Zhang""), the appellant was in possession of 400 ecstasy tablets. By s 7 of the DMT Act, joint possession is deemed to be possession. There was uncontested evidence that one tablet of ecstasy weighs approximately 0.25 (one-quarter) of a gram. By s 3 and Sch 1, a traffickable quantity of ecstasy is 0.75 grams. By s 29 of the DMT Act, possession of not less than the traffickable quantity of the prohibited drug in question is deemed to be in possession for the purposes of supply (unless the person accused is able to prove otherwise). 

8Accordingly, the Crown having proved to the satisfaction of the jury that the appellant (jointly with Zhang) was in possession of 400 tablets (100 grams, more than the traffickable quantity), he was, by s 29, deemed to have had the drug in his possession for the purpose of supply and was, by s 3, guilty of supply. 

Count 2 

9By s 3 and Sch 1, a large commercial quantity of ecstasy is 500 grams. The Crown sought to prove count 2 by proving that (in a series of telephone conversations) the appellant agreed to supply, to various persons, 830 grams of ecstasy. By the s 3 definition of ""supply"", proof that the appellant agreed to supply 830 grams, therefore, for the purposes of the DMT Act, established supply of not less than the large commercial quantity of the drug. 

Count 3 

10The Crown sought to prove count 3 by proving that, on 26 June 2005, the appellant attempted to have in his possession 2000 ecstasy tablets (500 grams). By the definition of ""supply"" (including attempting to have in possession), and s 3 and Sch 1, his attempt to have in his possession that quantity of ecstasy constituted supply by him of the drug. 

11In respect of each count, it was the Crown case that the appellant was engaged in a joint criminal enterprise with Zhang. 

12Before empanelling the jury, Hulme DCJ made a number of evidentiary rulings. It will be convenient to deal with them, so far as they are raised in the various grounds of appeal, below. 

The trial 

The Crown case 

13To a very significant extent, the Crown case was proved by the admission into evidence of a series of recordings of telephone conversations (Exhibits A and B) that had been lawfully intercepted, recorded and transcribed. The appellant was a party to most, but not all, of these conversations. Some were in the Mandarin language; others in the Shanghainese language, and others in English. Those conversations that were in the Mandarin and Shanghainese languages were translated by an accredited interpreter, Ms Hai Ou (Helen) Wang. A further form of ""translation"" was provided by the officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Senior Constable Zimmer, who gave evidence, accepted as being expert evidence, of the ""argot"" of drug dealing, and linguistic practices of drug criminals. This evidence of Detective Zimmer could therefore be said to be a further interpretation of the language (after translation to English) used in the conversations. 

14The transcript of the trial proceedings shows that all of the tape recordings (including those in the Chinese languages) were played to the jury, and the jury were provided, expressly by way of aide memoir, with the transcripts of the tape recordings. It was pointed out to them, in the usual fashion, that the tape recordings were the evidence, the transcripts were secondary; and it was also (realistically) pointed out to them that, where the conversations were in one of the Chinese languages, the primacy of the recordings was of little relevance and they were entitled to rely on the transcripts of the conversations as translated. 

15In all, the recordings of 39 different telephone conversations were before the jury, numbered, for convenience of reference, 1-39, in chronological order. It was not disputed that the appellant had been a party to 34 of the 39 calls. Of these, the other party to the conversation was, on 14 occasions, Zhang; on 11 occasions the other party was identified as ""Hokeo""; on 4 occasions the other party was identified as ""Sam""; and on 4 occasions the other party was said to be ""an unknown male"". The conversations to which the appellant was not a party involved Zhang, Sam, and an unknown male (or unknown males). 

16Nine of the conversations took place on or after 27 June 2005, thus post dating the last date mentioned in the indictment as the date on which the offences were alleged to have been committed. 

17The transcripts of the conversations disclose many, many references, in one form or another, to money, including to specific amounts of dollars, for example, $500, $700, $1200. In a number of calls, there are requests to borrow money, in the amounts I have just mentioned. There are also references to meetings. There are references to the use of mobile telephones. 

18One such conversation (at 3.32pm on 10 June 2005 (Call 6)) can here be mentioned. The conversation was in Mandarin. The transcript of the call shows that Zhang telephoned the appellant, saying that ""Hao Ki"" (which, I presume, is a different spelling of ""Hokeo"") did not need to borrow money so he would not see the appellant that day. The appellant asked: 

""Why you let him ring me so late? ... Why you use this phone ringing me? ... Which phone are you using?"" 

Zhang replied that he had no idea; the appellant asked what handset he was holding to which Zhang again replied that he had no idea. Zhang then gave four digits of the number he was using as ""8883"". Zhang said that he had not made the call; the appellant asked: 

""Why you let him use your phone ringing me?"" 

This was followed by a background sound of ""fucking ... fucking ..."" which was itself followed by the appellant saying: 

""You fucking, fucking you son of bitch! Go dead, you fucking stupid son of bitch, you bloody unteachable!"" 

19For a different reason, the telephone calls numbered 26 and 30 may also here be noted. The conversation recorded in call number 26 commenced at 11.31pm on 25 June 2005 and was in Shanghainese. The appellant is recorded speaking to an ""unknown male"", and asking the unknown male to lend him ""2000 dollars"". The two organised to meet at about midday the following day, 26 June. The unknown male asked the appellant to ""give me that stuff"". Calls 27, 28 and 29 were also said to relate to this transaction, but need not here be quoted. The conversation recorded in call number 30 took place at 8.49pm on 26 June (the last day of the range of dates of the second offence alleged, and the date on which the third was alleged to have been committed), in Shanghainese. The transcript shows that the appellant telephoned an unknown male, and asked who counted ""the 2000 dollars"". He is then recorded as asking: 

""Didn't you take $2000? Who counted ...?"" 

to which the unknown male replied: 

""I did."" 

The transcript then attributes to the appellant the following: 

""One of the issues ... they are very fragmented ... all in half pieces, very crushed ..."" [the word ""crushed"" has been struck out, and a handwritten ""broken"" inserted] 

The appellant is recorded as saying: 

""9 are short in total ... now I ... (indecipherable) ... around 10 plus ... 

... 

Now after weighing the stuff is 11 ...... right? ..... which means the whole ... whole pieces .. 11 whole pieces short ....... altogether .... might be 21 .., or 22 ... I have gathered all the crushed ones ......"" [again, ""crushed"" has been struck out and the word ""broken"" handwritten] 

The unknown male is then recorded as saying: 

""Okay, now, you give all the crushed ones back to me, put them Together, give them back to me, I will have them Exchanged ........."" [""crushed"" is again struck out and ""broken"" substituted in handwriting] 

20At the commencement of proceedings on 27 March, the Crown Prosecutor told the judge that the alteration of ""crushed"" to ""broken"" was made by Ms Wang, after she had considered an alternative translation proposed on behalf of the appellant. 

21The content of some of the remaining conversations will be referred to below, in the context of the appellant's explanations. 

22Also in evidence (Exhibits P and Q, admitted over objection) were tape recordings and transcripts of a second series of telephone conversations to which the appellant was not a party. These were between Zhang and a man named Heng (or Henry) Zou who gave evidence in the trial. These conversations were in English, and took place between 1 and 22 July 2005. 

23The first witness in the Crown case was Detective Senior Constable Matthew Zimmer, who was the officer in charge of the investigation. Detective Zimmer gave detailed evidence concerning his expertise in criminal investigation, specifically drug investigations. He had been engaged as an investigator for the State's Crime Command Drug Squad of the NSW Police Service, as part of an investigation into the manufacture of prohibited drugs. He said that he had been involved in and had led a number of overt and covert investigations targeting the production, importation and distribution of prohibited drugs in various divisions of the Police Service; in a number he had coordinated covert operations involving various law enforcement authorities, targeting persons involved in prohibited drugs of different kinds. His investigations had included the use of physical and electronic surveillance, undercover police operatives and other methods. He said that he had monitored thousands of recorded conversations relating to the manufacture and distribution of prohibited drugs and was therefore familiar with the terms and procedures used by persons involved in the manufacture and supply of prohibited drugs and the methods they used to avoid detection. He gave specific evidence about ecstasy, and the manner in which it is supplied; in particular, he said it is common for ecstasy tablets to be supplied in ""number quantities"" rather than by weight. In his experience ecstasy was the only drug commonly supplied in large quantities in tablet form and in number quantities. He said that, in his experience, it was not uncommon for persons involved in the supply of prohibited drugs to use two or more mobile telephones at any one time, in order to ""alleviate"" or hinder police investigations. He gave evidence about the nature of coded conversations which, he said, vary, but he said that codes were generally terms used to describe prohibited drugs and arrangements to facilitate the supply of prohibited drugs. He said: 

""Persons who engage in coded conversations will usually attempt to disguise any drug related talk by making the conversation appear legitimate in the event that the conversation may be subject to lawful interception. The terms money, and borrowing money, are common codes used by persons involved in the supply of prohibited drugs."" 

He said that, because ecstasy is sold in number quantities, that was an appropriate code to use in relation to that drug. 

24Objection was taken to the admissibility of Detective Zimmer's evidence. The basis of the objection was articulated in a pre-trial hearing as a challenge to the Detective's expertise. I will deal with this, and the ruling, when I come to the relevant ground of appeal. 

25Having established his expertise to the satisfaction of the trial judge, Detective Zimmer answered a global question about the recorded conversations by saying that they were ""consistent with"" references to drug transactions. When asked what particular words were consistent, he said: 

""The words money - in these discussions - conversations there is never any discussion in relation to why a person wishes to borrow money. Never any discussion in relation to paying money back. Whenever the borrowing of money is discussed, the arrangements and meeting locations in these conversations are generally conversed into guarded conversation. In my experience money does not fragment and does not divide into half pieces. Also during these previous investigations that I've been involved in I have seen this code utilised."" 

The penultimate sentence was a reference to what was recorded in call numbered 30 (see above). 

26Detective Zimmer repeated that the conversations were ""consistent with references to the prohibited drug ecstasy"" and said that he based that opinion upon: 

""The fact that during some of these conversations there is references to a number of - there is references to money and amounts of money and the amounts mentioned are not consistent with any other drugs, it's by weight so there's reference to quarters and ounces and halves. There is references to money which is consistent to an individual drug item and in my experience the only drug that is sold in large quantities in an individual item is ecstasy."" (AB 441) 

27After that evidence was given, the various tape recordings were played to the jury, accompanied by their transcripts (as, where relevant, translated). 

28A good deal of evidence of the appellant's financial dealings was also given. This appears to have been uncontroversial, and, as it does not feature in any of the grounds of appeal, it can safely be passed over. 

29Other evidence, relevant to the grounds of appeal, was given by Ms Wang (the interpreter), Mr Henry Zou, and Ms Tasesa Tui. 

30Ms Wang's evidence concerned her translation of the recorded conversations. I will return to this when dealing with the grounds of appeal. 

31Mr Zou gave the bulk of his evidence under the protection of a certificate under s 128 of the Evidence Act 1995, issued after he objected to answering questions on the ground that the answers might incriminate him. The substance of his evidence was that he was acquainted with Zhang, and that Zhang had, by arrangement and on more than one occasion, provided him with ecstasy tablets. He gave evidence that, at the commencement of the arrangement, they had agreed not to use the word ""ecstasy"" in telephone conversations and, instead, to use code. The code word upon which they agreed, as a substitute for ""ecstasy"", was ""tuition""; a reference to a specified number of hours of tuition would be a reference to that number of ecstasy tablets. 

32On one occasion in the company of Ryan McPherson-Fenn and Richard King, Zou met Zhang at Canterbury Station. Zhang supplied him with 18 ecstasy tablets, for which he paid $300 or $400. On a subsequent occasion (the date of which he did not give) he again arranged to meet Zhang at Canterbury Station, but was unable to attend. He arranged for McPherson-Fenn to attend in his place. 

33Zou identified Exhibits P and Q as tape recordings and transcripts of conversations he had had with Zhang. The conversations contain many references to ""tuition"", often accompanied by a reference to a number of hours. There are also many references to arranged meetings. 

34One of the calls (numbered 7, of 15 July) he identified as the call arranging the first meeting at Canterbury Station, and for the purpose of arranging for the supply to him by Zhang of the 18 ecstasy tablets. Another (call 8, of 22 July) he identified as arranging the second meeting at Canterbury Station, for the supply to him of 6 ecstasy tablets. This was the meeting that he was unable to attend, and at which McPherson-Fenn stood in for him. 

35The transcripts of these calls contain, respectively, references to 18 hours and 6 hours of ""tuition"". 

36Ms Tui had herself been charged with and pleaded guilty to two counts of supplying ecstasy tablets. She was arrested on 23 August 2005 (the same day as the appellant). At that time she was in possession of 245 ecstasy tablets. Some of the tablets were stamped with a ""bird logo"". Others were stamped with a ""dolphin logo"". The second count to which she pleaded guilty was of actual supply of 50 tablets to a person. On sentencing, another two offences were taken into account. These were of actual supply of 50 tablets to the same person. After reduction, by reason of her pleas of guilty, of the sentences, a non-parole period of 15 months was imposed. (She did not give evidence that she had received any benefit in sentencing by reason of her agreeing to give evidence against the appellant.) 

37Ms Tui said that she first met the appellant in 2001, at his home in Canterbury. His wife was present, as was Zhang. She visited the appellant there until she and her husband (Mr He) moved to an apartment in Forest Road, Hurstville. It was the appellant who made the arrangements for Ms Tui and Mr He to move into the apartment, and who, with Mr He, paid the rent. Shortly after that, again by the arrangement of the appellant, Ms Tui and Mr He moved into another apartment (apartment 197) in the same building. They shared this apartment with the appellant. 

38In this apartment, Ms Tui observed ecstasy tablets ""on some occasions ... thousands"", loose on the coffee table. Some of these were marked with a ""dove logo"". The appellant and Mr He supplied Ms Tui with ecstasy tablets for her own use, and for the purpose of supply to others. When she supplied others with ecstasy tablets, she paid the money to the appellant. It was the appellant who had supplied her with the ecstasy that led to the charges to which she pleaded guilty. 

39Also during the time she shared the apartment with Mr He and the appellant, Ms Tui observed: 

""a bundle of money five centimetres high on the glass table next to the ecstasy pills in front of [the appellant]."" 

40Ms Tui gave evidence that the appellant had asked her to register a mobile telephone for him, using (as identification) a ""fake licence"" bearing a photograph of the appellant, but in a false name. On other occasions, the appellant gave Ms Tui or Mr He money to purchase mobile telephones for him - about 10 in all. He asked her to dispose of the telephone she had been using because he feared that it was being intercepted. The appellant told Ms Tui not to call him on his telephone, and not to mention ""pills"" on the telephone, but to see him in person. He told her that, if she did need to speak to him on the telephone, because she wanted ecstasy, she was to say that she wanted something to eat. 

41Ms Tui's evidence was vigorously contested. Objection was taken to its admission, but was overruled. It will be necessary to consider the objection in relation to the grounds of appeal. 

42Detective Damien Beaufils gave evidence of events of 22 July. Police had Zhang under surveillance. They observed him meet McPherson-Fenn at Canterbury Station and saw what appeared to be an exchange of items between them. Mr McPherson-Fenn was arrested almost immediately after, in possession of 6 ecstasy tablets. 

43Detective Zimmer also gave evidence of events of 23 August 2005, on which date the appellant was arrested. At about 8.00am on the morning of that day, with other police officers, he participated in the execution of a search warrant at the residential premises of the appellant (which he shared with Ms Tui and Mr He). At the time of their arrival the appellant was in bed asleep. Also present was a ""Mr Wang"". 

44The execution of the search warrant was videotaped; the video and the transcript of what was audio-recorded were, respectively, in evidence as Exhibits E and F. During the course of the search, in answer to questions asked of him by police officers, the appellant directed the officers to where they located a small quantity of methylamphetamine, and one ecstasy tablet, which he said was for ""self-use only"". He said that he had about $6000 in cash, to pay ""rental fees"", and that Mr Wang was to travel to China three days later, and he (the appellant) had prepared some cash for him to take to his (the appellant's) mother. He directed police to where the money was contained in a wallet, concealed under a pillow. In fact, it contained $7400. 

45Detective Beaufils gave evidence of the execution of the search warrant on the appellant's premises. As a result of that search, more than 20 mobile telephones, some with and some without SIM cards, were located. A number of SIM cards were located separately, some in the appellant's motor vehicle. 

46After a conversation with him, Detective Zimmer arrested the appellant. Later that day, at the Hurstville Police Station and with the assistance of an interpreter, he formally interviewed the appellant. The interview was electronically recorded and transcribed. The transcript of the interview contains, inter alia , the following questions and answers: 

""Q41. Our investigation focuses upon your alleged involvement in the supply of the prohibited drug ecstasy. 
A. ... I don't think you have used the correct term. You mentioned the word supply. Who did I supply to? 

Q42. Okay. That's - that's what I want to speak to you about ... 
A. At the point of time when the police - when the police entered my room I was half asleep, half awaken and I - and I found the police was quite - not ... (indistinct) ... enough. And now I am thinking the police have to show me the search warrant. 

... 

Q47-48. I wish to inform you that as a result of our investigation we have intercepted a number of mobile telephone conversations ... and a number of those telephone services that were intercepted we believe belong to you. 
A. Why do you say it's mine? 

Q49. Okay. That's what we're alleging ... 
A. Could you play it to me? 

Q50. At this particular time of the investigation I do not have electronic copies to play to him. They can be made available at a later time. 
A. Yeah, I would like to have a listen. 

... 

Q54. ... these are notes that have been recorded by a person who has listened to the phone calls and translated to English. 
A. Yeah. How are you so sure that this words was spoken by me? 

... 

Q57. ... as a result of our investigation we believe that the person talking in some of these conversations is Mr CHEN ... 
A. So do you mean that in the conversation - telephone conversation I'm, um, talking about - I was talking about supplying drugs to a party? 

Q58. That's what we'll be alleging, yeah. 

... 

Q66. There is a phone call where you ask a male if you can borrow two thousand dollars. 
... 
A. Buy two thousand dollars? 

... 

Q68. Do you agree that you borrowed two thousand dollars? 

A[69] Yes, I often borrowed money from my friends since I need to pay the rent ... 

A[71] ... um, private matters and I borrow money from others. I don't want to tell."" 

At this stage the interview was suspended. Detective Zimmer said that the appellant's solicitor wished to speak to him. A short time later some formal questions, were asked by a senior police officer not involved in the investigation, and the interview terminated. 

The defence case 

47The appellant gave evidence through an interpreter. He said that he had, for many years, and before he came to Australia (in 1988) been a coin collector. He produced photocopies of various coins, four books containing coins, and various packets of coins. 

48One unresponsive answer of the appellant is of some interest. He was asked: 

""... in relation to the other coins you have there did you buy them in packets or individually?"" 

His non-responsive answer to this was: 

""When it comes to coins business when we make a phone call I will say in a habitual Chinese way that can I borrow 1000 or 2000."" (AB 589) 

49He gave an explanation for each of the telephone conversations recorded in Exhibits A and B, to which he was a party. It is here necessary to set out some more of the content of the transcripts of the conversations, together with the appellant's explanations. 

50The first three telephone calls were said to relate to count 1. Each was in Mandarin. They were in the following terms: 

Call 1 

51At 8.01pm on 3 June 2005 the appellant telephoned Zhang. He asked where Zhang was, and whether he was ""coming back"". Zhang said he had just left home. The appellant asked if he had taken any money, to which Zhang replied in the negative. The appellant said: 

""didn't touch nothing?"" 

Zhang replied: 

""No, no, didn't touch anything."" 

52The appellant asked what time he would be home and whether somebody called ""Hequi"" (again, probably the person also referred to as ""Hokeo"") would be coming. Zhang replied that that person was with him then but that he did not think he would be coming over later. 

53The appellant's explanation for this call was transcribed as: 

""Because I separate from him (sic) mother who was my ex-girlfriend in 2003. Then I moved out but my stepson was still very close to me. Then I asked him where he had gone. He said he had just left. Even though I separated from him (sic) mother the mortgage and bills were still shared equally. Then when I got there I found that there was something wrong with the $300 so I just rang him and asked him whether he had touched the money. And besides the person by the name of Hau Qu (?) [as recorded in the trial transcript] who was brought up with him because Hau Qu was a Korean and we talk about the DVD discs and I asked him to come here to pick some of them."" 

Call 2 

54Nine minutes later, at 8.10pm on the same day, the appellant again telephoned Zhang. The following conversation took place: 

""Appellant: It seems the money downstair is not correct ... the money downstairs is not correct. 

Zhang: No, I didn't touch it. 

Appellant: It was originally 300 dollars right? ... 4 were taken ... 4 dollars ... how come only 218 ... 18 dollars left now? 

Zhang: No ... I will tell you when come back, I might have put it somewhere else. 

Appellant: I need it now ... understand? I have only 218 dollars left here, where is the rest of the money? 

Zhang: The rest of the money ... I have all ... but I might have ... (indecipherable) but I have all paid back ... at the time. 

Appellant: That's not right then ... it totals ... 

Zhang: Yesterday he took 50, I have paid back. 

Appellant: What time took 50 dollars? 

Zhang: You remember you had your friend at our home ... Last night ...? 

... 

I then called you out ... 

Appellant: ... 10 dollars, another 50 dollars, that becomes 60 dollars ...? 

Zhang: There is a lot more ... 

Appellant: How come there is so much short? 

Zhang: No, no ... I don't think ... 

Appellant: It's about more than 20 dollars short now. 

Zhang: Let me look into it ... Let me calculate again ... 

Appellant: You think about it, we work it out when you come back home ... ok? 

Zhang: Ok, fine."" 

55Of this call, the appellant said: 

""This phone call should be the continuation of the previous phone call. When I went downstairs I found that some money was missing from $300, and actually there was only $218. Then I asked him, because he previously had mentioned to me that he took $4 at a time for four times, then he went across the street to buy Coca-Cola four times. Then I figured out he must have lent money to his friend or friends. He like lending money to someone like $20 or $50. Then I asked him to go through the account when he came back, and when he came back he found that the money he was going to lend to someone was actually in his pocket, and then we actually just went through the account and it was balanced after deducting the money he spent on Coca-Cola."" 

Call 3 

56The third call in this series was made on 6 June 2005 at 9.34pm. The appellant telephoned Zhang. The following conversation is recorded: 

""Appellant: Where are you? 

Zhang: I have just left the library. 

Appellant: I have put 400 dollars there, how come so much short? 

Zhang: I didn't touch it. It should be more than 300 left. 

Appellant: No, it is now 70, 80 short. 

Zhang: ... 70, 80 ...? 

Appellant: Didn't the big tall guy take 20 last time ... Ok, say, bits by bits ... make them 10 then 30, now only just over 300 dollars ... It was 400 dollars, what a hell right? 

Zhang: 400 dollars ... I lent him 50 dollars, you remember? 

Appellant: You lend him 50 dollars? 

Zhang: NO, not today, it was on Sat. ... yes, the day before yesterday. 

Appellant: Where is the money? 

Zhang: Didn't he pay you back? 750 dollars ... no, 725 dollars when you were talking in your room, you remember? ... oh, ... it was on Fri. then. The 750 dollars ... 725 dollars ... when you were in .......... 

Appellant: What a nonsense you are talking! I put 400 dollars there on Sat. his birthday. I put it in a good order ... the 50 dollars you took has nothing to do with it at all! I was on ... Sat ... was the birthday on Sat.? 

Zhang: NO, it was on Fri. ... 

Appellant: On the day of the party, before you guys came in the evening, I put 400 dollars there, I had counted. 

Zhang: I talk to you when I come back. 

Appellant: Talk about it when you come back ..."" 

57Of this call, the appellant gave the following explanation: 

""After we finish the account of $300 on the last occasion, I add another $100 which made the amount to $400 because the mortgage payment and also the other bills like water charge and the electricity bills were to be paid on the 10 th . Then I said if you have got some time, just ask your mother also to take some money to pay the bills. I became aware on the night of the 6 th that some money was once again missing from the $400. That guy, well because his mother never gave him any money, and when he was a young boy I just spoil him. I gave him whatever he asked for and I was pretty relaxing to him because he become successfully involved in a law course in the university. But when I became aware that some money was missing, I have to go through the amount with him and by asking him when the money had gone, and he said the money had been lent to that person, or that person. Sometimes when he got money, he just brought some of his mates and had drinks in the room, because I had already moved out and his mother never mind his business."" 

58Call 6 was the conversation which I have extracted above, concerning the use of a mobile telephone, in which the appellant had expressed anger that Zhang had allowed another person access to the telephone. Of this, the appellant said: 

""After I separated from my ex-girlfriend in 2003 her son still listened to what I said and I was able to control him. His mother namely my ex-girlfriend would keep making phone calls once she knew our phone number. Also her problem was that once she ring you, you can't just hang up otherwise she would become suicidal. Sometimes in order to avoid accidents from happening I had to listen to what she had to say. For instance when I was on the way to Canberra in 2003 after our separation she made a phone call to me and as a result I ran over a kangaroo and I nearly lost my own life. That's why I didn't let her know my phone number. 

I am such a person who likes new model of mobile phones. When the new model comes onto the market I would purchase one, and as a result I end up having different phone numbers because I need to make monthly payment for each individual phone. Because I notice that she made a lot of phone calls, therefore I gave her one of the phone numbers which was 0404 058 883. Then I give - actually I should say that I give the phone number to my stepson, not the woman. 

Just a few days after I gave that number to my stepson his mother found out that number. On that day she asked a solicitor to ring me. What happened at the time was that according to the asset settlement part of the house goes to mortgage repayment, the other half should be distributed equally between the two of us. But she just took the excuse of having to support her son, she demanded a 75% of the share ... My solicitor explained to her on numerous occasions that that was son was not the product of the lady - the relationship between the lady and myself. She then became very unreasonable by saying that her son had called me Daddy for more than ten years. That was why she was demanding 75 percent, that was why she kept ringing me and arguing with me. When I realised that she knew that number I just blamed her son why he never remembered what I said."" 

59The explanations for the remaining telephone conversations were in similar vein and, except for that numbered 30, do not need to be outlined. 

60Call number 30, it will be recalled, was the conversation in which the appellant was recorded as saying that ""they"" are ""very fragmented ... all in half pieces, very crushed [broken]"". 

61His explanation for call 26 was: 

""I was in the business of trading in coins, which is somehow different from other businesses. Usually when I said can you lend me $2000 or $1000 I was referring to the Australian dollar requirements of this $2000 or $1000 coins. Because the value of these coins all depends to the different years, and the different countries that make them. So usually the value of these coins are higher than the original values of these coins, and they never the equivalent, I mean at the same value when they were coins. Sometimes even the equivalent $1000 Australian dollars, which really means a lot because they - all the differences in the years, and in their original value, that were all different ... 

So in my telephone call to my friend, I ask him to bring the coin that's worth $2000 Australian dollars equivalent for then for me to have a look at first. 

So I just tried to make a selection of all these coins that he brought to me and if anything that I don't like or I feel that's useless i just simply return to him and pick up the useful ones I like. Also in this call my friend ask me to give back to him for the two previous occasions when he brought some of these coins for me to select, and some ones that I don't want and want to return to him."" (AB 607-608) 

62The appellant's explanation for call 30 was as follows: 

""So that just refer to my asking my friends to bring about the coins, equivalent of $AU2,000, and after he bought these coins to me and then I check then I find that this money for these coins were not a complete set, sometimes they just miss some coins not being a complete set. Also I told my friend that there is nine different variety were missing, nine different type of coins were missing. Can I just request for the two bags of small coins and I want to show it to the jury ... So yes, that's correct, because when my friends brought to me all these bags of coins and I check and I found some of these bags' seals become loosened, and as a result almost half of these coins contained in the bag were missing. Because at the time when I ordered for 50 of these bags and they supposed to be 39 kilos, because each bag of them have a fixed weight. Then I weighed all of these bags and they add up all together 30.5 kilos instead of 39 kilos ... I weighed them at the time and I found that they altogether weighed 30.5 kilos instead of 39 kilos. I found that there is a shortage of about 8.5 kilos, and for each one cent coin should weigh about 2.6 kilogram, milligram, yeah 2.6 milligram - gram, sorry, grams, 2.6 grams. For the two cent coin they should weigh about 5.2 grams. I ask my friend to deliver me about 100 one cent coins and 100 two cent coins, and I know that the supposed weight for a bag is 780 grams. So for a 8.5 of these bags is roughly about 11 of these bags. Because also I remember that last time, on the last delivery and there is a shortage of roughly about 10 bags of - shortage of 10 bags when I ordered about 21 or 22 bags, and I also ring my friend about this. So to my query my friend told me just wait on the next time when he come and he collect whatever I don't want and then he will settle this with me. That's it, sir."" (AB 610) 

The appellant was cross-examined at some length about this evidence. He identified the ""unknown male"", the other party to the conversation, as ""James"", a friend and also a coin collector (AB 655). ""James"" was also the ""unknown male"" who was party to the conversation in calls 26, 27, 28 and 29. The appellant maintained that both conversations recorded in calls 26 and 30 related to the purchase by him of Australian coins from James. He said that when he received the coins on 26 June, he expected coins to the value of $2000 Australian, but received coins to the value of only $1100. His complaint to James that ""they are fragmented, all in half pieces, very broken"" was a complaint that when the bags of coins arrived they were not a complete set, and that one bag had lost half of its contents because the seal was broken (AB 669). 

63When asked about the reference to ""fragmented"" he said that he thought that the translation was wrong something he repeated from time to time. 

64The appellant was then asked if knew Ms Tui. He said that he did, but only because he knew her husband, Mr He, and that he could not really communicate with her because his English was limited (but he agreed that they had lived in the same apartment). He denied that he supplied her with ecstasy and denied that he paid the rent on the apartment; he denied asking Ms Tui to purchase mobile telephones for himself. 

65The appellant also said that he knew Zou, again through Mr He. 

The grounds of appeal 

66The appellant pleaded the following grounds of appeal against conviction: 

""1. The trial judge erred in admitting opinion evidence from Det Zimmer; 

2. (Abandoned) 

3. The trial judge erred in allowing evidence to be given by Ms Tui; 

4. (Abandoned) 

5. The trial judge erred in allowing evidence of conversations which occurred subsequent to the last date of the charge period in the indictment and which did not involve the appellant; 

6. The trial judge erred in directing the jury as to the use that could be made of the evidence of Ms Tui and the evidence of conversations to which the appellant was not a party and which occurred after the period of charges alleged against the appellant; 

7. In relation to count 2, the evidence did not establish that the quantity of drug was in excess of the large commercial quantity for [ecstasy]; 

8. The trial in relation to count 3 miscarried because: 

(a) evidence available to the appellant was not tendered in his case; and 

(b) evidence of witnesses called by the Crown was not challenged on the basis of that evidence; 

9. The trial judge erred in allowing count 3 to go to the jury; 

10. The verdicts on each of the three counts were unreasonable."" 

67Somewhat puzzlingly, counsel who appeared for the appellant said that ground 9 was not relied upon in the conviction appeal, but was relied on in support of the sentence appeal. Counsel was given leave to reformulate the ground. The reformulation became ground 5 of the application for leave to appeal against sentence. 

Ground 1: opinion evidence - Detective Zimmer 

68Part 3.3 of the Evidence Act 1995 regulates the admissibility of opinion evidence. By s 76 (subject to a presently immaterial exception) evidence of an opinion is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed. 

69Provision is made for further exceptions in s 77, s 78 and s 79. It is s 79 (later re-numbered as sub-s (1)) that is presently relevant. That section provides: 

""If a person has specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study or experience, the opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge."" 

70The objection that was taken at trial to the admission of Detective Zimmer's opinion evidence was based upon a challenge to his expertise. The transcript of the argument (AB 381.2) reveals that the challenge itself depended upon a misconception as to the nature of the expertise upon which the Crown relied. Senior counsel repeatedly referred to the concept of ""ad hoc expert"". That term (it seems) derives from R v Menzies [1982] 1 NZLR 40. The notion of an ad hoc expert is examined and explained in R v Leung [1999] NSWCCA 287; 47 NSWLR 405. See also R v Tang [2006] NSWCCA 167; 65 NSWLR 681; Butera v Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) [1987] HCA 58; 164 CLR 180; Li v The Queen [2003] NSWCCA 290; 139 A Crim R 281. An ""ad hoc expert"" may best be described as a person who has acquired expertise in a narrow subject matter that would not ordinarily call for or warrant or be susceptible to specialised training, study or experience. A common example, as in Leung , is voice identification, where expertise may be acquired by repeatedly listening to tape recordings of conversations such as are here in question. 

71However, Detective Zimmer was not advanced as an ""ad hoc expert"". He was put forward by the Crown as a witness who, within the meaning of s 79, had specialised knowledge based upon his training, study and experience. His evidence supported that claim. 

72Hulme DCJ disallowed the objection and admitted the evidence. In a short judgment delivered on 18 March (before empanelling the jury) he noted the evidence contained in Detective Zimmer's statement concerning his experience in the investigation of the criminal drug milieu, and declared himself satisfied that Detective Zimmer had the requisite specialised knowledge and was therefore able to give expert evidence. That conclusion is not now challenged. 

73His Honour was conscious, however, of limitations that apply to the manner in which such evidence may be given. These are illustrated in the decisions in Keller v R [2006] NSWCCA 204 and Nguyen v R [2007] NSWCCA 249; 173 A Crim R 557, in both of which the circumstances were similar to those here under consideration. In Keller , a police officer, qualified as an expert, gave evidence as to his opinion of the meaning of the words actually used by the subjects of the recordings. He said that certain words were references to drugs. In one answer, he rejected a proposition that the words might mean something else. 

74In Keller , Studdert J identified three separate flaws in the manner in which the expert evidence was given. The first was that the witness gave evidence of his opinion that the person recorded was in fact talking about drugs (as distinct from an opinion that the language used could have been , or was consistent with, the language of drug dealing: see R v David and Gugea (NSWCCA, 10 October 1995, unreported) at p 8; for a contrary approach, see R v Van Thanh Huynh (NSWCCA, 13 May 1996, unreported). Hulme DCJ was conscious of this, and ensured that Detective Zimmer's evidence avoided that pitfall. His evidence was directed to the consistency of the language used with the language used by those involved in drug trading. 

75The second flaw in Keller was that the evidence did not meet the requirements of expert evidence as spelled out in Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305; 52 NSWLR 705 in that it did not sufficiently identify the basis for the opinion. That does not here arise. 

76The third flaw in Keller was exposed in some answers given by the expert witness in cross-examination. In respect of some statements attributed to Keller's co-accused, the following questions were asked and answers given: 

""Q. You can't say that simply by reading that, someone saying he's going to meet someone at 9 o'clock in the morning that that relates to drugs can you? 
A. I placed this telephone conversation in the total context of which it was involved. 

Q. What was the total context ... that you're talking about, what are the contextual matters that you rely on reaching that conclusion? 
A. The fact that [the co-accused] was arrested with half a kilo of cocaine the following day. 

Q. You just reasoned backwards. He's got the drugs on him so therefore he must be talking about drugs, is that your process? 
A. It's consistent with the outcome. 

Q. But that's your process of reasoning is it? 
A. In this particular matter? 

A. Yes? 
A. Yes."" 

77In other words, the witness gave opinion evidence that the interpretation he placed on the words used and asserted to be in code was not wholly based upon his expertise in the argot of drug dealing, but was based on a process of deduction from subsequently established facts - the arrest of the co-accused in possession of cocaine the following day. His opinion was influenced, or clouded, by his knowledge of extrinsic facts. Studdert J considered that it had not been shown that the opinions expressed by the witness were wholly or substantially based upon his specialised knowledge (but were, at least in part, based upon his knowledge of the subsequent arrest). He added that, even if the evidence were admissible, it ought to have been excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act because its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. That, it seems, was for the same reason - that the witness had formed his opinion in part by the process of deduction following the discovery of the cocaine in the possession of the co-accused the following day. That meant that the opinion of the expert was not based upon his particular expertise, as required by s 79. 

78In Nguyen v R [2007] NSWCCA 249; 173 A Crim R 557 at [32]-[35] a police officer gave evidence framed similarly: that is, that the words used in fact referred to drugs. But the court concluded that he could only have formed that opinion if he had been influenced by other known facts. Indeed, in that case, the Crown conceded that it had become evident at trial that the police officer had: 

""... inappropriately allowed other information he had received to form part of the basis for his opinions."" ([35]) 

79Counsel for the appellant relied upon this as the basis for his present challenge to the evidence of Detective Zimmer. It was not the basis for the challenge at trial. 

80Underlying the present challenge to the admission of Detective Zimmer's evidence is an assumption of fact that is unsupported by the evidence. That assumption is that Detective Zimmer allowed extrinsic facts to colour the interpretation he placed upon the words used in the conversations. That that occurred in Keller was established by the evidence I have extracted above; in Nguyen it was inferred from the manner in which the witness framed his evidence - he gave evidence that the participants in the conversations were in fact referring to drugs, rather than that the words used were consistent with references to drugs - and from the Crown concession. The court concluded that he had allowed other information to intrude upon his assessment. 

81No such inference is available or ought to be drawn in the present case. The assumption was based solely upon Detective Zimmer's position as officer-in-charge of the investigation. It was argued that he could not, for the purpose of giving his opinion evidence, have disassociated himself from what he otherwise knew of the case. As a matter of fact, that may or may not have been correct. But it has no foundation in the evidence. There was no cross-examination of Detective Zimmer, either on a voir dire , or in the trial, to suggest that he relied upon information other than that outlined in his description of his qualifications and expertise to form the opinions that the language used by the appellant and those to whom he spoke on the telephone was consistent with drug dealing. He gave a full explanation for his opinion that the references to money were consistent with references to drugs. He was scrupulous to ensure that his evidence was framed in terms of consistency. 

82I would reject this ground of appeal. 

Grounds 3 and 6: the evidence of Ms Tui 

83Although ground 3 of the appeal is framed only in terms of the admission of the evidence, the submissions also incorporated part of the complaint made in ground 6 and challenged the directions that were given. 

84The evidence of Ms Tui may be summarised as follows: 


after Ms Tui and her husband Mr He moved into unit 197 with the appellant, she observed ecstasy tablets, sometimes in thousands, loose on a coffee table; 

the appellant supplied Ms Tui with ecstasy tablets for her own use; 

the appellant supplied Ms Tui with ecstasy tablets for sale on his behalf; 

Ms Tui observed a large amount of money on the coffee table, adjacent to ecstasy tablets, in front of the appellant; 

the appellant asked Ms Tui to register a mobile telephone for him in a fictitious name; 

the appellant on some occasions asked Ms Tui, or her husband Mr He, to buy mobile telephones on his behalf; 

the appellant urged Ms Tui to replace her existing mobile telephone, fearing that it might have been intercepted; 

the appellant told Ms Tui not to call him on the telephone, or mention ""pills"" on the telephone, but rather to see him in person; 

the appellant told Ms Tui to use coded language (something to eat) instead of referring to ""pills"". 

85It is important to note that none of the three counts of supply alleged against the appellant involved supply to Ms Tui. I have explained in [7] above the manner in which the Crown put its case in respect of each count. 

86Objection was taken at trial to the admission of Ms Tui's evidence. In a judgment dated 27 March 2008, Hulme DCJ determined that her evidence would be admitted. From the judgment, it appears that the objection was based upon: 

(i)asserted irrelevance of Ms Tui's evidence to any of the specific counts on the indictment; 

(ii)an assertion that the evidence had ""no probative value"", and was ""highly prejudicial"" (presumably an invitation to his Honour to exercise the power conferred by s 137 of the Evidence Act ); 

(iii)an assertion that Ms Tui's evidence, properly understood, was tendency or coincidence evidence within the meaning of s 97 and s 98 of the Evidence Act , and that it was inadmissible because no notice, as required by those sections, had been given. 

87The Crown denied that the evidence was tendered as either evidence of tendency or coincidence. The transcript records that the Crown prosecutor at trial identified the purpose of Ms Tui's evidence as being: 

""... to prove that the accused was jointly involved in an ongoing business of a drug supplier as we suggest the telephone intercepts relate and also that they relate to ecstasy ... 

We say that Tui's evidence is so closely linked to the acts that are charged and it's within the same timeframe as the indictment which is between the end of May and the end of June when the accused was living in the same premises as her, the same drug ecstasy is alleged and I thinks (sic) he (sic) indicates that some of those had dove logos on them. 

Some of the charges in the indictment relate to agreements to supply and some of them relate to deem supply having [in] possession to supply and we say that the probative value of this evidence clearly outweighs any prejudice. The very issues that the jury have got to determine as to the meaning of the telephone intercepts, whether they're coded and whether they actually refer to drugs and what that drug was. We say that this is a purpose other than a tendency purpose so they're not governed by the tendency provisions and any prejudice would not be unfair and your Honour could give an appropriate direction ..."" (AB 413) 

88It is clear from the transcript that, at the time of the argument, his Honour had access to a statement of Ms Tui, as well as written submissions made on behalf of the appellant. Neither of these is before this Court. Some of the evidence in the statement referred to in his Honour's judgment was not, in fact, elicited from Ms Tui in the trial. 

89In his judgment, Hulme DCJ referred to the contents of the statement, and then noted the submissions put against its admission on behalf of the appellant. He noted a submission on behalf of the appellant as follows: 

""It was also submitted that the jury could reason that because the accused was susceptible to being involved in a joint enterprise to supply drugs with [Ms Tui] they could more readily conclude that he was so involved with Zhang; that they could therefore accept the intercepted telephone conversations concerned drug supply activity rather than some innocuous activity; and following these lines of reasoning the jury would more readily find the accused guilty."" 

He then recorded the submissions of both parties concerning tendency and coincidence evidence, including the Crown submission that I have extracted above. 

90Although his Honour did not expressly rule upon the submissions, it is plain that he accepted the Crown submission that the evidence was not tendered as tendency (or coincidence) evidence. He said: 

""In my view if the Crown sought to rely upon this evidence to support reasoning by the jury that because the accused was involved in drug dealing as described by Ms Tui, therefore it is more likely that he was involved in drug dealing in the manner alleged in respect of each, or any, of the counts in the indictment, then the evidence would not be admissible. That would involve tendency reasoning."" 

91He then said that there was no need to consider the probative value of the evidence, because no notice, as required by s 97, had been given, and for that reason alone the evidence would have been inadmissible. He said: 

""It seems to me that the evidence of Ms Tui that has the most probative value is that which has the effect of establishing that in about the period covered by the charges in the indictment the accused was in possession of large quantities of [ecstasy], large quantities of money, and that he adopted the practice in relation to mobile phones that could be seen to be designed to frustrate investigations by law enforcement authorities. One aspect of the matter that is particularly significant is his instruction to her not to speak of drug supply activity on the phone but that if she must do so that she should adopt a code. 

The fact that the accused engaged in drug supply activity with Ms Tui or with her husband on its own is of less significance ... It seems to me that this aspect of her evidence does have probative value in explaining the basis upon which Ms Tui knew those things about the accused, particularly his instruction to her as to how to conduct himself in speaking on the telephone about drug supply activity."" 

Later, he said: 

""I acknowledge that there is a possibility that the jury might engage in a form of tendency reasoning in relation to some of this evidence and so it will be necessary to give appropriate directions as to the permissible and impermissible uses that can be made of it. I am satisfied that this is a situation in which appropriate directions will avoid a use being made of the evidence by the jury that would involve unfair prejudice for the accused."" 

92He then held that the evidence was relevant and had ""quite important probative value"" which was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Accordingly, he admitted Ms Tui's evidence (excluding some which does not call for present consideration). 

93As he had indicated that he would, Hulme DCJ gave the jury a direction about the ""limits"" on the relevance of Ms Tui's evidence, recorded as follows: 

""None of it directly ties in with any of the charges the Crown has brought against the accused. You must not reason that because her evidence shows that the accused was involved in drug supply activity, therefore he must have committed the offences alleged in the three counts in the indictment. That would be completely impermissible . 

The relevance of her evidence is limited to this. The Crown case is that the accused was speaking in code in the various telephone conversations. The Crown says that he was in fact speaking about the supply of ecstasy. Ms Tui's evidence, if you accept it, goes to show that the accused was, in and around the relevant period of time, involved with ecstasy. So it is something you can take into account in considering whether the accused was in fact speaking about drugs and not the innocent subjects he claims, in intercepted telephone conversations. 

Also, her evidence about the accused acquiring mobile phones in false names and instructing her to speak on the phone when speaking - speak in code when speaking on the phone about drugs is relevant for the same purpose. I repeat, that is the relevance of her evidence. You must not reason that because her evidence demonstrates the accused was involved in drug supply activity therefore he must be guilty of the offences alleged by the Crown. 

Another part of the evidence of Ms Tui is that when she was arrested on 23 August 2005 she was found to be in possession of 245 ecstasy tablets. She said these came from the accused. If you accept that evidence it may be added to the evidence that the drug the accused was involved in was in fact ecstasy and not some other drug or substance. On its own it does [not] prove that in relation to the three specific charges the accused faces the drug involved was ecstasy. It is entirely a matter for you, but it is open to you to reason that if Ms Tui had ecstasy tablets on 23 August 2005 that she said came from the accused then that is something that would indicate the nature of the drug the accused was dealing with in relation to the three charges that he faces, that is that the drug involved was ecstasy and not some other drug."" (bold added) 

94The basis of this ground of appeal is the contention that, properly characterised, the evidence of Ms Tui was tendency evidence, and therefore subject to the restrictions on admissibility and use provided in s 97 and s 101 of the Evidence Act , and that Hulme DCJ was in error in accepting that it (or any significant part of it) was not tendency evidence. If that is correct, then there is a strong argument that it was wrongly admitted - not because its character as tendency evidence would render it necessarily inadmissible, but because the scrutiny that the Evidence Act requires to be applied to tendency evidence (especially, by reason of s 101, that tendered by the Crown) was not applied, and nor were the prescribed tests: see R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 358; 156 A Crim R 308 at [33]. 

95The submissions put on behalf of the appellant (and the Crown) in this Court tended to treat the evidence of Ms Tui globally, that is, as though it were all tendency evidence, or none of it was tendency evidence. That is not necessarily the case. 

Was Ms Tui's evidence tendency evidence? 

96""Tendency evidence"" is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as: 

""... evidence of a kind referred to in section 97(1) that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose referred to in that subsection."" 

Section 97(1) provides: 

"" 97 The tendency rule 
(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless: 
(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and 
(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value."" 

Tendency evidence is no more and no less than evidence that is tendered to prove that a person has or had a tendency to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind. The purpose of proving that a person had a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind is to provide the foundation for an inference. The inference sought to be drawn is that, on an occasion relevant to the proceedings, the person to whom it relates acted in a particular way, or had a particular state of mind. That is a fact in issue, or a fact relevant to a fact in issue. The foundation for the inference is the tendency evidence - that that person had a tendency to act in that (or in a closely related) way, or to have that state of mind. That the person had that tendency may (the appropriate tests having been met) be proved by proof of that person's: 


character; 

reputation; 

conduct; or 

a tendency that that person has or had. 

Tendency evidence is, therefore, a species of circumstantial evidence. 

97The definition gives primacy to the purpose for which evidence is tendered ( R v Quach [2002] NSWCCA 519; 137 A Crim R 345 at [32]). That purpose is not necessarily to be identified solely by reference to the characterisation placed upon it by the tendering party: R v RWC [2010] NSWCCA 332 at [129]-[130]. The evidence must be carefully analysed in order to ascertain what is sought to be achieved by its admission. If, properly characterised, the evidence is tendered to provide the foundation for an inference of the kind i have referred to above, then the evidence is tendency evidence. 

98Not infrequently, evidence that is tendered for a purpose other than to provide the foundation for such an inference may, nevertheless, have that capacity. The drafters of the Evidence Act were aware of that, and in s 95, made specific provision for it. By that section (relevantly) evidence that is not admissible to prove tendency must not be used for that purpose, even if it is relevant for another purpose. In that case, it will be the responsibility of the trial judge to direct the jury as to what use may, and what use may not, be made of the evidence. 

99It is only if the evidence comes within the definition that the specific provisions (s 97 and s 101 of the Evidence Act ) concerned with the admission and use of tendency evidence come into effect. Those specific provisions are: 

(i)the evidence is not admissible unless: 


(a)written notice of the Crown's intention to adduce the evidence has been given (s 97(1)(a); and 


(b)the court assesses the evidence (in the context of the evidence in the trial) as having significant probative value (s 97(1)(b)); 

(ii)(in a criminal case) the evidence can not be used against an accused unless its probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused (s 101(2)). 

100The only evidence of Ms Tui that could properly be characterised as tendency evidence was her evidence that the appellant had, on occasions, supplied her with ecstasy tablets, both for her own use and for supply to others. 

101In my opinion, the above analysis could readily accommodate that evidence of Ms Tui. Unless otherwise directed the jury might well have reasoned (assuming that they accepted Ms Tui's evidence) that, because the appellant had supplied Ms Tui with ecstasy on other occasions, then it was more likely that he had committed one or more of the offences charged in the indictment. Taken in isolation, the first paragraph of the Crown's submission, recorded at para [87] above, could suggest that the purpose of the tender of the evidence was to provide the foundation (the foundation being that the appellant was a drug dealer) for the inference that, on each of the occasions giving rise to the individual charges, he was dealing in drugs. But to take that in isolation would be to ignore the reality of the circumstances of the trial. An important consideration was the apparently innocuous nature of the telephone conversations - innocuous unless explained by other relevant evidence. 

102Hulme DCJ was well aware of the potential for tendency reasoning, and gave the directions I have extracted above. Those directions were in accord with the requirements of s 95. 

103The question that arises is whether there was any other legitimate reason for the admission of that part of Ms Tui's evidence. One thing is clear: it did not go directly to prove any of the counts on the indictment, none of which alleged supply to Ms Tui, even by reference to the extended definition. 

104It worth noting that the Crown case was largely, if not entirely, circumstantial. Notwithstanding that the allegedly incriminating conversations were recorded, there was no direct evidence against the appellant. That was because, in none of the conversations, was there any explicit reference to drugs (generically) or to ecstasy (specifically). One of the important circumstances constituting the Crown case was the expert evidence of Detective Zimmer concerning the nature of the language commonly used by drug criminals. But, it will be recalled, Detective Zimmer could not give evidence that, in his opinion, the references were, in fact, to drugs, or to ecstasy; he could only give evidence that the language was consistent with references to drugs and specifically to ecstasy. That the conversations did in fact relate to drugs, and that the drug was ecstasy, was made significantly more likely by the fact that the appellant had, independently of the charges, an association with ecstasy, and with other indicia of drug dealing. 

105Other relevant circumstances in allegations of drug dealing are the possession of large sums of money; covert behaviour, including the use of multiple mobile telephones, and caution in the use of the telephones and use of coded language. These all featured in the evidence of Ms Tui and was admissible, even in the absence of her evidence about the appellant's access to ecstasy, as part of the relevant circumstances. None of it, in my opinion, is properly characterised as tendency evidence. Not without significance is her evidence that some of the ecstasy tablets in the apartment were marked with a dolphin logo. That linked with a telephone call (call numbered 36) of 5 August, where an unidentified female, in a communication with Zhang, mentioned ""Dolphins"". (The appellant was not a party to that call.) 

106The question then arises whether the evidence that the appellant had supplied Ms Tui with ecstasy, both for her own use, and for supply to others, was tendency evidence. Certainly, it could be so seen, and (in the absence of appropriate directions) could have been so used. But it had another legitimate purpose. It cast further light upon the content of the appellant's telephone conversations. If the jury accepted Detective Zimmer's evidence that the references to money were consistent with references to quantities of ecstasy tablets, then Ms Tui's evidence that the appellant had access to, and dealt in, ecstasy tablets, added considerable weight to the inferences to be drawn from the conversations. It also had the capacity to strengthen Detective Zimmer's evidence. 

107The purpose of the tender of the evidence was not to establish the foundation for an inference that, because the appellant had, on other occasions, dealt in ecstasy, then he did so on the occasions the subject of the charges. The evidence was therefore not tendency evidence, and neither s 97 nor s 107 affected its admissibility. Having regard to the capacity of the evidence to give rise to tendency reasoning, the operative legislative provision was s 95, which Hulme DCJ correctly applied. 

108I would reject this ground of appeal. 

Ground 5: evidence of communications post dating the alleged offences 

109This ground appears to relate to the conversations between Zhang and Zou (Exhibits P and Q) that took place after 26 June 2005, the date on which the third offence was alleged to have been committed, and the last of the range of dates of the second. On 22 July Zhang was directed to meet McPherson-Fenn, who was then found to be in possession of 6 ecstasy tablets. (Zhang's evidence was that McPherson-Fenn stood in for him in relation to an arranged meeting for the purpose of the delivery of 6 ecstasy tablets.) 

110Since the appellant was not involved in these conversations, they were admissible against him only if they were capable of throwing light on what the Crown alleged to be a joint criminal enterprise with Zhang. 

111Objection was taken to the admission of the evidence on the ground that it was not relevant, or, alternatively, that it ought to be excluded pursuant to either s 135 or s 137 of the Evidence Act . In concluding that the evidence was relevant, Hulme DCJ said: 

""The primary issue in the trial will be whether the accused was involved in a joint criminal enterprise with Zhang to supply [ecstasy], and in seeking to establish this, the Crown will be relying on telephone intercept material. 

It is anticipated that major issues in the trial will be whether the Crown is able to establish that the participants in the telephone conversations are in fact talking about drugs, and whether those drugs are, in fact, [ecstasy]. 

There is a body of evidence of telephone conversations involving the accused and Zhang within the period covered by the indictment. Largely it is a matter of inference, but if the inferences for which the Crown contends are drawn, then, in my view, this material provides reasonable evidence of the existence of a joint criminal enterprise between the accused and Zhang to supply drugs to others ... The impugned evidence relates to activity involving the accused co-participant in this enterprise, within a very short period of time after the period with which the charges in the indictment are concerned. 

It would, in my view, be open to the jury to conclude that it demonstrates a continuation by Zhang of the very same activity that he had been involved in with the accused within the indictment period, that is, the supply of drugs, and using coded references when speaking on the telephone about drugs. 

The evidence that tends to establish that it was ecstasy that Zhang supplied to the man, McPherson-Fenn, is capable of supporting the inference that this was the drug that Zhang was in the business of supplying and therefore, that this was the drug that was supplied by the joint enterprise of Zhang and the accused in the indictment period."" 

112There is, in my opinion, no error in this reasoning. The submissions made appeared to challenge the capacity of the evidence to give rise to the inferences Hulme DCJ considered available. It was pointed out that the appellant was not a party to any of the conversations, that there was no evidence to suggest that he knew either Zou (that is not strictly correct: see para [65] above) or McPherson-Fenn, and no evidence that he used the tuition code to refer to ecstasy. 

113That another construction might be put upon the conversations to which the appellant was not a party does not affect their admissibility. What they meant, and any weight to be attributed to the evidence, were matters for the jury. 

114The real complaint that was made, it appears to me, concerned the directions that were given to the jury. His Honour said: 

""It is only if you are satisfied that they [the appellant and Zhang] were involved in a joint criminal enterprise that you can look at what Mr Zhang did with his involvement with other people, other than the accused, as circumstances which support inferences that the enterprise was concerned with drug supply, that the drug concerned was ecstasy, and that they adopted the method of using code when speaking on the phone."" 

115In my opinion, this direction was correct. However, it was submitted that the direction had the consequence that the evidence had no evidentiary use. It was submitted: 

""If they jury concluded that the appellant and Zhang were in a joint criminal enterprise, which could only be a joint criminal enterprise to supply [ecstasy], as alleged by the Crown, then there is no need for the jury to refer to the challenged evidence. It has, therefore, little probative value and was highly prejudicial. As such, it should have been excluded pursuant to either ss 135 or 137 of the Evidence Act 1995."" 

116The very point Hulme DCJ made was that the evidence added support to the contention of the Crown, which it was necessary for the Crown to prove, that the joint criminal enterprise involved the supply of a specific drug, that is, ecstasy. Put together, the evidence of Zou concerning the arrangement he had made with Zhang, and the evidence of the arrest of McPherson-Fenn, shortly after having contact with Zhang, was capable of being very persuasive that the subject of the earlier conversations between the appellant and Zhang was the drug ecstasy. 

117Of course, it was open to counsel for the appellant to point to divergences, such as the coded language, to suggest that the jury would not draw the inferences proposed. Again, that does not make the evidence inadmissible. 

118I would reject this ground of appeal. 

Ground 7: did the evidence establish the supply of a large commercial quantity? 

119As mentioned above, the large commercial quantity of ecstasy is 500 grams. If it were correct that the evidence failed to establish agreements to supply 500 grams or more (but did establish agreements to supply 125 grams or more), then the appellant may have been convicted of the supply of a commercial quantity with a commensurately lower maximum sentence (imprisonment for 20 years). 

120It was the Crown case that in the 39 telephone calls making up Exhibits A and B, nine separate agreements to supply ecstasy were revealed, and that the quantities involved, by translating the dollar references to numbers of ecstasy tablets, amounted to 3320 tablets, or 830 grams. This was arrived at by analysis of the various transcripts. It may be assumed, from the fact that the jury returned verdicts of guilty, that the jury accepted that the references to dollars were reference to that quantity of ecstasy tablets. 

121This ground of appeal is based upon the proposition that, in at least some of those instances, it could not be established that a separate agreement was made. It is, therefore, necessary to examine the content of the various transcripts in which the Crown alleges an agreement to supply was made. 

Transaction one 

122Call 7 was a call made by Hokeo to the appellant on 10 June 2005 at 5.57pm. Hokeo asked: 

""Can I borrow $500 off you?"" 

The appellant asked what time; Hokeo said 7.30pm. They then arranged to meet ""at normal place ... Hurstville"". 

123Calls 8 and 9 were calls on the same day, at, respectively, 6.32pm and 8.21pm, but these did not reflect any further transactions. 

Transaction two 

124Call 10 was a telephone call made by Hokeo to the appellant the following day, 11 June, at 4.37pm. They arranged to meet at Hurstville in 20 minutes time. The appellant is recorded as saying: 

""... you want the 500?"" (bold added) 

Hokeo confirmed that that is correct. 

125On behalf of the appellant it was submitted that there was ""no clear evidence"" of an agreement to supply 500 tablets on 10 June, and further, that the conversation of 11 June could not be treated as an agreement for an additional 500 tablets. 

126I would reject the first proposition. In my opinion, the clear request to borrow $500 (that is, 500 tablets) together with the appellant's assent, and the arrangement to meet at 7.30pm, are clear evidence of a concluded agreement for that supply. 

127It is true that the conversations recorded in calls 8 and 9, later on 10 June, are open to the interpretation that the proposed meeting had been delayed; and that the reference in call 10 to "" the 500"" could be construed as a reference back to the arrangement made in call numbered 7. The difficulty with that proposition is that, although the appellant gave evidence, he did not give any evidence that the meeting (even if, as he claimed, it was related to money) had not taken place on 10 June. In those circumstances it was open to the jury to conclude that the arrangement made on 11 June was a separate agreement for supply of an additional 500 tablets. 

Transaction three 

128This transaction was recorded in a conversation between the appellant and Zhang on 11 June at 6.22pm. Zhang told the appellant he needed some money now, but could not find it, and said that $100 would do. The appellant said: 

""Nothing left, didn't I let you take all of it yesterday? You squander money."" 

To which Zhang replied: 

""There should be $100 left, I didn't spend it."" 

129The appellant then told Zhang: 

""If you need it, come and get it at Hurstville."" 

130I am satisfied that this conversation was capable of establishing that the appellant agreed to supply Zhang with 100 ecstasy tablets. 

Transaction four 

131This transaction was established in call 12, which took place between ""Sam"" and the appellant on 17 June at 6.19pm. Sam asked the appellant if he could borrow $220; the appellant asked where he was and said he would be home in about 10 minutes, and told Sam to come to his home. 

132This conversation, in my opinion, is clearly capable of reflecting an agreement on the part of the appellant to supply Sam with 220 ecstasy tablets. 

Transaction five 

133On 17 June at 7.14pm Hokeo telephoned the appellant. He said: 

""I need to borrow $600 now, not 500. It's $600."" 

134The appellant suggested ""tomorrow""; Hokeo replied ""today"", and confirmed the amount of ""$600"". He said: 

""Yeah. You know how I told you before 500 - it's not 500, it's 600 now."" 

135On behalf of the appellant it was submitted that this call represented a substitution of an agreement to supply 600 tablets for a previous agreement to supply 500 tablets. The passages extracted are certainly capable of that construction. But that does not mean that the agreement to supply 500 tablets is represented in any of the previous conversations. This call took place on 17 June; the most recent reference to an agreement to supply 500 tablets was on 11 June. Given the urgency with which Hokeo treated the arrangement, it is unlikely that his request for 600 tablets was a substitute for the 11 June arrangement; it is far more likely that it is a substitute for an arrangement that had not been recorded. 

Transaction six 

136This transaction was recorded in a telephone call of 18 June at 6.50pm between the appellant and Zhang. Zhang told the appellant that another person wanted to borrow $100, but he did not have enough money left; the appellant asked: 

""Didn't I have $140 here yesterday?"" 

To which Zhang replied that he had ""spent all of them today"". The appellant told him to come to Hurstville and they agreed that Zhang would do so in about 15 or 20 minutes. 

137Call 16 was a telephone call on the same day, at 8.39pm, in which reference was again made to $100 which, the appellant said, Zhang owed him. As I understand it, the Crown does not reply upon call 16 as constituting a fresh transaction, and the complaints of the appellant in this respect are unfounded. 

Transaction seven 

138Transaction seven, it seems to me, is recorded in three telephone calls of 22 June, calls numbered 17, 18 and 19 at, respectively, 5.36pm, 5.41pm and 5.44pm. 

139Hokeo asked the appellant if he could borrow $500; the appellant replied ""maybe 300"" to which Hokeo replied that he would call back. He did so five minutes later, asking to borrow $300 and to meet the appellant at Zhang's home. The appellant replied that Zhang may have ""two, 200""; Hokeo said ""another 100 in Hurstville"". 

140In call 19, the appellant and Hokeo agreed to meet at Hurstville in one hour and asked the appellant what time he was going to Zhang's to take ""the 200"". 

141It was correctly submitted that the first call did not establish an agreement to supply, because the appellant said only ""maybe 300""; it was further submitted that the subsequent conversations established no more than an agreement to supply 100 tablets. 

142I do not accept the latter proposition. In the second call, Hokeo asked ""can I borrow $300?"". The appellant replied ""Yeah"". There was then discussion about meeting places, and whether Zhang would have some supplies. 

143In this call, Hokeo said: 

""Yeah, you going to call [Zhang] home get his two, 200. Another 100 in Hurstville."" 

The appellant said: 

""Oh, I see. Okay, um --"" 

144I am satisfied that these conversations together were capable of establishing an agreement to supply 300 ecstasy tablets. 

Transaction eight 

145The telephone calls establishing this transaction took place on 24 June at 7.09pm and 7.56pm between the appellant and Sam. Sam asked the appellant if he could borrow $500; the appellant asked when he needed it; Sam said in about one and a half hours. The appellant told him to ring in that time and Sam did so. He said: 

""Can I go to your home to get the $500?"" 

The appellant told him to come to Hurstville. There was then some discussion about travelling. 

146It was submitted that these calls do not constitute an agreement to supply (in any quantity). 

147I would reject that. These agreements are not to be construed in the manner that a formal contract might be. The tenor of the conversation, as recorded, discloses an agreement by the appellant to supply the quantity requested. 

Transaction nine 

148It was accepted that, in calls 22 to 25 inclusive, there were conversations ""open to the conclusion"" that there was an agreement to supply 500 ecstasy tablets. 

149The submissions put on behalf of the appellant, at times, included reference to evidence given by the appellant in cross-examination concerning the conversations about money. In my opinion, these are irrelevant to the present issue. The appellant attempted to put forward a case that the conversations were about money, and not about the supply of ecstasy. The jury were entitled to give that evidence no weight at all. In any event, what the calls were capable of establishing is not affected by dubious evidence given by the appellant. 

150I am satisfied that the evidence was capable of establishing agreement on the part of the appellant to supply 830 grams of ecstasy. 

151In my opinion this ground fails. 

Ground 8: evidence not tendered at trial 

152This ground has its origins in the translation evidence given by Ms Wang, particularly in relation to call number 30 (which relates to back to call number 26). 

153Ms Wang's evidence in chief outlined the preparation of her translations of the conversations constituting Exhibits A and B, and changes she progressively made to those translations. As the trial judge pointed out, the progression of her translations was of little relevance, given the unchallenged assertion that her final version represented her opinion as to what the appellant (and others) had said. In cross-examination it was put to her that she believed that the conversation in call number 30 was about money, a proposition to which she assented. 

154It is worth recalling that the ground is a complaint that evidence available to the appellant was not tendered in his case and that evidence of witnesses called by the Crown was not challenged on the basis of that evidence. It is, therefore, perfectly apparent, from the manner in which ground 8 is formulated, that the evidence the subject of this ground was available at trial, and is not fresh evidence that may be admissible on the principles stated in cases such as Green v The King [1939] HCA 4; 61 CLR 167; Ratten v The Queen [1974] HCA 35; 131 CLR 510; Lawless v The Queen [1979] HCA 49; 142 CLR 659; R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417; GAR v R (No 1) [2010] NSWCCA 163; Aouad and El-Zeyat v R [2011] NSWCCA 61. 

155It is a fair inference, also from the manner in which the ground is formulated, and confirmed by subsequent evidence, that the evidence in question was not called as the result of a deliberate, considered forensic decision by senior and junior counsel who represented the appellant at trial. 

156That being the case, the ground could ordinarily only be taken if it involved an assertion of incompetence to a high degree in the representation of the appellant, in particular in the decision not to call the evidence: R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677; R v Ignjatic (1993) 68 A Crim R 333; Clee v R [2009] NSWCCA 18; TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124. 

157Notwithstanding that, the ground is carefully formulated to avoid any such accusation and counsel shied away from making any such accusation. In the end he was driven to describe the decision not to call the evidence and not to use it as the foundation for cross-examination as an ""extraordinary lapse in relation to a central feature of the defence"" (Appeal transcript p 42). 

158For the purpose of dealing with this ground, it was necessary that the Court receive additional evidence. This consisted of two affidavits affirmed by the appellant, on, respectively, 30 November 2010 and 28 March 2011; affidavits sworn by senior and junior counsel who appeared for the appellant at trial, and Ms Selina Sadiq, the solicitor who represented the appellant at trial (the last three affidavits were filed by and on behalf of the Crown). A number of additional affidavits were filed, and constituted part of the material placed before the Court, but were not read and I have disregarded them. 

159On behalf of the Crown objection was taken to the admission of any evidence post dating the trial other than that concerning instructions given by the appellant to his legal representatives at trial. 

The evidence on appeal 

160The evidence in question concerns Ms Wang's translation of call 30. For convenience, I will set out the whole of the transcript of that conversation, as translated by Ms Wang (incorporating corrections made by her): 

""UM1 [identified by the appellant as ""James""]: Hello ... did you ring me? 

C [the appellant]: Yah ... listen ... who count the 2000 dollars? 

UM1: what money? 

C: Didn't you take 2000 dollars? who counted ...? 

UM1: I did. 

C: One of the issues ... they are very fragmented ... all in half pieces, very broken ... 

UM1: Oh ... 

C: 9 are short in total ... Now I ... (indecipherable) ... around ten plus ... 

UM1: Tell me how many short in total ...? 

C: Now after weighing the stuff is 11 ... Right? ... which means the whole ... whole pieces ... 11 whole pieces short ... Altogether ... might be 21 ... or 22 ... I have gathered all the broken ones ... 

UM1: Ok, now, you give all the broken ones back to me, put them Together, give them back to me, I will have them Exchanged ... 

C: Yah ... last time I ... 

UM1: Yah ... You put them together and give them back to me, I will have them exchanged with him 

C: Yah ... I put them together and leave it there ... 

UM1: Ah ... fine, fine. 

C: Ok. Fine ... 

CALL ENDED"" 

161In his affidavit affirmed on 30 November 2010 the appellant said that, prior to the commencement of the trial, his solicitor (Ms Sadiq) had arranged for two separate and independent accredited interpreters to make their own translations of that call. One was Ms Zhe Huang; the other was Mr Zhong Chen. Ms Huang's translation was as follows: 

""V1 [""James""]: Hello. Did you ring me? 

V2 [the appellant]: Yes. 

V1: Yes. 

V2: Listen. Who counted these money? 

V1: What money? 

V2: Didn't you bring 2000 dollars? Who counted them? 

V1: I did. 

V2: The first thing, they are very scattered . All were half packs full. All scattered around. There is 9 short in the total. They weight about over 10. 

V1: Tell me how many short? 

V2: They weighed 11 now. For complete packs, there are 11 short. There are 21 or 22 short in total. And I have had the scattered with me here. 

V1: You can give the scattered back to me. Keep them and give them back to me 

V2: Yes. I told you last time too. 

V1: Keep them and I can ask for an exchange from him/her. 

V2: I'm just letting you know. 

V1: Ok."" (bold added) 

162Mr Chen's translation was: 

""M1 [""James""]: Hello. 

M2 [the appellant]: Yes. 

M1: Did you ring me? 

M2: Yeah. Let me tell you ... 

M1: Yes. 

M2: Let me say ... 

M1: Yeah 

M2: Who did your money? 

M1: What kind of money? 

M2: You took $2000, didn't you? Who did it ... 

M1: This was me who did it. 

M2: Well, what segments they were! All were scattered . 

M1: Yeah 

M2: Nine were missing from among the total account. (Pause) Now I have weighed it and it is about ... 

M1: Short ... Tell me how much was short. 

M2: No ... the object ... what has now been left is eleven. Understand? (Pause) The whole whole whole package is short of eleven. 

M1: Yeah. 

M2: By adding them together, it probably comes to twenty. I am now ... the object ... the segmented object. 

M1: Now this way, you may wish to give me the segmented object. Put the segmented object together and give it me. 

M2: Yeah ... I shall swap with him/her ... 

M1: Put them together and give them to me and I shall swap with him/her ... 

M2: Yeah, I shall put them together ... 

M1: Good. 

M2: Good? 

M1: Good, good, good. Um, um."" 

163While there are a number of points of divergence among the three translations, that which is significant, for present purposes, is between the use of the words ""fragmented"" and ""broken"" by Ms Wang, and ""scattered"" by both Ms Huang and Mr Chen (and ""segmented"" by Mr Chen). 

164The significance of the variation is apparent, when regard is had to the appellant's explanations for calls 30 and 26 - that he was a coin collector and had received an incomplete set of coins. While it is possible to conceive of a ""scattered"" set of coins, it is not easy to conceive of ""broken"" coins. Indeed, that coins were not readily amenable to being spoken of as ""broken"" was part of Detective Zimmer's rationale for his view that the language of call 30 was consistent with a reference to drugs, and, in particular, to ecstasy. 

165Neither Ms Huang nor Mr Chen was called in the trial to give evidence of their competing translations. Nor were their competing translations put to Ms Wang in cross-examination. Her translation therefore effectively went by default. It may well be that the words ""broken"" and ""fragmented"" carried considerable weight in the minds of the jury. 

166An explanation for not calling the witnesses, and for not cross-examining Ms Wang was given by senior and junior counsel in their affidavits. Senior counsel said that, prior to Ms Wang giving her evidence, he and junior counsel conferred with her. At the time they did so, the appellant and Ms Sadiq were in the near vicinity. Senior counsel said that, while Ms Wang accepted that the word she had previously translated as ""crushed"" ought to be read as ""broken"", she adamantly adhered to her inclusion of the word ""fragmented"", as distinct from ""scattered"" proposed by Ms Huang and Mr Chen. She said that the language used in the call was Shanghainese, and that she herself was Shanghainese and was familiar that dialect. Importantly, senior counsel deposed: 

""11. Also, during the conference, Ms Wang demonstrated to us, in stating that she was sure that the words used meant 'fragmented', and not 'scattered', when she motioned by pointing to the nail on her little finger and saying 'very small piece like part of the top of a little finger'. She said that if she was asked questions in relation to this word and, if it was put to her that the words meant 'scattered', she would demonstrate with her hand, in the same manner, to explain to the jury what the word meant in English, namely 'fragmented'."" 

167Senior counsel said that he therefore formed the opinion that if Ms Wang were to give evidence to that effect, it would have been ""devastating"" to the appellant's case. 

168Senior counsel said that he and junior counsel then discussed with the appellant what Ms Wang had said in the conference. He said that the appellant gave him instructions not to challenge Ms Wang about the word ""fragmented"". A further complication, he said, was that he had been informed that Mr Chen was overseas and unavailable to give evidence. Junior counsel swore an affidavit to similar effect. 

169Senior counsel annexed to his affidavit a letter dated 12 June 2008 (the jury returned its verdict on 4 April 2008), in which he said: 

""Mr and Mrs Chen have been informed on numerous occasions why we did not cross-examine Mr Wang in relation to the issue they now raise. They were informed of those matters after [junior counsel] and I had a conference with Mr Wang and before she have her evidence. They were also informed of those matters after she gave her evidence and also subsequently. Not least of the matters was the fact that her evidence, for all relevant purposes, was the same or similar to the evidence that Mr Chen had proposed to be called if our witness had been available to give evidence in the trial. But, this proposed witness, as per my instructions, was not available to give evidence because he would have been overseas at the time he would have been called. But, in any case his evidence, in my opinion, would not have been of any material difference to the issues in the trial to that which was given by Ms Wang. 

Further, during these discussions with Mr and Mrs Chen we explained to them about a particular in the intercepted telephone calls that Ms Wang would have given evidence about. In her opinion a word used in the intercepted conversations of Mr Chen would have been translated to be a 'very small piece like part of the top of a little finger'. If this evidence had been given it would have been, in my opinion and in the opinion of [junior counsel], devastating to Mr Chen's case. After discussing this proposed evidence with Mr and Mrs Chen they agreed, particularly Mr Chen, at that time, with the way that we proposed to cross-examine Ms Wang."" 

170On 28 March 2011 the appellant affirmed a second affidavit to reply to the evidence of senior and junior counsel. He said that, before the trial, Ms Sadiq (who communicated with him in Mandarin) told him that neither Ms Huang nor Mr Chen would be called at the trial, because their statements would be given to the court. He said that he was never told that either of them was unavailable. He said that he was unaware of any conference between senior and junior counsel with Ms Wang (although senior counsel claimed he had been nearby). He denied giving instructions to counsel: 

""... to agree to Ms Wang's statement about 'crushed' or 'broken', and did not recall being told anything about fingernails"". 

He denied giving instructions to Ms Sadiq in Mandarin to accept Ms Wang's translation of ""crushed"" or ""broken"". In paragraph 8 of his affidavit he deposed: 

""I recall that sometime after Ms Wang had finished giving her evidence in my criminal trial, that I said to Ms Selina Sadiq words to the effect of 'you changed our evidence without telling me' and 'you are just using Ms Wang's translation. What is going on?' to which Ms Sadiq replied to the effect of 'It does not matter, Helen Wang is finished. 'Crushed' and 'broken' relate to money not to drugs'."" 

171Mr Sadiq also filed an affidavit, sworn on 29 March 2011. Relevantly, she said that had not been present during the conference between counsel and Ms Wang, and was not present when the appellant gave instructions not to challenge Ms Wang's interpretation; and that the appellant had always disputed the inaccuracy (sic) of translation for call 30 by Ms Wang. She said that she had no recollection of the conversation to which the appellant deposed in paragraph 8 of his second affidavit. 

172Given the conflict of evidence in the affidavits, oral evidence was given by the appellant (in Mandarin, through an interpreter), senior and junior counsel, and Ms Sadiq. 

173One peripheral area of conflict may here be noted. In his evidence in the appeal, the appellant was asked about his capacity to speak English. Through the interpreter, he said: 

""No. Even now I don't speak English."" 

174Both senior and junior counsel gave contrary evidence. Senior counsel said that he communicated with the appellant in English, and said: 

""Well, I think he had some knowledge of English. I remember his girlfriend had good knowledge of English and my instructing solicitor was fluent in Mandarin, and still is, but I communicated with him."" (p 9) 

175Junior counsel said: 

""[Senior counsel] was speaking in English. The appellant understood some English. There was also some conversation in Chinese."" 

He said that prior to the trial he had on occasions spoken to the appellant, and while he required the assistance of an interpreter for the court proceedings, he was able to conduct ""minimal"" conversation in English. 

176In the trial, the appellant had said: 

""I've already said that I really don't know what's the meaning of 'stuff', because my English is not very good and I don't understand."" (AB 659) 

177In oral evidence the appellant denied that he had ever been advised by Ms Sadiq of the proposal not to cross-examine Ms Wang about her translation of ""fragmented"" and ""broken"". Indeed, he said, when shown the translations of Ms Huang and Mr Chen Ms Sadiq said that she ""was very happy"" and said ""use these translations"". 

178Senior and junior counsel and Ms Sadiq were called by the Crown. Senior counsel maintained that he considered that cross-examination of Ms Wang suggesting that the word ""scattered"" ought to be substituted for ""fragmented"" or ""broken"" would have been ""devastating"" to the appellant's case. This was because of her intention to illustrate her point by reference to fragments of fingernails. He said that he gave advice (presumably to this effect) to the appellant in the presence of Ms Sadiq. (That was in contradiction of Ms Sadiq's affidavit evidence to which I have already referred.) 

179In one sense, the conflict of evidence concerning the instructions said to have been given to counsel is an irrelevance. In Birks , Gleeson CJ stated three relevant principles as follows: 

""1. A Court of Criminal Appeal has a power and a duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice, but what amounts to a miscarriage of justice is something that has to be considered in the light of the way in which the system of criminal justice operates. 

2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence. 

3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of 'flagrant incompetence' of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention."" 

It is principle 2 that is of present importance, although, of course, it must be read in the light of principles 1 and 3. 

180Earlier, the Chief Justice said: 

""In our system of criminal justice a trial of an accused person is conducted in the manner of a contest between the Crown and the accused, and that trial has many (although not all) of the features which attend civil litigation conducted in accordance with what is sometimes described as the adversary system of justice. To a large extent the parties to such proceedings are bound by the manner in which they conduct them. It is the parties who decide, for example, what information will be put before a tribunal of fact, and the tribunal bases its decision on that information. 

As a general rule, a party is bound by the conduct of his or her counsel, and counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are conducted. Decisions as to what witnesses to call, what questions to ask or not to ask, what lines of argument to pursue and what points to abandon, are all matters within the discretion of counsel and frequently involve difficult problems of judgment, including judgment as to tactics. The authorities concerning the rights and duties of counsel are replete with emphatic statements which stress both the independent role of the barrister and the binding consequences for the client of decisions taken by a barrister in the course of running a case."" 

His Honour then cited Rondel v Worsley [1969] 1 AC 191 as follows: 

""... [The advocate's] legal right is to conduct the cause without any regard to the wishes of his client, so long as his mandate is unrecalled, and what he does bona fide according to his own judgment will bind his client, and will not expose him to any action for what he has done, even if the client's interests are thereby prejudiced."" 

And Halsbury's Laws of England, 4 th edition, Vol 3(1) as follows: 

""... a barrister is ordinarily instructed on the implied understanding that he is to have complete control over the way in which the case is conducted. Unless and until his instructions are withdrawn, counsel has, with regard to all matters that properly relate to the conduct of the case, unlimited authority to do whatever he considers best for the interests of his client. This authority extends to all matters relating to the action, including the calling and cross-examination of witnesses, challenging a juror, deciding what points to take, choosing which of two inconsistent defences to put forward, and even to agreeing to a compromise of the action, or to a verdict, order or judgment."" 

181Gleeson CJ described these principles as: 

""... fundamental to the operation of the adversary system, and form part of the practical content of our notions of justice."" 

182It is apparent that, before incompetence of counsel, even if proved, will call for the intervention of an appellant court in a conviction, it must be shown that that incompetence resulted in a miscarriage of justice. 

183To the extent that it is necessary to resolve the conflict concerning the instructions counsel assert were given to them, for myself, I prefer the evidence of counsel. I do not accept the appellant's denials that he was advised, and gave instructions, as claimed by counsel. 

184Even if those instructions had not been given it was well within the mandate of counsel to make the judgment that they did concerning the potential consequences of cross-examination of Ms Wang. There is no basis for concluding that that judgment was wrong, let alone incompetent. 

185It follows naturally that the decision not to call the evidence of Ms Huang was also within their mandate. Indeed, if they proposed to call Ms Huang, it was essential, in accordance with the rules of a fair trial, that they put Ms Huang's proposed evidence to Ms Wang. 

186Moreover, for reasons given below, in relation to ground 10, I am satisfied that no miscarriage of justice was occasioned. I would reject this ground of appeal. 

Ground 10: unreasonable verdict 

187The entirety of the appellant's submissions on this ground were contained in a single paragraph of the written submissions, as follows: 

""43. The appellant submits that the above matters, individually and collectively, establish that the verdicts were unreasonable or unsupportable: Chow v R [2007] NSWCCA 225. As such, the verdicts should be quashed. In light of the time that the appellant has already spent in prison, it is submitted that ordering a retrial is not warranted. The appellant should be acquitted of the charges."" 

188The third sentence reflects a misunderstanding of the nature of the ground. The ground is drawn from s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, which provides: 

""The court on any appeal under section 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence ..."" 

and is ordinarily (and correctly) formulated as a ground that the verdict is unreasonable and/or cannot be supported on the evidence. 

189The logical consequence of a ruling of this Court upholding such a ground is that a verdict of acquittal is entered. It would only be in the most exceptional circumstances (which I cannot presently envisage) that a re-trial would be ordered following such a finding. 

190The reference to Chow v R [2007] NSWCCA 225; 172 A Crim R 582 was unexplained and unelaborated. Chow was a case that displayed some similarities with the present. Chow was charged with knowingly taking part in the supply of heroin. A person said to have been a co-offender was apprehended in possession of 5 kilograms of heroin. The case against Chow was substantially contained in the recordings of intercepted telephone conversations, supplemented by some relatively minor circumstantial evidence. 

191As in the present case, the language used in the telephone conversations was, on its face, innocuous, with references to horse racing (some of which were accepted as genuine), girls, contracts, amounts of money, materials, prices, furniture, plastic and others. A police officer gave expert evidence of a possible interpretation of the language used in the conversations consistent with drug supply. In the trial, an attack was made on the police officer's expertise, and qualifications to give evidence. Plainly, by the conviction, the jury rejected that attack. 

192The sole ground taken on appeal was that the verdict was unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence. On appeal, it was submitted that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction, and that, on examination, the conversations were capable of innocent construction. The Court of Criminal Appeal gave four reasons for rejecting the submission. The Court referred to and quoted from the authorities concerning an appeal ground framed in terms of that presently under consideration: Jones v The Queen [1997] HCA 12; 191 CLR 439; M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; for a more recent application of the principles, see SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13. 

193In giving its reasons for rejecting the ground, the Court conducted its own examination of the conversations, and pointed to some passages in the conversations that were inconsistent with the purported subject matter, and others where, though couched, for example, in racing terms, did not make sense in that context. 

194The Court also discussed the earlier decision of this Court in Keller (see ground 1 above). 

195In Chow , the Court dismissed the appeal. 

196I am unable to see how the decision in Chow assists the appellant, and no explication of the reference was given. 

197I have carefully, as required by SKA , conducted my own independent examination of each of the telephone conversations in the present case. 

198I am satisfied that the references, purported to be to money, are references to quantities of ecstasy tablets. 

199Highly compelling, and representative, are the conversations recorded in the calls numbered 26 to 30. It is to be remembered that the conversation in call 26, in which the appellant purports to be seeking to borrow $2000 (or, on his evidence, to be seeking to buy coins worth $2000) was initiated by him at 11.31pm on 25 June; and that it was followed by three short calls (calls 27, 28 and 29) made the following day, in fairly quick succession, in which, purportedly, arrangements for a meeting were made. The final conversation was recorded in the call numbered 30, when the appellant, on the face of the call, complained that ""they"" (the $2000) was ""fragmented"" or ""broken"". The appellant's explanation, that the coin sets that he had sought to purchase were incomplete, is entirely unconvincing. Even if the alternative proposed translation, of ""scattered"" were factored in, it would be difficult to reconcile what is recorded in these calls with references to coin collecting. 

200Moreover, notably absent from the appellant's evidence was any detail about the nature of the coins he claimed to have been negotiating to purchase, or to have purchased. While an accused person is entitled to remain silent, and no comment may be made upon that silence, where he or she does give evidence, inferences may be drawn as much from what is not said as from what is said. 

201Further support is given by the call numbered 36 (to which Zhang, but not the appellant, was a party) with reference to ""dolphins"", consistent with the dolphin emblem on some of the ecstasy tablets seen by Ms Tui. 

202There was a good deal of circumstantial evidence, including the appellant's possession of large sums of money, and of multiple mobile telephones, and of the purchase of telephones in false names. 

203The jury were entitled to reject the appellant's unlikely explanation, and to accept Detective Zimmer's interpretation of the telephone calls. I would do likewise. I am satisfied that the evidence establishes the guilt of the appellant. 

204I would reject ground 10. 

Application for leave to appeal against sentence 

205Pursuant to s 25(1) and s 32 of the DMT Act, the count 1 offence of supplying a prohibited drug attracts a maximum custodial penalty of imprisonment for 15 years; pursuant to s 25(2) and s 33 of the DMT Act, the counts 2 and 3 offences of supplying not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug attracts a maximum custodial penalty of imprisonment for life; pursuant to Pt 4 Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, these offences are subject to a standard non-parole period of 15 years. Pursuant to s 21 of the DMT Act the two offences on the Form 1, if charged separately, would attract maximum penalties of imprisonment for 2 years. 

206As outlined above, the appellant was sentenced, on the first count, to imprisonment for a fixed term of 5 years; on the second, to imprisonment for 12 years, made up of a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months; on the third, to imprisonment for 10 years, made up of a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months. The accumulation of each successive sentence on that earlier imposed yielded an aggregate sentence of 14 years, made up of a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months. 

Sentences imposed on co-offenders 

207Zhang pleaded guilty to an offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of ecstasy between May and August 2005. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years, made up of a non-parole period of 4 years, and a balance of term of 3 years. 

208Zhang was 18 years of age at the time of offending, and was a law student having had an impressive academic record. He was the son of the woman with whom the appellant had had a long term relationship, but which had ended in acrimony. The sentencing judge regarded: 

""... the extremely poor role models provided to him by his mother and step-father [the appellant] when he was at a particularly vulnerable age"" 

as a significant factor, particularly in relation to reducing the standard non-parole period. 

209Ms Tui pleaded guilty to charges of supplying ecstasy between 30 April and 20 August 2005 and on 2 August 2005. Three further offences were taken into account, involving a very small amount of cannabis, 50 ecstasy tablets, and 12.58 grams of ecstasy. She had a relatively minor prior criminal record. She was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 15 months, on one count, and imprisonment for 2 years and 7 months, made up of a non-parole period of 15 months, and a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months, the sentences to be served concurrently. 

210Mr He pleaded guilty to two counts of supply ecstasy over a period in 2005. Two further offences of drug supply were taken into account, as were an offence of goods in custody, five offences of having custody of a false instrument (false drivers licences). On one count he was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 15 months; on the other to imprisonment for 3 years, 4 months and 2 weeks, with a non-parole period of 2 years, the two sentences to be served concurrently. 

The appellant's personal circumstances 

211The appellant did not give additional evidence following the conviction. 

212Before the court were a Pre-Sentence Report and a psychological report. These disclosed that the authors of the reports took histories to the following effect. The appellant was born in December 1952, in Shanghai, the eldest of three siblings. He married while living in China but was divorced after 13 years. He has a 26 year old son from this marriage. He migrated to Australia in 1988. His former wife and his son continue to live China. He has no relatives in Australia. His parents are said to be very ill in a hospital in Shanghai and this has been the cause of depression and anxiety in the appellant. 

213In Australia he initially he undertook employment as a process worker and then established his own business, importing electrical goods from China. 

214Between 1993 and 2003 he was in a relationship with the mother of the co-offender, Zhang. The relationships with both the mother and Zhang developed difficulties. The relationship with the mother came to an acrimonious end in 2003, with disputes over the division of property. The break up caused the appellant considerable distress and depression, eventually resulting in his withdrawal from his business. 

215The author of the Pre-Sentence Report said that the appellant displayed little insight into his offending behaviour and maintained that he had done nothing wrong, and that his conversations had been about coin collecting. 

216The psychologist reported that his presentation suggested a relatively low level of cognitive functioning. This was confirmed by testing, which showed that his intelligence was between low average and extremely low average. He was diagnosed as suffering a major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. The psychologist stated as a conclusion, that the appellant's criminal conduct revealed: 

""... highly impaired judgment because there appeared to be little thought given to the fact that any unauthorised association with illicit drugs potentially leads to serious charges."" 

The remarks on sentence 

217Hulme DCJ sentenced the applicant on 30 October 2008. 

218His Honour recounted the facts of the offences as disclosed by the evidence in the trial. He expressly found that a joint criminal enterprise between the appellant and Zhang had been established, and that it was the appellant who was the dominant partner, and who largely guided and directed the activities of Zhang. He found that the supply that constituted the offence the subject of count 2 was made up in nine separate transactions (agreements to supply in total 830 grams) identified in the intercepted conversations. He found that the supply that constituted the offence the subject of count 3 was proved by the appellant's attempt to possess 2000 (500 grams of) ecstasy tablets, and that the appellant had in fact come into possession of a quantity (unspecified) but complained about the ""shortfall"". 

219Hulme DCJ made reference to the Form 1 offences, but found them to be ""comparatively minor"" and determined that they would have no impact on the sentence he proposed in relation to count 2, in respect of which they were taken account. 

220His Honour then turned to the appellant's personal circumstances, and recorded his birth in China and his age - 52 at the time of the offences, 55 at sentencing. He noted that he had no previous criminal convictions, but also recognised that, in drug supply matters, that circumstance is of limited significance. 

221He referred to the psychological report, but found it to be of little value. This was because it failed to provide the bases for the opinions expressed. In considering the psychologist's account of the appellant's anxiety and depression, his Honour observed that it did not seem that they had any causal connection with the commission of the offences. He did not accept the conclusion expressed concerning the appellant's supposed state of mind at the time of the offences, noting that the appellant had denied involvement in the offences. 

222His Honour turned to the evaluation of the objective seriousness of each of the offences. In relation to counts 2 and 3, it was necessary, by reason of the provisions of Pt 4 Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, that he place the offences within the range of objective seriousness applicable to offences of their kind. He found each to be below the middle of that range; count 2 ""not by a great margin"". The offence constituting count 3 he found to be less serious than that constituting count 2. That was because it involved a lesser quantity of the drug, involved a single transaction and was an attempt that was only partially successful. 

223His Honour referred in some detail to the sentences imposed upon Zhang, Ms Tui and Mr He. He observed that the three offenders mentioned were not involved at the same level of drug dealing as the appellant, and were charged with offences different from those with which the appellant was charged. He held that considerations of parity did not apply but noted that he would bear in mind the outcome of the proceedings against them. 

224His Honour rejected a submission that the circumstances of the appellant's offending was such that all sentences ought to be served concurrently. 

225The grounds of the application for leave to appeal against sentence were pleaded as follows: 

""1. The sentences imposed are manifestly excessive; 

2. The appellant has a justifiable sense of grievance having regard to the sentences imposed upon Hoa Wei Zhang; 

3. The sentence for count 2 is based on an incorrect factual matter, namely, the quantity of drugs 'supplied'; 

4. The sentences do not properly reflect the principles of totality"". 

226During the course of argument, leave was granted to amend the grounds by adding: 

""5. His Honour erred in finding that the offending in counts 2 and 3 was just below the mid range of objective seriousness."" 

227The written submissions did not address the grounds pleaded individually, but rather took a global approach. 

228Three individual circumstances, in combination, were said to point to the conclusion that the total sentence was manifestly excessive. These were: 


that the period of time over which the offences were committed was relatively short, approximately one month; and that, notwithstanding that the appellant was not arrested until 23 August, there was no evidence to suggest that he had continued to engage in drug activity between 26 June and the date of arrest; 

the nature of the offending; and 

the sentence imposed upon Zhang. 

229Issue was taken with the degree to which his Honour found that the offences constituting counts 2 and 3 were below mid-range - ""but not by a great margin"". This somewhat misinterprets the finding, which was confined to the offence constituting count 2. In respect of count 3, his Honour expressly found that the offence was below mid-range (he did not specify to what degree). 

230It was submitted in this Court that each of these offences was ""clearly below the mid-range of seriousness for offences of this kind"". In support of this, reliance was placed upon the sentencing of Zhang. What is relevant to the assessment of objective seriousness of an offence, for the purposes of Pt 4 Div 1A, was spelt out in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [85]-[86]. These include the actus reus , the consequences of the conduct, and factors that might properly have been said to have impinged on the mens rea of the offender. 

231The argument is untenable. Zhang was charged with a single count of supplying a large commercial quantity of the drug. The quantity involved was 860 grams. Williams DCJ, who sentenced Zhang, declared himself ""certainly satisfied"" that the offence was not in the mid-range of objective seriousness, and gave a number of reasons for that evaluation. These included the quantity - the extent to which the quantity of 860 grams exceeded the commencement point for a large commercial quantity (of 500 grams); the period over which the offending took place (2 months). To that, I would add Zhang's age - he was 18 years of age at the time of the offending - and that he was significantly under the appellant's authority (as his step-son), and the influence and domination of the appellant. 

232Moreover, his plea of guilty (which does not go to the evaluation of objective seriousness) was, of itself, a reason for departing from the standard non-parole period. 

233Reference was also made to the judgment of Hall J (with which Macfarlan JA agreed, and with which I disagreed) in DAB v R; NJB v R [2010] NSWCCA 275. It is true, as was submitted, that his Honour found that the offences therein were substantially below the mid-range of seriousness for offences of their kind - see [182]. However, with respect, his Honour does not elucidate the factors that led him to that result. The reasons in DAB and NJB cast no light on whether Hulme DCJ erred in his assessment of objective gravity. 

234The most significant point to be made in support of the appellant's argument, in my opinion, in respect of each of counts 2 and 3, is the quantity of the drug involved. As Hulme DCJ noted, the quantity involved in the count 3 offence was 500 grams, just sufficient to constitute a large commercial quantity. That in the count 2 offence was 830 grams, but, when one considers that there is no upper limit to the large commercial quantity, it is obvious that there will be many offences involving significantly larger quantities. Quantity, while a relevant factor, is not the sole determinant: Wong v The Queen ; Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 . The tape-recorded conversations disclose an intensity of activity that is also a relevant factor. Indeed, while the appellant relied upon the relatively short time frame over which the offences were committed, the other side to that coin is the very intensity of activity over that limited time. It is, in my opinion, also relevant to the assessment of objective gravity that each offence was committed as part of a joint criminal activity. 

235I am not satisfied that any error has been demonstrated in his Honour's approach to, or conclusions concerning, the evaluation of objective seriousness of the offences constituting counts 2 and 3. 

236It was further submitted that, in any event, the findings were not reflected in the sentences imposed. That submission cannot withstand scrutiny. It is only necessary to identify (again) the standard non-parole period - 15 years - against the non-parole periods imposed - 8 years and 6 months and 7 years and 6 months. Effect was clearly given to the findings. 

237A number of cases were referred to as support for the proposition that findings concerning objective gravity were not reflected in the sentences imposed. For completeness, I note those cases. They were: Hristovksi v R [2010] NSWCCA 129; R v Kazzi [2008] NSWCCA 77; DAB v R; NJB v R [2010] NSWCCA 275. Those cases may (or may not) establish that the sentences imposed on the appellant were more severe than sentences imposed on the other offenders the subject of those decisions. They do not establish that Hulme DCJ was wrong in the approach that he took or the sentences that he imposed. They may, on examination, suggest insufficient adherence to statute law. In my opinion, the sentences imposed by Hulme DCJ were precisely in accordance with the legislative prescription. 

238Specific reliance was placed upon the sentences imposed upon Zhang, not only by reference to the assessment of objective gravity, but also, in a conventional parity sense: R v Lowe [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606. That reliance was, in my opinion, quite misplaced. The argument ignored the very significant distinctions between the two offenders. As I have pointed out above, Zhang's circumstances were very different from those of the appellant. The mere facts that he was 18 years of age, under the authority and influence of the appellant, and dominated by him, are sufficient to dispose of the parity argument. 

239I am satisfied that no error has been demonstrated in the sentencing. I would grant leave to appeal against but dismiss the appeal. 

240The orders that I propose are: 


(1)Appeal against convictions dismissed; 


(2)Leave to appeal against sentences granted; 


(3)Appeals against sentence dismissed. 

241DAVIES J : I agree with Simpson J. 

242GROVE AJ : I agree with Simpson J.

2709577,R v PERRY [2011] NSWDC 70,"SENTENCE 



1HIS HONOUR: Early on a Tuesday morning in December 2009, Sarah Perry, an eighteen year old girl on a provisional driving licence, but not displaying her P plates, was driving her parents' Toyota Corolla along Captain Cook Drive at Kurnell. She should not have been driving in the state she was in. She had had very little sleep and had been drinking alcohol to the extent that her blood alcohol level was at least .142. As a P-plater she should have had a blood alcohol level of zero but her blood alcohol level was at the upper end of the middle range for PCA offences. She was thus well aware that she was committing a serious criminal offence and that she represented a significant danger to others on the road. 

2Despite her lack of sleep and her significant level of intoxication she had decided to drive that morning. I emphasise that that was a decision to commit a criminal act. That decision has had tragic consequences because whilst driving and most likely as a result of her tiredness and intoxication she appears to have fallen asleep at the wheel. The car she was driving crossed to the wrong side of the road. One driver coming the other way was able to take evasive action but Mr Christopher Gibson also driving in the other direction was left with nowhere to go. 

3The offender's car and Mr Gibson's car collided head on. Both drivers were injured, Mr Gibson severely. He was trapped in his car for about an hour before he was taken to hospital by helicopter, that mode of transport being used because of the seriousness of his condition. He did not get out of hospital for 79 days and has been left with permanent and significant injuries. His mental wellbeing has suffered too. He has suffered financial loss as I will later describe. That significant harm resulted from the offender's foolish and criminal decision to drive in the state she was in. Both Mr Gibson, and the offender herself, are very lucky that he is alive today. 

4Mr Gibson is entitled to feel bitter about the situation in which he finds himself. He was driving entirely lawfully that morning. He was not drunk, he was not at risk of falling asleep and yet it is he who has had to bear the significant and lifelong consequences of the offender's wrongdoing. Mr Gibson would be forgiven if, in those circumstances, he desired retribution. Yet to his vast credit, after he heard the offender give evidence during her sentencing proceedings, he conveyed to the Crown, who informed me, in turn, of his acceptance of what he believed to be Ms Perry's genuine remorse and his desire that she not suffer lifelong consequences for herself. However, as I explained to Mr Gibson at the time, whilst his attitude is commendable in the extreme it is not something which can operate to affect the sentence I must impose upon the offender. 

5Courts have duties which extend beyond consideration of only those directly involved in an offence, and for the courts to impose lower sentences on those whose victims forgive them would be to fail to take into account other potential victims of criminal conduct. Just as much as the courts must ignore victims' requests for harsh and extreme punishments, they must also ignore expressions of opinion by more humane people such as Mr Gibson. 

6Let me now deal with the circumstances leading up to the offender's criminal behaviour. The day before the collision the offender drank a substantial amount of alcohol, probably more than she remembers or is prepared to admit. She started at a hotel at about one o'clock in the afternoon where she had a vodka, lime and soda. She then went to an RSL club where she said she had three to four glasses of sparkling wine. At five o'clock she went to the hotel at which she worked where the management were offloading some of their expired stock by giving it to their staff. She had four Bacardi Breezers and one bourbon and coke whilst at the hotel. She left there at about 11.30 and went to the home of a work colleague and friend, Ms Jerish Naidoo. There is no evidence that the offender had more to drink there but there is evidence that she was tired. Indeed Ms Naidoo said that at one stage when they were all in the spa together the offender went and had a nap on a couch, while wearing her swimming costume, for between one hour and an hour and a half. She woke about 4.30am and decided that she would walk the comparatively short distance to her home. 

7One of her fellow employees, who had also been at Ms Naidoo's place, said that he would escort her. It was then that the friend, Mr Nathan Mosler and the offender discussed a problem Mr Mosler had in getting to his home. He needed to be at work and he needed to pick up his uniform and perhaps have a little sleep himself before starting work. It was then that the offender made the decision to drive him; she dropped him home and it was on the way back to her house that the collision occurred. 

8She gave evidence that she thought it was possible that she would not have had the zero alcohol level that the conditions of her driver's licence required. She has said something similar to psychologists who have interviewed her for these proceedings, namely that she realised there was a risk that she may have had some alcohol in her blood but drove in any case. I simply cannot accept that the offender had any doubt at all that she should not have been driving. I am satisfied that she well knew, not only that she had had very little sleep, but also that her blood alcohol level would have been well above zero. I do not accept that she failed to realise she was well over the limit which applies to P-plate drivers. I make this finding for the following reasons. 

9The level of alcohol in her blood at the time of the collision was at least .142, a level which is approaching the high range for PCA offences. I do not accept that a person with a blood alcohol level that high could contemplate the possibility that the blood alcohol level that she really had was zero. Further, she knew how much she had had to drink that day and despite being only eighteen, she was an experienced drinker who had done her RSA qualification in order that she could work at the hotel. I am going to sentence the offender on the basis that she well knew that she should not have been driving because of her blood alcohol level. When she got behind the wheel of her parents' car that morning she may not have known the precise extent of her intoxication but she knew she was intoxicated. This is a significant matter when I come to determine her moral culpability. 

10The offender is the youngest of five children of her parents. While she was in her middle year of high school she was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. It is perhaps the case that she had suffered from that condition for some time but it had not been diagnosed because of her generally placid nature. (In this regard it is important to note that she had been diagnosed with attention deficit order not attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder) She was prescribed dexamphetamine which assisted her to concentrate and focus on her studies. After completing her HSC she and some friends went on a trip to Fiji. She decided to cease taking her medication at that stage, she said because she was no longer studying and there was nothing in particular that she needed to concentrate on. She did not resume taking her medication upon her return from that holiday and she was not taking her medication at the time of the offence. 

11The evidence would suggest that those with ADD who do not take their medication are at a higher risk of committing driving offences and causing injury to other road users because of increased impulsivity which comes with untreated ADD. That is an important factor in determining the moral culpability of the offender. She could not have foreseen the possible link between ceasing her medication and the offence which brings her before me today. 

12I briefly mentioned before the consequences of this offence for Mr Gibson but it is worth spending some time, and I will take some time given the extent of his injuries, setting out what happened to him as a result of the offender's wrongdoing. 

13As I mentioned before Mr Gibson was taken to hospital by helicopter. He had massive facial injuries with associated bleeding which required that he be intubated so that he did not drown in his own blood. Even before he arrived at hospital two holes were opened in his chest to prevent his lungs collapsing. He had many bones broken throughout his body. He had a fracture at the base of his skull. He had fractures of both cheekbones. His nose and the eye sockets on both sides were fractured. He had a fractured rib, a fractured right arm and a fracture of the L5 vertebral body, both ankles were broken too. Not surprisingly he required blood transfusions and multiple operations. His recovery was slow but steady. Eventually he was discharged from the intensive care unit and was later transferred to a rehabilitation hospital where he remained until 24 February 2010. 

14Of course given his extensive injuries he has been left with significant problems; he suffers ongoing pain. He is permanently scarred. He limps when he walks and can only walk for a short distance before the pain overcomes him. His right arm is a lot less strong than it used to be and he has lost part of the use of his right thumb. He suffers lower back pain, numbness and pins and needles in his right thigh, shoulder and neck pain, headaches and muscle deterioration. He can no longer do many things that he used to do. He led an active sporting life before the collision, playing soccer, snow skiing, water skiing, surfing and tennis but these activities are now beyond his physical capabilities. He gets frustrated because he can no longer carry out the tasks around his home that he used to be able to do such as renovations, general maintenance and gardening jobs. He can no longer climb ladders and has difficulty walking up and down stairs. He has restricted vision in both eyes which frustrates him as before the collision he was an avid reader. 

15It is perfectly understandable that these physical limitations have caused him to become frustrated, which in turn has led to him becoming more short tempered and aggressive with his family. He suffers from short term memory loss and has suffered bouts of depression and aggressiveness. He has had to take a less satisfying job at work too. He used to be a refinery technician at the Caltex Oil Refinery and indeed he was travelling to work at the time of the collision. He lost a promotion that he expected to get and could not even do the job he previously had because it involved a lot of climbing high towers and similar physical activity. He is now reduced to office work. 

16The offence has had a financial consequence as well. Mr Gibson's wife had to resign from her part time job because of Mr Gibson's inability to do things for himself. 

17The harm that an offence causes is an important factor in determining the appropriate punishment for that offence. Although all offences involving grievous bodily harm by definition involve serious injury the injuries suffered by Mr Gibson and the consequences for him are substantial. 

18Since committing this offence the offender has made some changes in her life. Before the collision she would occasionally binge drink but as far as can be determined she has moderated her drinking behaviour. She is, I am satisfied, deeply remorseful for what she has done. She wrote a letter of apology to Mr Gibson and there is much evidence as to the psychological impact that her recognition of the consequences of her wrongdoing have had upon her. She too has suffered from depression as she comes to terms with what she has done. 

19It is undeniable that over recent years sentencing for this type of offence has undergone a significant change. The maximum penalty for this offence is seven years imprisonment. The offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm was the subject of the very first guideline judgment issued by the Court of Criminal Appeal. That guideline judgment was a response to a succession of Crown appeals, usually successful, against sentences imposed for dangerous driving offences in the District Court. To put matters bluntly both Parliament and the appellate courts were of the view that sentences for this type of offence were too low. It was, perhaps belatedly, recognised that those who get behind the wheel while drunk or tired, or who drive dangerously for any other reason, and thereby harm or kill someone usually exhibit a very high level of moral culpability. Of course noone convicted of this type of offence ever intends to cause harm but a willingness to run the risk of causing harm or death to another road user by driving whilst drunk, tired or in a dangerous manner can in truth be serious criminal conduct. In many respects this is matter which is consistent with what was described as the typical recurring case in the Court of Criminal Appeal decision of R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; (2002) 55 NSWLR 252, one exception being that the plea of guilty in this matter was entered early. Nor could it be said that the offender exhibited a low level of moral culpability. The result is, as Mr Bellanto, conceded that a custodial sentence of some form is required. 

20Her moral culpability is increased when account is taken of the significant sleep deprivation, and the significant level of intoxication which very significantly impaired her driving ability. Although I cannot describe it as high, even given the consequences of her ADD it is clearly substantial. In sentencing her of course I must also take into account the Form 1 matter of failing to display her P-plates. 

21Questions then arise as to the length of the sentence and if alternatives to fulltime custody are then available, what form a custodial sentence should take. 

22Given the length of the sentence I determined it was appropriate that the offender be referred for assessment for an Intensive Correction Order. That was done. The report has been tendered today indicating the suitability of the offender for such an order. I am satisfied that that is the appropriate punishment that I should impose upon her but I want to make it clear to the offender just how close she was to spending time in prison. She was but a hairs breadth away from a sentence that would see her in gaol. 

23The offender is sentenced to imprisonment for two years. It is to be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order. Her sentence will commence on 13 July 2011. It is subject to the mandatory conditions proscribed by clause 175 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation. These include that the offender must be of good behaviour and not commit any offences, must live at an approved address and not leave New South Wales or Australia without permission. She must comply with directions, submit to alcohol and drug testing, surveillance and monitoring, receive home visits, participate in any activities required and undertake 32 hours of community service per month. There are other mandatory conditions as well. A full copy of the mandatory conditions will be provided to the offender.

2709579,R v DX (No 2) [2011] NSWDC 165,"Judgment 



1. The Crown Prosecutor has applied for leave for a witness to refresh her memory. The application is made under s 32 of the Evidence Act 1995. The events which the Crown Prosecutor wishes to lead evidence about occurred in the mid 1990s. The document which the Crown Prosecutor is seeking leave for the witness to use to refresh her memory was made on 17 May 2011. 

2. The Crown Prosecutor, Mr M Barr, argues that the document is able to be used. The document is in fact a statement given by the witness to the police. Ms S Goodwin, who appears for the offender in these sentence proceedings, objects to the procedure. She argues that s 32(2) of the Evidence Act has not been complied with. She requires Mr Barr to lead evidence to form a basis for subs (2)(a) but more significantly she argues that s 32(2)(b) has not been complied with. 

3. It appears to be common ground that the statement made in 2011 was not made when the events recorded in it were fresh in the witness's memory. 

4. However, Mr Barr argues that it is able to be used under s 32(2)(b)(ii) because the statement was at the time that it was made found by the witness to be accurate. The statement itself, which I have admitted on the voir dire as exhibit VDD, says as much in para 1. 

5. Ms Goodwin on the other hand argues that the expression ""such a time"" refers not to when the statement was made but to the phrase used in s 32(2)(b)(i) ""when the events recorded in it were fresh"" in the memory of the witness. 

6. I agree with Ms Goodwin's submission. It seems to me to be supported by the observations contained in the Australian Law Reform Commission's Report (ALRC 26, volume 1, para 165) which says that the ""specific matters to be considered by the Court include whether the document was made or written or verified by the witness as accurate at a time when the facts were fresh in"" the memory of the witness. It seems to me that the phrase must be interpreted in light of that. If it were not so it would mean that - just in this case - a witness who had made a statement some fifteen years after an event would be able to refresh their memory from it even though it was many years after the events recorded and many years after those events could be said to be fresh in the witness's memory. The alternative interpretation Ms Goodwin submits would defeat the purpose of the section and I agree with her.

		27 October 2011",2011-06-23 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709581,R v La Rosa [2011] NSWSC 1394,"Judgment  1HIS HONOUR: On 8 April 2011 the offender, Francesco La Rosa, pleaded guilty to offences of affray and manslaughter.  The offences are against s 93C and ss 18 & 24 respectively of the Crimes Act 1900 and the maximum penalties are imprisonment for 10 years and imprisonment for 25 years.  2On 27 May 2011 I heard and received evidence and submissions on sentence before standing the matter over until today.  Facts  3The matter concerns events in the Qantas domestic terminal at Sydney Airport on 22 March 2009 when there was conflict between members of two rival motorcycle clubs, the Hells Angels and the Comanchero.  The offender has acknowledged that he was criminally concerned in an initial incident near Gate 5 of the terminal which gave rise to the charge of affray and that he was also concerned in a second incident a short time later near the check-in area of the departure hall which resulted in the tragic death of Mr Anthony Zervas.  4A statement of agreed facts was tendered before me.  I draw what follows from that document.  5There had been hostility and enmity between members of the two clubs for some time prior to 22 March 2009.  This resulted in various criminal acts being committed, including the firebombing of business premises belonging to the Hells Angels at Brighton; shots being fired into a tattoo parlour owned by a Hells Angels member in Petersham; and the bombing of the Hells Angels clubhouse.  The first of those incidents occurred in October 2008 and the others occurred in February 2009.  6It is not alleged that the present offender was involved in any of these incidents but it is an agreed fact that they all occurred at a time when he was treasurer of the Comanchero.  He was generally aware of the hostility between the Hells Angels and the Comanchero.  7There was a hierarchical structure within the Comanchero motorcycle club.  At the time of the incident on 22 March 2009, Mahmoud Hawi was the national president; Daux Ngakuru was the ""commander""; Farres Abounader was the ""road captain""; Tiago Costa was the secretary; as noted above, the offender was the treasurer; Rui Antao was the ""nominee boss""; and Herb Laupepa was the Sergeant at Arms.  8On 22 March 2009 five members of the Comanchero boarded a Qantas flight in Melbourne destined for Sydney.  They were Mahmoud Hawi, Canan (aka Ishmael) Eken, Christian Menzies, Maher Aouli and Pomare Pirini.  They had all spent the weekend in Melbourne.  9By chance, Derek Wainohu, the president of the Hells Angels, happened to be on the same flight and was seen by Comanchero members.  Hawi directed Aouli to contact Comanchero members in Sydney to have them attend Sydney airport.  Wainohu sent text messages to members of his club for the same purpose.  10Passengers on the flight observed animosity from the Comanchero members towards Mr Wainohu before the flight took off.  11Seven Comanchero members arrived at the airport, presumably in response to the calls that had been made.  They had made a prior stop at Brighton Le Sands on the way to the airport, where Usama Potrus and Farres Abounader spoke with other Comanchero members, Daux Ngakuru and Herb Laupepa. Once at the airport, five of them (AL, SP, Tiago Costa,  Zoran Kisacanin and the offender) proceeded through security screening and went to Gate 5 where the flight was due.  The other two (Farres Abounader and Usama Potrus) remained in the non-secure area of the terminal.  12Seven Hells Angels members or associates, including the deceased, also arrived.  Two of them, Tom Baker and David Padovan, went to Gate 5.  The other five remained in the non-secure area.  The Gate 5 affray  13The flight landed at about 1.30pm.  The five Comanchero members who had been on the flight disembarked at Gate 5 and met up with the five who had proceeded through security screening.   Similarly, Derek Wainohu met up with Tom Baker and David Padovan.  14Mahmoud Hawi confronted Derek Wainohu.  There was a short verbal argument before Wainohu was punched, causing him to fall to the ground.  Members of the Comanchero were then observed to chase and assault David Padovan.  The affray escalated into violent punching and kicking of Mr Padovan by Comanchero members.  The other two Hells Angels, Messrs Wainohu and Baker, were not seen to engage in any violence.  The fighting resulted in Mr Padovan losing his shirt.  At one stage he was on the ground being punched and kicked by numerous Comanchero members.  The offender was involved as part of the moving group chasing Mr Padovan at Gate 5, but there is no evidence that he punched or kicked Mr Padovan whilst he was on the ground.  15There were a large number of members of the public at Gate 5 at the time, including children and elderly people.  The offender accepts that those people who witnessed the affray were put in fear by his actions and those of his fellow Comanchero members.  16David Padovan re-joined Derek Wainohu and Tom Baker at the conclusion of the fighting.  Mahmoud Hawi pointed at him and yelled out threats, including the words, ""You're fucking dead"" .  The other Comanchero members, including the offender, were close by when this occurred.  17The entire incident, from the initial confrontation until the uttering of the threats, took less than 3 minutes. None of the participants received any serious injury.  18The ten Comanchero members then walked towards the exit and when they emerged into the non-secure area of the terminal they met up with Farres Abounader and Usama Potrus who were waiting in the vicinity of the escalator leading down to the baggage carousels.  The confrontation in the check-in area  19Instead of going downstairs to collect their baggage, the group of now 12 Comanchero members moved quickly towards the group of 5 Hells Angels members and associates, including the deceased, who were waiting in the departure hall.  They met up with them at check-in counters 13 and 14, having covered a distance of about 73 metres to do so.  20There was a short verbal argument before a riot erupted.  Witnesses described the two sides fighting each other and ""punches flying everywhere"".  There is conflicting evidence as to precisely how the fighting started.  Some say the deceased attempted to attack Mr Hawi whilst others say the Comancheros started it. This is not an issue that can be, or needs to be, resolved for present purposes.  By his plea the offender has acknowledged that he was a party to a joint criminal enterprise to assault one or more Hells Angels members and that this involved an unlawful and dangerous act which objectively carried with it an appreciable risk of somebody suffering serious injury.  21The fighting commenced behind the check-in counters and continued as the participants moved between the counters towards the front of the terminal.  Eyewitness descriptions include that the fighting was between two groups with more men in one group than the other.  There are references to it being an ""all in brawl"" with ""everybody punching"".  Bollards used for queuing of passengers at the check-in counters were taken up and used as weapons.  There were a number of fights taking place simultaneously.  22There is no evidence that the offender committed any physical acts during the brawl.  By his plea, however, the offender accepts that he was willing to assist in the brawl if necessary.  23Mr Zervas died from the combined effects of blunt force injuries to the head and stab wounds to the chest and abdomen.  There were three stab wounds, one inflicted by a pair of scissors and two were consistent with being inflicted by a knife.  24The assault upon the deceased was one of the fights occurring in the check-in area.  The Crown alleges that at least three Comanchero members were directly responsible for inflicting the fatal injuries with a bollard and a knife but it does not allege that the offender was involved in this attack, or that he was in the immediate vicinity when it occurred.  The offender acknowledges that the deceased died as a result of the actions of others in the riot but he has not nominated any of the individual participants who directly caused the death.  25Children and elderly people were among the members of the public who were present during the riot.  Many witnesses commented on the extreme viciousness displayed by the two groups.  Many also said that they were shocked and felt threatened and terrified.  One said, ""Whilst the fight was occurring I was shocked.  The punches were thrown with force and the attack was vicious"" .  Another said, ""During the incident I was scared and sickened as to what had happened.  These people looked like animals going at it"" .  26The fighting lasted just over one minute.  The offender fled the airport at the same time as others.  He left the scene in a taxi with AL, Christian Menzies and Mahmoud Hawi and they proceeded to Mr Hawi's parents' home.  Four other participants (Messrs Pirini, Kisacanin, Eken and Aouli) left in another taxi but they were stopped by police at Brighton Le Sands.  27The offender was arrested on 3 August 2009.  He was charged with riot and affray and refused bail.  A charge of murder was preferred on 12 August 2009.  Bail was granted on 27 August 2009 but revoked on an application to this Court by the Director of Public Prosecutions on 8 September 2009.  He has been in continuous custody since that time.  The parties have agreed that to give credit for pre-sentence custody, the offender's sentences should be back-dated to 12 August 2009.  Seriousness of the offences  28It is important to stress that I am not sentencing the offender for directly causing the death of the deceased.  I am not sentencing him for his participation in a joint enterprise that had as its object the doing of an act with the intention of killing or inflicting grievous bodily harm.  I am not sentencing him for his participation in a joint enterprise with the contemplation that the commission of murder was a possible occurrence.  29For the affray, the offender is being sentenced for his participation with fellow Comanchero members in using unlawful violence towards one or more members of the Hells Angels in circumstances that would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety.  30For the manslaughter, the offender is being sentenced for his participation in a joint criminal enterprise to commit an unlawful and dangerous act, namely the assault of one or more members of the Hells Angels, in circumstances which objectively carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury being occasioned to a person.  31As for the affray, it was relatively short lived and the offender's role was less than that of other participants. There is no evidence that he was involved in the punching and kicking of David Padovan whilst he was on the ground. Despite this, the offence is serious.  It involved a considerable number of combatants.  The location where it occurred is relevant, as also is the number and nature of innocent people who were present.  These are prominent features and render the offence considerably more serious than if it had occurred elsewhere and otherwise.  32The starting point in assessing the gravity of an offence of manslaughter is to recognise that it involves the unlawful taking of a human life.  There are, however, a wide variety of ways in which the crime of manslaughter can be committed and there are an equally wide variety of ways in which an offender may be culpable.  33The present case is one of considerable seriousness.  The offender realised that by being a party to a joint enterprise with his fellow Comanchero members to assault the Hells Angels members, even though there is no evidence that he committed any physical acts during the brawl, he engaged in an activity that carried with it an appreciable risk of somebody suffering serious injury.   That risk was not only of injury to participants in the fighting but to innocent bystanders who included children and the elderly.  The offender was part of a large group of men who outnumbered their opponents.  The statement of agreed facts discloses, as I have observed, that witnesses were shocked by the level of violence used, with comments made about the viciousness of it.  Witnesses were, understandably, sickened and horrified.  34It must be acknowledged that the offender's role was, relatively speaking, minor.  It is not alleged that he was involved in any physical fighting, but he was willing to assist if required.  He was not armed and, unlike some others, he did not take up any object to use as a weapon.  He was not near to, let alone directly involved in, the attack upon the deceased.  Acknowledging each of those matters, however, does not mean that his offence was anything other than a serious one.  The absence of those factors simply means that his culpability is less than that of others.  35It was submitted by Mr Webb, counsel for the offender, that the circumstances of the offender's membership of the Comanchero motorcycle club, something which I will describe in some detail shortly, were relevant in this context and that they should lead to a finding that the offender's moral culpability was less than it otherwise might be. I have considered that submission but, in the end, have concluded that although it might, in part, explain the offender's involvement, it does not reduce his moral culpability at all.  36There was a level of planning and organisation that attended the incidents.  Clearly, a confrontation was contemplated at the time phone calls were made to summon fellow gang members to attend at the airport.  The offender said in his evidence that he understood the trip to the airport was simply ""to pick up the boys"".  I regard that as nonsense: seven large men in two cars, one being a Toyota Corolla, going to pick up 5 similarly large men, some of whom had luggage.  Mr Webb conceded that it was open to me to conclude that the offender attended the airport with knowledge that there was a prospect of ""trouble"".  I am satisfied of that.  I accept, however, that it is unlikely that the offender had any idea that this ""trouble"" would be of the dimension of that which in fact occurred.  37Overall, I am of the view that the offender was a willing participant in offences that were of considerable seriousness.  However, in assessing the appropriate sentences to impose, I must also bear in mind that the role that he played was significantly less than that of other participants.  Denunciation, punishment and deterrence  38Members of the community have an entitlement to feel safe and secure in public places.  The selfish and mindless arrogance of those who perpetrate extreme levels of violence for their own ends with complete disregard for others warrants the strongest condemnation.  39It is necessary in the assessment of sentence to denounce the offender's conduct.  It must be made clear to him, and others who may contemplate acting in such a way, that such conduct will be met with condign punishment.  Aggressive and violent conduct between rival gang members in public places simply will not be tolerated, the more so where there is an appreciable risk of somebody suffering serious injury.  That risk, in what occurred in this case in the departure hall, was high indeed.  The offender must be punished and made accountable for his part in this tragic affair.  Subjective features  40The evidence tendered before me by Mr Webb as to the offender's personal circumstances comprised a statement by the offender; testimonials by a sister, his mother, Mr Antonio Brancato, Mr Peter Moniaci and Mr Jack Psaras; various business and vocational certificates; and a report by Mr Tim Watson-Munro, psychologist.  In addition, the offender gave evidence, as did his sister, Ms Maria Brancato.  41The offender was born in 1972.  He was aged 37 at the time of the offences and is 39 now.  42He has prior convictions for driving offences which are of no present significance with the exception that the offender was on bail for a relatively serious driving offence at the time he committed the offences for which he stands for sentence.  That is an aggravating factor that must be taken into account.  43The offender was born in Sydney to parents of Italian heritage.  He is the youngest of five children.  His father died at the age of 55 when the offender was 9 years old.  His mother is now 84 years of age and is not in the best of health.  It would appear from the evidence of both the offender and his sister that the family is close and supportive. He has been receiving regular visits from family members, including his mother, since coming into custody.  44The statement by the offender's sister indicates that the offender is a person who is generous in terms of providing assistance to family members when required; that seemingly being the family culture.  He is also generous to charities which he supports.  These matters were confirmed in her oral evidence and, to some extent, by the briefer statement by the offender's mother.  45The offender was raised in the inner western suburbs and attended local primary and high schools until he completed the School Certificate at the end of Year 10.  He was offered work the day after he left school and has been in steady employment since then.  46A motor mechanic apprenticeship was then completed over a period of four years.  He worked for wages for some years before opening his own mechanical workshop, ""Frank's Auto House"", in 1998.  That business flourished initially but had to be closed in 2003 due to high overheads and a downturn in work. The offender was able to readily obtain other employment, including driving concrete delivery trucks after he obtained a heavy truck licence.  At the time of his arrest he had returned to work as a mechanic.  47The offender was married in 2001.  His wife is a Thai national and she was not able to move to Australia until late 2004.  The couple do not have any children but this is a hope that the offender has for the future.  His wife has struggled with being on her own and has gone to live with her family overseas until the offender is released from custody.  They do, however, maintain regular contact by telephone.  48The testimonials by Mr Brancato, Mr Moniaci and Mr Psaras attest to the offender having many positive personal qualities both in his work and in his social life.  49Mr Watson-Munro reported that the offender had long-standing issues with depression, anxiety and low self esteem.  This commenced in his childhood and adolescence as a consequence of him suffering from morbid obesity.  There have been no issues with alcohol or drugs but the offender's life has been substantially impacted by a difficulty in controlling his food intake and, in turn, his weight.  In 2003 he weighed about 160 kilograms but after a year of concerted effort he was able to reduce to about 120 kilograms.  He said that he put on weight when he came into custody but since the committal hearing last year he has lost weight through a desire to get healthy and change his life.  50The offender has had an interest in riding motorcycles.  He came to know an older person who happened to be a life member of the Comanchero motorcycle club and he joined up himself in about 2003.  He said in his written statement, ""I knew I loved bikes and riding them and being part of a group that respected me for what I was and not what I looked like and I loved riding in a group and being part of something I had never experienced before"" .  51The offender withdrew from membership of the Comanchero at some time in 2010.  He had been the treasurer of his chapter for the last 2 years.  His duties included paying the rent and other expenses as well as purchasing provisions for parties and barbecues.  He was the leaseholder in respect of the clubhouse but he claimed that this was only because the real estate agent required the lessee to have an ABN, which he did.  He said that being the holder of this office did not involve him in making any decisions about club business.  52The offender claimed, ""I didn't get involved in any politics as I didn't want to get in any trouble"" .   When asked to explain what he meant by ""trouble"", he referred to fights at the clubhouse, members not paying their dues or not turning up at regular Friday night gatherings.  He said that he was aware from what he heard from other members that there had been ""burnings and bombings"" and other ""things of a criminal nature"" but claimed to have had no involvement.  53The offender's decision to leave the Comanchero was prompted by a realisation that at his age he should be getting on with his life. He had communicated his decision to other members and there had been no recrimination.  54Psychometric testing by Mr Watson-Munro confirmed ""a significant level of unresolved psychological distress"".   The offender had described to him feelings of sadness, pessimism, failure and intense feelings of guilt.  It was Mr Watson-Munro's opinion that the offender requires treatment.  He had been unable to engage in any form of psychotherapy as a consequence of his remand status but had hopes of doing so once sentenced, with a strong desire to continue following release.  55Mr Watson-Munro was of the view that the offender would benefit from some form of cognitive behaviour therapy focussed on maintaining his regimen of losing weight, in addition to appropriate social skills training and assertiveness training.  He indicated that the offender would also benefit from therapy which addressed his depression, anxiety and strong feelings of remorse.  A course of psychotropic medication might also assist.  56It was the opinion of Mr Watson-Munro that, having regard to the offender's attitude to the offences and their consequences, with continuing structure, supervision and treatment continuing for some time following release to parole, the overall prognosis is positive.  Specific mitigating features  Plea of guilty  57I have earlier mentioned that the offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter and affray on 8 April 2011.  He had been committed for trial for murder and affray on 23 September 2010 and a trial date for the offender, and a significant number of alleged co-offenders, had been fixed for 9 May 2011. The plea was entered after pre-trial case management procedures had been commenced and after I had sentenced a co-offender, Pomare Pirini.  Although there was some consideration given to the possibility of pleading guilty to some offences, other than those upon which the offender had been committed for trial, it was acknowledged by the offender's counsel that it was the sentencing of Mr Pirini that ""had a significant impact on his position"".  58Ordinarily, the time of the entry of the offender's pleas would justify a reduction of sentence only in the order of 10 per cent.  However, I am satisfied that there should be an additional component to reflect the length and complexity of the trial that was in prospect.  I will allow for a reduction of 15 per cent.  Other mitigating factors  59There are a number of other statutory mitigating factors that I must take into account.  It will be apparent from what I have set out earlier that the offender has no significant record of previous convictions and, I accept, was of prior good character.  I am also satisfied that he is unlikely to re-offend and that he has good prospects of rehabilitation.  60I am also satisfied that the offender is genuinely remorseful.  He expressed his regret for what happened and his sympathies for the family of the deceased, both in his statement and in his oral evidence.  He said that he had empathy for the deceased's daughter, he being aware from his own experience what it feels like for a child to lose a parent.  There was confirmation of this remorse in the statement of the offender's sister and the report by Mr Watson-Munro.  At the end of his evidence in chief, the offender volunteered that he also wished to apologise to all who were present at the airport who were witnesses to the violent conduct that occurred.  Sentencing of co-offenders  61AL, a Comanchero member, pleaded guilty in the Local Court to charges of affray and riot.  He was sentenced by Charteris DCJ on 17 June 2010 to a total term of 3 years with a non-parole period of 9 months.  The starting point for the affray sentence was 3 years and for the riot sentence was 6 years.  These were reduced by 55 per cent on account of the pleas of guilty and assistance to authorities.  62SP, another Comanchero member, also pleaded guilty in the Local Court to charges of affray and riot and was sentenced by Charteris DCJ on 18 June 2010.  The sentence imposed was in identical terms to that imposed upon AL except for the commencement date.  His Honour allowed a reduction of 55 percent in his case as well.  63It is unnecessary to refer to the sentencing of AL and SP in any further detail.  I undertook that task in sentencing Pomare Pirini on 18 March 2011 and, whilst the sentences imposed upon AL and SP are not irrelevant, it is the sentences imposed upon Mr Pirini that are more directly relevant in the present case.  64Mr Pirini had been committed for trial for the same charges as the offender but entered pleas of guilty to manslaughter and affray on arraignment on 16 December 2010.  The facts as to his offending included that he had been a passenger on the flight up from Melbourne with his four Comanchero colleagues.  He was aware of some aggression being shown on the plane towards Mr Wainohu, but not the extent of it.  He was involved in ""scuffles"" during the Gate 5 affray.  The only physical activity in which he was involved during the subsequent riot in the check-in area was to confront, but not land a blow upon, a Hells Angels member who was menacing him with a bollard.  65Mr Pirini was 21 at the time of the offences. There were no previous convictions of significance.  He had only been a member of the Comanchero motorcycle club for about a year.  There was no suggestion that he was involved in any criminal activity.  He regarded it as ""just a bunch of boys who rode around on bikes, all hanging out together"".  He had a good employment history and support from his partner and extended family.  Since going into custody he had returned to his Christian faith and renounced his Comanchero membership.  There was evidence that he was a loyal, hardworking, quiet, respectful, humble, gentle and well-mannered young man.  66I specifically found in Mr Pirini's favour that he was of prior good character and had good prospects of rehabilitation.  I was particularly well-satisfied that he was deeply and genuinely remorseful. I found special circumstances for reducing the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period.  67Mr Pirini received a fixed term of 2 years 2 months for the affray (starting point 2 years 8 months) and a sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years for the manslaughter (starting point 7 years 6 months).  The sentences were partially accumulated so that the total term was 6 years 6 months with a non-parole component of 3 years 6 months.  68There are a number of obvious distinctions between the cases of Mr Pirini and the present offender.  In the end, however, putting aside one particular factor, the differences largely balance themselves out.  There is little to distinguish between their objective criminality.  I do not regard the fact that Mr Pirini had been on the flight, whilst the offender had not, as being of any significance.  If it made any difference, it would probably work against the offender in that he had a choice whether to attend the airport but Mr Pirini did not. The respective subjective cases are significantly different but in terms of those matters that justify some mitigation of sentence, the weight that should be accorded to them is largely the same.  69The one matter of significance that is present in the offender's case, but not in the case of Mr Pirini, is the fact that the offender was on conditional liberty at the time of the offences.  His sentence should be more, but only very modestly so, for that reason.  70What I have said in the foregoing paragraph relates to the starting point for the sentences.  There is another distinguishing feature that then needs to be taken into account.  I allowed for a 20 per cent reduction of sentence in Mr Pirini's case because his pleas were entered at a much earlier time.  The reduction in the present case will be, as I have said, 15 per cent.  Other sentencing considerations  71It is necessary to determine sentences for the individual offences and then to determine whether they should be served concurrently or otherwise.  That determination is made with the principle of totality in mind.  The Crown Prosecutor submitted that there should be some level of partial accumulation of the sentences because there were two distinct offences committed some distance apart.  The affray at Gate 5 had ended but instead of the Comanchero members leaving it at that and proceeding downstairs to the arrivals hall to collect baggage and leave the terminal, they proceeded through to the departure hall to take on the Hells Angels in greater numbers.  Mr Webb did not make any submission in opposition.  I propose to proceed in the same fashion as I did in Mr Pirini's case.  72I do not propose to set a non-parole period for the affray sentence as there would be no utility in doing so.  I made some remarks about this concept when I sentenced Mr Pirini.  Section 45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 does not authorise the reduction of an otherwise appropriate sentence.  It simply provides for the setting of a sentence without the sentence having a non-parole period.  73Mr Webb submitted that I should find that there are special circumstances for imposing a longer parole and shorter non-parole period.  The Crown did not oppose this course, although clearly it is a matter for me to determine in the exercise of my discretion.  74In my judgment there are special circumstances.  The offender will require considerable assistance in re-establishing his life following parole release.  Not only will there be the need to settle down with work and in his home and social life, but there is also the significant need for the psychological assistance identified in the report of Mr Tim Watson-Munro.  It is significant that it is recommended that this assistance be provided now but also that it should continue for some time in the community.  A longer period of supervision by a parole officer will be of benefit in this respect.  SENTENCE  On each:  Convicted  Affray:  Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years 4 months.  The sentence is to date from 12 August 2009 and expire on 11 December 2011.  Manslaughter:  Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years 3 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 3 years 4 months.  The sentence is to date from 12 February 2010. The offender will be eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 11 May 2013.  The total term will expire on 11 September 2016.  That is a total sentence of 7 years 1 month with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months.  The sentence of 2 years 4 months for the affray, but for the offender's plea of guilty, would have been one of 2 years 9 months.  The sentence of 6 years 7 months for the manslaughter, but for the offender's plea of guilty, would have been one of 7 years 9 months.  **********

		18 November 2011",2011-06-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709597,R v Bateson [2011] NSWSC 643,"Judgment 

Introduction 
1Jeffrey Bateson (the offender) pleaded guilty to an indictment which alleged that: 

Between about 11 May 2008 and about 16 May 2008 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, while he possessed information that was not generally available and which, if it were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of particular Division 3 financial products, namely shares in Wind Hydrogen Limited, and he knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that the information was not generally available and that if it were generally available a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of those securities, [he] did acquire 550,000 shares in Wind Hydrogen Limited in his capacity as a beneficiary of the Carmarthen Superannuation Fund. 

2Five separate instances of the offender having possessed inside information were particularised. Reference will be made to those aspects of the case in due course. The offence to which the offender pleaded guilty is commonly referred to as ""insider trading"". 

3The offender originally pleaded guilty in the Local Court and adhered to that plea when he appeared in this Court. At the relevant time the maximum penalty for the offence was imprisonment for 5 years and/or a fine of $220,000. [The maximum penalty has now been increased, with effect from 13 December 2010, to imprisonment for 10 years and/or a fine of $495,000 (or three times the value of the benefits obtained from the offence)]. 

Facts relating to the offence 

4An Agreed Statement of Facts was admitted into evidence. It is a very comprehensive document and, but for some minor modifications, is set out below: 

A. Background . 
On 10 March 2005, Wind Hydrogen Australia Limited was incorporated as an unlisted public company. On 29 March 2005, the company changed its name to Wind Hydrogen Limited (WHL). On 24 June 2008 it changed its name to WHL Energy Limited. 
The offender was a non-Executive Director of WHL from 13 June 2006 until his resignation on 1 July 2008, apart from a period of two months from July to September 2007. 

On 6 September 2007, WHL's shares were listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (now the Australian Securities Exchange, or ASX). Wind Hydrogen Limited was allocated the ASX code ""WHN"" and its shares thereafter traded on the ASX. At all relevant times WHL was an alternative energy company, focussed on developing and commercialising energy assets including wind energy and clean fossil fuels. Until the end of April 2008, WHL's investments were exclusively in wind power projects, including the construction and operation of wind farms. These projects traditionally have long lead times from the decision to construct a wind farm to the time that the farm begins to produce power which might be sold in order to generate a return to shareholders. Accordingly, these projects can only promise a long term return on investment. 

In early May 2008 a new investment into shale gas projects in the United States was proposed for WHL by its Chief Executive Officer. The new investment offered the prospect of short to medium term returns on the investment. 

As at May 2008: 
(a) Lawrence Podrasky (""Podrasky"") was the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, 
(b) Warwick Pearce (""Pearce"") was Company Secretary and Commercial Manager, and 
(c) The offender, John Peter Bartter (""Bartter"") and Declan Pritchard (""Pritchard"") were non-executive directors of WHL. 
(d) Erene Keriakos was WHL's Administrative Officer. 

B. Share trading account 
At all relevant times, the offender and his wife, Geraldine Clisby, were the trustees and equal beneficiaries of the Carmarthen Superannuation Fund (CSF). CSF had a share trading account with Dixon Advisory and Super Service Pty Ltd (""Dixon Advisory""). Craig Cameron was the ""Client Advisor"" for the account. Cameron took all instructions in relation to the account from the offender. Dixon Advisory in turn used an ASX participant, ABN Amro Morgans (ABN Amro), as the broker to purchase or sell shares on its behalf. 

In their capacity as trustees of CSF, the offender and Ms Clisby held accounts with Macquarie Investment Management Limited (Macquarie) to pay for shares and as a repository for those shares. These accounts were, respectively, a cash management account and a "" wrap account "". The Macquarie cash management account was used to fund the purchase of shares by CSF. The legal title in CSF's shares in the Macquarie wrap account was in the name of Bond Street Custodians Limited, a nominee of Macquarie. Bond Street Custodians Limited appeared as the acquirer and holder of CSF's shares. 

The association between CSF and the offender (and Ms Clisby) was known to WHL and that information was also publicly available. See, for example: 



The prospectus of 8 June 2007 which refers to the offender as being a beneficiary of the Jeffery Bateson and Geraldine Clisby Carmathen Superannuation Fund which holds 1 million shares in the company; 



Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2007 at p 44; 



An ASX announcement on 6 September 2007 of the top 20 shareholders; and 



The WHL issue sponsored holding statement as at 23 August 2007 being the initial allotment of a million shares. 

C. Buy order for 750,000 WHL shares placed on 11 March 2008 
In January and March 2008, public announcements were made by WHL regarding a key appointment of a managing director of its UK business (21.1.08), an external investment of US$300,000 to buy 22% of the shares in a company which intended to develop energy assets in Latin America (25.1.08), and the signing of a memorandum of understanding for a joint venture to develop its wind power assets in the UK (7.3.08). 

After the last of those public announcements, the offender emailed Cameron on 11 March 2008 requesting the purchase of 750,000 WHL shares for his superannuation fund. This was an open and standing order, which Cameron put into effect the following day. 
This was achieved through numerous contract notes covering trades on 11 separate days, for a total of 700,000 shares, in the period between 12 March and 9 April. By the time the last of these trades had settled, on 14 April, the balance of funds in CSF's fund account was nil. On 2 May on Cameron's instructions, the offender's 11 March open buy order for CSF was cancelled because there were insufficient funds to complete the balance of the order, being 50,000 shares. 

D. The Morgan County Deal and communications with the Board 
In early 2008, Podrasky became aware of an opportunity to invest in a proposed joint venture between a US oil and gas company known as Derby Resources LLC ("" Derby "") and Rolland Energy Incorporated ("" Rolland ""). Rolland was incorporated in Quebec, Canada, and its shares were listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). 

Podrasky told Pearce on or about 2 May 2008 that he intended to propose to the Board of WHL that the company invest in a project to exploit reserves of shale gas in Eastern Kentucky. He gave Pearce a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet of financial information relevant to the project, and said that he had received the information from a Canadian company, Rolland, one of the companies involved in the project. He asked Pearce to review the financial information and reformat it for presentation to the WHL directors at the board meeting scheduled for 6 May. Podrasky then put forward a proposal for WHL to become involved in the project. Podrasky and Pearce sent emails and attachments about the project to board members, including the offender. 

From 4 May onwards, the offender was party to communications concerning the shale gas project in Kentucky. The other parties were Derby and Rolland . The project was variously referred to as the "" Morgan Gas Project Investment Opportunity "", "" the Morgan County Gas Project "", the "" Morgan County Deal "" and the "" Kentucky Shale Gas Joint Venture "". 

At 5:05 pm on 4 May , Podrasky sent an email to the offender and other members of the board on the subject of "" Morgan Gas Project Investment Opportunity "". This email and its attachments constitute the first item of inside information possessed by the offender. 

Attached to Podrasky's email were various documents, including: 

- A ""WHL Executive Chairman and CEO's Report to the Board"", which was an investment summary; 

- A projected cash flow for the Kentucky Shale Gas Project; and 

- A supplement from a United States periodical entitled ""Oil and Gas Investor"" dated January 2006, providing background on shale gas exploration in the USA. 

In the email Podrasky wrote that the recipient should review the material 

""as soon as possible due to the fact that we will need to secure the rights, very quickly by Tuesday 6 May next week, as there are competing buyers of significance. To achieve this, we will need Board approval by this date at the latest. Apologies for the short time frame, but to respond to desirable opportunities in the energy market, given that oil & gas is obviously a hot sector, quick turn around comes with the territory!"". 

In the email, Podrasky also suggested a conference call at 9.30am on 6 May, and said, ""we will likely have available on the call, to present when required, our Farm-in partner, Dr David Khan ."" Podrasky's purpose was to provide the other board members with information about the project so that it could be discussed at the board meeting. 

The document entitled "" WHL Executive Chairman & CEO's Report to the Board "", contained an estimate that the cost to WHL of participating in the proposed project would be approximately US$5million in the first 13 months, and that WHL's share value could potentially increase by approximately A$0.85 per share as a result of the project. The document stated that: 

""This represents a unique investment opportunity for WHL to become a major gas producer in the U.S. with a relatively small upfront investment (US$5.0 mil) which could contribute potential share price value of 85c per share. Board approval is sought to proceed with funding the Deposit and to enter into a Farm-in Agreement to receive a 35% Project interest. This acquisition will be done with or without WHL's participation by one of the major shale gas players in N. America. 

Board approval is further sought in order to recommend this investment to WHL shareholders requiring majority approval. Thus, an extraordinary shareholders meeting and vote with 28 day notice is necessary as this represents a diversification in to clean gas which is complementary to wind-power."" 

The following events took place the next day 5 May : 

(a) At 9.39am , the offender sent an email to Podrasky (copied to the other directors), on the subject of ""Morgan Gas"", in which he asked five questions about the project. The fourth question was as follows:- 

"" Assuming we go ahead with this we desperately need the website updated to reflect our enlarged strategy. When this is announced to the market the website will be the key point of contact for info on WHL- its crucial to getting the full share price kick. So how will this be done?"" 

(b) At 9:51 am that day, the offender sent a further email to Podrasky, (copied to the other directors), on the same subject. In it he asked further questions, including, ""How did this deal come our way- were you contacted by Kahn; is the deal 'common' knowledge in the industry and you happened to chase it up? what?"" . Podrasky replied that the deal was not common knowledge. 

(c) At 11:59 am , Podrasky sent an email to the offender and other board members. Attached to the email were further documents about the proposed investment. Those documents included an operations and due diligence plan, a WHL project cash flow summary, a WHL budget for May to December 2008 covering all its projects on a monthly timeline, a letter dated 14 April 2008 from a consulting geologist Gregory Maynor, a resume of key personnel (including a summary of qualifications for the proposed manager of the project, Orville Cole) and some project drilling maps. 

(d) At 1.39pm Podrasky replied to the offender's 9:39 am email by answering each of the five questions and saying in relation to the fourth, ""Yes, we should change the website and possibly our corporate name to WHL Energy"" . The offender responded 10 minutes later, saying "" Thanks Larry. I felt the answers would be positive but I have to due (sic) my Independent Director due diligence.... "". 

(e) At 4:20 pm , Pearce sent an email to Podrasky, the offender and the other directors, to which he attached a series of documents that he had prepared. They included cash flow projections for the period from August 2008 to May 2028, revenue projections for 20 years after WHL's intended investment, projected net present value calculations per share, an internal rate of return that WHL could expect to derive from its investment in the project over the first twenty years, and a pro-forma balance sheet based upon the acquisition proceeding. 

The 4.20pm email and its attachments constitute the second item of inside information which the offender possessed. 

The Board Meeting of 6 May 2008 

On 6 May , the WHL board met for more than two hours and discussed the project in detail. The offender was present and was actively involved in discussions about the project. The meeting was chaired by Podrasky. The documents attached to Podrasky's email of 5.05pm on 4 May, and Pearce's email of 4.20pm on 5 May, were tabled at the meeting. Podrasky explained the nature of the opportunity to the board, including the arrangements whereby WHL would ""farm-in"" to Derby's fifty per-cent share of the joint venture with Rolland. He also explained that WHL would receive an interest in two-thirds of Derby's fifty percent of the joint venture in return for funding one hundred percent of Derby's initial commitments. 

The minutes of the meeting dealt with what was described as the "" Kentucky Shale Gas Joint Venture "", and included, amongst other things, the fact that the board had noted that the estimated gas price for the project to break even was US$3.50 while the current gas price in the US was approximately US$11.50. The minutes further noted that Podrasky had an indirect material interest in the project and that he had abstained from voting. 

The signed minutes record, inter alia, that the Board resolved: 

(a) to enter into a letter of intent and two memoranda of understanding in relation to the project; 

(b) that Podrasky be given authority to sign the letter of intent and memoranda of understanding; 

(c) that a meeting of shareholders be convened to seek approval for a change in the nature of WHL's business and to change its name; and 

(d) that WHL make an initial deposit of up to US$125,000 to secure its rights under the letter of intent and memoranda of understanding. 

The board resolutions were signed by Podrasky on 23 May 2008 after having been circulated to the directors . The discussion of the investment proposal at the Board meeting, and the resolutions passed in relation to it, constitute the third item of inside information which the offender possessed. 

At the meeting, the offender asked a number of questions about the proposed project. The minutes of the meeting record that one of the offender's questions was, "" When will we have to notify the market? Is it at the end of Due Diligence? "". The offender disputes the accuracy of that record. 

Letter of Intent 

At about 5:00 am on 8 May Podrasky signed the letter of intent. The letter of intent established the basic terms of a sale and purchase agreement involving a joint venture between Derby, WHL and Rolland on one part, and a company known as NAFG LLC on the other part, by which the former agreed collectively to acquire 100% ownership of the Morgan County Gas Project owned by NAFG LLC. Podrasky organised for the signed letter to be sent to a J. Allen White for signature on behalf of NAFG LLC. 
That same day the TSX issued a press release announcing the signing of the letter of intent. The press release only referred to Rolland and to Derby, and did not mention WHL. On 8 May Podrasky received by fax from White an executed copy of the letter of intent, bearing all necessary signatures. 

At 10:56 am that day, Podrasky sent an email to the offender and the other directors in which he described as "" good news "" the fact that the letter of intent had been signed that morning with the vendor, and that the deal had been negotiated without putting up a 10% deposit. Podrasky observed in the email that there was no upfront "" earnest money "" required to tie up the deal and perform due diligence, that the full purchase price of US$2.5million would be due in 45 days, that a Notice to Shareholders was being prepared, and that he and Pearce had a due diligence conference call with members of the other parties scheduled for the following morning. This email constitutes the fourth item of inside information possessed by the offender. 

At 11:05 am the same day, Podrasky sent an email to the offender and other directors attaching a link to a website operated by Bloomberg. The subject heading of the email was ""U.S. Gas Prices"". The website showed that gas was selling in the USA for approximately US$10 per MMBTU (Million British Thermal Units), which was close to historical highs. At the board meeting on 6 May there had been discussion about the price at which the joint venture had to be able to sell gas produced by the project in order for it to be profitable, and the figure mentioned was approximately US$4-5 per MMBTU. 

On 9 May , the first Memorandum of Understanding ("" First MOU "") was signed between the three purchasing companies, Derby, Rolland and WHL.The First MOU referred to the letter of intent, and stated that Rolland, Derby and WHL had agreed to enter a joint venture in order to acquire the Kentucky shale gas project. It set out the relative interest each would take in the joint venture, namely: Rolland, 50%; WHL, 66.67% of 50%, being 33.33%; and Derby, 33.33% of 50%, being 16.67%. The intention was for WHL to ""farm-in"" to Derby's 50% interest in the proposed joint venture with Rolland, so that WHL was not in fact a party to the proposed joint venture agreement. The directors were notified of the execution of the document. 

At 5:24 pm on that day, Pearce sent to the directors, including the offender, an email with the heading "" Draft notice of general meeting "". Attached to the email were the following draft documents: Chairman's letter to shareholders, notice of extraordinary general meeting of shareholders, explanatory statement, glossary and proxy form. The draft letter referred to a May 2008 announcement by the company of a decision to diversify into complementary energy operations and said that for this reason approval was sought from shareholders to make a significant change to the nature of its activities to include gas production and complementary energy projects as well as approval to change the name of the company to reflect its new direction. The draft notice of general meeting set out resolutions to give effect to the proposed changes. The proposed change to the nature of the company's business detailed in the draft explanatory statement was the US Kentucky shale gas investment opportunity. The proposed date for the shareholders' meeting was 20 June. The draft letter began, "" On xx May, the company announced that it had made a decision to diversify into complementary energy operations "". This email and its attachments constitute the fifth item of inside information possessed by the offender. 

At 9:58 am on 10 May the offender sent an email to Podrasky, copied to Pearce, on the subject "" notice "". He described the draft notice as "" a very fine document "". He also said: ""I have one suggestion and that is that in your Chairman's letter in para 2 , you mention the rationale for the change in business being the development of risk diversification and bringing forward (sic.) earnings (or words to that effect). I don not (sic) think we can assume everyone will read the full document, but they will read the Chairman's letter, so I think we need to get in early with an attractive rationale. "" The offender also wrote, in reference to an entry at page 21 , ""... I now have 1,700,000 million shares by way of my superfund and hence indirect interest "". He also said, "" I hope we will be able to hit the 20 th target date as the following week I am in New Zealand (and I would like to be at this meeting )"". 

The offender's superannuation fund CSF owned one million WHL shares prior to the 11 March buy order, to which 700,000 shares were added in March and April. 

At 11:00 am on 13 May , Podrasky sent an email to the offender and the other directors in which he reported that, following the TXS market response to Rolland's announcement of its joint venture with Derby to acquire Morgan County (namely that the share price of Rolland had tripled with a huge volume traded), Derby had received better offers and had put forward a request for a finder's fee of 5 million WHL shares. Podrasky supported the proposal. 

The offender replied a little over an hour later at 12:06 pm , saying that, 

""Properly announced to the Australian market, the new look WHL Energy has a very good prospect in my judgment of exciting 'buy' interest and pushing up our share price both short and long term"". 

The offender wrote that he supported Podrasky "" closing this deal as quickly as possible "". Pearce and Pritchard also responded by agreeing with Podrasky's proposal. 

Later that same day, the second Memorandum of Understanding ("" Second MOU ""), being the farm-in Memorandum of Understanding between WHL and Derby, was signed by Podrasky. It incorporated the issue of 5 million WHL shares to Derby as a finder's fee. 

At 8:06 am on 14 May , the offender sent an email to Podrasky with the subject heading ""LOI"" in which he asked whether there was "" Any good news on the LOIs being signed? "" At 9:57 am that day, Podrasky replied, "" Waiting for David's signature to be scanned. "" The 8 May letter of intent and the First MOU did not have anyone called "" David "" as a signatory. However, the Second MOU did. 

At 11:53 am that same day, the offender sent an email to Podrasky entitled "" Looking ahead - a bit. "" It addressed the issue of how to manage the announcement and the mechanics of the gas joint venture. In it, the offender suggested two things. The first was that if Podrasky decided to have a shareholders' vote on David Khan coming on the Board, as opposed to directors simply appointing him, he thought it was appropriate to give the big shareholders a "" heads up "". Secondly, he said that because WHL was not followed by any analysts he thought it would be very beneficial if they got someone who could assist Podrasky in getting an "" Announcement Pack/meeting "" in front of the relevant Sydney analysts so that they could get as much interest as possible on this "" first really significant foray into braoder [sic] business model "". 

At 8:33 am on 15 May , Podrasky informed the offender that he had received the "" Signed LOI from David "". At 12.19 pm the offender replied, 

""Well done Larry. I'm absolutely of the opinion that this braodening [sic] in our direction is the best thing that could happen to the company right now"". 

Podrasky provided documents regarding the project to the directors on a confidential basis. His understanding was that all discussions in relation to the project at the relevant time were to be on a confidential basis. 

The Second MOU was announced on the TSX at 7:49 am on 15 May (Canadian Eastern Daylight Time), which equates to 9:49 pm on 15 May, Sydney time. At 9.47am on 16 May an announcement was made to the ASX that WHL had signed the second MOU. 

E. Buy orders for WHL shares placed by the offender in May 2008 

At 11:26 am on 11 May (which was a Sunday), the offender sent an email to Cameron entitled "" share transactions "". He advised that he was depositing money into the CSF account the following morning. He directed the sale of certain other shares "" immediately "", and asked Cameron to start purchasing "" as qucikly [sic] as practicable up to $50,000 worth "" of WHL shares as soon as funds were available. He stated that at that point in time he was willing to pay up to 11c to see if they (being he and Ms Clisby via their superannuation fund) could get another 500,000 shares. A Chris Monaghan at ABN AMRO entered the order the following day, 12 May, for the purchase of the 500,000 shares. 

On 12 May CSF contracted to buy 100,000 WHL shares at 9 cents per share with a settlement date of 15 May ( the first set of trades ). This was executed in two tranches following a 9 cent bid for 100,000 shares at 4.08 pm, which resulted in two trades at 4.10 pm for 77,650 shares and for 22,350 shares respectively. The shares were subsequently paid for out of the Macquarie CSF cash management account on the settlement date. A trading advice was sent to the offender by email at 8.14 pm on 12 May advising him of the purchase of 100,000 shares in WHL that day, together with the price paid and the amount due to be paid. 

On 13 May CSF contracted to buy 140,000 WHL shares at 9.8 cents per share with a settlement date of 16 May ( the second set of trades ). This was executed in two tranches following a 9.8 cent bid for 140,000 shares entered at 4.09 pm, which resulted in two trades at 4.11pm for 40,000 shares and for 100,000 shares respectively. The shares were subsequently paid for out of the Macquarie CSF cash management account on the settlement date and were the subject of a trading advice sent to the offender by email at 8:15 pm that night. 

On 14 May CSF contracted to buy 160,000 WHL shares at an average price of approximately 9.8cents per share with a settlement date of 19 May ( the third set of trades ). This was executed in four tranches:- 

(a) following a 9.5 cent bid which resulted in a trade for 45,000 shares at 12:42 pm; and 

(b) following a 9.6 cent bid for 115,000 shares entered at 3:45pm, amended at 4:09 pm to 9.9 cents, resulting in three trades at 4:10 pm for 12,700 shares, 10,000 shares and 92,300 shares respectively. 

The shares were subsequently paid for out of the Macquarie CSF cash management account on the settlement date and were the subject of a trading advice sent to the offender by email at 8:13 pm that night. 

About an hour later, at 9:12 pm the offender sent an email to Cameron in which he said, 

""looks like you'll fill that order for 500,000 WHL shares by week's end based on what is transpired so far. That being the case, I would like to up the numbers slightly to 550,000 total, in other words another 150,000 (if my arithmetic is correct and we've brought 400,000 to date)"". 


On 15 May CSF contracted to buy 105,339 WHL shares at 9.9 cents per share with a settlement date of 20 May ( the fourth set of trades ). This was executed in three tranches:- 

(a) following a 9.9 cent bid for 50,000 shares entered at 9.53am, which resulted in a single trade for 50,000 shares at 10:08 am; and 

(b) following an 8.3 cent bid for 100,000 shares entered on 12 May 2008, which was subsequently amended to a bid of 9.9 cents on 15 May which resulted in two trades, one for 5,339 shares and one for 50,000 shares, both at 3.49pm. 

The shares were subsequently paid for out of the Macquarie CSF cash management account on the settlement date and were the subject of a trading advice sent to the offender by email at 8:17 pm that night. 

On 16 May CSF contracted to buy 44,661 WHL shares at 10.5 cents per share with a settlement date of 21 May 2008 ( the fifth and final trade ). This was executed in one tranche, being the balance of the order for 100,000 shares entered the previous day, following the amendment of the price to 10.5 cents at 11.04am on 16 May, which resulted in a trade for 44,661 shares at 12.19pm. The shares were subsequently paid for out of the Macquarie CSF cash management account on the settlement date and were the subject of a trading advice which was sent to the offender by email at 8:14 pm that night. 

As a result of the execution of the order which he had placed on 11 May, the offender acquired a beneficial interest in a total of 550,000 WHL shares at between 9 cents and 10.5 cents per share. The total consideration for the shares was $53,497.97. 

F. The offender's communications with WHL regarding his share purchases 

On 12 May at 1.17pm , Pearce sent an email to the offender in which he referred to his presently holding 1.7 million shares in WHL through his superannuation fund. Pearce wrote, "" I note your direct interest has increased from 1,000,000 to 1,700,000 since the initial director's interest notice. "" Pearce sought information, for inclusion in an ""Appendix 3Y"" document to be provided to the ASX, regarding the share purchases, including the date of purchase, the consideration paid, details of the legal title holder, and details of the offender's percentage beneficial interest. Pearce wrote, inter alia , "" ... WHL needs to supply the ASX with changes in the interests of a director in the company within 5 business days of the change. "" The offender responded to Pearce by email at 2.37pm that day. He wrote, "" the legal entity is: Jeffrey Bateson & Geraldine Clisby Carmarthen Super Fund A/C: My interest is 50%"" . He provided the dates on which shares had been purchased between 17 March 2008 and 14 April 2008, at prices between 8 cents and 10 cents, and concluded, ""So 700,000 at an average price of about 9c"". On the basis of that information, Pearce prepared an Appendix 3Y Change of Director's Interest Notice to reflect the offender's March and April WHL share purchases, which he sent to the ASX on 13 May. 

Erene Keriakos had a standing instruction from Podrasky to monitor on a daily basis who was buying and selling WHL shares in the market. She normally provided the information to Podrasky about the previous day's trading by 10.00 am each day. On 16 May the documentation she provided to Podrasky indicated that there had been significant recent trading in a nominee name. 

At 9:31am on 16 May, Keriakos sent an email to the offender saying, ""I have just noticed from Computershare reports that there were 100,000 bought in the past few days under Bond Street Custodians Limited. Do you use Bond Street? and are these included in the list you have sent to Warwick [Pearce]? "" 

The offender responded by email at 11:34am the same day, ""ABN AMRO is, through Dixon Advisory completing a buy order that I had placed on behalf of my Superfund a couple of months ago. As I receive the confirmation settlement notices I shall you keep you informed. I haven't received anything regarding the 100,000 but that probably means that it is in the pipeline"" . The purchase in fact resulted from the offender's 11 May order and by then he had been notified that the purchase had been effected. 

At 3:32 pm that day, Pearce sent an email to the offender thanking him for his email to Erene Keriakos, and said, "" Noting your recent share trades/orders and WHL's present position and intentions, can we remind you of WHL's Share Trading Policy (a copy of which is attached) and the insider trading prohibitions under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). Could you please confirm that you have been complying with, and will continue to comply with, WHL's Share Trading Policy ."" Pearce's reference to ""WHL's present position and intentions"" was a reference to WHL's proposal to invest in the Kentucky Shale Gas project. 

The offender responded to Pearce's email, at 4:52 pm . He wrote inter alia, "" I can confirm unequivocally that I have complied with our Share Trading Policy. I determined to purchase WHL shares, and instructed my broker accordingly, in early March and what you see is the wash-up of those instructions. At the time I issued those instructions to my broker none of the deals that have very recently been before the Board were known ..."". He stated that his decision was based solely on his opinion that ""at, then, 8.5c a share, it would be attractive to increase my holding"". He stated that he believed his broker had secured the number of shares which he had identified, but that he had not got settlement confirmation and would advise when he had. Some time after he sent that email, the offender telephoned Pearce and explained that he had become aware of share purchases in addition to those that he had declared in his email of 12 May. He said they had been processed by his broker after his email of 12 May, and that he would give Pearce the details of the purchases once he had received the settlement notices from his broker. He said that he could not provide Pearce with information which would enable him to complete an updated Appendix 3Y for the ASX until he received it from his broker and until after he had returned from a fishing trip to New Zealand. 

In an email sent at 9.24 am on 17 May to Pearce, the offender again referred to a decision having been made over two months previously to increase his superannuation fund's WHL share holding. He asserted that there was no question of violating the letter or spirit of the company's share trading policy but did not refer to the share purchase order which he had placed on 11 May. He said, "" Normally I receive a weekly summary via email as to purchases and then, upon settlement an advice in the mail (within a day or two) confirming. Although I have not received any confirmations yet, I can tell you that I expect be receiving confirmation of the following outstanding purchases: ..."" He then listed 5 share parcels comprising 550,000 shares in WHL, with "" expected settlement dates "" from 15 May to 21 May. He said that he expected to receive confirmation of settlements in the following week, and that the "" wash up "" would be that the CSF would own 2,250,000 shares and that he, in his own name, would own 763,750 shares in WHL. In fact, at that point in time, the offender had already received email notifications of purchases from his broker. 

On 19 May at 12.53pm , Pearce sent a further email to the offender expressing concern that the offender may have breached the company's share trading policy and the Corporations Act 2001. Pearce made specific reference to the insider trading provisions in s 1043A of the Corporations Act , and stated that he was concerned that the offender had applied for shares during the period when he was in possession of inside information and that that expression pertained to any period in which an order to purchase shares was open. Pearce, proceeding upon the basis (as described by the offender) that the subject shares were ordered in early March 2008, wrote, "" My view is that whilst you advise that the order was placed in early March 2008, the application for shares was still open (and filled) subsequent to the board meeting held on 6 May 2008 at which price sensitive information became available to you and prior to the announcement of 16 May 2008. "" Pearce asked the offender to advise by return email why he believed that he had not contravened WHL's share trading policy and the Act. He referred to the seriousness of the matter and to the ramifications for the company. He also spoke of the need for the Board to act swiftly in the event that that there had been any breach of the policy or the Act. 

On 22 May at 4.09pm , the offender sent an email to Pearce and Podrasky attaching what he described as "" a comprehensive chronology of the shares that have been acquired by the Carmarthen Superannuation Fund (CSF) of which I have a 50% interest ."" He wrote, "" you will see, that the CSF issued two open orders, one for 700,000 (on 11 March) and one for 550,000 (on 11 May). Those trades that have occurred between 11 May to 16 May are listed, with details, for a further Appendix 3Y reporting. "" The attached chronology included the following statements: "" Carmarthen Superfund (""CSF""), of which I am a 50% beneficiary, decided on or about 8 March to purchase up to 1,250,000 shares in WHN. The reason to do so was my opinion that the share price had reached its nadir and that at 8c-10c it represented an excellent long-term investment ."" And later, "" The CSF decided, sometime during the week of May 5-9 to continue acquiring shares to reach the 1,250,000 goal, if possible, and how that should be funded ."" . 

In an email sent to Pearce at 4.59pm that day, the offender again referred to the May WHL share purchases having been initiated in March and said, ""...it did not enter my mind that the shares purchases that the Carmarthen Superfund had initiated in March...should be suspended..."" . 

At a Board meeting held on 23 May the offender's WHL share purchases of May 2008 were discussed. The minutes of that meeting record that the offender again explained that a decision had been made in March to purchase more shares in WHL at a time before the Board discussed purchasing the Kentucky shale gas assets. The minutes record that, "" The board noted that Dr Bateson had placed an open order with his stock broker that was temporarily unable to be fulfilled due to a lack of funds in his current account and this explained the gap in purchasing between 14 April 2008 and 12 May 2008."" There was no reference in the minutes to a fresh May buy order having been placed by the offender. 

On 30 June 2008, Podrasky and Pearce asked the offender for his resignation. The offender tendered his resignation by email the following day, 1 July. He said, "" While I dispute any wrong doing, the situation does not, I believe, permit me to continue on the Board of WHL Energy as to do so may not be in the best interest of the Company "". His resignation was immediately notified to the ASX by Pearce. 

G. Materiality of the Information 

An expert retained by ASIC, Andrew Frazer, who has been an investment advisor and stock broker since 1992, reviewed the Information possessed by the offender and concluded that, in his opinion, it was material. That is, if the information were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of WHL shares. 

H. Record of interview conducted on 1 September 2008 

On 1 September 2008, the offender participated in a recorded interview with officers of ASIC. When asked about the May share purchases, the offender did not deny the share transactions and did not suggest that the information available to him was not confidential. Nor has the offender ever sought to deny that the information was not generally available. 

He told investigators that he had always intended to buy 1.25 million WHL shares, and that he had always intended to buy the further 550,000 shares which were the subject of the 11 May order, as amended on 14 May. The following exchange then occurred: 

Mr Waschl: When you made the decision to purchase 1.3 million or 1.25 million Wind Hydrogen shares what was the reason that you didn't 

Offender: Well, at that time I looked at the cash we had available in the super fund and whether or not we would have to put anything in, or whatever, and I just picked that number because that is about how much cash we had available. In fact we actually ran out on that tranche and I had to transfer some money from one of the linked bank accounts that the super fund has to get to that first 750,000, and also in the back of my mind I thought I'd wait and see what happens to the share price. I mean for all I know it could have taken off. Then again it could've got- and what it did was sit again round about that eight to ten cent range, which is what I had identified originally as the trigger for wishing to purchase."" 

The offender also admitted that he understood the company's policy about insider trading. He explained his understanding in the following terms: 

""If you were in possession of information that was not in the general market and it was information that would manifestly cause(d) somebody to do something that they would otherwise not do, either sell shares or buy shares, some other action, that you oughtn't to trade in the shares. ...And just for the record I don't believe I have done anything that is either illegal or wrong from a moral point of view or whatever you want to put it"" . 

I. WHL Shareholding 

The offender, in his capacity as a beneficiary of the CSF, acquired a beneficial interest in the 550,000 WHL shares the subject of the charge at between 9 cents and 10.5 cents per share. Between 1 April 2008 and 30 May 2008, WHL's share price ranged from 8.1 cents to 14.5 cents. 

In September 2009 CSF also took up its full entitlement of WHL right shares purchasing 750,000 shares at 4 cents per share. The CSF sold 1,275,000 shares in WHL on 26 March 2010 at between 3.7 cents and 4 cents per share. As at 10 February 2011, the offender held, either personally (763,750 shares) or beneficially through CSF (1,725,000 shares), a total of 2,488,750 shares in WHL. The closing price for WHL shares on 10 February 2011 was 3.5cents. 

The evidence for the offender 

5The offender did not give, nor call evidence at the sentence hearing. He relied, in advancing his case, upon a large number of testimonials and other documentation which included a pre-sentence report. The offender is now aged 58. He has been married for more than 30 years and his wife remains supportive of him. There are no children of the marriage. The offender spent his formative years in Canada before coming to Australia. His father was a career Army officer and was apparently a strict disciplinarian. Nevertheless he remains in close contact with both his father and his brother who still live in Canada. The offender is clearly highly intelligent. At university he acquired an Honours degree in Science, a Masters degree in Nuclear Engineering and a doctorate in Finance and Economics. He has also completed a Senior Executive Program and the Australian Institute of Company Directors' Course. 

6The offender has worked in a number of high profile positions in the public and corporate sectors both here and overseas, mainly in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. A colleague, Mark Snape, indicated that he has known the offender for more than 20 years. He described some of the offender's professional achievements in the following terms: 

He has worked at senior levels in the NSW Government (Chief Economist for NSW Treasury) and with some of the world's largest corporations including as Associate Director County Natwest Corporate Finance Australia (the Australian subsidiary of the UK Investment Bank), Head of Strategy for China Light & Power (a Hong Kong listed power company) and Chief Financial officer for National Power (a UK listed power company). I am also aware that Dr Bateson has served as non-executive director of various listed and unlisted companies. 

7Mr Snape then outlined the nature of his contact with the offender. He said that he had known him: 


As a colleague, at County Natwest between 1994 and 1995 [where] we worked closely as part of the corporate finance group providing advice to governments and corporate entities on the privatization of government business; 
As a business partner and co-director from 1997 to 2000. China Light and Power and American Electric Power established an incorporated joint venture in Australia, Australian Energy International Pty Limited, to bid for electricity generating companies Loy Yang Power and Southern Hydro when they were being privatized by the Victorian Government for the right to build, own, finance and operate Basslink, a high voltage transmission line between Tasmania and Victoria. Dr Bateson and I were directors of AEI, representing CLP and AEP respectively. 

8Dr Janet Roth is a friend of the offender. She works as a clinical psychologist and provided the following insight into his activities: 

My view is that Jeff is a brilliant and talented man who does his best to be helpful and contribute to his local community and broader society through his involvement on various boards, e.g. alternative energy companies, Century Asset Management, which operates and manages solar power generation assets, Wind Hydrogen Ltd, a renewable energy company, and Varuna. Until he was accused of this charge, Jeff worked pro bono approximately a half day a week for several years as the financial controller for Varuna, Australia's only national writing centre, which has a particular focus on remote and indigenous writers. The Dark Home, Varuna's premises, was gifted by the Eleanor Dark Foundation. 

9The offender and his wife returned to Australia from overseas in 2001. The testimonials which were tendered on his behalf speak uniformly of his reputation for honesty and integrity. Many of them were provided by people who have had considerable contact with the offender both in his private and professional life. Indeed, two were furnished by former directors who had served on the board of WHL with the offender. The offender's actions were described by a number of persons as ""being out of character"" and, in that context, particular reference was made to the fact that he had frequently, in his professional life, been in possession of sensitive information but had not misused it. Furthermore, the testimonials provide strong support for the proposition that the offender is remorseful and that he feels ashamed of his actions. The author of the pre-sentence report noted that the offender ""appeared to show remorse for his actions and stated that he accepted full responsibility for his offending behaviour. He also stated that in hindsight, he could see, no excuse for 'his behaviour and could find no way to justify' such"". 

10A newspaper article and a report on ASIC's website, which record the fact that the offender had entered a plea of guilty to the offence in the Local Court, were tendered in evidence. The adverse publicity which the offender has received has no doubt added to his sense of shame and humiliation. The material before the court strongly suggests that, as a result of these proceedings, the offender has withdrawn from the circles in which he used to mix and that he has become somewhat reclusive. A colleague, Alan Rich, expressed the opinion that the impact of the proceedings upon the offender has been ""devastating"" and that ""he has become a shadow of the man he was"". 

11The offender's wife provided a statement in which she observed that she and her husband had suffered from the financial burden of having to meet the legal expenses that are associated with these proceedings. I was informed that to date nearly $170,000 had been paid in legal fees with the expectation that a further considerable sum is still to be outlayed. It is common ground that, as a result of the offender's conviction for the present offence, he will be disqualified from holding corporate office for a period of 5 years: Rich v ASIC (2004) 220 CLR 129. Moreover, his age, the shame which he feels, as well as the realities of the business world, all suggest that the offender is unlikely to be able to work again in the corporate sector. The offender has of his own volition resigned from the two non-executive directorships to which Dr Roth referred, as a direct consequence of the charge having been laid against him in April 2010. Since then he has been effectively unemployed. He spends his time maintaining the matrimonial home and attending to other domestic matters. For some of this period the offender had assumed the major burden of looking after the needs of his elderly parents-in-law. The offender was in the habit of driving them around in order that they could attend doctor's appointments and to enable them to do their shopping and banking. He also assisted them with their daily chores. He was able to do so because he has more time at his disposal than does his wife, who runs two small retail shops in Leura which are open 5-6 days a week. Apart from assistance which may be provided to them by community organisations, the only other person who could attend to their needs is their son, but he lives in Canberra. Regrettably, since the sentencing proceedings commenced the offender's father-in-law has died. His mother-in-law, who is aged 88, is now even more dependent on the offender and his wife particularly as she is mourning the passing of her husband to whom she was married for 65 years. 

The relevant sentencing principles 

12In determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed, I must proceed in accordance with s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (the Act). In DPP v El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370, the Court of Criminal Appeal said: 

The language of the Act gives no support for the proposition that general deterrence has been removed from the list of criteria to be considered by a court sentencing a person for a Federal offence. On the contrary, s 16A(1) imposes on the Court the duty, which is its primary obligation, to ensure that the sentence or order ""is of severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence"". It is by this duty that the general principles of sentencing law are imported into the function of a court imposing a sentence on a Federal offender convicted of the offence. What will be ""appropriate"" will depend, in part, upon a consideration of fundamental notions, such as that of general deterrence. 

The list of particular considerations in s 16A(2) must be read as subject to the primary obligation of the court stated in s 16A(1). All that s 16A(2) requires is that the court should ""take into account"" the listed matters. They provide a catalogue of matters to be considered in determining the ""severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence"". [at 378] 

13Furthermore, I must not impose a sentence of imprisonment unless, having regard to all other available sentences, no other sentence is appropriate: s 17A of the Act. It is common ground that a sentence of imprisonment must be imposed. However, that is where the submissions of the parties diverge. On behalf of the offender, it was submitted that the combination of objective and subjective features of the case made the present offence ""an exceptional case of insider trading"" such that a sentence which did not have an actual custodial component should be imposed. Accordingly, it was submitted, that a fully suspended sentence ought to be imposed upon the offender, or, in the alternative, that an intensive correction order should be made. The Crown, on the other hand, submitted that a sentence entailing a period of full-time custody was required. 

14The principles which are applicable to sentencing for offences of insider trading were conveniently stated in R v Rivkin (2003) 198 ALR 400, in which Whealy J, as his Honour then was, said that: 

[t]he element of general deterrence is important in white collar crimes. It is of course, an important part of the sentencing process in all crimes. It is however, an especially important matter in crimes such as the present because of the need to mark out plainly to others who might be minded to breach their professional or related obligations that such conduct will generally merit, in appropriate cases, condign punishment. 

An important reason why this is so relates to the often remarked difficulty in detecting and investigating white collar crime. Insider trading is particularly hard to detect. It may often go unnoticed but where it occurs it has the capacity to undermine to a serious degree the integrity of the market in public securities. It has the additional capacity to diminish public confidence not only so far as investors are concerned but the general public as well. Moreover, this diminution in confidence may occur subtly and is not confined to the circumstances where a substantial insider trading transaction has taken place. There is a capacity to undermine and diminish public confidence in the market even where the offence may be shown as one which in some respects occupies a lower level of seriousness. This is likely to be particularly so in the case of an offender who occupies a substantial position as a trader and advisor in the market. 

It is especially important that the sentencing process provide a firm disincentive to the carrying out of illegal activities especially by those who are engaged in the securities industry. There is a need to sound, in effect, a clarion call to discourage illegal and unethical behaviour among company directors, company officers, brokers, traders, advisors and those who have a close connection through, for example merchant banking, to the stock market: (See Regina v Pantano (1990) A Crim R 328 at 330; Regina v Andrew Peter White (NSWCCA unreported, 20 August 1998); Regina v Riccord (NSWCCA unreported 9 May 1997); Regina v El-Rashid (NSWCCA unreported 7 April 1995); Regina v Hawker [2001] NSWCCA 148 at para23 and para24; Regina v Pont (2000) NSWCCA 419; Regina v Hannes (2000) 158 FLR 389 at para394 (per Spigelman CJ); Regina v Hannes (James J) 13 December 2002 at para90; see also The Griffiths Report (1989) [1.2.1; 3.3.4 - 3.3.6; 4.3.4] Second Reading Speech to the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, p4215). [at para 44] 

15The damage caused by insider trading was described by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Rivkin (2004) 184 FLR 365 in the following terms: 
Nor is it correct to describe the offence ... as ""victimless"". The victim of any such offence is the investing community at large, the injury being that related to the loss of confidence in the efficacy and integrity of the market in public securities. [at para 412] 

16In R v Firns (2001) 51 NSWLR 548 Mason P observed that: 

On this approach, equality of access to the relevant market is the critical factor. Under this theory, restrictions on insider trading are designed to ensure that the market operates fairly, with all participants having equal access to relevant information. The playing field is to be levelled. [at para 50] 

17In R v Doff (2005) 54 ACSR 200; [2005] NSWCCA 119 , the Court of Criminal Appeal, in the context of dismissing a Crown appeal, observed that: 

[w]e do not, in this respect, suggest that anything other than a stern approach should be taken to offences of insider trading for the reasons earlier identified. It remains a serious offence, and there needs to be a considerable deterrent aspect reflected in order to protect the integrity and efficacy of the market. Those in a position of trust who receive price sensitive information in relation to securities are expected to conform to exacting standards of honesty, and transgression can normally be expected to lead to custodial sentences as well as to pecuniary penalties. [at para 56] 

18In DPP v O'Reilly [2010] VSC 138, T Forrest J said that: 

[I]n insider trading cases I consider there are at least two victims; the seller or sellers of the stock at the lower price and the public, whose confidence in the integrity of the market must be diminished. The impact upon public confidence in the market is an important factor. The securities markets could not survive and flourish without the confidence of those who elect to invest in it. [at para 19] 

19In R v Hartman [2010] NSWSC 1422, McClellan CJ at CL said that: 
[I]t must be remembered that his crimes were not victimless. Each illegal transaction was likely to have a cost to someone, who either traded or held their position, without the benefit of the knowledge available to the offender. The offender set about systematically trading in breach of the law for the sole purpose of enhancing his personal wealth at the expense of others. [at para 45] 

20It is also timely to recall the remarks of the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales in R v McQuoid [2009] EWCA Crim 1301; [2009] 4 All ER 388, in which His Lordship observed that: 

[t]hose who involve themselves in insider dealing are criminals: no more and no less. The principles of confidentiality and trust, which are essential to the operations of the commercial world, are betrayed by insider dealing and public confidence in the integrity of the system which is essential to its proper function is undermined by market abuse. ... The message must be clear: When it is done deliberately, insider dealing is a species of fraud; it is cheating. [at paras 8-9] 

21It is clear from those pronouncements just how seriously the courts treat offences of this kind. 

The objective gravity of the offence 
22A critical aspect of the sentencing process is an assessment of the objective gravity of the offence under consideration. It was submitted by senior counsel who appeared on behalf of the offender that the ""nature and circumstances of the offence"" were such as to place it ""in the mid-range of objective seriousness"". [I pause to observe that that expression does not have the significance that it assumes in relation to State offences in respect of which a standard non-parole period is applicable]. A number of features of the case were relied upon as providing support for that characterisation of the offence. First, it was submitted that it was important to have regard to the context in which the shares were acquired. It was pointed out that the offender had, for a number of years, been a non-executive director of WHL and indeed, for a period of time, had served as its chairman. Emphasis was placed on the fact that the offender had, on no fewer than five previous occasions, ""supported the company by capital raisings prior to the company raising money from the public and that he still held those shares at the time of the offence"". As I understand the submission, it was contended that as a long-term investor the offender had always acted in promoting the company's best interests. Secondly, it was submitted that the present offence was quite unlike those cases in which an ""offender obtained the insider information and then used it to acquire shares for the purpose of making a quick profit"". The present case, it was submitted, was also distinguishable upon the basis that not only had the offender not made a profit, but he had suffered a substantial loss. Thirdly, it was submitted that the extent of the offender's criminal venture was relatively modest given the amount of money that had been invested and the number of shares which had been purchased. Fourthly, it was submitted that far from the offence arising from a lengthy course of conduct, it had been committed within a relatively short timeframe. Counsel went so far as to describe the offender's conduct as ""a single, isolated, aberrant act"". That submission, when developed, was to be understood against the background that the offender had frequently been in possession of highly confidential information in the course of his professional life without previously misusing that information. Fifthly, it was submitted that ""no elaborate steps were undertaken by the offender to disguise the identity of the purchaser or the transaction"". In support of that submission, attention was drawn to the fact that the transactions in which the offender engaged in order to purchase the WHL shares were no different from the methods which he had previously used, including the fact that he had retained the same broker. The consequence, so it was submitted, was that the offender's connection to his superannuation account with that broker was readily traceable. The lack of subterfuge and sophistication meant, so it was submitted, that the offence was easier to detect than others of its kind. Sixthly, it was submitted that the offender's decision to acquire the 550,000 shares ""was not a new plan to buy those shares. He had always intended to do so. He reactivated his original decision. The insider information brought about the reactivation but it was not a new idea to buy."" Finally, unlike in other cases, it was submitted that the offender had not sought to involve third parties in his criminal conduct. 

23On the other hand, the Crown submitted that the offender should be characterised as a ""true insider"", that is, a person who was a director of the board in which the shares were acquired and who had obtained the inside information solely by dint of that position. That placed him in a different position from a person who may be described as a ""tippee"", that is, a person who is outside the relevant organisation but who has acquired inside information about its operations: see for example, Doff (supra) [at para 57]; R v Rivkin (2004) 184 FLR 365 [at para 409]. 

24The Crown stressed that general deterrence was vitally important in the present context because it is the only mechanism whereby the incidence of insider trading can be prevented from becoming widespread. People, like the offender, who are at the core of a company's operation must, it was submitted, be deterred from such conduct because they are ""the persons most likely to have access to material information that will never become generally available"". The Crown placed particular reliance upon the following passage from R v McKay (2007) 61 ACSR 470 in which Whealy J observed that: 

...the imposition of suspended sentences would send an inadequate message to the business and share trading community. It would not only give the appearance of inadequacy, it would, in fact, be totally inadequate. As I have observed in other matters, the real bite of general deterrence occurs only when an actual custodial sentence is imposed : see Howie J in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [29]-[32]; and R v Boulden [2006] NSWSC 1274 at [51] per Whealy J. In addition, there would be little achieved by the suspension of sentences in the present matter. The offender is fully rehabilitated and will not offend again. That consideration provides an additional reason why suspended sentences are not appropriate in the present matter . [at para 73] 


25The Crown's submissions appeared to proceed upon the basis that the sentence imposed in that case, namely periodic detention, did achieve the ""real bite"" to which his Honour referred. 

26The Crown acknowledged that the offender had not ultimately derived a profit from the beneficial interest which he had acquired in the WHL shares as a result of insider trading. The Crown submitted that although that was a relevant consideration, it nonetheless required evaluation in the light of the potential profit which the offender stood to gain. It was submitted that at the time he placed the order, the offender was aware, from the information which he had received, that WHL's involvement in the Kentucky project had the potential to add value of up to 85 cents per share in the company. It was pointed out that the shares themselves were purchased for between 9 and 10.5 cents each and that they were thus potentially capable of yielding a substantial profit. Moreover, it was submitted that it was to be inferred that the offender assumed that the share price was likely to increase. With that in mind, it was submitted that the offender acted as he did, when he did, ""to avoid paying a premium on the price likely to be brought about by the information becoming generally available"". The Crown submitted that that anticipation was realised because, at least initially, the share price did rise quite sharply from 9 cents on 12 May to 14.5 cents on 30 May. The Crown, in any event, relied upon the observations of Barr J in R v Doff [2005] NSWSC 50 in which his Honour said that: 

[i]t seems to me that the amount invested is a more important indicator of criminality than the amount ultimately realised from the criminal activity concerned. One would not regard as trivial, the criminality of an insider trader who ventured much but lost. [at para 31] 

27The Crown submitted that whilst the period of the offending conduct may have been of relatively short duration, the offender nonetheless received regular updates concerning the on-going filling of the buy order but did not avail himself of the various opportunities which presented themselves, over a period of about 5 days, to cancel the order. The Crown emphasised that, on the contrary, he had amended the buy order so that 550,000 shares, rather than 500,000 as was initially proposed, were acquired. That conduct prompted the Crown to describe the offender's actions as being quite deliberate and certainly not the product of an isolated decision arrived at on the spur of the moment. Allied to that submission, was a contention that the offender had endeavoured to conceal his offending conduct from the company in order to avoid detection. Moreover, it was pointed out that he had told deliberate untruths on a number of occasions to officers of the company, at a time when they were merely trying to ascertain the true state of affairs. The offender's lack of candour with those officers, it was submitted, demonstrated that he knew that his actions were against the law. 

28I accept that the various factors identified by counsel for the offender, particularly when taken in combination, serve to reduce in a meaningful way, the overall seriousness of the offender's conduct. It is common ground that the consequence is that his offence is considerably removed from being in the worst case of its kind. Nevertheless, it remains a case of considerable gravity. As the Crown submitted, an offence committed by a true insider is usually regarded as being more serious than one committed by a ""tippee"": see McKay (supra) [at paras 55-6]; O'Reilly (supra) [at para 18]. Furthermore, a number of the other matters advanced by the Crown place the submissions made on the offender's behalf into their proper perspective. In particular, it should not be overlooked that even though the offender had a history of investing in the company, and even though he may have demonstrated a commitment to furthering the company's long-term interests, his motivation for involving himself in the present offence reeked of self-interest and avarice. In short, he had seen an opportunity, based upon information which he had received on a confidential basis, and then had sought to capitalise upon it for personal reward. Therein lies his true criminality. It is conduct of that kind that the law must deter to ensure that the integrity of the securities market itself, and the interests of those who invest in it, are protected. 

29Before leaving this aspect of the matter, there is one further matter to which I should refer. The Agreed Statement of Facts reveal that the offender instructed Cameron on 11 May to start purchasing WHL shares ""as qucily [sic] as practicable up to $50,000 month"". Although the exigencies of the situation may suggest why the offender used that language, it should be observed that he also used similar language when issuing his earlier instruction on 11 March to Cameron to purchase shares, namely to do so ""as expeditiously as possible"". 

The offender's subjective features 

30There are a number of features of the case upon which the offender is entitled to rely in order to ameliorate the otherwise appropriately penalty. At the forefront of those considerations is the fact that he has pleaded guilty, and that he did so at the earliest opportunity. The Crown accepts that the fact that the plea was entered at the earliest opportunity may be taken to demonstrate a ""willingness to facilitate the course of justice"": Cameron v The Queen (2002) 209 CLR 339. Although as I have said, the offender did not give evidence before me, the Crown accepts the evidence that the offender is truly remorseful for his actions. Moreover he voluntarily participated in a record of interview with ASIC officers, during the course of which, he made some admissions concerning his offending conduct. Although he disputed that he knew that the information was price sensitive, he did recognise that he ought reasonably to have known that it was price sensitive. During the sentence hearing senior counsel for the offender explicitly conceded that the plea was entered upon the basis that he did, in fact, have the requisite knowledge. That suggests that the offender has now come to appreciate the criminality of his actions and to accept responsibility for them, although, as I earlier indicated, he had originally told ASIC officers that he had not done anything wrong either legally or morally. Indeed, he had expressed a similar attitude when tendering his resignation as a WHL board member. 

31The significance which should be attributed to these matters was expressly recognised by senior counsel who appeared on behalf of the Crown. Given the prominence which counsel gave to them, it is worth setting out that part of his oral submissions. He said: 

Your Honour, these offences go into the realms of the difficulty of detection. The five stage process in the criminal process of detection, investigation, prosecution, conviction and punishment is difficult at every stage along the way for insider trading offences. If you are dealing at the other end of the spectrum, once someone is caught out with an RBT all five flow and in many other offences the hardest thing is finding out and everything else gets easy. Certainly detection is the hardest, but the rest is by no stretch easy. These are hard cases to detect. These are hard cases to prosecute. It is difficult to get convictions and then punishment at the end of the day. 

...the single most cogent proof of contrition ordinarily a court will say is the guilty plea. The proof of contrition and remorse is an early guilty plea. In order to plead guilty, and it is particularly apposite for white collar offences because you are not dealing with someone who has had a previous poor background, but someone who has had a pretty good background, and in the case of this offender it is not in doubt that this man has had an exemplary background. He has been a person who has contributed to society well beyond his own interests. In order to plead guilty an offender has to admit to themselves what they have done and that it was wrong and that is often a big hurdle for anyone who has never seen themselves as a criminal and it is this realisation in the absence of any specific deterrence and rehabilitation and in those circumstances rehabilitation is either well on the way or complete. 

As a matter of simple observation, this wasn't an ordinary guilty plea. It was early. Comprehensive facts were agreed to. But, importantly, the offender has not kept secret what he has done. This is not a sentence where he sits alone with the parish priest to come along and comment upon what he has done. He has told his wife, his parents-in-law, long time friends and business associates. The distress that he has clearly suffered puts his guilty plea at a high level. ... 

The offender, without a shadow of doubt, deeply regrets what he has done, not just that he has been caught, and what I conclude with is that that sort of guilty plea is to be encouraged and given full recognition by your Honour on the remarks on sentence because these are offences that are so hard to investigate and prosecute successfully. Of course, the investigation phase did have to take place here, but the prosecution phase beyond the sentence did not. 

Your Honour, I don't say these things out of charity, but because it is in the community's interest to see that guilty pleas are given real weight in the courts. That is the early plea and the right kind of sorry. Not everyone considering that position upon being charged will have received may I respectfully say the benefit of the calibre of the advice that this offender has had from my learned friend and, with respect, your Honour's remarks on sentence need to spell that out in blunt language because these cases are reported upon much more than other matters. There is little crime reporting that takes place in the newspapers beyond the sensational. This area is an area that is watched and reported upon and making those things clear will serve to assist in the advising of others for years to come. So they are important. I know it is a little unusual in one sense coming from the Crown, but they are important matters for your Honour to take into account. 
We don't say in making any of those submissions that changes the objective seriousness or the starting point, but it has a bearing on your Honour's consideration of the final resting point and where your Honour considers this matter should be taken. 

32Given those observations, it is timely to recall that in R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, Spigelman CJ observed that: 

[I]n some cases the plea, in combination with other relevant factors, will change the nature of the sentence imposed. [at para 160] 

33Also to be weighed in the offender's favour is the evidence concerning his prior good character. That is not a matter which should be overlooked or given only cursory consideration. In arriving at that conclusion, I observe that I have entirely disregarded his conviction for an offence of drink driving. Nevertheless, the authorities have recognised that it is often an offender's prior good character and standing within the community that enables him or her to be placed in the position of trust from which he or she is then able to commit the offence in question. 

34In R v El Rashid (NSWCCA unreported, 7 April 1995), Gleeson CJ said: 
""It may be observed that, what is sometimes called white collar crime is rarely committed by people who do have a criminal history. Such people do not usually find themselves with the opportunity to commit offences of that character."" (at p 3) 

35In R v Rivkin (2004) 184 FLR 365, the Court of Criminal Appeal referred to that passage and said that "" the relevance of good character is of lesser significance for white collar crimes "" [at para 410] . 

36I n McQuoid (supra), Lord Judge CJ said that: 

[t]hose who are entrusted with advance knowledge are entrusted with that knowledge precisely because it is believed they can be entrusted. When they seek to make a profit out of the knowledge and trust reposed in them, or indeed when they do so recklessly, their criminality is not reduced or diminished merely because they are individuals of good character. [at para 8] 

37I also accept that the fact that the offender will be convicted is, in itself, an important part of the process of punishment. In Spies v R (2000) 173 ALR 529, the High Court quashed the conviction of an offender who had by then served the sentence which had been imposed upon him. The Court in determining that there should be a new trial said that: 

[i]f this court were now to refuse to order a new trial of that charge, the appellant would be acquitted of all charges. In addition, members of the commercial community as well as the general public have a vital interest in ensuring that directors who abuse their office and breach the criminal or company law do not escape conviction. [at para 103] 

38In R v Hannes (2000) 36 ACSR 72, Spigelman CJ in reaching a similar conclusion said that: 

[i]nsider trading offences, and the particular kind of offence under the Financial Transactions Reports Act are extremely difficult to detect. The issue of general deterrence is of great significance when it comes to sentencing. In the case of most white collar crimes of this character, the conviction is a very important part of the punishment: see Spies, above at [103]. [at para 394] 

39I have also taken into account the fact that the offender has received adverse publicity as a result of his offending behaviour and that he will not, in practical terms, be able to return to the corporate world. I have also weighed in the balance the financial burden under which he and his wife have laboured as a result of having to outlay a substantial sum of money on legal fees. I also accept that the offender has lost his reputation and had a significant fall from grace. His present circumstances underscore what for him, and his family, is nothing short of a personal tragedy. I have nevertheless had appropriate regard to what was said in Einfeld v R (2010) 266 ALR 598 by Basten JA [at paras 85-97] about the question of extra-curial punishment for someone in the position of the offender. 

40I have little difficulty in accepting that the offender is unlikely to re-offend. Moreover, his prospects of rehabilitation are extremely good, particularly given his prior good character and in light of the fact that he has pleaded guilty. In those circumstances there is no need for the sentence to reflect a component for personal, as distinct from general, deterrence. 

41It was submitted on behalf of the offender that consideration should also be given to the fact that hardship will, in all likelihood, be occasioned to the offender's mother-in-law in the event that he is incarcerated. The principles to be applied in cases involving hardship to a third party have been stated on a number of occasions. In R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510, Gleeson CJ, with the concurrence of the other members of the court, said: 

There is nothing unusual about a situation in which the sentencing of an offender to a term of imprisonment would impose hardship upon some other person. Indeed, as senior counsel for the respondent acknowledged in argument, it may be taken that sending a person to prison would more often than not cause hardship, sometimes-serious hardship, and sometimes-extreme hardship, to another person. It requires no imagination to understand why this is so. Sentencing Judges and Magistrates are routinely obliged, in the course of their duties, to sentence offenders who may be bread winners of families, carers, paid or unpaid, of the disabled, parents of children, protectors of persons who are weak or vulnerable, employers upon whom workers depend for their livelihood, and many others, in a variety of circumstances bound to result in hardship to third parties if such an offender is sentenced to a term of full-time imprisonment. 
... 

The real difficulty about a case such as the present, and many other cases in which imprisonment of an offender causes hardship to a third party, is to identify a ground upon which they can properly and relevantly be regarded as exceptional; regrettably, causing hardship to third parties by the imprisonment of an offender is only too common. Furthermore, as the Crown pointed out, if a hardship to (the invalid) were to be compared with a hardship that is commonly suffered by the spouse or children of a person sent to prison, it cannot be fairly categorised as exceptional in degree"". [at 515-6] 

42See also R v Maslen and Shaw (1995) 79 A Crim R 199; R v Hinton (2002) 134 A Crim R 286 and Dipangkear v R [2010] NSWCCA 156. 

43In my view, however, the present circumstances fall short of amounting to an exceptional case so far as hardship to a third party is concerned. There is nothing to suggest, for example, that the services which the offender currently provides cannot, albeit with some difficulty, be provided by others. Nonetheless, it is a factor to which I attach some weight in the overall sentencing process. 

44I was provided by the Crown with a schedule containing a large number of cases in which sentences have been imposed in respect of offences of insider trading. Those cases spanned the period between September 1991 and December 2010. To that schedule may be added the decisions in R v De Silva [2011] NSWSC 243 and in R v Dalzell [2011] NSWSC 454 which have been delivered since this hearing commenced. In Hili and Jones v R (2010) 272 ALR 465 a majority of the High Court, French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Keifel and Bell JJ made a number of observations, in their joint reasons, about the application of proper sentencing principles including the use that may be made of other cases. In particular their Honours pointed out that ""[c]are must be taken, however, in using what has been done in other cases"" [at para 53]. See also R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368; Doff (supra) [at para 58]; Rivkin (2004) 184 FLR 365 [at para 415]. 

45I have borne those considerations steadily in mind. Furthermore, there are several observations of a general nature which should be made about the schedule of cases with which I was provided. First, as would be expected, the cases reflect a diverse range of circumstances and sentencing outcomes. Secondly, some of the cases were decided quite some time ago, and accordingly, given more recent pronouncements by the courts, are of reduced utility. Thirdly, in respect of a number of offences committed in NSW, a sentence of periodic detention was imposed. Although that form of sentencing disposition was available at the time the present offence was committed, it is no longer available. Fourthly, the sentences were, for the most part, imposed at first instance and accordingly did not receive appellate scrutiny. In Hili (supra) the High Court observed that: 

""[c]onsistency in Federal sentencing is to be achieved through the work of the intermediate courts of appeal"" [at para 56]. 

46The parties made extensive submissions about the schedule of cases. Inevitably the focus was upon a comparison between the present case and the sentencing disposition in each of those cases. I have given careful consideration to those submissions but I do not consider it necessary to engage in the same exhaustive analysis as counsel did of the various features of each of the individual cases. I should record however that it is common ground that the criminality revealed in R v Hannes (2002) 173 FLR 1, in Hartman (supra), and in De Silva (supra), is decidedly more serious than that displayed by the offender. 

47Counsel for the offender also contended that the circumstances which obtained in various other cases such as R v Hall (No 2) [2005] NSWSC 890; R v Frawley [2005] NSWSC 585; McKay (supra) and R v Panchal [2009] QDC 105 all constituted more serious examples of insider trading offences. In Frawley and McKay sentences of periodic detention were imposed whilst in Panchal and Hall (No 2) , head sentences of 2 years and 2 years 1 month imprisonment respectively were imposed. It was submitted that those decisions also demonstrated that a sentence of considerably less than 2 years imprisonment was called for in the present case even before consideration was given as to how such a sentence should be served. As I understand it, the Crown accepts that the criminality, at least in the cases of Hall (No 2) and Frawley , was more significant than that displayed in the present case. 

48Counsel for the offender also placed very considerable reliance upon the decision in O'Reilly (supra). In that case, a fully suspended sentence was imposed upon an offender in a case which, it must be said, bears considerable similarities to the present case. There are of course, some differences, but nevertheless the course adopted in that case cannot, and nor was it suggested that it could, determine the sentence which ought to be imposed in the present case. The decision did not, for example, purport to indicate a range for offences of the kind under consideration. Nor, of course, does a question of parity arise. The Crown sought to draw a distinction between the factual circumstances in O'Reilly (supra) and the present case. It was submitted that in that case ""there was a single trade for the shares taking place at a single point in time, rather than multiple trades, over a week that occurred in the present case"". Nevertheless, I accept the submission made on behalf of the offender that little turns on that distinction because once the order to amend the purchase of the shares was given in the present case, it was then up to the broker to give effect to that order. 

49The parties also made extensive submissions in respect of Dalzell (supra) in which a term of imprisonment for a period of 2 years, to be served by way of an intensive correction order, was imposed. That offender was engaged as a team leader for KPMG Corporate Finance (Aust) Pty Limited which was retained to undertake ""a financial due diligence and a synergies due diligence"" for a private company in respect of the proposed acquisition of another company. His main focus was to ""evaluate the business"" of both companies. It was in that capacity that that offender acquired confidential information, and armed with that information, proceeded to purchase shares in the company that he was advising. There are, of course, factors which differentiate the two cases. Presumably, for example, the present offender, as a director of the company in which the illegal shares were purchased, had access to the full range of information about its operations whereas Mr Dalzell, as an adviser to a prospective purchaser, had access to a more limited range of information. As a director of the company, the present offender's breach of trust was probably also of a greater magnitude. On the other hand, Mr Dalzell had no long-term interest or involvement in the company in question and was apparently motivated by the prospect of a short-term profit. Nor was his plea of guilty entered at the earliest opportunity. There are also, I accept, considerable similarities between the two cases. However, having carefully assessed the two cases, I do not see any basis for accepting the contention advanced on the offender's behalf that the circumstances of that case were deserving of a more severe penalty than the present case. In any event, for reasons which I identified when discussing the decision in O'Reilly , the sentencing outcome in Dalzell cannot in any way determine the sentence that should be imposed in the present case. I also note that the sentencing judge in Dalzell observed that although that case involved serious criminality, it ""nonetheless takes its place towards the lower end of the range of insider trading cases"" [at para 154]. 

50Although I have derived some assistance from a consideration of the schedule of cases, and particularly those which are of a ""closely comparable"" nature: Hili & Jones (supra) [at para 64], in the final analysis, I am nevertheless bound to exercise my own discretion based upon all the features which are relevant in the present case. 

51As I have said, counsel for the offender's primary submission was that a suspended sentence should be imposed. To that end, counsel referred to the well-established principles which are to be applied by a court in imposing such a sentence. In Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 the High Court allowed an appeal from a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia in which a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of a sentence imposed at first instance had been upheld. As a consequence, the original order that the sentence was to be fully suspended was restored. Gleeson CJ and Hayne J, in their joint reasons, said: 

The Court concluded that the offences committed by the appellant ""were rightly found to be of sufficient seriousness to require the punishment of imprisonment to be imposed"", but concluded that because ""there was no rehabilitation process going on which merited the support of a suspended sentence"" there was no reason shown which ""dictated a merciful disposition of the case."" 

This inverts the order in which the statute requires a sentencing judge to consider matters. The sentencing judge must first decide the kind of punishment to be imposed. In this case that was understood as requiring a choice between imposing a term of suspended imprisonment and imposing imprisonment which the appellant would have to serve immediately. Only if satisfied that it is not appropriate to impose a term of suspended imprisonment may the judge impose a term of imprisonment which is to take effect immediately. 
... 
The discretion to impose a suspended sentence is not confined by considerations relating to rehabilitation. These will often be significant, but there may be other relevant matters, of the kind taken into account by the trial judge in the present case. [at paras 12-13, 18] 

52Gaudron and Gummow JJ in their joint reasons said: 

The sentence imposed by the trial judge was not ""manifestly wrong"" as being ""manifestly inadequate"". We also agree with Kirby J that the power to suspend given by s 76(1) of the Sentencing Act which is limited by the criteria specified in s 76(2),(3), is not confined by reference wholly, mainly or specially to the effect the suspension would have on the rehabilitation of the particular offender. [at para 26] 

53Kirby J said: 

In my view, to limit the exercise of the discretion to suspend a sentence of imprisonment by reference wholly, mainly or specially, to the effect which suspension would have on rehabilitation of the offender would constitute an error. There is nothing in the grant of the power, as expressed in the applicable legislation, to justify confining its availability in such a way. Had the legislature intended to limit the discretion to suspend by reference to such a consideration, it could have done so. 
... 

Moreover, the scheme of the legislation, and the two steps which s 76(1) and (2) of the Act requires, suggest, as a matter of construction, that the same considerations that are relevant for the imposition of the term of imprisonment must be revisited in determining whether to suspend that term. This means that it is necessary to look again at all the matters relevant to the circumstances of the offence as well as those personal to the offender. It would be surprising if the legislation were to warrant, at the second step, concentration of attention only on matters relevant to the offender, such as issues of the offender's rehabilitation and the court's mercy. ... 

Adopting this approach, then, permits attention to be given not only to the circumstances personal to the offender but also to the objective features of the offence. These may, in a particular case, outweigh the personal considerations of rehabilitation and mercy. They may require that the prison sentence be immediately served, despite mitigating personal considerations. This approach is consonant with the recognition in jurisdictions other than Western Australia of the ""complete discretion"" which, subject to the statute, the primary judge has in suspending a sentence of imprisonment. In other States, it has been considered undesirable to attempt to circumscribe the language of the statute by reference to supposed formulae, particular considerations or any other gloss. 
... 

The primary judge, on the other hand, had looked at the matter more broadly. He was obviously influenced in his decision about suspension by the prospects of rehabilitation on the part of the appellant, which he regarded as promising. But he also appears to have been influenced by all the circumstances and information available, including the nature of the particular offence, the low likelihood of the appellant's reoffending, and the impact which a prison sentence, immediately served, would have on the appellant and his family. The primary judge also mentioned the ""social stigma"" which necessarily followed the conviction, quite apart from a prison term. In my view, all of these were considerations available and proper to the decision of whether or not to suspend the term of imprisonment. [at paras 84-6; 88] 

54In R v Foster [2001] NSWCCA 215, Badgery-Parker J, with whom the other members of the court agreed, after citing the passage from the judgment of Kirby J to which I have just referred, said: 

Obviously, the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment which is then suspended for the whole of its term is a significantly more lenient sentencing order than the imposition of the like sentence not so suspended. Nevertheless, Australian courts have rejected the idea that a suspended sentence is really no punishment at all. In Elliot v Harris (1976) 13 SASR 516 at 527, Bray CJ commented upon that view - 

"" It reveals an entirely mistaken and wrong headed approach to the question of suspended sentences. So far from being no punishment at all, a suspended sentence is a sentence to imprisonment with all the consequences such as sentence involved on the defendant's record and his future, and it is one which can be called dramatically into effect on the slightest breach of the terms of the bond during it currency"". 


Those remarks were cited with approval by a full bench of the Federal Court in Regina v P (1992) 64 A.Crim. R 381; by Winneke P in Regina v Carter (1997) 91 A.Crim.R 222 at 229; and again by a full bench of the Federal Court in Regina v Gillan (1991) 54 A.Crim.R 475 at 480; 100 ALR 66. [at para 36]. 

55In R v JCE (2000) 120 A Crim R 18 the Court of Criminal Appeal rejected a submission made on behalf of the Crown in an appeal against the inadequacy of a fully suspended sentence that ""the respondent will be effectively unpunished"". Fitzgerald JA, with whom other members of the court agreed said that ""a suspended sentence of imprisonment is punishment"" [at para 25]. 

56In R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17, Howie J, with whom the other members of the court agreed, said: 

It is clear that, when sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment under that Act, a court is required to undertake a number of steps before finally determining the appropriate sentence. Each step requires the court to consider the objective gravity of the offence balanced against the subjective circumstances of the offender, but it is the first of those considerations that will principally determine which of the available sentencing alternatives the court should adopt. This is because at the end of the day the sentence must be commensurate with the seriousness of the crime: R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR(NSW) 554; R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594. 
... 

Once the term of the sentence has been determined the court is then to consider whether any alternative to full-time imprisonment is available in respect of that term and whether any available alternative should be utilised. ... But the appropriateness of an alternative to full time custody will depend on a number of factors, one of importance being whether such an alternative would result in a sentence that reflects the objective seriousness of the offence and fulfils the manifold purposes of punishment. The court in choosing an alternative to full time custody cannot lose sight of the fact that the more lenient the alternative the less likely it is to fulfil all the purposes of punishment: R v Jurisic at 250B. 
... 

As s 5 of the Act recognises, the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment is a grave step for a court to take whether or not the offender's liberty is immediately removed or curtailed. Section 5(2) requires a court, which imposes a sentence of imprisonment of 6 months or less, to indicate to the offender, and to record, its reasons for imposing such a sentence including the reasons why no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. These restrictions upon the power of a court to impose a sentence of imprisonment apply even if the sentence is suspended. A sentencing court, therefore, must recognise that a sentence of imprisonment can be a significant and effective punishment even where the execution of that sentence is suspended: JCE at [25], R v Foster at [36] where reference is made to statements to that effect in other jurisdictions. That is why, in the hierarchy of sentencing alternatives, a suspended sentence is considered as more severe than a community service order even though it may appear on its face to be less punitive. 

Further, a sentencing court must approach the imposition of a sentence that is suspended on the basis that it can be a sufficiently severe form of punishment to act as a deterrent to both the general public and the particular offender. Of course it must also be recognised that the fact that the execution of the sentence is to be immediately suspended will deprive the punishment of much of its effectiveness in this regard because it is a significantly more lenient penalty than any other sentence of imprisonment. The question of whether any particular sentencing alternative, including a suspended sentence, is an appropriate or adequate form of punishment must be considered on a case by case basis, having regard to the nature of the offence committed, the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the need for general or specific deterrence and the subjective circumstances of the offender. It is perhaps trite to observe that, although the purpose of punishment is the protection of the community, that purpose can be achieved in an appropriate case by a sentence designed to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender at the expense of deterrence, retribution and denunciation. In such a case a suspended sentence may be particularly effective and appropriate. [at paras 23; 28; 31-2] 

57See also Douar v The Queen (2005) 159 A Crim R 154 [at para 72]. 

58The alternative submission advanced on behalf of the offender, as I have said, was that an intensive correction order (ICO) should be imposed. That form of sentencing disposition was introduced in the same legislation which, on the recommendation of the Sentencing Council, removed periodic detention as a sentencing option. As it is an option that has only been available in this State since 1 October 2010, it is convenient to set out some of the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which give effect to its operation: 

7 Intensive correction orders 

(1) A court that has sentenced an offender to imprisonment for not more than 2 years may make an intensive correction order directing that the sentence be served by way of intensive correction in the community. 

(2) If a court makes an intensive correction order directing that a sentence be served by way of intensive correction in the community, the court is not to set a non-parole period for the sentence. 

(3) This section is subject to the provisions of Part 5. 

59It should be observed that s 7 is in Division 2 of Part 2 of the Act. That Division is headed ""custodial sentences"". Division 3 is headed ""non-custodial alternatives"" and includes a ""suspended sentence"". It is common ground that an intensive correction order is to be regarded as a more serious form of punishment than a suspended sentence. 

60Part 5 of the Act includes the following provisions. 

64 Application 

This Part applies in circumstances in which a court is considering, or has made, an intensive correction order. 

61Section 66 provides that such a order is not available for certain sexual offences. 

67 Suitability of offender for intensive correction order 

(1) An intensive correction order may not be made with respect to an offender's sentence of imprisonment unless the court is satisfied: 

(a) that the offender is of or above the age of 18 years, and 

(b) that the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of intensive correction in the community, and 

(c) that it is appropriate in all of the circumstances that the sentence be served by way of intensive correction in the community, and 

(d) that the offender has signed an undertaking to comply with the offender's obligations under the intensive correction order. 

(2) In deciding whether or not to make an intensive correction order, the court is to have regard to: 

(a) the contents of the assessment report on the offender (prepared under section 70), and 

(b) such evidence from the Commissioner of Corrective Services as the court considers necessary for the purpose of deciding whether to make such an order. 

(3) A court may, for any reason it considers sufficient, decline to make an intensive correction order despite the contents of the assessment report. 

(4) A court may make an intensive correction order with respect to an offender's sentence of imprisonment only if the assessment report states that, in the opinion of the person making the assessment, the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of intensive correction in the community. 

(5) If a court declines to make an intensive correction order with respect to an offender's sentence of imprisonment despite an assessment report that states that the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of intensive correction in the community, the court must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, its reasons for doing so. 

(6) A sentence of imprisonment is not invalidated by a failure to comply with subsection (5). 

69 Referral of offender for assessment 

(1) Before imposing a sentence of imprisonment on an offender, the court may refer the offender for assessment as to the suitability of the offender for intensive correction in the community. 

(2) A court is not to refer an offender for such an assessment unless satisfied, having considered all the alternatives, that no sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate and that the sentence is likely to be for a period of no more than 2 years. 

70 Assessment of suitability 

(1) When an offender is referred for assessment, the Commissioner of Corrective Services is to investigate and report to the court on the matters referred to in section 67 (1) and such other matters as the regulations may require. 

(2) An offender's assessment report: 

(a) must take into account, and specifically address, the matters prescribed by the regulations, and 

(b) may indicate the nature of any conditions that it would be appropriate for the court to impose on an intensive correction order if such an order is made. 

(3) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the conduct of investigations and the preparation of reports for the purposes of this Part. 

62It is also important to have regard to s 81 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 which is in the following terms: 


81 Conditions governing intensive correction orders 

(1) An intensive correction order is subject to any conditions imposed by the sentencing court under this section. 

(2) The sentencing court must at the time of sentence impose on an intensive correction order the conditions prescribed by the regulations as the mandatory conditions of an intensive correction order. 

(3) The sentencing court may at the time of sentence, or subsequently on the application of the Commissioner or the offender: 

(a) impose additional conditions on an intensive correction order, or 

(b) vary or revoke any additional conditions imposed by it on an intensive correction order. 

(4) The additional conditions that a court can impose are limited to: 

(a) conditions prescribed by the regulations as additional conditions that can be imposed by the sentencing court, and 

(b) such other conditions as the court considers necessary or desirable for reducing the likelihood of the offender re-offending. 

(5) The court may refuse to entertain an application by the offender under this section if the court is satisfied that the application is frivolous or vexatious. 

(6) The court may, at its discretion, deal with an application under this section with or without the parties being present and in open court or in the absence of the public. 

(7) Before imposing an additional condition under subsection (4) (b), a court is to consider whether the condition will create a need for additional resources and must not impose the condition unless satisfied that any such additional resources that will be needed are or will be made available. 

(8) This section does not permit the sentencing court to impose any additional conditions, or vary any additional conditions imposed by it, so as to be inconsistent with any of the conditions prescribed by the regulations as the mandatory conditions of an intensive correction order. 

63Sections 89 and 90 of that Act deal with the consequences of a breach of an order. 

64Regulation 175 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008 provides that: 

The following are the mandatory conditions of an intensive correction order to be imposed by a court under section 81 of the Act: 

(a) a condition that requires the offender to be of good behaviour and not commit any offence, 

(b) a condition that requires the offender to report, on the date fixed as the date of commencement of the sentence or on such later date as may be advised by the Commissioner, to such local office of Corrective Services NSW or other location as may be advised by the Commissioner, 

(c) a condition that requires the offender to reside only at premises approved by a supervisor, 

(d) a condition that prohibits the offender leaving or remaining out of New South Wales without the permission of the Commissioner, 

(e) a condition that prohibits the offender leaving or remaining out of Australia without the permission of the Parole Authority, 

(f) a condition that requires the offender to receive visits by a supervisor at the offender's home at any time for any purpose connected with the administration of the order, 

(g) a condition that requires the offender to authorise his or her medical practitioner, therapist or counsellor to provide to a supervisor information about the offender that is relevant to the administration of the order, 

(h) a condition that requires the offender to submit to searches of places or things under his or her immediate control, as directed by a supervisor, 

(i) a condition that prohibits the offender using prohibited drugs, obtaining drugs unlawfully or abusing drugs lawfully obtained, 

(j) a condition that requires the offender to submit to breath testing, urinalysis or other medically approved test procedures for detecting alcohol or drug use, as directed by a supervisor, 

(k) a condition that prohibits the offender possessing or having in his or her control any firearm or other offensive weapon, 

(l) a condition that requires the offender to submit to such surveillance or monitoring (including electronic surveillance or monitoring) as a supervisor may direct, and comply with all instructions given by a supervisor in relation to the operation of surveillance or monitoring systems, 

(m) a condition that prohibits the offender tampering with, damaging or disabling surveillance or monitoring equipment, 

(n) a condition that requires the offender to comply with any direction given by a supervisor that requires the offender to remain at a specified place during specified hours or that otherwise restricts the movements of the offender during specified hours, 

(o) a condition that requires the offender to undertake a minimum of 32 hours of community service work per month, as directed by a supervisor from time to time, 

(p) a condition that requires the offender to engage in activities to address the factors associated with his or her offending as identified in the offender's assessment report or that become apparent during the term of the order, as directed by a supervisor from time to time, 

(q) a condition that requires the offender to comply with all reasonable directions of a supervisor. 

65The consequence of Regulation 175(o) appears to be that an offender who is sentenced to the maximum term of 2 years (or 24 months) by way of an ICO will be obliged to perform a minimum of 768 hours of community service. Regulation 176 sets out the additional conditions that may be imposed by a court. 

66On 25 March 2011 I referred the offender, pursuant to s 69(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 , for an assessment as to his suitability for intensive correction in the community. I did so after having satisfied myself of the matters referred to in s 69(2) of the Act. Regrettably the report was not made available until 24 May 2011, with the consequence that there has been a delay in finalising the proceedings. Nevertheless, the offender has now been assessed as suitable for an ICO. He has also signed an undertaking to comply with his obligations in the event that such an order is made. 

67It is common ground that an ICO has been available as a sentencing option for Commonwealth offences since 29 October 2010: Crimes Amendment Regulations 2010 (Cth) (No.4). 

68To assist my understanding of the operation of such orders, the parties provided me with a considerable amount of background information. Material provided by Corrective Services NSW suggests that a curfew may be imposed upon the offender in addition to the other conditions to which I have referred. As I understand the situation, the ICO consists of 4 stages, commencing with the most restrictive conditions and progressively working towards fewer restrictions. 

69Because ICOs have been available in Victoria for some time, and particularly as there appears to be little difference between the two schemes, the parties drew my attention to some aspects of the scheme which operates in that State. Section 19 of the Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic) enables a court, in the circumstances set out in ss (1), to impose a sentence of imprisonment of not more than one year and order that it be served by way of intensive correction in the community. Section 20(1) sets out the core conditions of an ICO and ss (2) provides that an ICO must have all the core conditions attached to it. 

70Core condition (d) requires that the offender attend at a specified community corrections centre, or as otherwise directed by a community corrections officer, for twelve hours during each week of the period of the order or a shorter period specified in the order for the purpose of - 

(i) performing unpaid community work as directed by the Regional Manager for not less than eight of those hours; and 

(ii) spending the balance (if any) of those hours undergoing counselling or treatment for a specified psychological, psychiatric, drug or alcohol problem as directed by the Regional Manager. 

71In DPP v Nikolic [2008] VSCA 226, Warren CJ, with whom Vincent JA agreed, said that 

[a]n intensive correction order is not a light sentence. It is intended to be, and ordinarily will be, burdensome and will substantially contribute to the punishment of an offender, including where condign punishment is warranted. [at para 21]. 

72In DPP v Karazisis & others [2010] VSCA 350, in the context of dismissing Crown appeals against the inadequacy of sentences in which ICOs had been imposed at first instance, a majority of the Court of Appeal in Victoria said: 

In any case, it is well established that an Intensive Correction Order must be regarded as a significantly punitive disposition. The conditions of any such order are extremely onerous. Any breach is likely to have dire consequences. [at para 184] 

73In R v Lanteri [2006] VSC 225, Gillard J said: 

An Intensive Correction Order seeks to meet the objects of sentencing. There is no doubt that it is a form of penalty in that it will intrude into your life for the next 12 months. It will require you to provide your services to the community on an unpaid basis, and further will constantly remind you over the next 12 months of the evils of criminal conduct. It will be an appropriate adjunct to your rehabilitation and a constant reminder to you to never again involve yourself in criminal conduct. [at para 116]. 

74In Aitken v Moten-Connor (Supreme Court of Victoria, unreported, 9 February 1995) Smith J said: 

It becomes necessary then to identify the important features of an Intensive Correction Order. It might be argued that major features of the Intensive Correction Order are the imposition of the term of imprisonment and the treating of the order as a sentence of imprisonment. From the legal point of view that is a very significant aspect of the order. Plainly, however, it is the requirement that the sentence of imprisonment be served by intensive correction that gives an Intensive Correction Order its identity. To remove the latter is to change the character of the Order so that it ceases to be an Intensive Correction Order. [at p 5] 

75In Dimitrovski v Jones (Supreme Court of Victoria, unreported 23 August 1994) Mandie J said: 

In his Second Reading Speech relating to the Sentencing Bill in the Legislative Assembly on 19 th March 1991, the then Attorney-General said this: ""The Bill introduces a new sanction - the intensive correction order. This measure is designed to provide a severe punishment just short of imprisonment but more severe than a community-based order."" [at p4] 

76I now return to the principal submission made on behalf of the offender that I should fully suspend the sentence of imprisonment. Counsel made submissions concerning the passage from McKay (supra) to which I referred earlier. In particular, it was contended that Whealy's J view that because that particular offender was rehabilitated, there existed ""an additional reason"" why a suspended sentence was inappropriate in that case, was inconsistent with what was said by the High Court in Dinsdale (supra). Although I am disposed to accept that submission. I do not need to reach a concluded view about the matter. That is because, in my view, the objective gravity of the present offence, in the terms in which I have described it, outweighs the personal considerations which have been advanced on the offender's behalf to such an extent that I am unable to accept the submission that a suspended sentence is an appropriate sentencing outcome in the circumstances of the present case. In so concluding, I have not overlooked the very considerable significance which the Crown submitted should be afforded to the offender for his early plea of guilty. Furthermore, I accept that a suspended sentence would not properly reflect the need for general deterrence in this case. 

77As I said earlier, the legislature treats an ICO as a sentence of imprisonment notwithstanding the fact that it is served entirely in the community. As the Crown submitted, such an order is not regarded as an alternative to imprisonment itself but as a means of serving such a sentence. Courts often described periodic detention as having a ""strong degree of leniency built into it and as being outwardly less severe in its denunciation of the crime"": R v Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67 at 73. In my view, those sentiments are equally apposite to an ICO and I have proceeded upon that basis. 

78I referred earlier to the fact that it was open to the court to also impose a fine upon the offender. Before doing so a court must take into account the offender's financial circumstances: s 16C of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) . To that end, I was provided with a comprehensive statement of the offender's assets and liabilities. It reveals that he and his wife jointly own a property at Leura worth, on current estimates, between $850,000 and $900,000 as well as a motor vehicle worth $25,000. They also have a joint bank account in which, as at 7 March 2011, there was a balance of $43,772.45. The value of the shares which the offender retains in Wind Hydrogen Limited were said, as at 16 March 2011, to be worth $25,968. The Carmathen Superannuation Fund, which he also jointly owns with his wife, also has significant investments. It includes an apartment which is currently worth about $550,000 and shares in listed companies which are worth in excess of $800,000. However, it was submitted on the offender's behalf that if he was obliged to draw down from the superannuation fund in order to meet any pecuniary penalty that may be imposed upon him, that may have ""adverse taxation implications"" for him. In essence, it was contended that whereas he could draw down on those funds when he reached the age of 60 without incurring tax, if he was obliged to do so before reaching that age then he would, in all probability, be taxed at the rate of 15%. In short, it is submitted that such an outcome would constitute a further significant impost upon him. In considering the appropriate penalty in this case, I accept that it is relevant to have regard to that submission. 

79In arriving at the appropriate penalty I have sought to fashion a sentence that meets the various purposes of sentencing to which I referred earlier. As I also said earlier, the legislature has recently seen fit to dramatically increase the maximum penalty which is available to be imposed upon persons who engage in ""insider trading"". That development is likely to result in rather more severe penalties, everything else being equal, than those which I am about to impose upon this offender. 

Sentence 
80The offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years to commence on 6 July 2011 and to expire on 5 July 2013. 

81Pursuant to s 7(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 , I make an intensive correction order and direct that the sentence is to be served by way of intensive correction in the community. The conditions of the latter order include the mandatory conditions referred to in s 81 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 and Regulation 175 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008 . As I indicated earlier, s 7(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 precludes a court from setting a non-parole period in respect of such a sentence. 

82In selecting the date for the commencement of the sentence, I have had regard to the need for the authorities to have time in which to put the appropriate administrative arrangements in place. The offender is to report by no later than 10 am on 6 July 2011 to such local Office of Corrective Services NSW or such other location as may be advised by the Commissioner of Corrective Services. 

83In addition, the offender is to pay a fine of $70,000. I will allow him 6 months within which to pay that fine.

2709601,R v McLAREN [2011] NSWDC 115,"Judgment 



1HIS HONOUR: Barry Harrison had been a person who lived an active life. He was a yachtsman, a surfer and a businessman until the effects of motor neurone disease from which he suffered began to affect the way he lived his life. His condition deteriorated to the stage that he was virtually helpless. He could not move his limbs, he could move only his head and his eyes and was having trouble swallowing. He was totally dependent on the care of others. 

2One of those who cared for him was the offender, Steven McLaren. 

3On 5 October 2010 Mr McLaren tried to kill Mr Harrison but this was far removed from any idea of a mercy killing. Mr Harrison had no desire to die and the offender's motivation was a selfish one. As he told police, if he had succeeded in killing Mr Harrison, he would not have to continue feeling trapped by Barry. 

4The offender now stands to be sentenced for an offence of attempted murder. The maximum penalty for that offence is twenty-five years imprisonment. It carries a standard non-parole period of eight years. That standard non-parole period is not of direct application in this case because the offender pleaded guilty at an early stage to the offence for which he must now be sentenced. Nevertheless, the standard non-parole period remains as an important guide post to the sentence I must impose upon him. 

5Whilst I speak about the plea of guilty, I should say that it came at an early stage and so the sentence I will impose upon the offender is twenty-five percent less that it would otherwise have been. 

6Let me now deal with the events leading up to 5 October 2010 and what occurred in the early hours of that day. 

7The offender had suffered from various forms of mental illness for most of his life. He was put in touch with Mr Harrison by an intermediary. He then moved in to Mr Harrison's home and began to care for him from 4 March 2010. He received a Centrelink carer's pension because of the care he provided for Mr Harrison. 

8The offender started to become concerned about the constant need for him to care for Mr Harrison. It was the offender's responsibility to provide sole care to Mr Harrison overnight. Other people from Homecare came each morning and each afternoon, but even when others were there, the offender would still care for Mr Harrison by assisting the homecare visitors from time to time. 

9The offender began to complain about not getting a break within a few months after he began living with Mr Harrison. He spoke to his daughter in July 2010 and those complaints continued for some time. His daughter encouraged her father, the offender, to speak to Mr Harrison to try and get a break, but the offender did not take that advice. 

10Mr Harrison's family also offered to provide the offender with a break if he required it but again he did not take advantage of their offers. 

11Mr Harrison developed a urinary tract infection which increased the number of times he needed to visit the toilet at night and which, consequently, increased the demands upon the offender. That was the situation that presented itself on 5 October 2010. 

12The offender decided to kill Mr Harrison. Mr Harrison slept at an angle with his head higher than his feet. This was important because of the difficulties that Mr Harrison had swallowing. Mr Harrison had told the offender that if he was ever laid horizontally he would die. 

13The offender took Mr Harrison to bed, and placed him there in the early hours of 5 October. He then went to bed himself. It had been a particularly bad day. Mr Harrison was quite unwell. We know what the offender was thinking at this stage because he told police, in what I accept was a frank interview, what was going through his mind. He told police that he was thinking that he had to get out of the situation he was in and the idea came to him that if he changed the position of the bed and laid Mr Harrison horizontally, Mr Harrison would die fairly quickly because of the mucous that was building up. He said, ""I won't have to continue to feeling trapped with Barry"". 

14He put his plan into action. He waited until Mr Harrison was asleep. He then went into the room and lowered the head end of the bed as far as it would go. Mr Harrison became aware of what was going on. He woke up. He called out to the offender saying, ""Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing?"" 

15Mr Harrison did not die. Instead he suffered for hours, in which he believed he was going to die, and during which the offender ignored his cries for help, he ignored the sounds of his suffering and responded at first by turning up the television so he could not hear Mr Harrison and then leaving the home completely. 

16As I said, it was the offender's belief that Mr Harrison would die quickly but when it became clear that Mr Harrison was not going to die quickly and was suffering greatly, the offender did not change his mind. He explained in court today that the reason he did not was because he was fully aware that if he went back in and raised the bed so that Mr Harrison would not die, 

17Mr Harrison would tell others what the offender had done. 

18By daylight, after hours of listening to Mr Harrison suffering, the offender got into his car and drove off and bought himself coffee and breakfast, made appointments with his optometrist, went to a pub and had a beer at an early-opener. All this time Mr Harrison was calling for help. When he realised that the offender was not going to come and help him, he focussed his attentions on attracting help from his neighbours. When it became apparent that they could not hear him, he decided to save his energy so that he could call out again once the sun had gone up and there might be passers-by. 

19As it transpired it was not until 8.30am that a homecare worker, Ms Jenny Murray arrived at Mr Harrison's home and finally rescued him from the perilous position that he was in. She lifted his head back up. She did this gradually because he was in a lot of pain. He had mucous and foam coming from his mouth. 

20The offender went back to the home at 2.30 in the afternoon. He said, ""I'm sorry for what happened last night, Barry. I just need a break for a week or so and then I can come back and care for you."" He then went and had a sleep. He woke a bit later and explained to Ms Murray, Ms Jenny Harrison and Mr Harrison that he had tried to take Mr Harrison's life. 

21Eventually the police were called. 

22Upon hearing what Mr McLaren had said they asked him whether he attempted to kill Barry this morning to which the offender said he did. He was asked, 

""What was your intention?"" 

and he said, 

""It was my intention to kill him. I was at breaking point. At 2am I walked into where Barry was and I reclined his bed to horizontal and I left the room. I heard him calling for help. I woke up in the morning and left the house at 8am, he was still alive"". 

23Not surprising, the effect upon Mr Harrison was significant. He has now passed away. I note that the Crown does not suggest that the actions of the offender caused the death of Mr Harrison. Had that been the case, of course, Mr McLaren would be facing a charge of murder rather than one of attempted murder, but it is the case that Mr Harrison lived for only a very short time after the offender tried to kill him and in that time he suffered. He could no longer live in his own home and he was clearly affected by fear and apprehension. That is not at all surprising. For a person as helpless as Mr Harrison was, to have someone come into his bedroom and try to kill him would clearly have a significant impact on Mr Harrison's quality of life. Of course, the effect of an offence upon the victim of that crime is a matter which is an important aspect of deciding the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender. 

24The offender was born in Grafton. He is the second of six children. His mother left the family when he was thirteen years of age leaving his father with the care of their children. He completed his higher school certificate and did well, achieving a pass in the top ten percent. He went to university but failed because he did not apply himself to his studies. But he did a certificate of mechanical engineering which he completed. 

25He began work and married and had three children. He is now separated from his wife with the marriage breaking down due to his gambling problem which is related to his mental illness, a subject I will deal with later. 

26He left physical work to become a carer. He did an appropriate course and worked in a home for a short time before taking up the position with Mr Harrison. 

27There is a great deal of evidence suggesting that Mr McLaren, the offender, has been mentally unwell for a great part of his life. At the age of twenty-eight he had a breakdown. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital where a diagnosis of schizophrenia was made. 

28He was unable to return to work but did find work in a sheltered workshop. He worked there for many years under the care of a psychiatrist. 

29In 2000 he was again admitted to a psychiatric hospital and began being treated by a Dr Allan Weiss who was treating him until his arrest. 

30Unfortunately he was not taking all the drugs that were prescribed for him. One of the reasons he gave for doing so concerned the cost of one of the medications. It was not on the PBS. 

31Anyone who wants to make it harder to obtain drugs to treat mental illness or who does not want to make it cheaper for those drugs to be obtained, should explain to people such as Mr Harrison's family why they have made their decision. The courts deal with distressing regularity with the consequences of violent acts by mentally ill people in situations where drugs which may well have prevented such violent acts are either not available or too expensive. Another of the reasons the offender gave for not taking his medication at the time of the offence, concerned his feeling that they stripped him of his personality. 

32He is now taking his medication. The fact that he was not taking his medication at the time of the offence is something I will return to, but I will say this at this stage, that it does explain some flippant answers that the offender gave to police when they interviewed and also his rather flat demeanour when giving evidence in court today. 

33The offender was a man of otherwise good character. He was clearly capable of caring for Mr Harrison and did so at times with compassion. 

34Mr Harrison said himself of the offender, 

""He was a man that was full of so much caring, it was like chalk and cheese. Something happened. Apparently that string broke, something happened. He was a nice man, he was a gentle man that just went over the edge"". 

35The offender went into custody but was released on bail. In order to reflect that pre-sentence custody it is agreed that the sentence I will ultimately impose upon the offender should commence on 17 April 2011. 

36To say that this offence is a serious one, is an understatement. As it carries a standard non-parole period I am required to specifically state how this offence compares to an offence in the middle of the range for objective seriousness. I adopt the Crown's description. This offence is slightly below the middle of the range. The matters suggesting the seriousness of the offence include the offender's motivation. As I said at the outset, he wanted to kill Mr Harrison for selfish reasons. He was feeling trapped and he wanted to get out of it and his motivation for not changing his mind, once it became apparent that Mr Harrison was not going to die quickly and was suffering significantly, was again a selfish one. He did not want his crime to be detected. He was hoping that Mr Harrison would die and people would think it was of natural causes. 

37The second aspect suggesting the seriousness of this crime is clearly the vulnerability of Mr Harrison. The offender himself said that Mr Harrison was defenceless. It is hard to imagine a more vulnerable human being than Mr Harrison. 

38The third aspect suggesting the seriousness of the crime concerns the length of time that Mr Harrison struggled for life. He believed at many stages of his struggle that he would die. For something like six hours, Mr Harrison struggled to breath and struggled to attract the attention of someone to come to his aid. 

39The fourth aspect concerning the seriousness of the crime is related. The offender ignored these cries for help. He ignored what must have been the terrible sounds made by Mr Harrison as he struggled to breathe. 

40The fifth aspect concerns the enormous breach of trust that this offence represented. He was taken into Mr Harrison's home, provided with accommodation and paid, and Mr Harrison, in effect, put his life in the offender's hands. The offender breached that trust in the most serious way imaginable. 

41The next aspect concerning the seriousness of the offence relates to the fact that this was not only a single act, which was immediately regretted. I appreciate that I have mentioned this on many occasions, but it is very important, to understand that many offences of attempted murder involve one act and once that act is done, there is an immediate expression of remorse and attempts to aid the victim. That is not what the offender did. He continued to allow Mr Harrison to suffer in the hope that he would eventually die. 

42The final aspect that I want to refer to concerning the seriousness of the crime concerns the effect of the offence on Mr Harrison himself, a matter that I have already mentioned. 

43Were that the end of the story, the offender would go to gaol for a very long time but it is not the end of the story. There is substantial evidence that the offender suffered from a significant mental illness for a great part of his life. I have referred to his psychiatric history. I should also refer to observations made by Dr Neilssen, a forensic psychiatrist of great repute, who examined the offender and prepared a report for the assistance of the court. 

44Dr Neilssen did not find any symptoms of active mental illness associated with the offender's crime or that his conduct was due to the effects of an acute episode of mental illness. On the other hand Dr Neilssen did say that it was clear that the offender had a residual disability arising from his illness, particular in the area of coping with stress. Dr Neilssen says, 

""It seems likely that Mr Harrison's demanding condition and the associated sleep deprivation caused the offender significant distress. Sleep deprivation is known to trigger symptoms of mood disorder, chronic mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder, (I interpolate the disease from which it appears Mr McLaren, the offender, suffers) are also associated with an increased tendency to act on impulse and impaired capacity for problem solving"". 

45Dr Neilssen also refers to the high dose of one of the particular anti-depressants that the offender was on and Dr Neilssen concludes, 

""I believe the effects of Mr McLaren's circumstances and his underlying chronic mental illness resulted in significant impairment in his capacity to control his actions and his perception of the seriousness and likely consequences of his conduct"". 

46The crown does not challenge Dr Neilssen's conclusion and so I will accept it. 

47This means that the offender's moral culpability is substantially reduced and reduces also the effect that general deterrence should have on the sentence I will impose upon the offender. 

48The offender gave evidence today and expressed his remorse. As I said, he did so in a rather flat way, speaking almost matter of fact about what he had done and how he felt about it. I have no hesitation at all in proceeding on the basis that his presentation in the witness box is most likely due to the medication that he is now taking. 

49The offender expressed his remorse for what he did to Mr Harrison, the effects of what he did on Mr Harrison's family, and also his own family. He himself could not really explain what he did beyond saying that he felt trapped and was at the end of his tether. 

50In determining the appropriate sentence the Crown provided me with one case but the facts in that matter were substantially different. I have the standard non-parole period to guide me, the maximum penalty to guide me and the other principles of sentencing. One of those is that the sentence must bear a reasonable relationship to the objective gravity of what the offender did. That principle does not cease to apply in a case where an offender's moral culpability is reduced because of mental illness and in this case the offender well knew that what he was doing was seriously wrong. He well knew that 

51Mr Harrison was suffering for six hours and his sole motivation was, I repeat, a selfish one. He felt trapped by Barry and he wanted to get out of that situation. 

52For those reasons, the offender must serve a substantial period of imprisonment, even though he is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation, particularly if he continues to take his medication. 

53The taking of a human life and the attempt to take a human life, are offences of the most serious kind. The offender well knew what he was doing. He may have been less able to reason about what he was doing, but he full knew that he wanted to kill Mr Harrison because he felt trapped by him and he well knew, once Mr Harrison did not quickly die, that he was suffering enormously. 

54I will make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour. This is his first time in prison. He is now fifty-five years of age and upon his release it will be in his interests, and in the community's interests, that he is supervised for an extended period of time. For that reason I will enlarge the period of eligibility for parole at the expense of the non-parole period. 

55The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of five years to date from 17 April 2011. It will expire on 16 April 2016. I set a head sentence of eight years.

2709610,R v RIDGEWAY; R v SHEARD; R v WELLS [2011] NSWDC 90,"SENTENCE 

1HIS HONOUR: Appearing for sentence today are three offenders, Jasmine Lee Ridgeway, Emmett Raymond Sheard and Dean Nathan Wells. They each pleaded guilty at the Local Court to offences of aggravated break, enter and steal in circumstances of aggravation. The maximum penalty for that offence is twenty years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of five years; the standard non-parole period is not of direct application but it remains as an important guidepost to the sentences I should impose. 

2In the case of Mr Sheard and Mr Wells, the circumstance of aggravation relied on is that they inflicted actual bodily harm upon the victim of the offence. In Ms Ridgeway's case a different circumstance of aggravation is relied on, namely that she was in company with Mr Sheard and Mr Wells. As will be apparent soon, multiple circumstances of aggravation existed. 

3On 7 July last year Mr Neville Canon, who was then seventy three years of age, was home alone. At about 9.45pm there was a knock on the door; it was Ms Ridgeway. She asked if she could use the toilet. Mr Canon suggested that she go and see ""Uncle Reg"", an Aboriginal elder who lived next door, but Ms Ridgeway told Mr Canon that she did not know Uncle Reg and that she really needed to go to the toilet. Mr Canon opened the door and let Ms Ridgeway in. He closed the door behind him and showed Ms Ridgeway where the toilet was. However, when he walked back into his living room he was confronted by two men, Mr Sheard and Mr Wells. One of them had a balaclava on and the other one was covering his face with what appeared to be a scarf, but both of them were armed with machetes. They started to wave their arms around, saying ""Where's the safe?"". Mr Canon said he did not have a safe. 

4The male with the scarf around his face kept walking towards Mr Canon, waving the machete. When he was in front of Mr Canon, defending himself, the latter grabbed the male by his throat. A struggle then ensued, during which Mr Canon suffered cuts to his right hand, he fell backwards over a heater. After that happened, he was able to see the male in the scarf and Ms Ridgeway going through the house, clearly looking for things to steal. After a few minutes they left and Mr Canon went to a neighbour's house to call police. 

5It turns out that a watch and an old mobile phone were taken from the premises. Mr Canon went to hospital, where he was treated for superficial lacerations, and underwent an x-ray which showed that he had a fractured left clavicle. He was given painkillers, antibiotics and his arm was placed in a sling. There was nothing found at the scene to identify who it was who had committed this offence. 

6It is important to understand that the Crown tendered before me three separate statements of fact, one in relation to each of the offenders. Much of the statements of fact was identical, but there were substantial differences concerning what each offender had done after committing the offence. In particular, it seems that Mr Sheard and Mr Wells both deny that they were the person who struggled with Mr Canon and that they were the person who, with Ms Ridgeway, searched the house. I repeat, the Crown tendered three different statements of fact and did not tender the statement of facts in the case of any accused in the case regarding the others. The Crown controls the way it presents its case and not me, all I have got to do is somehow work my way through the difficulties that the Crown's decision creates. 

7I should state at the outset that I will not sentence either Mr Sheard or Mr Wells on the basis of he was the one who struggled with the victim and who continued to search the premises with Ms Ridgeway after Mr Canon was injured. But nor can I make a finding, a positive finding, in favour of Mr Sheard or Mr Wells that it was he who immediately regretted going to the unit and effectively played little further part. That is a matter I am satisfied which would need to be proved on the balance of probabilities, and statements to the police not repeated in evidence in the court are insufficient to overcome this burden. 

8As I mentioned, there is a different circumstance of aggravation pleaded in the case of Ms Ridgeway. That was because she was not herself armed with a machete or knife, but she knew full well that her two co-offenders were, and so the fact that there is a different circumstance of aggravation pleaded will make little difference to the sentence that I would impose upon her. 

9As I mentioned earlier, there were multiple circumstances of aggravation present. I have, or course, had to be careful not to double count, and I will not do so by following the path that Mr Rosser suggested would be wrong. But with that qualification it is important to note that many other circumstances of aggravation to be found in s 105 of the Crimes Act were present. Mr Wells and Mr Sheard were armed; each of the offenders was in company; corporal violence was inflicted on Mr Canon; actual bodily harm was occasioned; and each of the three offenders knew that Mr Canon was at home at the time they broke into his premises. Another circumstance which suggests the seriousness of this offence concerns Mr Canon's age and the fact that he was home alone. The offenders preyed upon his good nature. 

10This offence is accurately described as a home invasion and the most serious one of that. Because the offence carries with it a standard non-parole period, I am required to identify the objective seriousness of the offence with more particularity than I would have to if the offence did not carry with it a standard non-parole period. In each case I find that, objectively, the offenders have committed an offence which is slightly above the middle of the range of objective seriousness. 

11Before moving on to the individual cases of each offender, I should note that I have taken into account the principles of parity. I have attempted to ensure that no offender has a justifiable sense of grievance when he or she compares the sentence imposed on him or her with the sentences imposed on the other offenders. As it turns out, there will be substantial differences in the sentences which are imposed, but that circumstances is largely a reflection of the very different subjective features of each of the offenders. 

12I will deal with Ms Ridgeway first. 

13She was only eighteen years of age at the time of the offence. Her parents separated when she was twelve years of age and her mother died shortly thereafter. Her father then moved away from the area and Ms Ridgeway lost contact with him. Following her mother's death, Ms Ridgeway moved in with her older sister, but that relationship broke down due to Ms Ridgeway's behaviour and she was asked to leave her sister's home. As the author of the Probation and Parole reports, Ms Ridgeway described herself as being out of control during her teenage years. She moved into her uncle's home and was mostly residing with him until her incarceration. 

14She was allocated a mentor, a Ms Rowe, when she was in year 9; she is fortunate indeed to continue to have the support of Ms Rowe, who gave evidence on Ms Ridgeway's behalf today. It has been distressing, I gather, for Ms Rowe to have watched the offender's behaviour deteriorate, but there is hope for the future. The offender, Ms Ridgeway, has been in custody for some time but has used her time to reflect upon her position and now has plans for the future. Upon her release she wants to attend TAFE to complete her School Certificate and re-enter society as a law-abiding citizen. 

15In the immediate time leading up to this offence Ms Ridgeway's drug use got out of hand. She had commenced binge drinking and cannabis use at the age of twelve and continued to smoke cannabis on a daily basis until she was introduced to harder drugs, gas and speed, about a week before the offence. She was using those drugs daily leading up to the offence and claims that she does not actually remember the details of the offence because of the effects of drugs and alcohol upon her. 

16She clearly impressed the author of the pre-sentence report, who in the summary to that report said this: 

""Miss Ridgeway has fully cooperated during the preparation of this report. She impresses as a young woman who has been drifting for some time following the death of her mother. She appears to be motivated to address her issues underlying her drug and alcohol abuse and resume her education. Her previously strained relationship with her sister appears to be on the mend and she continues to enjoy the support of her extended family"". 


17It is, of course, not all roses. Since being in custody Ms Ridgeway has accumulated a substantial number of disciplinary charges. However Ms Rowe gave evidence that suggested that any misbehaviour of Ms Ridgeway whilst in custody could be largely explained by her frustration at the delay in this matter being finalised. 

18Ms Ridgeway has no prior convictions at all, I repeat she was only eighteen years of age at the time of the offence, and so it is to be hoped that, as Mr Fitzgerald suggested, this matter would not be her first offence but her only offence. I am prepared to find that Ms Ridgeway does have good prospects of rehabilitation and that there is a good prospect that Mr Fitzgerald's prediction will turn out to be true. 

19I have not mentioned thus far the most important factor as regards Ms Ridgeway, her likelihood of rehabilitation, and ultimately the sentence that I will impose upon her. 

20Soon after the offence, indeed only two days later, Ms Ridgeway went to the police and told them what had occurred on 7 July 2010. She also indicated that she was prepared to assist police further if required. She nominated her co-offenders as being involved in the offence with her and also told them who it was that drove the car to Mr Canon's home. It is very important to understand that at the time Ms Ridgeway went to the police she was not a suspect. I repeat something I said earlier, there was no forensic evidence discovered at the scene to identify who she was. She is thus entitled to a substantial R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 discount. She has told police that she was involved in the offence where, at least at that stage, there was nothing that the police had to suggest that she was one of the offenders. 

21That is very substantial evidence of her remorse. I am not suggesting it is the only evidence of her remorse because she has also expressed her remorse to others, but the best evidence indeed of how Ms Ridgeway now feels about what she did concerns the fact that it was she who turned herself in rather than the police coming to get her. Of course that is a very important matter also in assessing the likelihood that she will do what she hopes to do, and that is put this matter behind her and lead a productive and law-abiding life. She will have support of others when she is released from custody and, if she chooses to accept that support, I am confident that she will be able to achieve what she hopes. 

22I should make it clear that I will impose upon Ms Ridgeway a significantly lower sentence than would otherwise be the case. Mr Fitzgerald conceded that a custodial sentence was required, albeit he made that submission on the basis that the non-parole period should simply be time served. However I do not agree that a custodial sentence is required in the circumstances of this case, in particular noting that she has already done more than seven months in custody. I will impose a non-custodial sentence upon her later in these remarks. 

23I turn now to Mr Sheard. 

24Mr Sheard's parents separated when he was about five and he remained with his mother until he was about age fifteen. He was asked to leave home because he was abusing alcohol and drugs and his antisocial behaviour was attracting the attention of the police. He went to live with his older sibling for a short period of time before returning to live with his mother. He has had no contact with his father since he was about fifteen because of his illicit drug use. He was expelled from school in year 9 but did make efforts to obtain and keep work, although he lost his job in the building industry when he was disqualified from driving. He had been unemployed for about twelve months before the offence and, as he told the author of the pre-sentence report, he was relying on crime and associates for support. After the offence and whilst he was on bail he met his current girlfriend; he said that she is a good support and a positive role model and he wants to live with her upon his release. 

25Unfortunately he appears to have lost contact with his mother as she has recently moved. He too has a problem with drugs. In his case he started drinking and using cannabis at the age of fourteen, but his drug use escalated very quickly so that by the time he was fifteen he was using ice, gas and acid. In the lead up to the offence he was abusing alcohol and drugs most weekends. He would on occasions binge from Wednesday through to Sunday. He said that at the time of this offence he was on a drug binge and became involved because of what he could obtain. He was offered free drugs. 

26He expressed his remorse to the author of the pre-sentence report but did not give evidence in court today as to how he now feels about what he did. He was on probation at the time of this offence. He had been dealt with for an offence of resist police and an offence of take and drive and put on twelve months' probation for each offence. That is a matter which, of course, aggravates his conduct in this matter, but I have to be careful not to double count. I note that because of this offence he was called up for breaching his probation orders and received a sentence of one month's imprisonment. Although he has been in custody since 7 September 2010, I will start the sentence I will ultimately impose upon him from 7 October 2010 because one month of that custody is referable to the sentence imposed after being called up for breaching the probation orders. 

27Mr Sheard has a criminal history but it could not be said to be extensive. In particular there is no other break, enter and steal offence on his criminal record, nor is there an offence of violence. He too was very young at the time of this offence. 

28Although the law has to draw the dividing line somewhere and draws the line between dealing with someone as a child and dealing with someone as an adult at the age of eighteen, there is not some magical change that occurs in a human being on their eighteenth birthday. Mr Sheard, like Ms Ridgeway, was still very much a child at the time of the offence and so the principles for sentencing young people are very important. It has to be recognised that the sentence that I will impose upon him is much lower than would have been the case if he had been older, wiser and more mature. 

29I cannot say that Mr Sheard's prospects for rehabilitation are good. That is not to say he does not have some prospects of rehabilitation, clearly he does, but, given his problems with drugs and alcohol, given that he has had those problems for some time, and given they were part of what led to him committing this offence, the path for Mr Sheard is not going to be an easy one. I mentioned before that the offender expressed his remorse to the author of the pre-sentence report. There is also the plea of guilty which can be used in an appropriate case as evidence of remorse, and so, not without some hesitation, I will find on the balance of probabilities that he has genuinely accepted responsibility for what he has done. 

30A custodial sentence is obviously required in his case, but I will make a finding of special circumstances in his favour, due primarily to his youth and his need to have an extended period of supervision on parole, so that his problems with drugs can be addressed whilst he is in the community, as much as that is possible. 

31I turn now to the case of Mr Wells. 

32He was older than the other two. Since he has turned twenty he has spent almost all of his life in gaol. He was born in Newcastle. His parents separated when he was quite young and he has been raised by his mother and his stepfather. His stepfather gave evidence on Mr Wells' behalf today. Mr Wells treats his stepfather as his ""dad"". He remains close to his parents. He had significant disciplinary problems in school once he entered high school. There were issues with truancy, suspension and finally he was expelled. He went to a different school but was expelled from that as well. He has not been to school since. 

33He too started drinking as a child of fifteen, and his alcohol consumption is now clearly excessive, drinking about a bottle of spirits each day. He also has problems with cannabis, using it on a daily basis. He has tried other drugs, in particular he has dabbled in heroin and used amphetamines as well. A psychiatrist who interviewed him made the obvious finding that he meets the diagnostic criteria for poly-substance dependence. His problems with the authorities are numerous and varied, from lighting bushfires, stealing motor vehicles, driving offences, assaults, and breaching an AVO. Once he became an adult he commenced committing offences of a broadly similar kind to that for which he must be sentenced today, break, enter and steal. 

34He was on three s 12 bonds at the time of this offence, (it might even be four s 12 bonds, there are certainly a number of them.) Once more this is a significantly aggravating feature, but once more I have to be careful not to double count. In this case the commission of this offence saw him breached on the suspended sentences and he was sentenced to four months' imprisonment. I will start the sentence that I will ultimately impose upon him on 17 November 2010. 

35Given the length of time that the offender has already spent in custody since he turned twenty there is a real risk that if he does not change his ways he will be one of those unfortunate members of society who I see regularly enough, who waste their lives in prison, people who measure out their lives in court dates and custodial sentences. Mr Wells is well on his way to being one of those people. Often offenders, at the age of forty, forty five, fifty, eventually turn around and look at how they have lived and realised the futility of their lives, when it is all too late. 

36I mentioned before that Mr Wells' stepfather gave evidence. Though he does not visit Mr Wells in prison, for reasons which were explained, he speaks regularly to him over the telephone. His evidence was that for the first time Mr Wells has said that he did the wrong thing. As I understand it, Mr Wells is saying that he regrets the escalation of his criminal behaviour that this offence represents. So he too is remorseful for what he did, even if perhaps he does not yet accept the futility of the life that he has led. 

37In common with the other two offenders, the substantial motivating feature for this offence was his drug use. I will make a finding of special circumstances in his favour also because of the benefit not only to him but also to the community which an extended period of supervision on parole would bring. If the offender can be assisted to overcome his drug problem, then the chances of him committing further offences on his release from custody will be reduced. Not only would he be better off if that were the case, but so would the community. 

38I will now impose sentences. 

39In the case of Jasmine Lee Ridgeway, noting that Ms Ridgeway has spent more than seven months in custody, I impose upon her two hundred hours' community service, she is to perform two hundred hours' community service and to report to the Lake Macquarie Probation and Parole Service within seven days upon her release from custody. She is entitled to be released forthwith. 

40In the case of Emmett Raymond Sheard, he is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two and a half years and a head sentence of five years. That sentence, as I said earlier, will commence on 7 October 2010 and so Mr Sheard is eligible to be released to parole on 6 April 2013. 

41In the case of Dean Nathan Wells, I sentence him to imprisonment. In his case I set a non-parole period of four years to commence on 14 November 2010 and a head sentence of six and a half years. His non-parole period will expire on 13 November 2014 and that is the first date on which he is eligible to be released to parole.

		11 August 2011",2011-06-15 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709633,R v LTN [2011] NSWSC 614,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE 

1The offender stands for sentence for the manslaughter of her 2 year old daughter. To preserve the anonymity of the child, I shall not refer to either of them by name. The offender was charged before me with the murder of the child, but her plea of guilty to manslaughter was accepted by the Crown in satisfaction of the indictment. 

2To understand the offence it is necessary to sketch the offender's background. She is 29 years old. She was born in Vietnam, and at the age of 13 she came to this country with her family. She married in 2006, and her daughter was the only child of the marriage. The offence occurred on 21 March 2010. At that time she, her husband and her daughter were living with her parents at Dulwich Hill. 

3She has a history of mental illness. In 2003 she was diagnosed as suffering from schizoaffective disorder. She received psychiatric treatment, was prescribed medication and was managed by the Marrickville Community Mental Health Centre. Over the ensuing years, she regularly attended that centre and was reviewed by a consultant psychiatrist. She also had home visits from mental health professionals and telephone contact with them. She had the benefit of the supervision of her husband and her parents and, generally, a significant level of family support. 

4It seems that symptoms of her mental illness first appeared after a cousin, to whom she was close, hanged herself in 2000. She and her father witnessed the aftermath of this suicide. She came under psychiatric care when she was admitted to Rozelle Hospital as an involuntary patient in May 2003, after the intervention by police in an incident in which she locked her family inside the family home. Her behaviour was disorganised and disinhibited, and she suffered auditory hallucinations. She was observed to be talking to her deceased cousin, and appeared to be preoccupied with her death. 

5She benefited from the treatment available to her and, generally, was compliant with it. However, there were a number of subsequent occasions on which her condition deteriorated. 

6She was again admitted to Rozelle Hospital in June 2003 because she had been running in front of traffic. Her behaviour was hostile and obstructive and she exhibited paranoid thoughts. Later in that year, she came to the attention of the Community Mental Health Centre because she reported hearing voices and having delusional thoughts. She told her then boyfriend that she was feeling suicidal because she believed that she was not pretty enough for him. She said that the voices were telling her to kill herself. On one occasion she held a knife and threatened to kill herself, but was restrained by family members. She was still troubled by the suicide of her cousin. 

7In early 2004, she told staff at the centre that she had had thoughts of harming herself by driving her car off a cliff or by cutting herself. 

8In early 2006, she was again detained as an involuntary patient at Rozelle Hospital following a severe deterioration in her mental state. She had been seen punching a wall and banging her head against it. At the hospital she was assessed as being a medium risk of suicide and was preoccupied with death, saying ""Stop the pain ... judgment day ... die, die, die ... kill me."" Her behaviour was bizarre, sometimes aggressive, and sometimes sexually inappropriate. Medical staff noted her to be acutely psychotic, and a provisional diagnosis of schizophrenia was made. 

9Towards the end of her stay in hospital she showed signs of improvement, but was reluctant to take her medication. She was ultimately discharged, subject to a community treatment order. 

10During a home visit in April 2006, she was upset and preoccupied with voices telling her that her family was going to die. A couple of days later she was observed to be delusional, saying that she had a special mission from God and was receiving messages to relieve her parents' suffering by strangling them. She said, however, that she had not acted on those messages and would never hurt her family. She also reported auditory hallucinations about killing herself, but said that she had no intention of doing so. 

11She was admitted to Rozelle Hospital yet again in May 2006, where she was observed to be at risk of self harm and harm to others and was described as being disinhibited and promiscuous. She had thoughts about the world and her life ending, although she denied having suicidal thoughts. Nevertheless, she had experienced thoughts of self harm, including choking herself, so that the world would carry on. In that month she came to the attention of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, which made a further community treatment order. 

12She gave birth to her daughter on 25 June 2007, and ceased her medication because she was breastfeeding. In the following month the Mental Health Review Tribunal decided not to make a further community treatment order, noting that she appeared to have strong family support, good insight into her illness and compliance with treatment, and a good relationship with her case manager. She was not medicated at that time, and felt well. 

13In November 2007, she discovered that she was pregnant again. She was ambivalent about the pregnancy but, due to her religion, termination of it was not an option for her. She ceased taking her medication because of the pregnancy, apparently with the concurrence of her treating psychiatrist. However, at the end of 2007 she was admitted to hospital after her husband noted a deterioration in her mental health. She exhibited gross thought disorder, and there were lacerations and abrasions to her face and legs which were self inflicted. Again, she behaved in a bizarre and sometimes inappropriate way. She was diagnosed as suffering from a relapse of chronic schizophrenia due to the cessation of her medication. She suffered a miscarriage in January 2008, and was discharged at the end of that month. 

14During a home visit at the end of 2009, she said that she felt stable and well, although she sometimes experienced symptoms such as receiving special messages from the television. Her caseworker observed her to be anxious about her daughter, expressing a fear that the child might hurt herself. It was agreed that she would attend the Koala Playgroup, for mothers with a mental illness, at Glebe. 

15On two occasions in February 2010 she attended that playgroup, where she was seen to be involved with her daughter's activities and interacting a little with the other mothers. The child was observed to be active and energetic, running around excitedly, but not sitting still during reading and music activities. 

16It was at this time that there was a deterioration in her condition which, with the wisdom of hindsight, appears to have been significant. Her mother told her caseworker in a phone call that same month that her mental state was ""up and down."" In a consultation with her treating psychiatrist, also in that same month, the doctor observed her to have an anxiety disorder, noting that she worried about what would happen if she did things, that she was anxious about meeting and mixing with people, and was afraid of what they would think. Notably, a few weeks before the offence she tried to stab her mother, saying that she would kill her and then kill herself and her daughter. Although she had generally been reliable in attending for consultations with her treating psychiatrist, she missed an appointment on 11 March 2010. 

17I turn, then, to the fateful day, 21 March 2010. In the late afternoon of that day, the offender's uncle visited the family home. He was concerned about her because she looked very vague and was unresponsive in conversation. He thought that she was getting sick again. Sometime before 9pm the offender left the family home with her daughter. Her mother was also concerned about her, and after she and the daughter left, the mother rang the offender's sister and said, ""I don't know why, but I am very worried about this time."" 

18What ensued after the offender left with her daughter emerges from her admissions to police in a videotaped interview and walkthrough with police. She drove with the child to the Tempe Recreation Reserve, and took her to a canal adjacent to the Cooks River. She intended to drown the child and herself. She sat on a bench on a pathway adjacent to the canal, and sang the child a song. Carrying the child, she then climbed down an embankment and entered the canal. She walked out about 50 metres until she was out of her depth. She tried to get under the water and roll around in it, but she and the child kept flipping over. As she was unable to force herself under the water without letting go of the child, she returned to the shore. At this stage the child was not moving. 

19She returned to the path, sat on the same bench and again sang a song to the child. A man walked past. She said to him, ""Help me, I've killed my daughter,"" but he kept walking. She then drove back to the family home, holding the child on her lap. 

20Upon arriving home, she said to her parents, ""I have killed my daughter. I wanted to kill both of us but I couldn't kill myself."" Her father called the emergency line and the police arrived. The child was dead. Her sister arrived and observed that she appeared as she had on a previous occasion when she was unwell and had not taken her medication. (It is not clear when this was, but I take it to be the occasion at the end of 2007 when she was off her medication during her second pregnancy.) 

21To one or other of the police officers who came to the home, the offender said: 

""I have killed my daughter, she drowned."" 

""I drowned her, I wanted to die with her but I couldn't. I should be dead, not her ... . ... I'm a bad teacher to her and I wanted to die with her ... . I hold her close to me and I jump under the water. I kept rolling around and around in the water, trying to die ... . I wanted to die with her. I am the one who should be dead."" 

""I'm a bad mother. ... It's all my fault. I drowned her."" 

""I killed her, I killed the baby. ... I am a bad mother."" 

22She was arrested. Prior to leaving the family home she pleaded with police on several occasions to allow her to hug her daughter and to dress her. Police protocol prevented the officers from allowing her to do so. She buried her head in her hands and sobbed. 

23She was conveyed to Newtown Police Station, where she was placed under the supervision of the custody manager. She said to one of the officers, ""Do I get to go to gaol soon? ... I deserve to be locked up forever."" 

24In the recorded interview, asked why she entered the water with her daughter, she said: 

""I don't know, I just think that I won't be a good mother ... and I'm just scared that she's going to be bullied or she's going to hurt so I just decided me and her will die together ..."" 

Asked why she wanted to die as well, she said: 

""I don't know, I just think that I can't do anything anymore and I feel like I'm a bad mother, a bad daughter, a bad wife and I can't ... do anything anymore."" 

25Asked why she did not think that she was a good mother, she said: 

""Because of the medicine that I take, sometimes I can't wake up and then ... I try to cook but ... it really confuses me because some days I know how to cook and sometimes I don't and I wake up ... a little funny sometimes. I just don't know like, I can't be there for everyone ... some days I would wake up really early and cook and some days I would wake up really late and my daughter has to knock on the door and call me 'Mummy, Mummy, wake up', ... and then sometimes ... I can't even get up, I hear her voice and it hurts me ... and then I get up, I go out and look after her ... . I don't know what's wrong with me. Some days I drink my medicine and other days I forget and I'm just jumbled up everywhere. I don't know what to do."" 

26In answer to further questions, she told police something of her psychiatric history and her regime of medication, which required her to take a tablet in the morning and again at night. She acknowledged that she did not always take both tablets each day, and revealed that on the day of the offence she had taken neither of them. Asked why she did not take her tablet that night, she said that she wanted to die with her daughter and she forgot about taking it. Asked why she wanted to die with her daughter, she replied: 

""I don't know ... I felt that ... I'm not a good teacher to her. I've been going to school with her ... to learn things but then like, it's out of control ... , she doesn't understand and all she does is run around like, jumping up and down and I can't control her and like, when I look at other kids ... they listen and I feel that ... I'm teaching her wrong stuff and I'm not a good mum."" 

27Asked whether her daughter went to a playgroup or to kindergarten, she said: 

""Yeah, she goes to the playgroup but then the more I read books or the more I watch TV I get really like, offended because I'm not a good mum ... everyone's talking about me and not being a good mother so everything I read or something like that, I just think that, 'oh, no, you know, I'm doing wrong every day and my daughter's not learning like she's supposed,' ... I'm supposed to read books for her everyday but then she enjoys watching TV more and ... the information I get from anywhere is just wrong and I just can't help myself because I can't help my brain, you know, it just think weird stuff, bad stuff like, all the time."" 

28Asked if she had ever tried to hurt her daughter before, she said, ""I tried to but then ... I couldn't imagine me holding a knife, stabbing her or hurting her ... ."" She said that she had never told anyone, even her treating psychiatrist, about this. By her expression ""I tried to"" I take her to mean that she had thought about harming the child but had never actually attempted to do so. 

29A post mortem examination of the child on 23 March 2010 confirmed that the cause of her death was drowning. 

30While in custody the offender has been interviewed by two respected forensic psychiatrists, Dr Olav Neilssen, engaged by her legal representatives and Dr Stephen Allnutt, engaged by the Crown. She gave to each of those doctors an account of her state of mind consistent with what she had told the police. In addition, she described to each of them thoughts of a paranoid kind at the time, including a conviction that the world was about to end and that she wanted to die with her daughter. The effect of what she told them was that she feared for the child's well being and, in particular, that she might succumb to mental illness such as she herself had suffered. 

31Both these experts confirmed that she suffered from schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Dr Neilssen provided a report in which he expressed the opinion that the offender ""was affected by an acute exacerbation of her chronic psychotic illness at the time of the offence."" He expressed the view that she had the defence of mental illness available to her, and could also raise the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind ""because of the effect of symptoms of mental illness on her perception of events and her capacity to judge right from wrong."" 

32In his report, Dr Allnutt expressed the same view. He put it this way: 

""... I do believe that she was suffering a defect of reason of a nature and severity that she was significantly compromised in her capacity to know the wrongfulness of the actions for the following reasons: 

1. At the material time of the alleged offence she was experiencing a delusional belief of a nihilistic nature perceiving the world to be coming to an end, herself to be a poor mother and fearful for her child's future. 

2. She had incorporated the victim, her child, into this delusional belief. 

3. She described seeing her behaviour as being the only option for her. 

4. She described believing at the material time of the alleged offence that this was the right thing to do and I would be of the view that this was consistent with her delusional justification."" 

He also concluded that she had a defence of mental illness or, alternatively, the partial defence of substantial impairment. 

33The offender has no previous convictions. She was educated to year 10 standard and attended TAFE after leaving school. She worked mainly as a nail artist but since 2006, because of her mental illness and the side effects of her medication, she had been on a disability pension. I received a statement from her sister, written on behalf of the family, expressing their shock at her crime but attesting to her good character. Putting aside the symptoms of her mental illness, she is described as a generous and caring person. Her sister acknowledges her illness and her need for treatment in a caring protective environment. Clearly, she has the continuing support of her family. 

34She is deeply remorseful for her crime and, as is apparent, has been from the day it was committed. Indeed, when she was first arraigned in this Court she pleaded guilty to murder, in the teeth of advice from her solicitor and counsel that the defence of mental illness was available to her. At that time the Crown was not prepared to accept a plea of guilty to manslaughter because, as I understand it, whether she was not guilty by reason of mental illness was seen to be the central issue in the case. She told her legal representatives that she wanted to plead guilty to murder because she was responsible for what she had done and deserved whatever sentence she got. From an affidavit by her solicitor, Ms Coultas-Roberts, it is apparent that she understood the defence of mental illness and its legal consequences, but could not bring herself to plead not guilty even on that limited basis. The subsequent decision of the Crown to accept her plea of guilty to manslaughter was obviously in the interests of justice. 

35By her plea the offender abandoned the prosect of the special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness. Her plea was entered on the basis that at the time of the killing she suffered from an abnormality of mind which substantially impaired her capacity to understand events and, in particular, to judge whether her actions were right or wrong. It is that impairment which characterises her crime as manslaughter, rather than murder. Clearly, on the material before me, her impairment was of a very high order. 

36While acknowledging that that impairment is the basis for her crime being characterised as manslaughter, the high level of it entitles her to a considerable measure of leniency. Of course, the protection of the community has to be considered and the question whether she poses a danger because of her mental illness must be faced. There are aspects of the history which I have recounted which are cause for concern: her sometimes aggressive behaviour observed in hospital, the delusional experience of messages that she should strangle her parents and her attempt a few weeks before the offence to stab her mother, accompanied by her threats to kill her mother, herself and her daughter. Moreover, it is of concern that she did not reliably take her medicine in the period leading up to offence and did not take it at all on the day itself. She should have known of the danger of not doing so from her experience of going off medication during her second pregnancy. 

37Nevertheless, as I have said, it seems that over the years of her treatment between 2003 and 2010 she was generally conscientious in attending for psychiatric treatment and compliant with her regime of medication. From what she told police after her arrest, from her account to the forensic psychiatrists and her discussions with her legal representatives disclosed in the affidavit of Ms Coultas-Roberts, it is apparent that she has insight into her mental illness and recognises it as the cause of her criminal behaviour. As I have said, she is assured of the continuing support of her family. In all the circumstances, I am of the view that she unlikely to present a danger to the community, that she will be compliant with treatment in the future, and that her prospects of rehabilitation are good. 

38This is a tragic case. Manslaughter is an inherently serious crime, involving the unlawful killing of a human being. The killing of a child, particularly by his or her mother, is a terrible thing. Nevertheless, the condition of the offender obviously calls for sympathy. One can understand that she believes that her crime deserves severe punishment. But no one in this community, informed of all the circumstances, would demand it. 

39I shall reduce the sentence I would have passed by 20% in recognition of the utilitarian value of the offender's plea of guilty. It is common ground that there are special circumstances justifying a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. But for the plea of guilty, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 5 years. In recognition of that plea, it will be a term of 4 years. I shall set a non-parole period of 2 years. The sentence will date from the day of the offence, when she was taken into custody, 21 March 2010. She will be eligible for release on parole on 20 March 2012, and the sentence will expire on 20 March 2014. 

40For the crime of manslaughter the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing on 21 March 2010 and expiring on 20 March 2012, and a balance of term of 2 years commencing on 21 March 2012 and expiring on 20 March 2014. 

41I must express my appreciation to counsel for the Crown and the offender, and those who instruct them, for their responsible and humane approach to this sad case.

		22 June 2011",2011-06-16 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709634,Peterson v The Nominal Defendant [2011] NSWSC 579,"Judgment  1HIS HONOUR:  Nature of proceedings  On 2 November 2008 the plaintiff was the driver of a Subaru station wagon, registered in the Northern Territory. While the vehicle was travelling in a northerly direction on the Stuart Highway in South Australia, between Coober Pedy and Marla, it left the road and rolled over.  2As a result of the accident, the plaintiff was seriously injured and became a quadriplegic.  3The plaintiff has brought proceedings in negligence against the Nominal Defendant on the basis that the accident was caused by a large articulated vehicle, probably a road-train, the identity of which is unknown, which overtook the Subaru in such a way as to cause the Subaru to leave the highway and eventually overturn.  4The plaintiff particularised negligence in the following respects:  (i)       Failing to overtake another vehicle with safety.  (ii)      Failing to take proper care in relation to other road users when overtaking.  (iii)      Driving too close to another vehicle in the process of overtaking it causing the plaintiff to take evasive action.  (iv)  Forcing the plaintiff to move so far to the left of the roadway so that the plaintiff's vehicle left the road surface and drove onto the gravel which ultimately caused the plaintiff to lose control of the vehicle.  (v)      Driving at a speed excessively fast in the circumstances.  5The Nominal Defendant has defended the proceedings on the basis that there was no truck involved in the accident and that the cause of the accident was that the plaintiff lost control of the Subaru station wagon.  6Pursuant to an order of Davies J made on 21 September 2010, the matter proceeded as a hearing as to liability only under Part 28 rule 2 of the Uniform Civil Procedures Rules 2005.  Factual Background  7Except where otherwise indicated, I find the facts to be as follows.  8Although the Nominal Defendant was involved, it was agreed between the parties that there would be no requirement for the plaintiff to prove ""due inquiry and search"" (T.8.35). It was also agreed that the law of South Australia, in particular the Motor Vehicles Ac t 1959 (SA) and the Civil Liability Act 2004 (SA), would apply.  9At the time of the accident the Subaru station wagon was owned by Mr Addicott. He was born in March 1943 and was a member of the Senior Executive Service of the Commonwealth Public Service. He was a valuer by qualification and was the Valuer General of the Northern Territory. He held that position between June 1999 and June 2009. He and the plaintiff were in a de facto relationship and had been since January 2008. Mr Addicott resided in Canberra, but would spend approximately one week a month in Darwin.  10The motor vehicle involved in the accident was a 2004 model white Subaru Outback station wagon. Mr Addicott had been provided with the vehicle as part of his employment entitlement. The motor vehicle was mechanically inspected on 24 September 2008 and no defects were found. It was common ground that the accident was not caused by any mechanical defect in the motor vehicle.  11On 25 October 2008 the plaintiff's sister, Su Li Deng (hereafter referred to as Ms Deng) arrived from France at Sydney Airport. Mr Addicott and the plaintiff had driven from Canberra to pick her up. Upon her arrival, they drove her back to Canberra and spent that night there.  12On 26 October 2008 Mr Addicott, the plaintiff and Ms Deng commenced driving from Canberra towards Adelaide. Mr Addicott and the plaintiff shared the driving duties. Mr Addicott was to attend a conference in Adelaide, marking the 150 th anniversary of the introduction of Torrens Title. They stayed overnight at Murray Bridge and arrived in Adelaide on 27 October.  13On Saturday, 1 November they left Adelaide with the intention of arriving in Alice Springs by the following night. Mr Addicott had work to attend to in both Alice Springs and in Darwin. The work involved a number of complex valuation activities. They stopped at Port Augusta for petrol and stayed overnight at  Coober Pedy. The plaintiff and Mr Addicott again shared the driving.  14The plaintiff, Mr Addicott and Ms Deng left Coober Pedy at approximately 8am on 2 November. Mr Addicott was driving.  15The weather was fine and there was no suggestion that the visibility was other than excellent. In the relevant area the Stuart Highway runs generally in a north-south direction with one lane travelling in each direction.  The surface of the road was bitumen and each lane was 3.5 metres wide.  There was a gravel shoulder at each side of the highway, which was approximately .75 wide.  The speed limit was 110 kph.  There was no suggestion that the weather or the condition of the road surface made any contribution to the accident.  16After approximately 15 minutes, the plaintiff took over the driving. Mr Addicott said that this occurred because he was familiar with the Northern Territory roads which were more winding and he thought it better that he take over driving once they entered the Northern Territory.  Mr Addicott said that he had confidence in the plaintiff's driving. She used regularly drive in Canberra on weekends and on one occasion they had shared the driving on a trip from Canberra to Melbourne.  17Mr Addicott's evidence concerning the plaintiff taking over driving duties is controversial on the issue of whether or not the plaintiff was wearing a seatbelt. His evidence on this issue was:  ""A. Actually it was a ritual and in this situation it probably sounds a bit ridiculous but we walked around the back of the car, I'd give her a cuddle and a kiss and then walk back. And because she is shorter than me I sat her in the seat and adjusted the seat to the length of her legs and locked it in place and then, as on other occasions, made sure that she and Su Li, who wasn't familiar with Australian road laws and so forth, had their seatbelts done up."" (T. 19.21)  ""Q. You mentioned something before about checking something. Would you elaborate upon that? Did you say something to somebody? Was it to Qier or Su Li.  A. I have to communicate anything more than the simplest of messages via Qier. I wanted to remind Su Li particularly that she needed to put on a seatbelt and I would do that regularly.  Q. Pausing there. You are not saying this happened at the point of this changeover but at some point during the journey?  A. It was a regular bit of nagging that I would do.  Q. Why is that? Do you have a thing about seatbelts?  A. I do. I had a car accident some 30 years ago where I, while I did have an unfortunate injury with my head hitting the windscreen, but I do believe that the seatbelt prevented me from actually going through the windscreen and possibly wiping myself out.  Q. Just in respect of the seatbelts, do you believe you made any observation about Qier on the day of the accident when she took the wheel, about her and her seatbelt?  A. I certainly for my own satisfaction made sure that her seatbelt was done up."" (T.20.5)  18The Subaru was fitted with conventional retractable lap sash seatbelts. This model of Subaru contained a warning system when an occupant failed to fasten the seatbelt.  (a) There was a light on the dashboard which would flash;  (b) There was an audio warning, an annoying beep, which would commence when the Subaru drove at 20 kph and would then continue for 108 seconds.  Mr Addicott said that when the plaintiff took over as driver outside of Coober Pedy, he did not hear this beeping sound.  19I will return to the question of whether the plaintiff was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the accident in due course.  20Although the Subaru had air conditioning, Mr Addicott was not able to say whether the air conditioning was on or off. He was not able to say whether the windows were up or down. After the change of driver, the plaintiff was in the driving seat and Mr Addicott was sitting in the front passenger seat next to her. Ms Deng was sitting in the back seat behind Mr Addicott.  21Before the accident Mr Addicott said that he was ""very comfortable and content"" with the way the plaintiff was driving. Ms Deng was reading Chinese newspapers in the backseat and he was ""thinking about the difficulties of the valuation tasks that were in front of me"" and looking out to the west (which was to the left of the car). It is common ground that the vehicle was travelling at 90-100 kph immediately before the accident. The accident occurred at about 9am.  22The circumstances of the accident are controversial. What is relatively uncontroversial is that at a point about 70 kms north of Coober Pedy, the Subaru commenced an erratic path which seems to have been as follows:  (i)       A movement to the left so that both left-side wheels of the Subaru entered onto the gravel shoulder of the western side of the highway.  (ii)      A correction to the right so that the Subaru crossed the centreline and entered the southbound lane.  (iii)     A correction to the left so that the Subaru re-entered the northbound lane.  (iv)     A yaw to the right, across the whole of the road surface and beyond the gravel shoulder entering into a rollover.  23When the vehicle came to a stop it was on its side, being the driver's side. The front windscreen was broken in the sense that it had a crazed pattern but had not shattered and remained in place. The plaintiff was slumped against the door of the car in the driver's seat on her side. Mr Addicott said that she was within her seatbelt but leaning against the driver's side door. Mr Addicott was retained by his seatbelt.  24Following the accident, Mr Addicott tried to get some response from the plaintiff and was successful in getting her to open her eyes. He could also hear Ms Deng moving in the back of the car. He was able to punch out the glass in the passenger window above his head and was able to get out of the car. Either at that time or in the course of the accident, he suffered a gash to his right arm which severed some tendons and which subsequently required an operation.  25Mr Addicott was unable to find his mobile phone and commenced walking along the Stuart Highway. Within 5 minutes he was able to stop a car which was being driven by two visitors from France. Ms Deng was able to extract herself from the car without Mr Addicott's assistance. When he returned with the French couple, she was already out of the car. Mr Addicott estimated the time between him exiting from the car and returning with the French couple at about 5 and 10 minutes.  26There was an issue between the parties as to the position of the plaintiff's right arm following the accident. This was relevant to the question of whether she had been wearing a seatbelt or not. In cross-examination Mr Addicott's evidence on this issue was:  ""Q. When you got back to the car you saw  Qier was lying with her arm out the car window?  A. Her arm was somehow under the car. I can't at the moment visualise where it was, whether the car was sitting on her.  Q. When you say the car was sitting on her -  A. Somehow or other she was pinned at that point.  Q. She was pinned at the top of her arm, the right arm?  ...  A. I can't remember with any great detail.  Q. We will see if this photograph refreshes your memory. Would you have a look at this photograph, please. Looking at this photograph, take a moment if you would like to carefully look at it. Does that depict the Subaru on its driver's side with Qier's arm protruding out to the right of the top of the car?  A. Yeah, it appears to, yes.  Q. Who is the lady? There seems to be a lady bending over with a black and white striped top on.  A. I don't know who that is.  Q. And the male person with the shorts on the right-hand side of  the photograph is a passerby?  A. I presume so. I was dressed differently to that that day.  Q. The position of Qier's arm as depicted in this photograph, is  that how you recollect how her arm was pinned under the car after  the collision?  A. I don't remember how she was pinned at the time that I saw  her.  Q. But her arm was pinned?  A. The arm appeared to be pinned at the time."" (T.32.39 - 33.22)  27Some other cars arrived after the French couple and at approximately 10.15am, Constables Baker and Agostino from the South Australian Police Service arrived. The police were the first of the Emergency Services to arrive at the accident scene.  28The plaintiff was not able to be released from the Subaru until SES personnel arrived. The plaintiff was transferred directly to the Royal Adelaide Hospital while Ms Deng and Mr Addicott were taken by ambulance to the Coober Pedy Hospital. Ms Deng and Mr Addicott flew to Adelaide the following day. On 18 December 2008 the plaintiff was transferred to the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney.  Mr Addicott's evidence  29An important question on the issue of liability is how the accident occurred and whether a vehicle, other than the Subaru station wagon was involved.  In order to resolve this question, it is necessary to carefully examine the evidence relevant to it.  Mr Addicott's evidence as to how the accident occurred was as follows:  ""Q. Relevant to the accident what did you first feel, experience,  see or hear?  A. My first feeling was that of buffeting.  Q. Buffeting is a word, what does it mean?  A. It means the shuddering effect, like the effect of which  happened on, blowing on the side of a house or the car, and I  could recognise that as a truck passing us. It, it didn't worry me  particularly at the time because I had experienced it many times  before.  Q. And what did you next see or feel?  A. The next, it, from then on everything started to happen very quickly indeed. Qier moved the car to the left, the passenger side wheel got into the gravel. Her, the driver's side wheel was still on the road, on the bitumen and the, the front of the car was showered with gravel and dirt and my vision was obscured by the, the rear trailer of a vehicle of some kind.  Q. There is a lot in what you just said and I wanted to try and divide it up?  A. Yes.  Q. Are you absolutely confident about the order of events?  A. Yes, it...  Q. The first thing you mentioned as I recall it was the wheels on to the dirt on the left-hand side of the bitumen?  A. I don't know whether it was wheels or one wheel. It was certainly the front passenger wheel. Whether the rear passenger wheel was off the road as well I could not say with certainty. The driver's wheel was certainly on the bitumen and -  Q. Are you able to say now how long that happened?  A. No. Look, I only revisit this time with great difficulty and it all  happened in a very, in a very short period, that is all I can say.  Q. When you said difficulty what did you mean? Did you mean emotionally?  A. Yes.  Q. You then, in the second of three things, mentioned a spray of I  think you said gravel?  A. Gravel and dirt and stuff being flung up in front of the car.  Q. Where did that come from, the left or the ride or straight ahead?  A. It came from directly in front and my vision was obscured. Firstly by the cloud of dust and gravel flying up at the car but through it I could see the rear of a trailer carrying, it was either an enclosed truck or carrying a large container. It was I think a creamy or dirty white colour and there were aluminium strips to each side. But once again it was happening very quickly and this stuff was being thrown up at the car.  Q. Even in that you mentioned a few different things I want to take you back to?  A. Yes.  Q. You mentioned a truck. Were you able to see the automotive force, the vehicle, the prime mover?  A. No, no.  Q. So you have just assumed that what you saw was what you  described as a container?  A. Virtually a container or a rear part of an enclosed trailer, yes.  Q. When you used that expression, container, are you referring to  something?  A. Like a shipping container.  Q. You spoke of the gravel and dust et cetera. Did that impede your view?  A. It did.  Q. Were you able to see any markings on the truck or the trailer or the container?  A. No, I wasn't. It was drawing away but at that time, once again we are talking about a sequence of events, it was drawing away but I was certainly occupied with other things that were happening at that time.  Q. When you first saw the rear of the trailer where was it?  A. It was very close. I'd say within three metres of the front of the  car.  Q. Was it travelling entirely within one lane or was it between  lanes?  A. I'd say it probably had one wheel off the road, too.  Q. On the left-hand side or right-hand side?  A. On the left-hand side.  Q. What makes you say that?  A. Because of the dust that was coming up. If it was completely on the bitumen I doubt there would have been that kind of stuff being thrown at us.  Q. And when you say you saw the rear of it, you said that it was moving away. How rapidly was there a distance being created between the car in which you were travelling and the container?  A. It was moving away very quickly. I can't say what speed and certainly, as I say, I was distracted by other things going on at the same time.  Q. What happened to the car in which you were placed?  A. Qier got the car back on to the road, got all wheels back on to the road. At that time it, it was as if the car was on ice. It, it serious simply seemed to be running down the road. She was clinging to the wheel and I said ""Are you okay?"" And she said ""No"" and I just realised there was nothing I could do to help her. I couldn't interfere in any way and that is something that I've held myself guilty for since.  And the car continued down the road. Even if I'd been driving I don't believe I could have controlled it and then gradually, or not gradually, I'm sure it was very quickly in a time sequence, it veered to the right and was heading into the dirt and gravel on the right-hand side of the road.  I had this vague hope that the effect of driving into dirt would slow the car down and reduce its momentum but it, it started to turn over. I had this vision of the ground coming up towards me, the red ground coming up towards me. As the car turned it rolled to the left."" (T.22.39-25.15)  30Under cross-examination Mr Addicott described how the accident occurred as follows:  ""Q. You told us as your car neared where the accident occurred you felt the sensation of buffeting?  A. I did.  Q. You've described to us what that is. At that time you didn't see anything that was causing the buffeting?  A. I didn't, because I've felt that motion on many previous occasions driving up and down that road, so it didn't in itself particularly alarm me and I was concentrating on some fairly thorny issues, but I probably would have - the sequence of events  that I did describe happened in quick succession from that point onwards.  Q. The first time you saw what you say appeared to be the back of a truck, that image was in front of your car?  A. That's right.  Q. You never saw a vehicle to the right-hand side of your car at the time you felt the buffeting?  A. I didn't look that way, no.  Q. When you first saw what you say you thought was the rear of the truck in front of you, how far was it, that is, the rear of what you say you thought was a truck, from the front of your car?  A. I hesitate to estimate but it looked very close. It was filling my field of vision so I would imagine it was something like three metres at that point and drawing away.  Q. So that's three metres between the front of your Subaru?  A. The front of the car, not where I was sitting, of course.  Q. The front of the car and what you thought was the back of the  truck?  A. Yeah.  Q. Between the front of the car and the back of the truck, as I understood your evidence, your view was obscured by dust and gravel being thrown up?  A. Absolutely, yes.  Q. At this point part of the Subaru is off the left-hand side of the  road?  A. Certainly the passenger side wheel was off the road, the front  wheel. I'm not sure about the back.  Q. And at this time the effect of your evidence is, as I understood it, that the truck had to be off, that is, the left-hand wheels at least, off the side of the bitumen to create this dust and gravel that was obscuring your vision?  A. Yes.  Q. Was the truck that was occupying your field of vision directly in front of the Subaru at the time you saw it for the first occasion?  A. As far as I could tell.  Q. Did you see the truck continue to move away from the front of the Subaru from that very first moment you saw it?  A. It was moving away but I was distracted immediately by the sequence of events that was happening in my car at that stage.  Q. And that sequence of events was triggered by Qier turning the wheel of the Subaru sharply to the right?  A. No, not sharply. She pulled it back on to the road but it wasn't a sharp movement.  Q. Could you describe the path of the Subaru when it went back on the road?  A. How would I describe it?  Q. Yes.  A. When it went on to the road or as it was on the road?  Q. From the moment it came on to the road, that is, back on to the road having been partially off to the left-hand side, could you describe the path of the Subaru from that point?  A. It seemed to be more or less straight. It wasn't weaving. The car was out of control at that point. It would have been out of control for anyone at that point. As I say, it just felt like the car was on ice and Qier was holding grimly to the wheel.  Q. And the vehicle went off to the right, that is, the eastern side of the road?  A. To the eastern side of the road but it did run down what would probably be the centre of the road for some distance.  Q. But out of control?  A. Apparently out of control, yeah.  Q. When you say apparently, was it your impression that the driver, that is, Qier, had lost control of the car at that point?  A. Well, I don't know if she lost control, she was still retaining the steering wheel, but the car was not responding.  Q. It went up, that is, the car, up about the middle of the road?  A. It came back on to the road, got about towards the middle of the road, I would say, and then slid - well, went on its way down the middle of the road until it veered to the right. It wasn't a sharp -neither movement off from the left to the road nor the movement off the road was sharp."" (T.30.8 - 31.48)  ""Q. I want to take you back to the moments leading up to the car leaving the road. To recap, you first saw the truck you say that was involved in this incident when it was directly in front of your car?  A. Yes.  Q. You didn't hear any sound from the truck before you saw it in front of you?  A. I didn't.  Q. And you were not aware of its actual physical presence until you saw it three metres in front of your car?  A. I was aware of the buffeting effect and presumed that it was a truck of some kind because I had experienced that sensation before on a number of occasions driving up and down the Stuart Highway.  Q. But you didn't even turn your eyes or avert your gaze to the  right?  A. Not at that point, because everything was happening very  quickly after that.  Q. Was this the first occasion that Qier had driven with you on this  length of road?  A. On this length of road?  Q. Yes.  A. Yes.  Q. After you, as you say, felt a buffeting sensation, did you hear Qier say anything?  A. I don't recall her saying anything until I asked her when the car was careering down the road after she got back on to the bitumen, all wheels back on to the bitumen when I could see there was nothing I could do, I said, ""Are you okay?"" And she said ""no"".  Q. That's all she said, ""no""?  A. She was hanging on for grim death and sailing down the road  clutching the steering wheel and obviously highly stressed.  Q. I put it to you, Mr Addicott, that in fact you didn't experience any buffeting sensation immediately before Qier lost control of the car, that's not the truth of it.  A. I am sorry?  Q. I am putting to you that you did not experience any buffeting sensation in the car immediately before Qier lost control of the car?  A. Well, I did."" (T.55.6 - .48)  31There is a major difficulty with the evidence of Mr Addicott as to how the accident occurred and the presence of an overtaking truck. The difficulty is that on a number of occasions following the accident, when he was asked how the accident occurred, he made no mention of any other vehicle. On some occasions he denied that another vehicle was involved.  32Constable Baker spoke to Mr Addicott at the accident scene and asked him how the accident had occurred. Constable Baker took notes in dot point form of what he was told. Mr Addicott told him that the plaintiff had ""lost control"" (T. 141.11) and made no mention of there being any other vehicle involved in the accident. Although he had spoken to Mr Addicott for only a short period of time, Constable Baker said that Mr Addicott ""didn't appear to be exhibiting any signs of being too distraught"" (T.134.9).  33While Constable Agostino made no notes of her observations or  discussions at the accident scene, she had a clear recollection of having spoken to Mr Addicott. Her evidence on this issue was:  ""Q. What did you ask?  A. Along the lines of what happened, and --  Q. Do you remember his response?  A. To the effect, not exact words, that he didn't know what had caused the accident, that one moment they had been driving along the road and the next moment they were rolling off it or involved in an accident.  Q. When abouts did this conversation take place in relation to your initial arrival at the scene?  A. I can't remember whether I had it immediately with him. I had a conversation with him, I remember he was being treated by the ambulance while sitting at the side of the ambulance. I can't remember whether that conversation was part of that or whether it was before the ambulance got there, but it was at some point at the scene.  Q. And do you have a clear recall of this conversation now?  A. Yes."" (T.158.44 -159.11).  34When Mr Addicott was cross-examined as to these conversations, his response was:  ""Q. Was it firmly burnt in your mind at that time, though, that the  cause of Qier leaving the road had been the overtaking heavy  vehicle?  A. I don't remember what my comprehension of the situation was  at that time. As I say, my foremost thought all the time was Qier's  safety.  Q. Is it the case that it has been firmly fixed in your mind since this incident that the cause of Qier leaving the roadway was the actions of the driver of this truck?  A. As I have been able to reflect on the accident, after that initial period of trauma, I suppose, when I simply just didn't know what was going on at all, I didn't have myself together, I can sequence the events and say that yes, the intimidating effect of the truck would have caused that deviation off the road to the left and then back on to the road.  Q. And that's a clear image you have fixed in your mind after this initial trauma, as you've called it?  A. Yes.  Q. And this initial trauma, what sort of period are we talking  about?  A. I would say I was at that level of trauma that I am describing, it  would have persisted for a fortnight to three weeks. I was still  taking medication for pain for my arm injury, I was still vomiting  and fainting. Su Li had to wash me and help me dress. I had no-  Q. Do you recall two police officers being the first emergency personnel who arrived at the accident?  A. I do, yes.  Q. A male and a female?  A. Yes.  Q. And they both asked you how the accident happened?  A. They - my memory is not clear on the process, but they would  have, no doubt.  Q. To the female police officer you said you didn't know what had  happened?  A. I don't remember.  Q. Do you remember the male police officer having a notebook  with him?  A. No, I don't remember.  Q. He may have had but you don't now recall?  A. I don't recall that, no.  Q. He asked you specifically how the accident had happened, did he not?  A. I can't remember. As I say, my memory of those subsequent events is kind of limited.  Q. I put it to you that male police officer specifically asked you how the accident happened and you said that Qier lost control?  A. If that's his recollection I probably did.  Q. You didn't have any notion of how the accident occurred at the scene of the accident, did you, you simply knew that Qier had lost control?  A. No. At the time my main priority was Qier and I was only answering questions that were put to me in the words that I could find at the time. I remember thinking I've got to keep myself together, I've got to keep myself together, but that certainly was a very extraordinary time."" (T.34.41 - 35.48)  35Ms Ralph, a case manager with the Australian Taxation Office, gave evidence concerning her contact with Mr Addicott following the accident. As a case manager, her objective was to return Mr Addicott to work as soon as possible. This involved discussing with him what his injuries were, looking at whether a rehabilitation provider should be engaged and whether medical assessments were necessary. She had an independent recollection of Mr Addicott because ""it is the only motor vehicle accident that I've had to deal with and also because Mr Addicott was a Senior Executive Service level officer, which is quite high in the ATO, quite a fuss was made at the time to look after him"" (T.191.13).  36This recollection was supported by entries which she made under a computerised system known as ""PIE"" (People Issues Escalation System). Her entries into the computer system were based upon handwritten notes taken at the time but subsequently destroyed. These computer printouts became exhibit 10. This contact with Mr Addicott took place in November 2008.  37Her evidence concerning what she was told by Mr Addicott was:  ""Q. Do you recall whether on that occasion you in fact inquired of  him as to the circumstances of the accident that had led to his  claim?  A. Yes, I do believe I did and Mr Addicott told me that the accident  happened about 100 kilometres north of Coober Pedy, that Ms  Peterson had been driving and that she had skidded on the gravel  on the side of the road and lost control of the car."" (T. 192.25)  38In relation to Mr Addicott's emotional state, Ms Ralph said:  ""Q. And when you say you saw Mr Addicott, you said he was upset, did you have any concerns about the cogency or the reliability of the description of the accident he gave you?  A. No, he was able to discuss what had happened, even though he was obviously distressed, because he was very concerned with Miss Peterson's welfare and he didn't really want to have to come into the office to do all the admin side of things."" (T. 196.41)  39One of the computer entries in exhibit 10, made by Ms Ralph, described the accident in the following terms:  ""The accident occurred at - 9am on Stuart Highway on 2.11.08 - a 100 km north of Coober Pedy. Qier was driving at the time of the accident. Neither Graeme nor Qier had consumed any alcohol in the 24 hours prior to the accident. Graeme believes Qier skidded on the gravel shoulder of the road, and over-corrected which caused the vehicle to roll. There was no other vehicle involved. The vehicle was ""written off'.  That entry was made on 13 November 2008.  40Mr Addicott was cross-examined as to his contact with Ms Ralph:  ""Q. Do you recall Ms Ralph asking you how the accident  happened?  A. I don't recall the conversations, no. I, I know she was  extremely worried about Su Li and attempting to find someone  who could speak French to her.  Q. Do you recall anything you might have said to Ms Ralph about how the accident had occurred?  A. I don't, to be honest, at that time. It was all part of that overriding emotional pain I was feeling. I just felt that I was living in a nightmare at that point.  Q. But you remember the fact of the matter being that she actually  raised with you how did the accident happen?  A. I don't remember her doing so but I presume she would have done.  Q. I put it to you when you saw her on the occasion I directed your attention to, you told her that the accident occurred approximately 9am on the Stuart Highway on 2 November about a hundred kilometres north of Coober Pedy, that is correct?  A. I don't remember how accurate the time or the distances are but that is the circumstances of the case.  ...  Q. And then I put it to you on this occasion you went on to tell Ms Ralph that you believed Qier skidded on the gravel shoulder of the road and overcorrected which caused the vehicle to role?  A. I don't recall those words, no. I don't recall saying that.  Q. Do you accept you may have said that to her?  A. Because I can't remember that I did, I can't say.  Q. You see, Ms Ralph will tell the court that you went on to say to  her there was no other vehicle involved?  A. It was in that sense. I meant there was no collision.  Q. Is that what you told her? That there was no other vehicle  involved?  A. In the sense that there was no collision, that was my  understanding of her question.  Q. I see. You remember the question now, do you?  A. No, but that would be my understanding of that question.  Q. Didn't you think it important if you were asked that question to explain that Qier had been forced off the road by a large truck?  A. I don't remember at that time, I'm sorry."" (T.38.34 - 39.34)  41Evidence was given by Ms Bright, who in November 2008 was a customer services officer with a company called Sureplan. Sureplan was an organisation which lodged insurance claims in respect of car accidents involving vehicles made available to Senior Executive Service Officers such as Mr Addicott. While Ms Bright had no independent recollection of what she had been told by Mr Addicott, she clearly recalled speaking to him and being provided by him with details of the accident. Those details she recorded by way of computer entries which became exhibit 8.  42The computer entries which were made in mid November 2008 variously described the accident as follows:  ""The passenger (custodian) is out of hospital and can be contacted. I spoke with him today and he provided a similar description of the accident (which has been added to file) but cannot account for the initial swerve by the vehicle that caused the driver to over correct.""  ""The passenger's (OC) version - 100 km north of Coober Pedy. The passenger was looking out the window when the car swerved (OC does not know why but confirmed the driver was not distracted). After the car swerved, the driver attempted to correct it but has lost control and the car has left the road on the right hand side and has started to roll several times, with the resultant damage.""  ""The incident reporter was not provided with complete information.  The custodian (passenger) advised there appears to be no mechanical fault. He believes the driver over-corrected after skidding on some gravel and has left the road, rolling the vehicle.""  43Mr Addicott was cross-examined in relation to his contact with Ms Bright as follows:  ""Q. I put it to you on 18 November, that is 2008, some 16 days after the accident, Ms Bright of Innovations Sureplan contacted you about processing the claim for insurance and asked you for a description of the accident?  A. I, once again I have no memory of that conversation.  Q. I put it to you that in such a phone call she told you that the, the description of the accident that was available to her was that about a hundred kilometres north of Coober Pedy the passenger was looking out the window, and that was you. When the car swerved, you didn't know why but confirmed the driver was not distracted after the car swerved. The driver attempted to correct it but lost control and the car has left the road on the right-hand side and started to roll several times with the resultant damage. And you advised there appears to be no mechanical fault and you believe the driver overcorrected after skidding on some gravel and left the road, rolling the vehicle. And that you communicated, when describing the accident, the circumstances that both you and Qier were in hospital. I'm putting to you that is the effect of what Ms Bright said was a description of the accident available to her from the records that she had control of?  A. That was her summary of what that conversation was, are you saying?  Q. I'm saying that is what she put to you. This is the conversation  to which I directed your attention which I'm suggesting to you  occurred on 18 November 2008?  A. I don't remember the conversation but the point was that I was  not in hospital. I'd been operated but I was not admitted to  hospital.  Q. Putting that to one side the description of the accident that I'm  putting to you that Ms Bright recited to you was to the effect that  I've just put to you. Do you recall that occurring?  A. I don't recall that conversation and that apparently is her  summary of what she understood to be the subject of the  conversation.  Q. You accept that that may have been put to you in a  conversation you do not now recall?  A. I don't recall the conversation so I can't accept or deny.  Q. Isn't that description of the accident that I've just put to you  which was summarised to you by Ms Bright, isn't that in fact what  occurred?  A. Not so. Only partially. If the car left the road to the left, came  back on the road and then was out of control, those elements are  right. The car turned over. Qier ended up in hospital. I spent a  few hours in hospital but that, that's...  Q. Yes, but in the description that I put to you and suggest that it was in turn put to you by Ms Bright, there is no mention of another vehicle at all, is there?  A. Apparently not.  Q. When you spoke to Ms Bright in this conversation which you  say you do not recall, I put to you that you added, when you spoke  to her, that you could not account for the initial swerve by the  vehicle that caused Qier to overcorrect?  A. I can't recall a conversation, that's all I can say."" (T.41.17 - 42.18)  44Evidence was given by Ms Neil, who in November 2008 was employed by the Royal Adelaide Hospital as a compensation officer. Her role was to determine whether a patient at the hospital had a claim for compensation with any insurer throughout Australia. Ms Neil said that apart from documents which she had completed in relation to the plaintiff's claim she had quite a specific recollection concerning the events relating to the claim (T.179.9).  Because the plaintiff was too injured to complete the forms relating to the accident, Mr Addicott completed them on her behalf.  45Ms Neil remembered Mr Addicott coming to her desk on 14 November 2008 with the vehicle accident form and asking her what needed to be done in relation to it. She had filled in the form for him and said that all of the information on the form had been provided to her by him. In relation to the question on the form about details of the accident, Ms Neil's evidence was:  ""Q. Do you have a recollection of speaking to Mr Addicott about this question?  A. I do.  Q. And can you tell us then, please, what question was asked by you and what answer was provided by Mr Addicott which permitted you to answer the question in that fashion?  A. I asked him the details of the accident and he advised me that he had spoken to his wife that morning and she had told him that she had swerved to miss a kangaroo and because this form is just a generalisation for our hospital we then normally just put the details like ""driver, single vehicle accident"" or ""lost control"", but he did tell me that she had swerved to miss a kangaroo.  Q. As a result of what he said you wrote ""driver lost control""; is  that right?  A. Yes. He said that she had lost control."" (T.181.25)  46On the form (exhibit 1 and exhibit 9) the question asked was ""Details of accident: (e.g. car lost control and hit stobie pole, other vehicle went through red light, etc.)"" the response is recorded as ""Driver lost control"". Later in the same form in answer to the question ""If you are not entitled to a claim through Third Party Insurance, please state reason why? i.e. driver of single vehicle, lost control"" the response set out on the form is ""Driver lost control"". The form was signed by Mr Addicott.  47In answer to a question about whether she had been told anything about another vehicle, Ms Neil's evidence was:  ""Q. Just pausing there, if something was said by Mr Addicott to you about the involvement of a road train or a truck or some other vehicle, how would this form have been filled out differently?  A. It would be completely different. Because of my knowledge with CTP, compulsory third party, if there's any mention of another vehicle involved or a cow or anything like that it changes the whole perspective of the claim. If a vehicle is involved then I do advise them that they are possibly entitled to a claim."" (T.182.5)  48Mr Addicott was cross-examined in relation to the Vehicle Accident Form and the evidence of Ms Neil:  ""Q. And do you recall attending at a desk in the finance department of the Royal Adelaide Hospital and speaking to a lady about completing this form?  A. I don't, I'm sorry. I remember going to the finance department but I don't remember the purpose or the, to whom I spoke.  ...  Q. Did it occur to you that it would be important to the hospital to know whether there was some compensation that might be  received by Qier as a consequence of the accident from which the hospital could seek reimbursement of its costs?  A. Certainly not.  ...  Q. You will see about four lines from the top there is a typed question, Details of Accident. I won't read the rest of the words. Do you see that?  A. Yes.  Q. The words are not in your handwriting?  A. No.  Q. But in some other person's handwriting, ""Driver lost control""?  A. Mm.  Q. Is that not the detail you provided to a lady in the finance department at the same time that you attended there and in fact signed the bottom of this document?  A. Well, it must have been if she got that information but I don't recall that, those conversations, I'm sorry.  Q. And you will see the same answer appears opposite a question halfway down the page which I will not read out in its entirety. See it starts ""If you are not entitled to a claim"". Do you see that?  A. I see that. I don't remember that, answering that question as such. I think that must have been filled in.  Q. Aren't the two answers on this page about how the collision occurred in fact the truth of it. That Qier just lost control of the car she was driving north on the Stuart Highway?  A. Not so.  Q. In fact you tell us you don't recall this occasion when you signed the document but you acknowledge it is your signature?  A. That is my signature, yes.  Q. I put it to you that what you told the lady who completed the form for you and in front of whom you signed it, was this: You said that your wife was now able to speak to you and that very morning she had told you that she had swerved to miss a kangaroo?  A. No, I never, Qier never said that to me.  Q. Never?  A. Never."" (T.43.12 - 44.37)  49I do not accept the evidence of Mr Addicott as to the presence of another vehicle immediately before the accident. I am of the opinion that Mr Addicott did not see another vehicle and was unaware of the presence of another vehicle immediately before the accident.  50On that issue, I prefer the evidence of Constables Baker and Agostino and of Ms Ralph, Ms Bright and Ms Neil. I found those witnesses to be impressive, particularly Constable Agostino and Ms Neil. I formed a clear impression as to each one of them, that they were doing their best to assist the Court and to accurately set out their recollections of the events of November 2008. None of those persons had any motivation to mislead the Court. Where their evidence conflicts with that of Mr Addicott as to the presence of another vehicle immediately before the accident, I accept their evidence and reject that of Mr Addicott.  51Constable Baker, Ms Ralph, Ms Bright and Ms Neil were able to explain clearly the documents which comprise exhibits 1, 4, 8, 9 and 10. Those documents were consistent with their evidence as to what they were told by Mr Addicott.  52I do not accept that Mr Addicott was so traumatised by the accident that he was incapable of properly describing the accident. I do not accept that he was unable to refer to a large truck driving so close to the white Subaru that it caused the Subaru to partly move off the bitumen surface of the highway to the west. Mr Addicott struck me as being a careful and meticulous person who, had he made such observations of another vehicle, would have communicated that fact certainly to the police and to at least one of Ms Ralph, Ms Bright or Ms Neil.  53I do not accept his explanation that when asked whether another vehicle was involved in the accident he interpreted this question to mean whether there had been a collision with another vehicle. I am satisfied that had Mr Addicott seen and felt another vehicle as he described in his evidence, he would have said something about it to at least one of Constables Baker and Agostino and Mses Ralph, Bright and Neil.  54I have concluded that Mr Addicott did not see or feel the presence of another vehicle immediately before this accident.  55That finding was implicitly accepted by senior counsel for the plaintiff in the course of oral submissions. There, counsel said:  ""COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF: ... I am not standing here to say he should be treated as a liar. I am going to put a submission now that is capable of explaining the circumstances, that Mr Addicott may, an enormously emotional matter for him, have reconstructed this. I am not also going to put to your Honour that Mr Addicott gave accounts under some disadvantage because he was frightened, shocked, emotional, et cetera. They went on for too long.  HIS HONOUR: That's the troubling feature. Had it just been what he said to the police followed up a few weeks later by a change, you may say, well, that may well be a very fraught situation, but to do it three or four times.  COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF: Your Honour anticipated that that may be my answer. It is not. I will tell you what my answer is. We submit that the probability with Mr Addicott is that he did not see what happened. He was probably distracted. Probably alerted to it and when it happened he did not see what happened.  Is there a possibility that in the agony of that moment the car, losing control, he looking at his wife - they had not been together all that long - and he did not see what happened.  Imagine for the moment if Graeme Addicott had come before your Honour and said: I was looking there, thinking about some tricky valuation I had had to carry out and she lost control of the car. It began swerving across the road, it rolled out over the other side of the road. I don't know what caused her to lose control. That could be consistent with there being no truck but it also could be consistent with there being a truck which he did not see. That is our explanation and that is what we ask your Honour to find. But that is all I can say about it."" (T.280.41 - 281.17)  56Similar observations were made in the plaintiff's written submissions:  ""36 It is accepted that Mr Addicott's evidence has problems and the absence of a contemporaneous account by him means that his evidence is of very limited value.  37       This is not an acceptance that Mr Addicott is a liar - far from it. Rather, his evidence probably suffers from the problem that it is a reconstruction, built upon the observations of Ms Peterson and Ms Deng. It is submitted that Mr Addicott is a careful and considerate man, who was truthful when he says that he bears some guilt in relation to the incident.  38       The Court may prefer to put Mr Addicott's evidence aside and to test Ms Peterson's case by reference to the other evidence. Putting Mr Addicott's evidence aside does not damage Ms Peterson's case. The balance of the evidence is sufficient to prove the case.""  57The problem created by Mr Addicott's evidence is not as simply resolved as the plaintiff's written submissions would have it. It is not just a question of putting Mr Addicott's evidence concerning another vehicle to one side. If, as I have found and as appears to have been conceded by the plaintiff, Mr Addicott did not see or feel a truck passing the Subaru, the question remains how could that be so if in fact a truck did pass the Subaru in the manner described by the plaintiff and Ms Deng.  58Mr Addicott's failure to see any such truck needs to be reconciled with the evidence of the plaintiff and Ms Deng.  The Plaintiff's evidence  59The plaintiff was born in July 1962 in Shenyang, a city in China. Her principal language is Mandarin. She speaks a little English. She married a Mr Peterson, who was a student living in China and came to Australia with him in August 1993. That marriage broke down and they were divorced. While living in Darwin, the plaintiff met Mr Addicott and they commenced living together in 2008 in Canberra. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff had had an Australian driver's licence for over 10 years.  60It was her evidence that she put on a seatbelt when she became the driver of the Subaru after leaving Coober Pedy. She said that because Mr Addicott's legs were longer than hers, she moved the seat forward. She said that she wore a seatbelt every time that she drove a motor vehicle. She said that immediately before the accident, the vehicle was travelling a little over 90 kph.  61The plaintiff's description of how the accident occurred was as follows:  ""A. After I started driving it wasn't long, not more than half an hour. I saw from the rear view mirror that a big truck was approaching behind. I saw the truck about 50 to a hundred metres behind.  Q. What happened after that?  A. I, because of the truck was travelling at a fairly high speed, I moved, I moved my car to the side a bit to try to give way to the truck. I don't know how, how far the truck was behind me.  ...  Q. When you first saw the truck did you do anything about your  speed?  A. I increased my speed to some extent and moved, while I  moved to the side of the road.  Q. Do you know how fast you were going when you increased  your speed?  A. About a hundred.  Q. And when you increased your speed to a hundred the truck  continue to gain on you?  A. Yes. It was very close and also very high speed.  Q. You say you moved your car to the left. When you moved your  car to the left where was the truck?  A. The truck was behind me and it, it honked its horn once.  Q. I did ask you, when you moved your car to the left where was the truck? Was it still behind you? Next to you? Where was it?  A. It was overtaking me.  Q. From where you were sitting in your car how far away, you can indicate this with your hands or by whatever means, how far away was the truck from your car?  A. When I moved my car to the left side the truck then overtook me from my right side.  Q. Now, I'm asking you at the time you moved your car to the left. How much distance was there between your car and the truck?  A. Are you asking about the distance between these two vehicles when it overtook me?  Q. Yes. How far was between the two vehicles?  A.  About that distance.  COUNSEL FOR THE PLAINTIFF: A metre and a half.  COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENDANT: Yes.  Q. Could you feel anything in your car when the truck was next to  you?  A. My car was shaking.  Q. Could you control it?  A. At that time I could control it.  Q. Why did you move your car to the left?  A. Because after the front of the truck passed me the rear part of the truck was very close to my car. If I didn't move to the left the truck would have hit my car.  Q. In terms of moving to the left, when you moved to the left how close was the truck to your car?  A. I showed you before, it was that close when the truck overtook me. Because the truck was travelling very fast the rear part of the truck was going to hit my car. If I didn't move my car to the left the truck would have hit my car, so to avoid the collision I moved to the left and I moved to the left further. The wheel at that time left the road and was actually on the dirt and the grass part of the road.  Q. Compared to the speed of your car, was the truck going faster? A. Very fast.  Q. After you felt your wheels leave the road surface and go on to the dirt and grass, what happened next?  A. Then I swerved to the right to try to correct the car. It went to the right and rolled over.  Q. Could you describe to the judge what the truck looked like?  A. The truck was very big, very long. It was around the end of the first trolley.  Q. Could you start that again?  A. It was very big, very long. It was around the end of the first  trolley and the beginning of the second trolley.  Q. I don't understand that. Could you describe what you mean by a trolley?  A. The trailer part of the truck, there is a truck cabin at the front and then the trailer part.  Q. And with the trailer part, were there different parts to the  trailer?  A. I don't understand what you mean.  Q. You said there was a cabin part?  A. The cabin and then three parts of the trailer part of the truck.""  (T.61.22 - 64.6)  62The plaintiff was cross-examined as to how the accident occurred. She said that she first observed the truck in her internal rear view mirror. The truck was about 50 -100 metres behind at that time and she observed its cabin to be white in colour. She said that the truck was directly behind her vehicle when she first saw it. She looked in her rear vision mirror when she heard the truck sound its horn.  63The plaintiff's further evidence under cross-examination was:  ""Q. At that time when you looked in your mirror and saw the truck after that honk, what side of the road was the truck?  A. When I heard the honk I moved my car to the left and then the truck started overtaking me.  Q. I want to know when you looked in your rear vision mirror when you heard the truck honk its horn, was it straight behind your car or was it on the wrong side of the road?  A. After I heard the honk I started to move into the left. The truck moved forward some more and it started overtaking me.  Q. Did you see the truck move to its wrong side of the road?  A. The truck didn't move into the wrong side of the road. When it, the road had two lanes, one for each direction. When the truck overtook me I increased my speed and went forward and the truck overtook me but it stayed, the truck stayed in the right lane at all times.  Q. When you say the right lane?  A. Correct. The correct lane.  ...  A. Before the truck overtook me it was in the same lane as I was travelling. When the truck overtook me I'm not too sure whether it went over the midline into the wrong lane. I didn't know about that.  ...  Q. And you have told us about the honk you heard. Was that a  very loud noise?  A. The normal, the normal sound of a honk.  Q. Did it startle you?  A. No, it did not. I just moved to the side and increased speed a  bit.  Q. Was there only one honk that you heard from the truck?  A. Yes, that is correct.  ...  Q. When you first felt this movement you have told us about in your car, where was the front of the truck in relation to where you were seated in your car?  A. Not far away.  Q. Was it in front of where you were seated, that is your position in the car? Or was it behind where you were seated in your car? I'm talking about the front of the truck?  A. It was, I felt the movement when it was very close to where I was sitting.  Q. When you felt this movement you have told us before it was shaking, where was the left-hand side of your car?  A. At that time I had already moved to the left a bit. They were still on the left side of the road.  ...  Q. You mean your car was on the left side of the road but was it  all on the bitumen?  A. One wheel was very close to the grass already.  Q. Do you mean front left-hand wheel of your car?  A. Yes.  ...  Q. I'm asking about the cabin. How close was the side of the cabin of the truck to your side of the car as the cabin went past your car? A. About that.  COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT: Witness indicating a metre. About a metre?  COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF: Yes."" (T.65.46 - 68.35)  ""Q. Are you sure there were three trailers behind the cabin of the truck that passed you?  A. I think so.  Q. And all three trailers eventually got ahead of your car after the truck passed?  A. The three trailers passed me only after I moved to the left. When I was going straight the trailers hadn't passed me yet. I moved to the left and then moved back.  Q. Ever since the accident has it been your memory that there were three trailers being towed by the cabin?  A. Yes.  Q. You have never been uncertain as to whether there were three  trailers or just a large truck?  A. No, I have never been uncertain. It was three, three trailers.""  (T.71.32 -.49)  Q. Why did you increase the speed of your car if it was obvious the truck was going to pass you?  A. Because the truck honked its horn behind me so I just moved, moved forward further.  Q. Why did you not slow down your car to make it easier for the truck to go past you?  A. Because I thought if I slowed my car down it would be dangerous because the truck was very close to me already.  ...  Q. Can you tell us how much faster the truck was going than your  car?  A. I think it was about 120.  Q. When you last saw the truck, where was it?  A. The final position?  Q. Yes. The very last time you saw the truck it was in front of  your car?  A. The truck cabin was in front of my car.  Q. Where was the back of the truck at the time you last saw the truck?  A. About that (demonstrating).  COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT: Two-thirds of a metre?  COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF: I thought it was a metre.  HIS HONOUR: I don't think it was a metre. It was more like two-thirds of a metre.  Q. But that wasn't the back of the truck you are talking about. Aren't you talking about the side of the truck?  A. I was talking about the section between the end of the first trailer and the front of the second trailer.  Q. Did you see the whole of the truck, including the trailers, go past the front of your car?  A. At that time I started moving to the left. If I didn't, the truck would have definitely hit my car.  Q. Could you just listen to the question carefully, please. Did you see the whole of the truck, including the trailers, pass in front of your car?  A.   No.  Q. So when you last saw the truck, part of the trailer or a trailer was next to your car?  A. The truck cabin passed. It was between the end of the first trailer and the front of the second trailer. Then I moved to the left because it was too close.  Q. And you did not see the truck again after you moved to the  left?  A. I moved to the left and then moved to the right again. My car  was in a straight position briefly and then moved to the right and  then fell to a lower ground.  Q. You mean on the other side of the road when you say lower  ground?  A. I moved of to the left then moved to the right. The car was in a  straight line position briefly, then the car was sort of - I sort of lost  the control of the car. The car then fell to the lower ground.  ...  Q. When you moved back on to the bitumen when you turned to the right you did not see the truck again. Is that your evidence? A. At the time I was anxious to turn the wheel back. I didn't see the truck."" (T.73.23 - 75.5)  64The plaintiff was asked a number of questions about whether she had spoken to Mr Addicott whilst a patient at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. The plaintiff said that she could not remember and that she had no clear recollection of events until she was in the Prince of Wales Hospital.  65The plaintiff was asked some questions directed to when she first told anyone about a truck being involved in the accident. Implicit in the questions was a suggestion that she had only spoken about a truck being involved after she had seen a lawyer. On this issue, the plaintiff said:  ""Q. And did you see him in the month of February after the  accident?  A. After they removed the tube from my neck I transferred from  acute to rehab. The lawyer rang me first and then came to see  me.  Q. He was the first one to make contact with you, is that what happened?  A. There was another patient like me. I met this patient in the gym. That patient saw me like that. He asked me what happened to me. I told him about my situation. He said he had a lawyer representing him in a case. I then asked him for his lawyer's phone number. He didn't give it to me and later the lawyer rang me. So I thought he must have told my situation to the lawyer."" (T.72.20 -.30)  It is clear from exhibit 3 that by 13 February 2009 the plaintiff had consulted a solicitor.  66To rebut the suggestion of recent invention, evidence was given by Dr Monica Ling, a rehabilitation specialist, who treated the plaintiff after her admission to the Prince of Wales Hospital. Dr Ling's parents were Chinese and she is able to speak a little Mandarin. The date when this conversation took place is not clear. The range of dates is between the middle of January until early February 2009. Dr Ling's evidence concerning the conversation was:  ""Q. Using your best Mandarin, did you ask her something?  A. Yes.  Q. And translating your own question into English, how did you  commence the conversation?  A. I asked her what were the circumstances of her car accident.  Q. Did she respond?  A. Yes. To which she replied she tried to swerve to avoid an  oncoming truck, the opposite direction.  Q. Did she say anything else about the circumstances of the  accident?  A. No."" (T.112.26 -.35)  ""Q. Your recollection of this conversation when Ms Peterson mentioned a truck is quite clear?  A. Yes.  Q. And you are crystal clear that she mentioned a truck coming in the opposite direction?  A. Yes."" (T.115.8 -.14)  67I was most impressed with Dr Ling as a witness and I have no hesitation in accepting her evidence as not only being truthful, but accurate.  The evidence of Ms Deng  68The only other witness to the accident was the plaintiff's sister, Ms Deng. Like the plaintiff she was born in Shenyang in China and her principal language was Mandarin. She was born in April 1958. She was married to a Frenchman and lived in France with permanent residency status. She said that one of the reasons they were driving to Darwin was to visit a Chinese friend of hers. She gave her evidence through a Mandarin interpreter.  69Ms Deng's evidence concerning the accident was:  ""A.   I was reading a Chinese newspaper and then at some time I felt the shaking of the car.  Q. I will ask a question, if I may. At the time you felt the shaking of the car were you still reading the newspaper?  A. Yes, I, I thought it was just a, a normal passing of another vehicle so I didn't look outside.  Q.  Well, after you felt the shaking what did you next become aware of?  A.  At the time I was still reading the paper and then I heard a scream from my sister. Now I saw a truck outside, I saw a truck in front of us. I only saw the, the back of the truck.  Q. Which window were you looking out of? The front window, the side windows? Where were you looking when you saw the truck?  A. The front window of the car.  Q. When you saw the truck what did you see? Could you describe it?  A. After I heard the scream from my sister I saw the back of the truck and the truck was somewhat slanted in some sort of angle and now I felt the car shook a couple of times and rolled over.  Q. When you saw the truck through the front window how far away was it from the body of the car in which you were travelling?  A. I can't tell you exactly how many metres, how many metres it was but it was very close. Maybe about two, three or four metres."" (T.80.6 -.31)  70Under cross-examination Ms Deng's evidence was:  ""Q. You've told us as the car got close to where the accident happened you felt a shaking of the car. Do you remember telling us that?  A. Yes.  Q. Has it always been your clear memory that you felt a shaking of the car just before the accident?  A. Yes.  Q. But you told us the first you saw the truck was when it was ahead of your car. Was it straight in front of your car when you first saw it?  A. Not straight ahead. It was in an angled position.  Q. Do you mean angled to your left off the edge of the roadway? A. (Indicating).  COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT: Has the witness indicated by her hand gestures what she wanted to say, is that what happened?  INTERPRETER: She indicated the truck front was towards the left side of the road, in that angle. The truck front was towards the side of the road, left side of the road.  (At the direction of counsel for the defendant Ms Deng drew a diagram of the truck indicating its direction.)  A. When I draw this picture I don't know how close our car was to the edge of the road. I'm just drawing the position of our car and the truck when I saw it where the truck was relative to our car.  Q. Is this diagram intended to show that when you first saw the  back of the truck the truck was still on the road?  A. Whose car, our car or the truck? (Question read.). Yes.  Q. And when you first saw the back of the truck you say you had a clear view of it?  A. Yes.  Q. Did you ever see the truck leave the road and go off on to the dirt to the left?  A. Then our car shook a couple of times and rolled over. I didn't see the truck any more.  Q. And before seeing the back of the truck in the position you've drawn you were not aware of it being on the roadway at all?  A. When the truck was passing us I didn't look. After I heard the scream of my sister I looked. The car was in front of us already.  Q. You did not hear the truck at all before you saw it in front of your car?  A. I did hear there was a noise. I thought it was just like a normal passing of another vehicle."" (T.83.47 - 85.11)  71Ms Deng then gave extensive evidence relating to the plaintiff's position in the overturned vehicle with particular reference to whether the plaintiff was restrained by a seatbelt and what, if anything, Ms Deng did in relation to the seatbelt and the plaintiff's right arm.  72Although the details were not entirely clear, on 13 February 2009 Ms Deng signed a statement in the presence of a lawyer using an interpreter in the Mandarin language. That document was exhibit 3. It was accepted by the plaintiff's legal advisers that exhibit 3 was prepared for use in the plaintiff's case. It was also accepted that the statement was made while Ms Deng was still in Australia.  73Exhibit 3 relevantly provided:  ""STATEMENT IN THE MATTER OF QIER PETERSON DATED 13 FEBRUARY 2009  Statement of Su Li Elis Deng  ...  5.        On 2 nd November 2008 I was sitting in the back seat of her car, the passenger side travelling on a long straight road.  I was looking at a paper. My sister said this is where we produce opals.  I was half looking at the paper. I heard my sister scream and I looked up. I saw the back of a large truck.  The truck was very close to the car.  The car then overturned and I don't remember after that.""  74Ms Deng was cross-examined on the contents of exhibit 3.  ""Q. And what has just been read to you is the truth?  A. I didn't lose conscious. I was very sober at the - at that time.  Q. In all the passage that has just been read to you in this document, is that the truth?  A. Something was incorrect. The part I don't remember after that is not correct.  Q. Is the rest of what has been read to you the truth?  A. Yes.  Q. There is no mention in those sentences about you feeling the car shaking, do you see that?  A. At the time, no-one asked me about that question. No-one asked whether I felt the shaking of the car, whether there was other vehicle passing our car.  Q. The truth is that it is not correct that you have always had a  clear recollection of feeling a shaking of the car just before the  accident?  A. I remember it clearly because I was sitting at the back, the car  was shaking.  Q. When the statement was taken, was a lawyer present with the  interpreter?  A. Yes.  Q. And he asked you questions in English which the interpreter interpreted into Mandarin and then you provided the answers to the interpreter in Mandarin?  A. Yes. Yes, but he didn't ask me those questions.  ...  Q. What you have said in the statement is you don't remember what happened after the car overturned. You recall that was read to you a few minutes ago by the interpreter?  A. I didn't say I don't remember after the car turned over.  HIS HONOUR: Q. When the lawyer asked you how you got out of the car, how did you respond to him?  A. I said Graeme broke the window. He got out. I got out from the same place after him. I remember I might have stepped forward a step and - and got out from that same place where Graeme got out.  Q. That is what you told the lawyer at the time that the statement was prepared, is that what you are saying?  A. Yes.  COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT: Q.  See, I put it to you that the  truth is you do not remember what happened after the car  overturned?  A. I did remember. Even though I may not have remembered a  hundred per cent but - a hundred per cent details, but I remember  the most - most part of it.  Q. I put it to you what you have told the Court about what you saw about your sister's arm, where it was after the accident, how you say you moved it and how you say you released the seatbelt is something that is not true?  A. The truth, I moved her arm, I unbuckled her seatbelt. I tried to lift her. I couldn't because it hurt me when I tried to do that. I did move her arm."" (T.101.17 - 102.43)  75Evidence was led from three witnesses to rebut the suggestion of recent invention by Ms Deng. The first of those witnesses was a Mr Li Si Xin. Mr Xin was born in May 1967 in Wuhan, China. He had been in Australia for some years when in 2005 he was involved in a motor vehicle accident. As a result of that motor vehicle accident, he became a paraplegic. He used regularly visit Prince of Wales Hospital to see a doctor there. He had retained a lawyer in relation to his accident.  76He gave evidence as to a conversation with Ms Deng. He could not remember the precise date but it seems to be early in February 2009. His evidence which was given through a Mandarin interpreter was:  ""Q. And how did you meet Qier Peterson?  A. When I went there to see doctor I met her sister at an eating  place there.  Q. Do you remember the sister's name?  A. I don't remember her name but I know the person.  Q. And did you get talking to the sister of Qier Peterson?  A. Yes.  Q. And do you now have any recollection of the date of this  conversation?  A. I can't remember the date, I can't remember the date. I  remember the content of the conversation.  Q. In the conversation that you had with Qier Peterson's sister do you remember any discussion about Qier's accident?  A. Yes.  Q. And did the sister of Qier Peterson say something to you about how the accident occurred?  A. She told me that when the accident happened that there was a big truck behind and she tried to move away from the truck and the car overturned.  Q. Did you then offer any suggestions to Qier's sister?  A. She asked whether there was a case in this situation. It had been almost three months, whether it was, whether the time had passed to lodge a legal proceedings. I said no, my case was being processed. I could refer my lawyer to her.  Q. Did you do that?  A. Yes, I did.  Q. Did you meet Qier?  A. You mean the victim of the accident?  Q. Yes, the sick lady?  A. Her sister took me to the physio room to see her. She said to me about how she had, she had had thoughts of committing suicide. She, she was depressed. I told her to be strong. I had the same thoughts as well before.  Q. I think it is the case you didn't speak to the injured lady about how the accident happened?  A. I can't remember clearly. I spoke to her sister about it."" (T.105.7 - 106.7)  77Mr Xin was cross-examined about his conversation with Ms Deng:  ""Q. And when you started talking to her was it your intent to give her some help?  A. Yes. Yes. I asked her how the accident happened, whether they looked for a lawyer. Then I suggested to her to look for a lawyer, to find a lawyer.  Q. Did she explain to you that she had trouble understanding the Australian legal system?  A. She was not clear on that. I wasn't familiar with it either. She, she said it was three months since the accident so I suggested her finding a lawyer.  Q. Did you explain to her that you had made a claim for damages  after your accident?  A. Yes, I mentioned it to her.  Q. Did you explain that in Australia it was necessary to sue somebody that had been involved in the accident before you could recover damages?  A. I only suggested for her finding my lawyer, for her to see my lawyer to discuss whether an action could be brought. I didn't say anything else.  Q. You say she mentioned something about a truck being involved in the accident with her sister. Was that after you had mentioned that she should see a lawyer?  A. She said this before she saw my lawyer. She talked about it before she met with my lawyer.  Q. When you were at the eatery, is that what you mean?  A. Yes."" (T.107.9 -.38)  78Ms Liu Cui Fang gave evidence. She was the friend that Ms Deng was intending to visit in Darwin. Her principal language was Mandarin, but she did have some knowledge of English. She was born in January 1967 and raised in Shenyang in China. It was in Shenyang that she became friends with Ms Deng. They both worked in the same clothing shop. Ms Fang came to Australia to live in June 2007. She gave her evidence through a Mandarin interpreter.  79Ms Fang said that she learned of the accident indirectly and as a result telephoned Ms Deng on her mobile phone. Her evidence in relation to this conversation was:  ""A. I can't remember the exact date. I think it was within one week or two weeks of the accident.  Q. When you spoke to Su Li you told her who you were. What  conversation did you have?  A. I told her who I was. I rang her, I asked her what was the  matter. I asked her what happened. She said they had a car  accident.  Q. Did you find out how Su Li was?  A. I asked her over the phone and found out what it was.  Q. Did she tell you anything about people being injured in the  accident?  A. She told me her sister was injured and her boyfriend was  injured.  Q. Did you ask or were you told by Su Li as to how the accident  happened?  A. I asked her what happened. She said, Qier's sister said she  was reading her newspaper, she felt a shaking of the car and she  heard a scream from her sister. She looked up, she saw a big truck.  Q. Did she tell you what happened after that?  A.  No."" (T.118.2 -.20)  80Under cross-examination Ms Fang agreed that she had been first asked to give evidence in relation to this matter in the last month by the plaintiff's lawyer. She said that she had arrived in Sydney from Darwin the night before for the purpose of giving evidence. She denied that she had discussed with Su Li the conversation which she said she had on the telephone just after the accident. (T. 119.42)  81In cross-examination Ms Fang said:  ""Q. You have told us what you say Su Li said in this conversation about how the accident happened. I want you to tell us again what you say she said, using as best you can remember the words she actually spoke to you?  A. I rang Su Li and asked her how the accident happened.  Q. I want to know what words she spoke to you when you asked  her that question?  A. About the matter I became aware initially?  Q. You told us about a telephone conversation where you asked how the accident happened. I want you to tell us what words she spoke to you in answer to your question?  A. She said to me, ""I was reading the newspaper, I felt the shaking of the car, I heard a scream from my sister and then the car - then I don't know anything else""."" (T.120.8 - .37)  ""Q.  Madam, in this telephone conversation, when you asked Su Li how the accident occurred, did she say anything more about how the accident occurred than what you have told the Court today?  A.  No.""  (T.122.15)  82The final witness in this group was Mr Michel Elis, the husband of Ms Deng.  He was born in 1940 and was a French citizen.  His evidence related to a telephone conversation with Ms Deng.  His evidence was:  ""Q. How did you ring Su Li? Was it a land line or a mobile phone line that you called?  A. On the mobile.  Q. And did you speak to Su Li?  A. Yes.  Q. Emotionally, how was she?  A. She was crying. She was very emotionally upset.  Q. Do you now know the date in France when you telephoned Su Li in Australia?  A. 4th of November 2008  Q. As at 2008, when you and Su Li would speak to each other at home, which language would you use?  A. In French and sometimes in Chinese.  Q. You have a little Mandarin?  A.  Yes, just a little.  Q. When you rang Su Li on 4 November 2008, in which language or languages did you speak?  A. Little bit of each, French and Chinese.  Q. Did you attempt to ascertain whether Su Li was hurt?  A. I just simply say, ""Look, how are you feeling? How are you?"" and she said, ""Oh, yeah, I am - I am all right. I am all right"".  Q. Did she tell you about Qier?  A. She - she said that Qier, or Gier, just wasn't well at all.  Q. Did you ask Su Li how the accident happened?  A. It was rather she who volunteered the information about the accident.  Q. When she volunteered that information, what did she say to you?  A. She said that there was a very large car behind and then a very large car in front.  Q. And did she describe what happened to the car in which she was travelling?  A. I understood her to say that Qier's car was in a bad state and it fell.  Q. When she used this expression ""a very large car"", was she speaking in Mandarin or was she speaking in French?  A. In French."" (T.124.13 -125.16)  83Mr Elis then came to Australia. Upon his arrival, he again spoke to Ms Deng about the accident:  ""Q. And did you speak to Su Li again about how the accident had happened?  A. Very little.  Q. Did you discuss with her again about the very large car?  A. Yes. In a subsequent conversation with Su Li she mentioned the word kache, which means truck in Chinese.  Q. Did you check up this through either the dictionary or the translation device?  A. No, I know the word, I don't have to look it up. I know a lot of words, vocabulary in Chinese."" (T.125.43 - 126.3)  84In cross-examination Mr Elis gave this evidence:  ""Q. I wanted to know if an Australian lawyer has asked you about the conversation you told us you had with Su Li on the telephone on 4 November 2008?  A. Yes.  Q. And when did that lawyer speak to you about this  conversation?  A. I don't know. I can't remember. I don't have a precise date.  Q. Was it this year or last year? Can you assist in identifying  which year?  A. I believe it's probably this year.  Q. And was it in the last few weeks?  A. I had this conversation when I arrived in November.  Q. November this year?  A. This year. (T.127.1 -.17)  ...  Q. You've told us that on 4 November 2008 in your telephone conversation with Su Li she told you something about how the accident happened in French?  A. A little bit of each language.  Q. Well, her French is very limited?  A. Yes.  Q. And your Mandarin is very limited?  A. Yes.  Q. Can you tell us what word she used in French and Mandarin when, as you say, Su Li told you something about the accident?  A. She said in French those words, there was a large car behind, a large car in front.  Q. And that's all she said to you about the accident when you spoke to her on the telephone on 4 November 2008?  A. She said that Qier was driving. (T.127.27 - .45)  Q. About the accident, was that all that was said?  A. She was crying a lot and all I could hear was words between  sobs.  Q. All you could make out about what she said about the accident  is what you have told us?  A. Yes, that's all she mentioned about the accident.  Q. And when you came to Australia you said you had a conversation about how the accident happened but she told you very little?  A. Correct.  Q. And was the first time you have been asked to recall what she told you when you came to Australia about the accident was when you spoke to a lawyer in November?  A. Yes.  Q. When she told you something about this accident when you came to Australia, was she talking in French or Mandarin?  A. A bit of both with the help of the dictionary.  Q. What words did she speak to you when you had come to Australia when she told you very little about the accident?  A. We were just passing the dictionary backwards and forwards basically to try and make one another understand what happened.  Q. Did you understand what she was trying to say to you?  A. More or less. I understood that a truck was overtaking and then afterwards the car was sort of turned over."" (T.127.1 -128.29)  85Leaving aside the evidence which was led to rebut recent invention, there are some real difficulties with the evidence of Ms Deng as to what she observed at the time when the accident occurred. In saying that, I appreciate that language difficulties prevented Ms Deng from providing a statement to the police at the accident scene or subsequently. While it is known that two French speaking tourists were the first persons at the  accident scene, the evidence is silent as to whether Ms Deng said anything to them about how the accident occurred and neither of them gave evidence in the proceedings.  86The most obvious difficulty with the evidence of Ms Deng generally is the contradiction between the evidence she gave at trial concerning what occurred at the accident scene after she had extracted herself from the motor vehicle and what she said in exhibit 3. Exhibit 3 was prepared approximately three and a half months after the accident when one would have expected Ms Deng's recollection to have been better than it was at trial. Ms Deng says that exhibit 3 is not correct and that she did not say that she could not remember anything after the car overturned. This is despite the fact that exhibit 3 was prepared with the assistance of a Mandarin interpreter in the presence of a lawyer.  87Ms Deng says that she explained to that lawyer at the time how she had extracted herself from the car (T.102.20).   I do not accept that if a lawyer acting for the plaintiff had been provided by Ms Deng with the detail of what occurred after the accident at the accident scene, he would not have made sure that this was recorded on exhibit 3. I cannot think of any reason why such a lawyer would not do so.   It follows that I do not accept that Ms Deng explained to the lawyer at the time she signed exhibit 3 how she had extracted herself from the Subaru.  88I am satisfied that when exhibit 3 was signed by Ms Deng she in fact had no recollection of what occurred after she had extracted herself from the motor vehicle. Some support for that comes from the evidence of Ms Fang at T.120.37 where Ms Deng is said to have finished her description of the accident with the words ""Then I don't know anything else"". There was no evidence or any suggestion that at some time subsequent to 13 February 2009, Ms Deng regained a recollection of what occurred at the accident scene after the accident.  89I appreciate that just because Ms Deng's evidence as to what happened after she got out of the Subaru is not reliable, does not necessarily mean that her evidence as to the sequence of events leading up to the accident  and seeing the back of a truck is also unreliable. Nevertheless, the rejection of her detailed evidence concerning removing the plaintiff's seatbelt and moving her arm, must inevitably lead a fact-finder to be sceptical of other evidence which is of a controversial nature and which benefits the plaintiff.  90It is implausible that, had Ms Deng experienced a shaking of the vehicle shortly before the accident occurred, she would not have referred to that fact in exhibit 3. When one takes into account some of the extraneous detail in exhibit 3, e.g. the reference to the mining of opals, one would have thought that a relevant piece of information such as the shaking of the car would have been included. Ms Deng's explanation that she made no reference to the vehicle shaking because she was not specifically asked about it is unsatisfactory in circumstances where she was making a statement for a lawyer concerning her recollection of events leading up to the accident.  91It is also implausible that if a large articulated vehicle passed the Subaru so as to cause it to shake, Ms Deng would not at the very least have looked up from her magazine.  She was a visitor to Australia and being passed by such a vehicle would not (one might think) have been a familiar occurrence for her.  92The failure of Ms Deng to look up when she felt the buffeting effect is all the more difficult to accept when apparently the plaintiff had accelerated the Subaru and there would have been a shadow over the car, together with a significant level of sound, as the articulated vehicle passed.  If, as the plaintiff said, the articulated vehicle had sounded its horn (almost certainly a loud air horn), this was another reason why Ms Deng would at the very least have looked up from her magazine to find out what was happening.  93I also find the sequence of events described by Ms Deng at trial to be improbable.  94Ms Deng's evidence was that she felt shaking, heard a scream and looked up to see the rear of a truck approximately 4 metres in front of the Subaru. If the plaintiff did scream (Ms Deng is the only person to say so), this would only have occurred when she realised that the Subaru was out of control, i.e. it had already returned to the road and was not responding to the plaintiff's efforts to steer it. The expert evidence, to which I will refer in more detail later, made it clear that by this time any passing truck, articulated or otherwise, would have been well clear of the Subaru at a considerably greater distance to its front than 4 metres. This is based on the speed at which a truck would have to be travelling in order to pass the Subaru. Since it would have taken a road train at least 10 seconds to have passed the Subaru, it is difficult to accept that Ms Deng would not have looked up during that period, particularly if there had been some shaking of the Subaru during the first few seconds of that passing manoeuvre.  95Ms Deng's evidence as to the plaintiff screaming is in direct conflict with that of Mr Addicott. While I have found that Mr Addicott did not see any other motor vehicle before the accident occurred, there is no reason to disregard his evidence as to how the Subaru came to roll over. It is his evidence that the car felt as if it were on ice, which caused him to ask the plaintiff ""Are you okay?"" (T.25.2)  96Accordingly, I do not accept that Ms Deng's evidence as to the sequence of events leading up to the accident and as to seeing the back of a truck is reliable.  97Before leaving the evidence of Ms Deng, it is necessary to consider the evidence of Mr Xin, Ms Fang and Mr Ellis, who were called by way of corroboration.  98An initial problem with their evidence is that nothing was led in chief or re-examination from Ms Deng in relation to any of the conversations. This is surprising when it was known from the defendant's DCM document that the absence of a contemporaneous reference to another vehicle was important and when it must have been known from the cross-examination of Ms Deng that this was a most significant issue in the trial.  99While it was open to the defendant to require Ms Deng to be recalled and to be cross-examined as to these conversations, it was not obliged to do so. It was necessary for the plaintiff to provide an explanation for why this evidence was not led. In submissions the explanation offered was that of an oversight by counsel.  100I accept, of course, this explanation by counsel and it is common knowledge that such oversights do occur.  Nevertheless, I am left with the impression that such an oversight is more likely to occur where counsel only becomes aware of such information at a late state in the trial.  There also remains the difficulty that Ms Deng was never tested in cross-examination in relation to these conversations.  This is important because there are problems with each conversation.  101Mr Xin's evidence refers to a conversation which occurred at least three months after the accident. His evidence as to the conversation is somewhat different to that of the plaintiff. It was the plaintiff's evidence that she met Mr Xin in the gym of the hospital and that she told him about her ""situation"". He then arranged for his lawyer to contact her (T.72.25).  102Mr Xin's evidence was that he had met Ms Deng and not the plaintiff and that the meeting had occurred at an ""eating place"" at the hospital. It was his evidence that Ms Deng told him about the accident not the plaintiff. To the extent that Mr Xin had a conversation with the plaintiff, it was a conversation in the physio room directed to her being depressed because of her condition (T.106.1).  103The description of the accident which Mr Xin attributed to Ms Deng differs from the evidence which Ms Deng gave as to her observations leading up to the accident. It also differs from the contents of exhibit 3. He says that he was told by Ms Deng that there was a big truck behind, the plaintiff tried to move away from the truck and the car overturned. If this is an accurate description of what Mr Xin was told by Ms Deng, she could only have obtained this information from the plaintiff since all she saw was the back of a truck. If that is so, there is no evidence from either the plaintiff or Ms Deng about any such conversation between them during which the plaintiff passed on that information.  104These unexplained anomalies in the evidence of Mr Xin cast some doubt on its reliability. Even if Mr Xin is accurate in his recollection of the date and what he was told concerning the accident by Ms Deng, this conversation could not be regarded as contemporaneous with the accident. By this time the extent of the plaintiff's injuries was clear and no doubt consideration was being given to whether a claim could be brought on her behalf.  105Ms Fang's evidence, if accepted, would certainly be regarded as contemporaneous. The telephone conversation which she says she had with Ms Deng occurred within two weeks of the accident. Unfortunately I found Ms Fang to be unimpressive as a witness. She appeared to be very ill at ease when giving her evidence. This, of course, might merely have been nervousness.  106She agreed that she had been first asked to turn her mind to this conversation by the plaintiff's lawyers in the weeks leading up to the trial, i.e. approximately 2 years after the conversation took place. Although she denied speaking to Ms Deng about the conversation, it was clear from the evidence that she had done so. Her evidence was in almost identical terms to those used by Ms Deng to describe her observations leading up to the accident. Ms Fang agreed that she had arrived in Sydney the night before she gave her evidence and had spoken to Ms Deng that night.  Because of the similarity of her evidence to that of Ms Deng, I find that they must have discussed the evidence she was going to give, probably on the night of her arrival.  107Apart from that concern, there is an inherent improbability in Ms Fang's evidence as to what Ms Deng told her about how the accident occurred.  Both in chief and in cross-examination (T.118.89, T.120.35) her evidence on this issue reads as a summary of the relevant parts of Ms Deng's evidence, i.e. ""I was reading a newspaper etc."".  108If Ms Fang in fact had such a conversation in the course of which she asked Ms Deng ""What happened?"" one would have expected a response along the lines of ""A large truck forced our vehicle off the road causing it to overturn"" or something similar.  It is incredible that a person in Ms Deng's position would give a response to that question such as ""I was reading a newspaper, felt a shaking of the car, heard a scream from my sister and looked up and saw a big truck"".  109I am not satisfied that a conversation took place between Ms Deng and Ms Fang as set out in Ms Fang's evidence. I do not regard Ms Fang as providing any corroboration for the evidence of Ms Deng.  110Mr Elis gave evidence with the assistance of a French interpreter. There was nothing in the demeanour of Mr Elis to indicate that he was doing other than telling the truth. Unfortunately, he appeared to have considerable difficulty in understanding and answering relatively simple questions which were put to him. The interpreter was an experienced and competent interpreter in the French language, and there was no apparent reason why Mr Elis experienced such a difficulty but it was obvious throughout his evidence that he did so.  111Under cross-examination Mr Elis accepted that in November 2008 he and Ms Deng had considerable difficulty in communicating with each other and used a patois of French and Mandarin in order to do so. As with Ms Fang, Mr Elis had first been asked to turn his mind to the conversation with Ms Deng by the plaintiff's lawyers at some time in November 2010, i.e. two years later.  112The evidence of Mr Elis as to what he was told by Ms Deng, while being consistent with the presence of another vehicle, was inconsistent with the evidence of Ms Deng as to what she experienced and saw at the time of the accident. If the evidence of Mr Elis is accurate as to what he was told by Ms Deng, it is not clear whether she was purporting to say what she saw or what she had been told by the plaintiff. Given the early time at which this conversation is said to have taken place, i.e. within days of the accident, it is unlikely that Ms Deng could have discussed the matter with the plaintiff since the evidence strongly suggests that the plaintiff was unable to communicate with anyone at that time.  113Another difficulty with the content of the reported conversation, i.e. ""a very large car behind and then a very large car in front"", is that it is not really responsive to an inquiry as to how the accident happened. It says nothing about how the accident occurred. Nevertheless, that was all Mr Elis was told about how the accident occurred, except for the additional information that the plaintiff was driving.  114While I accept that Mr Elis was doing his best to provide assistance to the Court, the problems with his evidence were such that I am not satisfied as to its reliability.  This is particularly so in relation to his last answer in cross-examination (T.128.28) which was in summary form and was inconsistent with his earlier evidence as to what he was told.  This response looks very much like a later reconstruction.  I am not satisfied that the evidence of Mr Elis provides corroboration for that of Ms Deng.  Was there another vehicle involved in the accident  115There were a number of differences between the evidence of the plaintiff, Mr Addicott and Ms Deng as to what happened at the time of the accident.  While one would expect that there would be differences in recollection, the differences in this case are so stark as to raise a real question as to whether another vehicle was involved in the accident.  This is particularly so when consideration is given to the inconsistencies within the plaintiff's evidence as to how the accident occurred.  116I have already concluded that Mr Addicott did not observe another vehicle.  That fact alone is most surprising if in fact a large articulated vehicle passed the Subaru immediately before the accident.  117The plaintiff was the only one to see a big truck approaching 50 - 100 metres from behind.  The plaintiff was the only person to give evidence about the Subaru accelerating to about 100 kph.  The plaintiff was the only person to see the articulated vehicle pass the Subaru at a distance of about 1.5 metres away.  The plaintiff was the only person to hear the truck sound its horn.  If these events occurred, it is difficult to accept that neither Ms Deng nor Mr Addicott was aware of them.  118The plaintiff and Mr Addicott described the Subaru moving to the left of the highway and partially onto the shoulder of the road.  The plaintiff said that she did this to avoid a collision with the rear of the truck.  Implicit in this evidence is the proposition that the truck had already passed.  Earlier the plaintiff said that she had commenced moving to the left of the highway while the truck was still behind her after it had sounded its horn. The plaintiff and Mr Addicott gave evidence that she then drove or swerved back onto the road.  While the plaintiff did not provide the same detail as Mr Addicott, her evidence is consistent with his, i.e. that when the car returned to the highway, it was not under control and eventually turned over.  119The plaintiff was the only person to describe the truck, which she said was very big, very long and comprised a cabin and three trailers.  Ms Deng saw only the rear of the truck.  120In cross-examination, the plaintiff altered the sequence of events.  Instead of moving to the left of the road to avoid colliding with the rear of the truck, she said that she moved the Subaru to the left when she heard the horn and the truck started overtaking her (T.65.49).  This was a significant change to her evidence.   Somewhat strangely, the plaintiff then described the movement of the truck as follows:  ""The truck didn't move into the wrong side of the road.  When it, the road had two lanes, one for each direction.  When the truck overtook me I increased my speed and went forward and the truck overtook me but it stayed, the truck stayed in the right lane at all times.""  (T.66.19)  Subsequently the plaintiff said that she was not sure whether the truck crossed the middle line onto the wrong side of the road (T.66.41).  121Under cross-examination the plaintiff said that the cabin of the truck was about one metre away when it passed her vehicle.  There continued to be considerable confusion in the plaintiff's evidence as to whether she saw all three trailers pass the car and whether the car had already moved to the left as the trailers passed.  She said that when she last saw the truck, the cabin was in front of her car.  Shortly thereafter, she said that when she last saw the truck the section between the end of the first trailer and the front of the second trailer was two-thirds of a metre in front of the car.  122The internal contradictions in the plaintiff's evidence as to the movement of the truck are consistent with a fragmented recollection as a result of everything happening very quickly.  They are also consistent with confabulation in the sense that the plaintiff had no real recollection of any articulated truck passing the car before the accident.  123The plaintiff's description of events as the truck passed the vehicle cannot be reconciled with Ms Deng's evidence as to when she first sighted the truck.  It is quite implausible that in the circumstances described by the plaintiff, Ms Deng's first observation of the truck was of its rear as it drove away in front of the Subaru.  It follows that I do not accept Ms Deng's evidence to that effect and that I have concluded that she did not see a truck immediately before the accident.  124This presents a major problem for the plaintiff.  If there were an articulated truck, and it moved in the way described by her, i.e. overtook the Subaru in such a way as to force it in part to the western edge of the highway so that had the plaintiff remained on the highway she would have come in contact with the rear of the truck, how was it that neither Mr Addicott nor Ms Deng made any such observation of it?  As already indicated, their explanations of thinking about a difficult surveying problem and being engrossed in reading a magazine, are inconsistent with the plaintiff's evidence as to what happened and are inherently implausible.  125One also has to take into account the internal inconsistencies in the plaintiff's evidence to which reference has already been made.  While a benign interpretation can be given to those inconsistencies, when taken with the absence of any reliable observations by Mr Addicott and Ms Deng, I have concluded that the plaintiff's evidence on this issue should not be accepted.  I do not accept the plaintiff's evidence as to how the accident occurred and I do not accept the plaintiff's evidence as to the presence of a truck being driven in the manner she described immediately before the accident.  126In reaching that conclusion, I have taken into account the evidence of Dr Ling.  In one respect this evidence provides strong support for the plaintiff's case.  Dr Ling was clearly independent and was an impressive witness.  Her evidence is consistent with there being another vehicle involved in the accident.  127The difficulty for the plaintiff is that Dr Ling did have a knowledge of Mandarin and was very definite as to what the plaintiff told her, i.e. that there was a truck travelling in the opposite direction which forced the plaintiff's vehicle off the road.  If that is an accurate record of what the plaintiff told her, it is quite inconsistent with the plaintiff's evidence at trial.  128The plaintiff cannot have it both ways.  If the Court is to accept Dr Ling (as I am prepared to do) the Court should accept her as being an accurate witness.  There is no basis for the Court to speculate, as it has been invited to do, that Dr Ling only partially understood what she was told by the plaintiff because of language difficulties.  Dr Ling struck me as the sort of person who would have made it clear to the Court if there were any problem or ambiguity in her understanding what the plaintiff said.  129On the contrary, the final question and answer put to Dr Ling was:  ""Q.  And you are crystal clear that she mentioned a truck coming in the opposite direction?  A.  Yes.""   (T.115.14)  Accordingly, Dr Ling's evidence does not overcome the difficulties which I have identified in the plaintiff's evidence.  130There was expert evidence at trial but that expert evidence was not of a kind as to overcome my rejection of the plaintiff's evidence.  It was equally consistent with an articulated truck passing the plaintiff's car as with there being no other vehicle involved in the accident.  131The two experts who gave evidence were Grant Johnston, a chartered professional engineer with a particular interest in motor accidents, and Christopher Hall, a mechanical engineer with a particular interest in motor vehicle accident reconstruction.  The evidence of those experts was taken concurrently.  132In their joint report (exhibit A), question 6.3 and its response was as follows:  ""6.3 Is it possible to say (and if so, please do) whether the loss of control of the Subaru indicated by the northern set of tyre marks would be more consistent with:  6.3.1 The Subaru being forced off to the left of the bitumen by an unidentified vehicle;  6.3.2 The Subaru travelling off the left of the bitumen during a period of driver inattention;  6.3.3 The Subaru driver swerving to avoid an object (not being a vehicle) or an animal on the roadway; or  6.3.4 The Subaru drifting onto the incorrect side of the roadway during a period of driver inattention?  A. All of the above explanations are consistent but on the basis of the physical evidence alone (ignoring the statements) it is not possible to say which is more likely.""  Was there evidence of negligence  133There was evidence from the experts concerning what was a safe distance between a car such as the Subaru and a large articulated vehicle overtaking it.  ""HIS HONOUR:  Perhaps I'm not making myself clear and that's my fault, not yours.  What troubles me is one of the allegations of negligence is that this truck, be it one of those three types, in carrying out the overtaking manoeuvre, was too close to the overtaken vehicle so as to cause the driver to get into difficulty and then roll, as we know occurred.  I don't have any direct expert evidence and perhaps it is not a matter of expertise, as to, for the truck driver carrying out that manoeuvre, how close one would need to be to render that overtaking manoeuvre unsafe, and if it varies from truck to truck, I would be grateful to know that, that is, of the three trucks we are considering.  WITNESS HALL:  In a way it is not at all - it is not easy to determine what that separation might be.  What we can say is, unless the vehicle was within half a metre of each other, the buffeting is not going to cause a loss of control.  So we are then talking about what did cause the loss of control.  And that would seem to then, if the separation was greater than half a metre, that would suggest that it has been driver input that has caused the loss of control.  It is then difficult to ascertain, because each driver is different, what would be an unsafe separation between the vehicles.  HIS HONOUR:  Are we agreed between you both that if it was half a metre, that is just too close for a big truck, be it a B-Double, a double trailer or a triple trailer?  WITNESS JOHNSTON:  Yes, anyone I think would panic at that scenario.  HIS HONOUR:  So outside of half a metre, then you'd say, Mr Hall --  WITNESS HALL:  Your Honour, if we look at what a normal situation might be, a semi-trailer in the middle of its lane overtaking in the overtaking lane will sit about, on a roadway of this width, 3.5 metres, will sit about 1 metre away from the - sorry, half a metre from the centre line and then the other, the vehicle being overtaken sitting in the middle of its lane, will be about say 800 millimetres from the centre line.  So under typical circumstances we are looking at about 1.3 metres separation and that's just a normal overtaking situation.  WITNESS JOHNSTON:  Yeah, I think I agree with that and at 1.3 metres it is not inherently unsafe.  I don't think it's the distance that's the issue.  I would be not - I would be completely comfortable a truck overtaking me 1.3 metres away.  My mother-in-law, on the other hand, would require me to slow down and move further left.  She is not comfortable at all around trucks in that particular scenario.  So the issue is not what the spacing was, but what the spacing becomes.  I was always of the view the spacing was closing and closing and closing as they moved left.  That gave them little opportunity but to move left.  If she was uncomfortable with a metre or even uncomfortable with a metre and a half and then moved, she was in the middle of her lane on that assumption, gave herself the other .8 of a metre and drove on the left edge of the road, but then the truck moved to within another metre, then you moved again, that is more the issue that you are consuming her, the driver's fat margin of safety, because they are not comfortable with the valuation distance.  HIS HONOUR:  That also would seem, if the distance is closing in that way, that would seem to presuppose some failure to take reasonable care that the truck driver is really not very conscious of what his trailers are doing.  WITNESS JOHNSTON:  Yeah, the back of the vehicle's coming back too quick, if that perception is of course correct.  HIS HONOUR:  Mr Hall?  WITNESS HALL:  Yes, I agree with what Mr Johnston has said.  In terms of what the trailer will be doing, at a speed of 100 kilometres an hour, 110 kilometres an hour, the trailer will follow the front of the semi-trailer very closely.  It is not going to swing in any further than the prime mover would.  So the path that the prime mover takes, the trailer will follow that very closely.  WITNESS JOHNSTON:  Yeah, that is pretty much correct.  Indeed, it is slightly outside.  When you are at a high speed turn, you actually have a slightly positive off track, but it is only centimetres. ""  (T.231.44 - 233.12)  134The importance of that evidence is that even on the plaintiff's version of events, there were real difficulties in establishing negligence on the part of the overtaking truck, if in fact there were such a truck.  The plaintiff's estimate of distances varied in her evidence.  In chief she indicated that when the cabin of the truck passed the Subaru it was approximately 1.5 metres away.  Later she suggested 1 metre.  On the expert evidence, the trailers would have followed the prime mover and would have followed the same track as the prime mover.  That places considerable doubt on the plaintiff's evidence that she moved to the left of the road because she thought if she did not do so she might collide with the rear of the truck, i.e. the rear trailer.  135Of course the plaintiff gave another version which had the Subaru moving to the left even before the truck had commenced overtaking.  On that scenario, negligence on the part of the truck driver is even more difficult to establish.  136If, contrary to my primary finding, there was an overtaking truck involved with this accident I am not satisfied that, on the basis of the plaintiff's evidence, negligence could be established against the driver of such a truck.  The manoeuvre undertaken by the driver of the truck was a legally permissible one and would not be regarded as unreasonable in circumstances where the plaintiff was travelling at about 90 kph in an open roadway with a speed limit of 110 kph.  137It is not clear from the plaintiff's evidence whether she moved to the left of the road after, during or before the truck passed.  She gave all three versions in evidence.  Her estimates of the distances between the overtaking truck and the Subaru varied between 1.5 metres and 1 metre.  These were very general estimates made by reference to objects in the courtroom.  On the plaintiff's evidence what seems to have occurred is that the plaintiff over-reacted to seeing the approach of the truck, causing her to drive off the highway and then lose control when she attempted to correct that manoeuvre.  138The plaintiff's evidence of accelerating to a 100 kph when she saw the truck approaching in her rear mirror is a somewhat odd reaction.  It is also consistent with the plaintiff over-reacting to the presence of the truck.  139In any event, for the reasons indicated, the plaintiff is the only source of evidence as to the movement of the truck.  Her evidence on this issue is vague in the extreme and to the extent that there is any clarity, it is internally inconsistent in significant ways.  At no point, however, does her evidence indicate in the way described by Mr Johnston that the truck as it overtook the Subaru was getting closer and closer to it so as to take up or occupy the space available to the Subaru in its lane thereby forcing the Subaru to drive off the highway.  140Although speed was particularised as an element of negligence, there is no evidence from the experts or from the plaintiff that the speed of the truck made any contribution to the accident.  On the plaintiff's evidence the only basis upon which negligence could be established against the postulated truck driver was that in overtaking the Subaru he travelled too close to it.  141Another difficulty for a court in making a finding against the suggested overtaking truck is that there is no clear evidence as to the location of the Subaru at any given time, and there is no clear evidence as to the location of the truck at any given time.  What the Court is left with are conflicting estimates of the distance between parts of the truck and the Subaru at different and imprecise points in time.  Such a variation in distance during the overtaking manoeuvre is not supported by the evidence of the experts set out above, i.e. the trailers would follow the track of the prime mover.  142Accordingly, even if I accepted the plaintiff's evidence as to the presence of an overtaking truck immediately before the accident, her evidence is not such as would enable me to find negligence on the part of the driver.  143Although it is not necessary for the Court to provide an explanation for how the accident occurred, the likelihood seems to be that postulated in the questions put to the experts, i.e. inattention on the part of the plaintiff as driver allowing the vehicle to move to the western side of the highway and then a loss of control when she tried to rapidly correct that movement by turning the steering wheel to the right.  144Perhaps the most accurate description of what occurred is that given by Mr Addicott to Constable Agostino when she spoke to him at the accident scene:  ""A.  To the effect, not exact words, that he didn't know what had caused the accident, that one moment they had been driving along the road and the next moment they were rolling off it or involved in an accident. ""  (T.158.48)  145It follows that there must be a verdict entered for the defendant.  The seat-belt issue  146For completeness, I should deal with an issue that took up some time in the trial, i.e. whether the plaintiff was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the accident.  147I have concluded that if the plaintiff were not wearing a seatbelt this would only have occurred by way of a deliberate choice on her part.  I have reached that conclusion because of the noisy beep which would have continued for approximately 108 seconds if the driver were not wearing a seatbelt.  Mere inadvertence or oversight could not explain it.  148The plaintiff's evidence was unequivocal that she attached the seatbelt when she took over driving from Mr Addicott.  Mr Addicott's evidence is to similar effect.  He said that he had a clear recollection of the plaintiff attaching the seatbelt since it was necessary for him to adjust her seat to enable her to drive more easily.  Ms Deng gave evidence to similar effect.  The plaintiff said that she continued to wear the seatbelt until the accident occurred.  149Mr Addicott said that after the accident he observed the plaintiff to be still within her seatbelt but that her right arm appeared to be pinned by the car.  He could not remember exactly how the arm was pinned.  150Ms Deng gave evidence, in considerable detail, as to how she unbuckled the plaintiff's seatbelt following the accident (T.81.38, 82.15, 91.31).  She denied that the plaintiff's right arm was pinned (T.85.32).  She said that she moved the plaintiff's right arm on a number of occasions and put a cushion and clothing underneath it (T.87.39, 88.37).  151I have already indicated why I do not accept Ms Deng's evidence about what happened at the accident site after the accident.  There are, however, some other difficulties with her evidence concerning unbuckling the seatbelt.  152The expert evidence was that the moment the seatbelt was unbuckled it would have retracted as far as it was able.  Having then retracted, it would not have been possible for the seatbelt to have been extended again.  In other words, it would have been extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the plaintiff to have been extracted from the seatbelt in its partially retracted state.  The fact that Ms Deng made no mention at all about the seatbelt retracting when she unbuckled it and made no mention of any difficulties she experienced as a result of the seatbelt becoming partially retracted, leads me to conclude that she did not in fact unbuckle the plaintiff's seatbelt following the accident.  153Accordingly, I reject Ms Deng's evidence on this issue.  This analysis confirms my earlier rejection of her evidence concerning her recollection of events which occurred at the accident scene after the accident.  154The evidence of Constable Baker was equivocal on this issue.  He had indicated on the accident report form that the plaintiff was wearing a seatbelt.  He was, however, unable to recall the basis upon which he made that entry.  He said that if the plaintiff had not been wearing a seatbelt, he would have expected much more trauma about her head, face and body (T.133.5).  On the other hand, he had a clear recollection of her right arm being pinned (T.138.29, 139.3, 139.15, 142.32).  Constable Agostino also had a recollection of the plaintiff's right arm being trapped (T.158.4, 158.8, 158.14).  She did, however, say that if she had noticed that the plaintiff was not wearing a seatbelt, she would have recorded this (T.161.46).  155The significance of the observations of Mr Addicott, Constable Baker and Constable Agostino that the plaintiff's right arm was pinned or trapped was that the experts agreed that if that were so, it would not have been possible to remove the seatbelt without cutting it.  The photographs made it clear that the seatbelt was in its retracted position and had not been cut.  156The photographs taken at the accident scene were inconclusive.  They were consistent with the plaintiff's right arm being pinned by part of the car.  They were also consistent with there being some space between the car and the plaintiff's right arm.  One of the difficulties with the photographs was that it was not known exactly when, in relation to the sequence of events following the accident, they were taken.  The photographs show what could be a cushion or clothing around the plaintiff's right arm, but do not provide sufficient detail so as to indicate whether the cushion/clothing was actually underneath the arm.  157Both Mr Johnston and Mr Hall put forward, albeit somewhat tentatively, theories as to the interpretation of the photographs in relation to whether the plaintiff was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the accident.  Mr Johnston opined that his theory was consistent with the seatbelt being worn while Mr Hall reached the opposite conclusion.  I do not find it particularly profitable to analyse these competing theories.  158As indicated, neither theory was put forward with great conviction and both theories depended upon the interpretation of photos which both experts agreed involved a significant risk of error.  159The final piece of evidence on this issue was exhibit K.  This was an ambulance report which noted that a seatbelt had been worn.  The author of that report did not give evidence and the basis for that notation on the report is not known.  160The significance of whether or not the plaintiff was wearing a seatbelt arises from s49(3) of the South Australian Civil Liability Act .  That section provides that where a seatbelt is not worn, there will be a finding of 25 percent contributory negligence against the plaintiff.  As with New South Wales law, the defendant carries the onus of establishing that a seat-belt was not worn.  161On this issue I have concluded that the defendant has failed to establish that the plaintiff was not wearing a seatbelt.  My reasons are these.  162As I have already indicated, I found both police officers to be impressive witnesses, who were impartial and who were doing their best to assist the Court.  In that regard, I accept the comment by Constable Agostino that if she had noticed that the plaintiff was not wearing a seatbelt she would have made a note of it.  It seems to me that there is a certain practical common sense in the evidence of Constable Baker that had the plaintiff not been wearing a seatbelt, he would have expected to see far more trauma about her head and the rest of her body.  163I also found the evidence of Mr Addicott on this issue to be persuasive.  One of the matters which counted against my acceptance of his evidence as to the existence of a truck is the very reason why I accept his evidence on this issue.  I found Mr Addicott to be a rather meticulous and careful person.  I accept that he would  not have allowed the plaintiff to drive without wearing a seatbelt.  164I accept that there is a significant body of evidence to the effect that the plaintiff's right arm was pinned in some fashion beneath the car but that evidence is of a general kind and does not indicate the extent to which the right arm was pinned or trapped.  For the reasons already indicated, the opinions of the experts based as they are on the photographs and on unestablished assumptions are not decisive.  It would, of course, be quite unsafe for the Court to try to reach its own conclusion based on the photographs.  165On balance, therefore, I have not been persuaded that the plaintiff was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the accident.  Accordingly, the defendant has not established contributory negligence on this basis.  Conclusion  166I make the following orders:  (1) There will be judgment for the defendant.  (2) The plaintiff is to pay the defendant's costs.  (3) I grant leave to the parties to make further submissions as to costs, should they wish to do so.  **********

		16 June 2011",2011-06-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709645,Wayne Quirk v The State of New South Wales [2011] NSWSC 341,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: On 1 and 7 March 2006 the plaintiff was arrested by police after encounters in Kingswood and in Sydney City respectively. Different Constables were involved on each occasion. Arising out of both events and following occurrences the plaintiff alleges that he was the victim of tortious conduct by them. Claims of that nature against police are required by statute to be brought against the State of New South Wales. 

2A short sketch of some of the background and circumstances will identify from whence the various claims are sourced. This sketch is not intended to canvas all of the issues of contest between the parties. 

3The plaintiff is the father of two children born to a relationship which he had with Tracey Knight. That relationship ceased. On 15 March 2005 she obtained an apprehended violence order (AVO) against him, current for 2 years from that date, which inter alia included an order in these terms: 

""13. Other Orders: THE DEFENDANT MUST NOT APPROACH, CONTACT OR TELEPHONE THE PROTECTED PERSON(S) EXCEPT FOR THE PURPOSE OF ARRANGING OR EXERCISING ACCESS TO CHILDREN ON ALTERNATE MONDAYS AT PASSADERA DAY CARE CENTRE AT 8AM OR NOT TO CONTACT EXCEPT FOR CHILDREN RELATED ISSUES BY USING TEXT SMS MESSAGING."" 

4On 31 January 2006 Tracey Knight was at St Marys Police Station complaining of a breach of this AVO by the plaintiff. She was being interviewed by Constable Arapa. It appears that there had been earlier contact during the day between the plaintiff and Ms Knight and she had asked him to call her later in the evening. At the time when this further contact might be expected she was at the police station with her mobile phone. There is dispute about exactly what happened or was said but Constable Arapa described an incoming call on Ms Knight's phone and it was placed on a speaker so that from that point he could hear the conversation. He said that, in conversing with Ms Knight, the plaintiff did not mention the children and he intervened and asked the plaintiff to attend the police station to discuss the apparent breach of the AVO. 

5I shall later turn to some detail of what did or did not happen in the interim, but contact by telephone between the plaintiff and Constable Arapa took place on 1 March 2006. Soon thereafter Constable Arapa, accompanied by Constable Donney, went to Kingswood Autoport, a business which was then conducted by the plaintiff. At the time two other police officers, Constables Wade and Barnes were on foot patrol at Kingswood Railway Station which is opposite the Autoport. The Great Western Highway runs between it and the station. 

6The plaintiff was in the driver's seat of his Holden Crewman Utility when, within the Autoport premises, he stopped as a result of a signal by a police officer. There is dispute as to what was said at the time but ultimately by the combined efforts of Constables Arapa, Wade and Barnes the plaintiff was physically removed from the vehicle and handcuffed. His appearance was such that an attendance by ambulance was arranged but after examination by the ambulance officers he was conveyed in a police vehicle to Penrith Police Station where he was taken into custody. Items of property were taken from him including a gold necklace which he had been wearing. 

7He was charged with a number of offences and issued with court attendance notices (CANs). He was released to bail. The plaintiff claims that when his property was returned to him on release, the gold necklace was not included. 

8Four charges were presented against the plaintiff being, in short description, contravening an AVO, resisting a police officer, failing to undergo a breach test and refusing to produce a driving licence. 

9The return of the CANs was listed before the court on 23 March 2006 and the matters adjourned to 4 May 2006. The plaintiff did not appear. On a further adjourned date (18 May 2006) he did not appear and he was convicted of the four offences in his absence and a warrant issued for his arrest. Pursuant to that warrant the plaintiff was arrested on 22 May 2006 and when taken before the court on that day was released to bail. 

10The plaintiff sought to have the convictions annulled on the ground that he had not been notified of the adjourned hearing dates. On 8 June 2006 a Local Court Magistrate annulled the convictions. 

11Following the annulment the matters were again listed for hearing on 17 October 2006. There was an obligation to have filed the CANs in the Local Court within a specific limited time. This was an obligation of the prosecution. The CANs were not filed in time and in accordance with binding authority, when the matters were listed, the presiding Magistrate held that he lacked jurisdiction to hear and determine the charges and orders for dismissal were made. 

12Based upon these events the statement of claim by the plaintiff seeks, first, damages for false imprisonment, specifying a period of restraint commencing from when he was removed from his vehicle at the Autoport until he was released on bail from Penrith Police Station about 7 hours later. 

13Second, the plaintiff seeks damages for assault based upon the conduct of Constables Arapa, Wade, Barnes and Donney at the time of the removal of him from his car. Constable Donney was partnered with Constable Arapa on that day and is asserted to be liable for standing ready to assist the others and preventing persons from intervening (to aid the plaintiff). The other three officers are alleged to have physically beaten the plaintiff in a variety of ways. 

14Third, the plaintiff pleads that Constables Arapa, Wade, Barnes and Donney procured the issue of the four CANs and he seeks damages for malicious prosecution in respect thereof. 

15Fourth, pleaded as ""further and in the alternative"" damages are sought for abuse of legal process in effecting the issue of the said 4 CANs. 

16Fifth, a claim is made for the value of the gold necklace abovementioned. It is not asserted that the taking of it into possession by police after arrest was unlawful but that demands for its return have not been fulfilled. The pleading included the title ""claim for loss of property"" and would seem to be an assertion based upon detinue or conversion. 

17Referring to events of 1 March 2006, Senior Counsel for the plaintiff in opening said ""what happened to the plaintiff put him in dreadful fear of police"". He added that, given a pre-existing anxiety disorder, ""it significantly unbalanced him"". Thus, on 7 March 2006 he proceeded from Kingswood to the city on a motorcycle, apparently harbouring a belief that his motor vehicle would be identified and likely to attract unwanted police attention. The purpose of the visit to the City was to consult Dr Robert Hampshire, a psychiatrist who had been treating the plaintiff over an extended period prior to March 2006. 

18Again, I will sketch without detail a broad outline of events on 7 March 2006 out of which further claims for damages are pleaded. 

19The manner of riding of the motorcycle amidst traffic led to a report and consequent police effort to intercept it. A police car on patrol in the City sighted the cycle in the northerly area of George Street. The plaintiff rode his cycle through that end of the City, not always upon vehicle carriageways, until he entered the grounds of Government House where he abandoned the cycle and proceeded on foot to an area near the Conservatorium of Music. 

20Police arrived and the plaintiff's presence was indicated to them by a teacher who was shepherding some students into the Conservatorium. At about this time the plaintiff had made telephone contact with Dr Hampshire whose consulting rooms were nearby in Macquarie Street. Dr Hampshire came into the general botanical garden area seeking the plaintiff. 

21In the meantime, police had located and begun to speak to the plaintiff and thereafter they sought to arrest him. This involved some physical contact. By this time Dr Hampshire had arrived at the scene and offered to intervene but police did not require his intervention. 

22The plaintiff was conveyed to the Rocks Police Station. Whilst there, observations of him provoked a call for an ambulance. The ambulance officers examined him but they did not remain. The plaintiff was charged with a number of offences and bailed. He left the police station in the company of Dr Hampshire and stayed for some time in his rooms where, somewhat surprisingly, he was treated by being given 10 mgs of valium, some food and ""a couple of glasses of wine"", this combination apparently being intended to induce sleep. 

23The plaintiff later left Dr Hampshire's rooms and went to the offices in Market Street of Mr Amirreaggi, his solicitor. From there he was later collected by his parents and taken home. 

24These events led to claims, first, for assault alleged to have been perpetrated by police officers involved in the arrest at the botanical gardens. They are nominated in paragraph 34 of the statement of claim as ""Sergeant Simon Joice and/or Constable Rebecca Armstrong and/or Constable Ryan Spong and/or Constable Winter and/or Constable Steve de Jong and/or Constable George Wee and/or other unidentified police officers"". 

25Second, the plaintiff pleaded that ""Sergeant Simon Joice and/or the other officers named in paragraph 12 herein"" procured the issue of 4 CANs each charging resisting an officer in the execution of duty. Paragraph 12 has no nomination of officers and it is assumed that the reference should be to paragraph 34. It is alleged that the institution of these four proceedings constituted a malicious prosecution of the plaintiff. It can be mentioned that, in addition, CANs were issued charging the plaintiff with riding (the motorcycle) in a manner dangerous to the public and riding without a licence. 

26Third, it is claimed that ""further and/or in the alternative"" the conduct in procuring those four charges of resisting an officer in the execution of duty was an abuse of process. 

27The context of the contest between the plaintiff and the defendant is described in the foregoing. 

The credit of the plaintiff 

28Before turning to some specific matters, I record a finding in relation to the plaintiff's evidence. I did not find the plaintiff to be a creditworthy witness. In coming to that finding, I made allowance for the anxiety condition which he is diagnosed to suffer but he appeared more than capable of fencing with questioners and to promote answers to his own advantage. Otherwise, there was an alarming frequency of the response ""I'm unsure"" when confronted with facts, the denial of which he appeared to perceive as forensically dangerous. I am conscious of the limitations upon judicial assessment of demeanour and the restraint against acting upon such, however there was an abundance of instances when the plaintiff impressed as lacking in candour and, more significantly, instances where the plaintiff's evidence was demonstrably unacceptable. 

29It might be inferred that adverse conclusions concerning the plaintiff's credit were anticipated as submissions on his behalf focused upon assertions where the plaintiff's evidence was supported by others and in a broad sense, corroborated. 

30The plaintiff's evidence about his financial dealings was cloaked in obscurities and mired in contradictions. 

31In incidents in 2003 which occurred in close proximity to each other, the plaintiff was assaulted by a disgruntled customer and then struck in the face with some force by a motor vehicle spring which detached from a vehicle on which he was working. From about 2003 to 2009 he was in receipt of workers compensation payments, I gather on the basis he was regarded as unfit, for psychiatric reasons, for occupation as a mechanic. He said that he could do other things which he categorised as ""director's duties"". 

32The evidence shows that he was at times in paid employment when he made declarations denying that fact to the workers compensation insurer. When questioned about this, he constantly referred to his entitlement to reimbursement for medical and pharmaceutical expenses. The evidence of the accountants who produced a joint report, reveals plainly that he was receiving concurrent payments declared as income. He eventually acknowledged that he would not declare reimbursements for expenses as income. 

33As part of his case on damages the plaintiff claimed that, despite a setback when the RTA suspended or restricted him or his business from issuing inspection certificates, he had prospered in the business. He had some success from an appeal process in relation to the suspension, although like the bulk of his evidence, it lacked precision, but he asserted that he overcame the handicap of suspension by altering the focus of his business to installing LPG tanks. His business was so successful he said that he could, from the profits, fund land development projects in which he was engaged. 

34There is no detailed evidence of the extent of the plaintiff's landholdings although there is a passing remark in the evidence of Dr Hampshire that the Doctor understood that the plaintiff and his father had significant holdings. The evidence does reveal that over a span of time between, prior to the events of 2006, and the present the plaintiff developed one block of land by moving a house from the front to the rear and building two further residences on the block and, on another holding, built 12 town houses in one of which he presently resides. 

35The plaintiff testified that, in addition to bank finance, he was providing money from the profits from the Autoport to the development projects. He said the provision of this money was by way of loan. There is no need for present purposes to recite the corporate structures, but in short, the relevant balance sheets of the Autoport record no such loans. 

36Further, the records made available to the accountants for the purpose of assessing the plaintiff's claims show that the Autoport was incurring operating losses. There is nothing in the material which would support the plaintiff's assertions that the losses were manipulated (legitimately) for taxation purposes. To the contrary they demonstrate that the business was not flourishing. 

37That observation is consistent with the plaintiff's own assertion elsewhere. He was engaged in litigation with Ms Knight consequent upon the break up of their defacto relationship and for that purpose the plaintiff swore an affidavit in which he declared, with express detail, his parlous financial circumstances. This affidavit, sworn 27 April 2006, asserts that, owing to the present financial position of the business conducted at the Autoport, the shares had only nominal value. He added that the trading activities of the business ""have only deteriorated since the 2003 to 2004 financial year"" and his personal income was largely dependant upon income receipts from this business and, more recently, workers compensation benefits. He said that over the previous twelve months he had borrowed funds totalling $80,000 in order to meet his weekly living expenses. 

38There has been a considerable transfer of the plaintiff's assets into a family trust. His evidence that the beneficiaries were his children is contradicted by his own statement asserting that he was the beneficiary when he was ""marketing"" his skills to a potential employer. The plaintiff's attempts to distinguish himself from the corporations through which he traded and the trust, merely offered confirmation of his willingness, when it suited him, to dissemble. 

39It is also not without significance that the affidavit abovementioned asserted that until recently the plaintiff had resided in premises Number 6 Roger Street, Kingswood but owing to the poor state of his financial affairs he had moved in with his parents at Number 4 in the same street. When arrested on warrant on 16 May 2006 he gave his address as Number 6 aforesaid. Nevertheless, when seeking to have the convictions entered ex parte annulled, these movements of residence did not coordinate with his reasons for non-receipt of the notification about adjourned dates. 

The 7 March Incident 

40A commencing point for the plaintiff's version in his evidence in chief can be made when he said that one of his staff (Michelle Pateman) had observed him to be distraught and hiding underneath the service station and ""she asked a good friend of mine to come and have a talk to me and we organised to go and see Dr Hampshire the next day"". 

41It transpired that the plaintiff had gone to Queensland on 4 March and returned only on morning of 7 March. Dr Hampshire said that he had spoken to the plaintiff on that morning and, concerned about his condition, told him to come in to see him intending to ""squeeze him in between other appointments"". The plaintiff had been in Queensland in connection with a proposed purchase of a camshaft grinding business. 

42The plaintiff said that on the morning of 7 March as he drove past a post office a police vehicle followed him and he drove into the Autoport where he sustained a panic attack as a result of which he sat in his locked car for about half an hour or a little longer. When he emerged he saw police on foot and their car parked nearby and this provoked another panic attack. As he was intending to go to see Dr Hampshire he determined to ride his motorcycle, fearing that his motor vehicle would be identified by police. He had no licence to ride a motorcycle. Nevertheless he mounted the cycle and proceeded near Bringelly Road where he said a police vehicle came behind him and activated its siren. He stopped the cycle but recognised Constable Arapa (the arresting officer on 1 March) as a result of which he panicked and ""shot through"". Although he was pursued by the police vehicle for a time, he evaded them and headed for the City on the M4 Motorway. 

43I interpolate that the evidence shows that Constable Arapa was not on duty on 7 March 2006. 

44When the plaintiff reached the City, he missed an intended turn and circled under the southern approaches of the Harbour Bridge coming into George Street North. There, patrolling police sighted him and in their vehicle made a u-turn to position it behind the plaintiff. The police vehicle activated its siren and lights. The plaintiff responded by trying to ""get away"". The plaintiff said that he did realise that the police vehicle was local to the Rocks but he thought that St Marys police must have radioed ahead a report that he had ""shot through"". 

45The plaintiff intended to proceed to Macquarie Street to see Dr Hampshire. He accepted that he rode along a footpath but, eventually observing that the traffic gates were locked, he rode into the Government House gardens through a pedestrian way, passing the sentry box, and he then removed his jacket and helmet and dumped the motorcycle into some shrubbery. 

46In order to exit the Government House area, he climbed over a fence, gashing his leg in the process. He claimed that he noticed a police ""chopper"" in the air above him. I interpolate that Dr Hampshire also noticed a helicopter in the air which he presumed, as a result of assertion by the plaintiff, was a police aircraft. There is no evidence that any police helicopter was surveying the plaintiff or that any helicopter in the air at about this time was part of the police air wing or had anything to do with the plaintiff. 

47As already mentioned, the plaintiff was in telephone communication with Dr Hampshire. He noticed that there were ""police everywhere"" but he said that they did not approach him until he was in the presence of Dr Hampshire. He heard Dr Hampshire identify himself to police and the plaintiff said that a police officer took his arm and he claimed that he responded that he would go with them. However, the plaintiff said that he was wrestled to the ground and said he felt knees and blows to his back. He said he was having a seizure at the time but was handcuffed and dragged and thrown into the back of a paddy wagon. He was taken to the Rocks Police Station. 

48There, after being seen by ambulance officers, he was charged and released to bail in the company of Dr Hampshire to whose rooms he went, then to his solicitor's office and later home. 

49Dr Hampshire was called. He said he had spoken on the phone to the plaintiff in the week prior to the 7 March but on that day he thought that the plaintiff seemed increasingly anxious and he asked him to come to his rooms without appointment. This contrasts with the plaintiff's evidence about the appointment being made as a result of Ms Pateman's urgings the previous day. 

50Dr Hampshire said that when he arrived the plaintiff had ""police officers around him"". He asked police what was going on after telling them who he and the plaintiff were. He said police were ""very quiet, quite still"". He said he put his arm around the plaintiff and told police that he was not dangerous and he offered to help even to the extent of offering to put handcuffs on the plaintiff. What Dr Hampshire did not know was that police were responding to reports of a motorcyclist (the plaintiff) riding erratically into the City from the Anzac Bridge area and that the motorcycle had, inter alia, been ridden among pedestrians on a footpath. In the circumstances it would be surprising if police unreservedly accepted the dependability of what this stranger (to them) said about a suspected offender who had fled from a police vehicle of which the sirens and lights had been activated. 

51In a statement to an investigator on 21 March 2006 Dr Hampshire expressed his view that (police behaviour) was ""excessive"". But the apparent context of this assessment was that Dr Hampshire believed that the plaintiff ""didn't need it"" because Dr Hampshire had a belief that his patient was ""not violent"". 

52However Dr Hampshire's description of the plaintiff at the time was that he was a large man and looked very wild. He said his eyes were wide open and red and he looked very agitated. He gave an analogy that the plaintiff appeared ""like a boxer before round one"". If that description be accepted, then that is the appearance of a person by whom the police were being confronted. Ordinary prudence would dictate that such a person would be likely to require restraint upon arrest. Dr Hampshire candidly stated that he had never on any other occasion witnessed an arrest. He described himself as emotionally distressed and alarmed, so he left. 

53As far as physicality was concerned, Dr Hampshire said in examination in chief ""one of the officers quietly went up to try to grab him, get hold of his hand, he flung his hand away, flung the officer's hand away, in quite a violent sort of emotion (sic - motion). That was I think the trigger more or less for everyone to subdue him"". He said he saw the officer's ""jumping"" on him but this seemed to be a description of them using ""mainly their weight"" with their bodies and knees trying to get the plaintiff still. 

54Dr Hampshire had observed six police officer's (four in uniform, two in plain clothes) and none were, he estimated, over 5 foot 10 inches or would weigh over 75 kilograms. He said two of the officer's were ""girls"" and three others were very small people. In evidence he described the female officers as ""little"". In contrast he described the plaintiff as ""a six foot two, six foot three bloke 'big fellow'"". Mr Ingram was the teacher who ushered the pupils into the school building. He had seen the motorcycle enter Government House grounds and the plaintiff emerge and sit in an area which he described as the amphitheatre. When police arrived he drew their attention to then plaintiff whom he thought looked agitated. He recalled seeing only two police officers on the occasion. His description of events was as follows: 

""The police went over to him and then I noticed that he seemed to resist. His movements indicated he seemed to resist something because there was an agitated movement. Then the constable who was - well, the police officer had his knee holding the man down as if the knee was bent and he was sort of kneeling holding him down and then that seemed to subdue the man, and at that moment I turned away to usher students in."" 


55Mr Ingram saw no punches or kicks being delivered. Although he ushered the students inside he ""kept the man under view"". 

56Although nominated in the pleading it is common ground that Sergeant Joice, who was in the police car that commenced the pursuit in George Street North, was not one of the officers who physically arrested the plaintiff. Sergeant Joice was the prosecutor who initiated the issue of six CANs given to the plaintiff at the police station. There were, as previously mentioned, four charges of resisting police in the execution of duty and charges of riding in a manner dangerous and riding a motorcycle without being licensed. 

57The officer's present at the time of arrest were Constables Murray, Wee, Spong, Armstrong, Winter and de Jong. 

58It might be observed that, contrary to Dr Hampshire's memory, the police officers at the scene were five male and one female rather than four male and two female. 

59Constable Murray with Constable Wee were the first police to approach the plaintiff. They had come in response to a radio message and been directed to the plaintiff by Mr Ingram. Constable Murray recalled a person, obviously Dr Hampshire, approaching him as he spoke to the plaintiff. This person said that he was the plaintiff's psychiatrist. Constable Murray placed his arm on the plaintiff who pulled away and the Constable told him that he was under arrest. When he took hold of his arm again, a scuffle took place. He was assisted in the arrest by other police who had come to the scene. 

60Cross-examination was directed to the possibility that, accepting Dr Hampshire's assertions of his offer of assistance and the possibility (which he did not recall) that the plaintiff offered to go with police, a physical arrest could have been avoided. Whilst Constable Murray acknowledged this hypothesis, in the actual circumstances particularly the plaintiff's reaction (corroborated by Dr Hampshire) I find that proceeding to arrest was reasonable. There is no basis for concluding that any force applied by Constable Murray was excessive. 

61Constable Wee was on duty as Constable Murray's partner. He could not remember the conversation between Constable Murray and the plaintiff in detail but when he himself asked the plaintiff to wait, he was ignored and that is when Constable Murray stepped in. Constable Wee recalled the plaintiff saying something about ""his psych being across the road"" and that ""he had to go"". He thought the plaintiff was ""agitated and fired up"". The plaintiff was then told that he was under arrest and taken by the arm. Constable Wee said ""he (the plaintiff) pulled away a couple of times. Constable Murray stepped in and the other two officer's who came in the car came and the next thing I know, yeah, they were on the ground arresting Mr Quirk"". 

62Constable Wee was not cross-examined to suggest that he observed any excessive force being applied to the plaintiff in the course of that arrest. 

63Constable Spong was accompanied by Constable Rebecca Armstrong. They were in plain clothes but wearing the usual police appointments. Upon hearing a radio message they proceeded to the area of the Conservatorium of Music in an unmarked police car. Constable Spong saw the plaintiff, whom he described as breathing heavily, sweating and eyes dilated. He added that the eyes were ""wide"". At the time of his arrival he deduced that the plaintiff was under arrest. He noticed the plaintiff was ""thrashing his body around"" and Constable Spong took hold of him and, against resistance, applied handcuffs. He later assisted in walking the plaintiff over and into a caged police vehicle. 

64Taken to a statement made by him in 2006, the Constable agreed that although he did not presently recollect it, a man had introduced himself as the plaintiff's psychiatrist. He agreed that he recorded that he had made a knee strike to the plaintiff ""as we took him to the ground"". He said that that strike was to the upper thigh and not to the back. That assertion is consistent with the strike being made as the plaintiff was being brought to the ground as distinct from striking him after he was on the ground. 

65A statement, admitted by consent, by Constable Armstrong deposed that she has no recollection of the incident and has been informed that, although a computer record notes a statement by her for the purpose of a preparation of a brief of evidence, it cannot be located. 

66Constable Winter came to Government House in response to a radio message where he located the abandoned motorcycle. He then went to the Conservatorium area where the plaintiff was seen by him to be on the ground and handcuffed. When the plaintiff was later conveyed to the Rocks Police Station in the back of the police vehicle, Constable Winter positioned himself so as to be able to view the plaintiff during the journey. After being assisted to the rear of the cage on arrival the plaintiff alighted from the vehicle unassisted. Constable Winter noticed that the plaintiff was shaking violently and breathing heavily while he was in the vehicle. As already noted, an ambulance was brought to the police station and the plaintiff was examined. 

67Constable de Jong accompanied Constable Winter. He saw the plaintiff on the ground with handcuffs applied. He thought the plaintiff looked distressed and agitated. He recalled the plaintiff saying he was having a panic attack. Constable de Jong was not cross-examined. 

68It is convenient, although out of chronological sequence, to deal with the causes of action advanced in respect of the events of 7 March. 

69As previously stated tort claims were formulated asserting assault and malicious prosecution and, apparently in the alternative to the latter, abuse of process. 

70In respect of the claim for assault I am considerably assisted by what I would asses to be the realistic view of the evidence taken by counsel for the plaintiff and the candour of final submission, which relevantly was: 

""The only submission that I put in relation to 7 March 2006 is that the use of force on that occasion was excessive, therefore, the plaintiff was assaulted. I can't put it any higher than that but I with respect acknowledge what my learned friend says, that the police were in a situation where they were confronted with a man who to them looked barking mad, agitated, wide open eyes and the like, and it is a case where it would be open to your Honour to take the view that in the circumstances that the behaviour on that occasion was not as such excessive."" 


71I do take that view and accordingly conclude that this claim for damages for assault should fail. 

72Although it is unnecessary for decision, I add that I would not agree with the submission that the situation "" could undoubtedly have been handled better"", by police availing themselves of assistance of Dr Hampshire. It was necessary for police to respond to the exigencies of the moment, taking into custody a person previously seen erratically riding a motorcycle, including scattering pedestrians, who had abandoned the motorcycle as above described and whose appearance was, to borrow counsel's phrase ""barking mad"". It would not have been reasonable for police to suspend what they were doing to investigate the identity or bona fides of Dr Hampshire. In any event, in the absence of threat to the safety of police officers or others, I would seriously doubt the prudence of police taking upon themselves to enlist civilian aid in the execution of their duty. 

73I turn to the action for malicious prosecution. To succeed upon such a cause of action the plaintiff must prove the institution of criminal proceedings by the defendant, the termination in favour of the plaintiff, the absence of reasonable and probable cause for the institution of proceedings and malice by the prosecutor in the sense of having a purpose other than that of carrying the law into effect. The distinction relevant to the pleaded alternative (abuse of process) lies in the misuse of legal process, even if properly obtained, for some improper purpose. I mention that no such improper purpose was sought to be identified nor was it evidenced. 

74As already recorded, the plaintiff was charged with four offences of resisting an officer in the execution of duty as well as charges of riding in a manner dangerous to the public and riding without a licence. The claim for malicious prosecution is limited to the four charges of resisting an officer. Somewhat imprecisely, the pleading asserts the institution of proceedings (by procuring the issue of CANs) by Sergeant Joice and/or other officers. Sergeant Joice is nominated as prosecutor on each CAN. The officers said to have been resisted are specified as Constables Murray, Wee, Spong and Armstrong respectively. As the State is, by Statute, vicariously liable in respect of all these police officers, an analysis seeking to individualise the institution of proceedings would be surplus to requirements. 

75All six charges were dismissed pursuant to s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 by the Presiding Magistrate at Downing Centre Local Court on 2 November 2006. A transcript of the proceedings on that occasion was admitted as part of an exhibit. From that source it can be seen that the plaintiff pleaded guilty to the offences other than those of resisting the police officers. It does not appear that the plaintiff was asked to enter a plea to the last mentioned charges. Section 32(1) empowers the Court to act pursuant to its provisions at the commencement or at any time during the course of hearing. It may be a moot point whether proceedings have been commenced before a plea is sought by the Local Court equivalent of arraignment. It is not necessary to explore this. 

76The police officer appearing to prosecute at the hearing (not Sergeant Joice) stated that he had seen a report from Dr Hampshire and, as a consequence of reading its contents, he would be asking that the charges be dealt with under s 32. That report of Dr Hampshire is not in evidence but the transcript notes that, according to it, the plaintiff has been treated for post traumatic distress disorder since at least 2002. Following some discussion, not only the charges of resisting police but the two charges to which the plaintiff had pleaded guilty were dismissed pursuant to s 32. This course was not opposed by the prosecutor. 

77It should be noted that s 32(4) provides: 

""a decision under this section to dismiss charges against a defendant does not constitute a finding that the charges against the defendant are proven or otherwise"". 

78As the transcript exhibited does not contain formal orders, the conditions attached to the dismissal of the charges can only be paraphrased. The conditions appear to require the plaintiff to undergo treatment and take medication as described by Dr Hampshire or ""other relevant doctors suitable"". 

79The statutory provisions are structured so that in the absence of breach of condition within 6 months of imposition (ss 3A and 3D) the dismissal of the charges becomes final. 

80The defendant has submitted that the plaintiff has not pleaded (nor proven) favourable termination of the relevant charges. It is admitted on the pleadings that the charges were dismissed as above recounted on 2 November 2007 (sic 2 November 2006). At the risk of repeating comments made during the hearing about the quality of pleading, I am content to approach the issue on the basis that it was intended by the expression of dismissal to assert a relevant termination in the plaintiff's favour. 

81In support of its contention, the defendant drew attention to the remarks of Isaacs ACJ and Starke J in Davis v Gell (1924) 35 CLR 275 concerning proof of innocence where a prosecution had been brought to an end by the entry of a nolle prosequi. The observations in that case must be understood in the light of the later authority of Commonwealth Life Assurance Society v Smith (1938) 59 CLR 527 where it was noted (at page 540) that, before Davis v Gell , no one appears to have supposed that, where the prosecution broke down before a magistrate a plaintiff was in a less favourable position than a plaintiff who had been acquitted after trial. The joint judgment (Rich, Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ) proclaims that, except in the case of a nolle prosequi, the guilt or innocence of a plaintiff is not an issue going to the cause of action in malicious prosecution (at page 543). 

82Given the structure of the mental health provisions above noted, the plaintiff is not in jeopardy of further prosecution and, to the extent that it might be sought to argue its relevance, the plaintiff possesses a presumption of innocence in respect of the charges. I am satisfied therefore that the plaintiff has established the element of the tort that the proceedings terminated in his favour. 

83However, the plaintiff must also prove the absence of reasonable and probable cause and malice. On both these issues, the plaintiff fails. Irrespective of which police officers the plaintiff intended to identify as ""prosecutor"", that prosecutor would have had the observed conduct of the plaintiff reported including his riding of the motorcycle which clearly justified a decision to arrest. For reasons already given no excessive force was applied to affect the arrest and the evidence that the plaintiff resisted was scarcely challenged. I accept it would be reasonable to regard the plaintiff as liable to prosecution for resisting the officers. 

84As counsel for the defendant pointed out, the plaintiff did not seek to address the particulars of malice which are set out in the pleading. There is no basis for inferring that the police officers did not have an honest view that there was a proper case to be brought against the plaintiff for resisting arrest. There is not a skerrick of evidence that any police officer involved in the events of 7 March was motivated by spite or ill will against the plaintiff or intended to injure him. 

85Neither is there any basis for conclusion that any legal process was misused so as to provide a foundation for an action for abuse of process. All of the tort claims by the plaintiff said to arise from the events of 7 March will be dismissed. 

86Anticipating the possibility of such an outcome, the plaintiff submitted that (on the assumption that the plaintiff succeeded in proving tort induced damage arising from the events of 1 March) that damage flowing from the events of 7 March remained compensable along principles which have been conveniently summarised by Malcolm CJ in State Government Insurance Commission v Oakley (1990) Aust Torts Reports 81-003 and cited by Kirby J in Covington-Thomas v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] NSWSC 779 namely: 

"" ""In my opinion, where the negligence of a defendant causes an injury and the plaintiff subsequently suffers a further injury the position is as follows: 

(1) where the further injury results from a subsequent accident, which would not have occurred had the plaintiff not been in the physical condition caused by the defendant's negligence, the added damage should be treated as caused by that negligence; 

(2) where the further injury results from a subsequent accident, which would have occurred had the plaintiff been in normal health, but the damage sustained is greater because of aggravation of the earlier injury, the additional damage resulting from the aggravated injury should be treated as caused by the defendant's negligence; and 

(3) where the further injury results from a subsequent accident which would have occurred had the plaintiff been in normal health and the damage sustained include no element of aggravation of the earlier injury, the subsequent accident and further injury should be regarded as causally independent of the first."""" 

87As is obvious, any such possibility would appropriately be dealt with in due course in the context of any assessment of damages. 

The gold chain or necklace 

88Although a necklace was part of the plaintiff's property taken into custody after being brought to the police station at Penrith following the events at Kingswood on 1 March 2006, the claim in respect of this item can be dealt with discretely from the other tortious conduct alleged to have occurred on that day. 

89Upon arrival at the police station, the arresting police gave the plaintiff into the custody of others who were performing management duties at the station. The plaintiff's property was taken from him as he was processed into custody. It was not suggested that anything unlawful or improper occurred in relation to this process. A ""property docket"" was prepared, listing what had been taken. This docket acts as a receipt and was signed by the plaintiff and Constable Jennifer Thomas. The docket which she prepared was timed at 12.54 (pm) and showed cash of $325.00, some medications and documents, some, like a driver's licence, no doubt in the form of cards. 

90During the plaintiff's custody it was later discovered that he had some further cash and a necklace. A new property document was prepared, timed at 15.41 (3.41pm), and it showed an increase in the cash taken (from $325.00 to $340.00) and repeated the eight items which had been on the earlier docket and added ""one x gold coloured neckless (sic)"". 

91The plaintiff was released on bail and his signature on the bail undertaking is timed at 5.40 pm and the plaintiff dated it (in the American style) 3.1.06 but it is clear from Constable Warner's endorsed certificate on the document that the relevant date was 1 March. Upon release the plaintiff was entitled to the return of his property. The form of property document makes provision for a second signature by the detainee in order to acknowledge receipt of the property. 

92At some point after being released to bail, the plaintiff apparently became aware that he did not have his necklace. On the following day (2 March) he went to the police station and complained to the officer in charge that his necklace had not been returned. It would appear that his now claimed pathological fear of police had not by then developed or he was able to suppress it in order to seek to recover the necklace. 

93Ultimately, police undertook a formal investigation but the necklace was not located. Relevant police asserted that it had in fact been returned to the plaintiff on his release and it was accordingly not in police custody. The investigation reportedly criticised the adherence to procedures at Penrith Police Station and, I gather, an important foundation for the criticism was the absence of a signed receipt in the documentation maintained as the police file. 

94But it is now apparent that there does exist a signed receipt and it is plain that the procedural break down at the police station involved handing the plaintiff the original signed property document rather than a copy. I am able to reach this conclusion as the signed document was retrieved from material produced by the plaintiff's solicitor whose possession of it must have emanated from the plaintiff himself. 

95When confronted by this document, the plaintiff denied that the receipt signature was his. There are numerous examples of the plaintiff's signature among the exhibits. Signature, of course, is a personal matter but the undisputed examples are not legible and consist of several overwritten left leaning ellipses and these are encircled by the flourish of a loop which passes through them. To my untrained eye there may be detectable differences between the signatures appearing on the property document but I would assess them as minor and they do not persuade me that forgery is a realistic possibility. As a fact finder, I regard it as a matter of notoriety, that not every signature by a particular person produces an exact trace. I reject the plaintiff's denial of the signature. 

96That conclusion is fortified by other evidence. Nine items (apart from the cash) are scheduled on the property docket. These items consist of drivers' and boat licences, two blank cheques, something described as ""advantage plus"", two open packets of medications, two loose tablets, a brown belt and the gold necklace. 

97The activity in the custody management area was recorded on CCTV. The relevant product was viewed during the trial. The evidence of Constable Thomas who was, of course, not involved in the events at Kingswood is important. She personally took the plaintiff's property into custody. She gave evidence that her procedure was to take items such as jewellery and fold them in paper and seal the package with tape. She is able to be seen doing this in the vision from the CCTV. Apart from being asked to spell ""necklace"" the only question in cross-examination directed to her obtained her agreement that what was shown on the video to ""be folding"" (sic - being folded) was a black or very dark coloured object. The actual wrapping paper was obviously white. At one point it was suggested by counsel that the video might be interpreted as showing the wrapping of shoe laces. No such items were taken from the plaintiff. I am not in a position to analyse the colour reproduction qualities of the CCTV but the only item of the plaintiff's property that would be treated by Constable Thomas in the way that she described was the necklace. The plaintiff's property is exhaustively listed and there was no other item of intrinsic value. 

98The surveillance of the custody management area was operative as the plaintiff was being released to bail and receiving his property. He is seen to be handed papers and apparently signing them but I am unable to say that he is shown to be specifically signing the property docket. Inter alia, he was required to sign an acknowledgment of bail conditions. However the plaintiff is seen to be placing a white object of similar appearance to the package created by Constable Thomas into the back pocket of his trousers. I reject counsel's invitation to conclude that this was a packet of medication. It was said that the plaintiff could be seen adjusting the package into his pocket but this is hardly persuasive to a conclusion that the white object was a medication packet rather than package as prepared by Constable Thomas. 

99A written submission contended that the gold chain ""was stolen from the custody of police"" and that the State is vicariously liable for any tort by a police officer including conversion, detinue or negligence as a bailee. It remains not entirely clear which tort is alleged but that is of no moment as, without needing to depend on onus, I am affirmatively satisfied that the plaintiff did receive back the gold chain at the time of his release on bail. Accepting his assertion that he no longer has it, it was lost, mislaid or stolen out of his possession and not out of the possession of police. 
The events leading to 1 March 2006 

100The events of this day had their origin in the AVO taken out by Tracey Knight against the plaintiff. Her visit to St Marys Police Station on 31 January was said to be in relation to complaints of breach of conditions by him. Although Ms Knight was scheduled as a possible witness for the plaintiff in the course of case management directions, she was not called. In all the circumstances (the plaintiff has had relationships with three other women since that which he had with Ms Knight) I do not draw any inference from her absence but it remains the case that there is no evidence verifying any breach by the plaintiff until the call overheard by Constable Arapa on the speaker phone when it is claimed that there was no mention of any arrangements concerning the children. 

101The evidence did, however, include a print from police computer records concerning Ms Knight's visit to the police station shortly before 7.30 pm when the call from the plaintiff was received. I do not think that this visit was coincidental and was consistent with a requested arrangement for a call being made at about that time by Ms Knight when she had met the plaintiff earlier in the day. The computer entry records that ""it was deemed at the time that the allegations being made could not be substantiated"". 

102The print is informative as to the level of apprehension which might be derived from alleged breach of the AVO by the plaintiff. There is apparently a pro forma built into the system which notes ""domestic violence related details"" and some twenty-nine circumstances can be logged with a Y for yes or an N for no. The entry is in a negative for ""domestic involved violence to person""; ""domestic involved stalking/intimidation""; ""domestic involved threat of violence"" and ""domestic involved argument (no threat)"". Also in the negative were various references to firearms possession, the presence of children ""at domestic"" and alcohol or drug abuse. 

103It is clear that, assuming the validity of the complaints of breach taken at the highest, violence of neither actuality nor potentiality was involved. Those circumstances should have provided a key indicator as to the appropriate conduct in enforcing the AVO. 

104As mentioned, it appears that Tracey Knight was complaining of contact before 31 January. There is evidence that the telephone call overheard by Constable Arapa was made pursuant to an arrangement. Whether Ms Knight intended to ""set up"" the plaintiff is not an issue in this litigation but I can comfortably deduce that if the plaintiff had subjected her to threat or the like, it would have been at least mentioned and recorded. Certainly Constable Arapa was not informed that Ms Knight was in fear of actual violence by the plaintiff. This is confirmed by the computer entries. 

105The absence of urgency can be detected in Constable Arapa's election only to seek contact with the plaintiff by telephone as an entire month went by. There is dispute about what passed between them in telephone conversations but, so far as the evidence demonstrates, Constable Arapa was seeking to enforce an alleged breach of AVO consisting of a telephone call in which arrangements for the children were not mentioned. What was in fact discussed in the call before the speaker was attached was not the subject of testimony and I infer that nothing said by the plaintiff would have inculpated him. 

106One of the faculties available to Constable Arapa was the issue of what was categorised as a ""future CAN"". Similar to the superseded Justices Act provisions whereby information could be laid and a summons issued and served, upon complaint, a CAN could issue requiring the plaintiff to attend court to answer the allegation on a specified date. Given the non-violent nature of the alleged breach, it is difficult to see why this method was not adopted. A CAN of this sort may be served by post or personally. When questioned about the use of this alternative to arrest, Constable Arapa spoke at length about practical difficulties when service by mail is attempted. That was not the point and I found his testimony about this intentionally obfuscatory. 

107The essence of contradiction between the plaintiff and Constable Arapa concerning the telephone exchanges was whether the plaintiff declined to agree to attend the police station, and in effect, challenge the Constable to find him or whether he agreed to come to the station on condition that he was accompanied by his solicitor. I prefer the plaintiff's version. It is indirectly supported by the evidence, which I accept, of the solicitor Mr Amirreaggi that he rang St Marys Police Station and spoke to an officer asking that whoever was dealing with the matter concerning the plaintiff be informed that he and the plaintiff would be available to attend the police station within the hour. Constable Arapa denied that he received any message to that effect. Given the extensive and sophisticated communication equipment available to police, I find the claimed lapse difficult to countenance. 

The events of 1 March 2006 

108Given the relatively leisurely activity in relation to the matter as the month of February passed, the swiftness of police action on 1 March provided a marked contrast. In his cross-examination Constable Arapa said that he had asked the plaintiff ""can you come down to the police station today so we can sort this matter out"". This is slightly different from his COPS entry which recorded ""police (that is Constable Arapa himself) offered the accused the opportunity to attend the police station either that day or at a later date"". It was Constable Arapa's version that the plaintiff refused and challenged him to find him. 

109Constable Arapa left the police station and headed to Kingswood virtually straight away. He claimed he formed the intention to arrest the plaintiff after he had spoken to him at the Autoport. To a question asserting that from the outset he had not the slightest intention of doing anything other than arresting the plaintiff, Constable Arapa said ""that's not true"". 

110He had been accompanied from St Mary's Police Station by Constable Cathy Donney. They were working together in the station when Constable Arapa told her that ""he needed to do the arrest"". She confirmed in cross-examination that he (Constable Arapa) was always going to arrest him (the plaintiff) about which she had no doubt. I prefer the evidence of Constable Donney which, in any event, is more consistent with what later happened at the Autoport. 

111Somewhat differently from Constable Arapa's version above quoted, I observe that in cross-examination of the plaintiff it was put by counsel for the defendant that Constable Arapa had said on 31 January in response to the plaintiff's statement that he would not be found ""well if you're going to be like that, I will have to come to your work to arrest you"". 

112Upon arrival at the Autoport the officers made inquiries and searched for the plaintiff without success. It is apparent that his motor vehicle was there in plain sight. The constables made their way across the road to Kingswood Railway Station where a man was arrested for an offence in the category of offensive language. As they were escorting this man to the police vehicle which was at the Autoport, Constable Arapa sighted the plaintiff in his vehicle which was turning within the precinct of the Autoport. Leaving the person arrested with Constable Donney, Constable Arapa ran across the Great Western Highway to the plaintiff's vehicle. 

113What next happened was tinged with high drama and emotion and I doubt that anybody's recollection as transmitted into testimony would have been exact but significant facts can be determined. 

114Although the plaintiff's vehicle was moving he stopped it reasonably promptly in response to a police hand signal. At about this time Constable Arapa was joined by Constables Wade and Barnes who had been of foot patrol in the vicinity of the railway station. Constable Arapa's evidence in chief was that, without response from the plaintiff he said ""I am Constable Arapa. I am a police officer from St Marys police. Can you produce your driver's licence for me please?"". And ""you're the driver of a motor vehicle. I require you to produce your licence for me. If you fail to do so you may be committing an offence"". And ""you know, I believe that you are Wayne Quirk, a person wanted by police for breach of an AVO. I am placing you under arrest for breaching that AVO and I require you to get out of the car"". 

115This evidence is substantially in harmony with the content of statements which the Constable made on 29 June 2006 and 25 March 2011. There is a significant difference in what he recorded in his notebook at 12.15 on 1 March 2006 when he had returned to Penrith Police Station. He recorded: 

""I have stopped you for the purpose of a random breath test, do you have your drivers licence?"" 

116I shall later record some observations about the request for breath test, recognising there is a dispute about when and the circumstances in which it occurred. 

117Constable Arapa had just run across a major road, leaving Constable Donney with a prisoner whom he (not she) had arrested. It stretched credibility that he approached the plaintiff and spoke in the terms of the dispassionate ritual incantations to which he testified. 

118Two aspects upon which there appear to be agreement are, first, that the plaintiff was pressing buttons on a mobile phone and saying that he was attempting to call his solicitor and, second, that the plaintiff did not willingly get out of his vehicle. The latter was achieved by the joint efforts of Constables Arapa, Wade and Barnes. To the extent that he resisted, the preponderance of evidence was that he did so by stiffening his body and planting his feet on the firewall at the floor of the car. I do not accept the plaintiff's contention that he was doing so in order to keep the clutch engaged for fear of the car moving forward and striking one of the officers. He did not offer any explanation as to why he did not himself simply turn off the motor. Nevertheless, it was not suggested that the plaintiff struck any blow upon or toward the police. He simply held his body rigid. The physical aspects of what followed were applications of force by the police upon the plaintiff. 

119Irrespective of the accuracy of testimony as to the use of words, Constable Arapa commenced to try to lever the plaintiff bodily out of his car and Constable's Wade and Barnes joined in the action. 

120It is not surprising that the descriptions of events by those present, including those by police officers, vary as to detail. However, assuming without deciding, that the arrest might be justified by an allegation of breach of the AVO, an issue arises as to whether excessive force was employed by those involved in making the arrest. My conclusion on the whole of the evidence is that excessive force was applied and the plaintiff was the victim of assault. 

121Only Constable Arapa (and to a limited extent Constable Donney who did not participate in the physical arrest) were aware of the non-violent nature of the alleged offence for which the plaintiff was being sought. Constables Wade and Barnes who did participate physically were neither given, nor did they seek, information as to what Constable Arapa was about. 

122Constable Barnes drew and extended his baton. He claimed that he did not use it. His assertion that his purpose was to defend against the possibility of being struck by the vehicle was not credible. 

123The witness Bannister said that he saw two officers with drawn batons. Whilst this is possible, the evidence does not persuade me that anyone other than Constable Barnes produced such an implement. I am satisfied that Constable Barnes used his baton to strike the plaintiff. One of the visible marks on the plaintiff's body which can be seen in photographs taken very soon after the incident is strikingly consistent with a blow by a straight rod-like instrument and it is inexplicable by anything else described as occurring at the relevant time. The evidence of the witness Potter about this was convincing. As I understood him, he did not claim to see actual blows in the sense of seeing the baton striking the plaintiff but his description of seeing the motion of an arm moving up and down was a realistic picture of a scene in which the person in the car was being struck by the baton. 

124Constable Arapa's own version of events included the plaintiff showing him his phone and informing him that, ""It's my lawyer"". On Constable Arapa's own version he ignored this and commenced to attempt to remove the plaintiff from the car by the use of force. This included using his knee to strike the plaintiff's upper thigh ""a number of times"". It appears from Constable Barnes' evidence that, contemporaneously, Constable Wade had made a fist and was punching down in the same area of the plaintiff's thigh. Constable Wade limited these punches to two but in the circumstances I do not accept that his contribution to seeking to remove the plaintiff from the car was so limited. Contables Arapa and Wade were at the open door on the driver's side and Constable Barnes was wielding his baton through the passenger's open door. 

125The violence being manifested was, I am satisfied, a significant factor in the assembly of a crowd of people. Estimates of how many assembled vary widely from the absence of any observation of such a gathering to a few to thirty or more. It was not demonstrated that any citizen attempted to interfere physically with what the police were doing but one woman who expressed criticism was herself arrested. 

126It is to be recalled that Constable Arapa rejected the inferential invitation to speak to the plaintiff's solicitor. This was not the only opportunity offered which might have tended towards a calm resolution of the situation. In these respects and generally I found the evidence of Michelle Pateman both credible and reliable. 

127Ms Pateman was obviously a trusted employee of the plaintiff but it was not suggested that, for that or any other reason, she was biased in his favour. She had left his employ some months after the incident on 1 March and had not seen him again until she was required to attend the hearing as a witness. 

128After the initial visit by Constables Arapa and Donney to the Autoport when they failed to located the plaintiff and had gone over to the railway, the plaintiff came to where Ms Pateman was working and she informed him of the visit and gave him some documentation and the banking. She inferred that he was going to his car in order to proceed to the bank. 

129Next, she noticed three police coming over the Great Western Highway ""in a hurry"". When they approached the plaintiff, who was by then in his car, she recalled hearing one of them say ""Put your telephone down"". She then saw what she called pushing and pulling to get the plaintiff out of the car. She described pulling the legs ""quite viciously"" and then saw that they had managed to get the plaintiff out of the car ""and they've turned him around mid-air and plopped him down on his face and stomach"". She defined ""plopped"" as a throwing down which was quite forceful and she heard a ""large thud"" when he hit the ground. 

130Following this she saw that a police officer ""has pulled his arms around the back of him to put the handcuffs on and then he's come down on him with his knee in the middle of his back"". The sequence is significant. She added that ""his back crunched when the policeman went down on his back with his knee"". This is obviously quite a different use of the knee from the ""knee strikes"" described by officers. 

131At this point Ms Pateman noticed the plaintiff shaking violently. She asked one of the police (who must have been either Constable Arapa, Barnes or Wade) if she could give the plaintiff a bottle of water because she thought the plaintiff was having a seizure. She had seen this type of thing happen before. She said she was told by the police officer to ""Fuck off"" as it was none of her business. 

132In cross-examination she conceded that her memory of this was not clear but I am satisfied that she was rebuffed and indeed the same vulgarity was directed to her on another occasion. 

133This arose out of her response to being repulsed by the police. She decided to telephone the plaintiff's solicitor Mr Amirreaggi. When she contacted him he asked her to put him in touch with the police, so she approached the constable who appeared to be in charge and told him that she had the plaintiff's solicitor on the telephone who would like to speak. The officer's reply was ""Fuck off"" and he added that ""he didn't have to answer that"". 

134By this time, which could only have been minutes after the commencement of physical encounter between the plaintiff and police, a legion of police arrived in vehicles. None of the defendant's witnesses explained how this came about although one witness made mention of a radio message. I infer that there was some form of communication to bring all of these police to the scene and that the communication system was more efficiently engaged than appears to have been the case in communicating the simple message of willingness to attend St Marys Police Station with his client which had been left at St Mary's Police Station by Mr Amirreaggi. 

135Ms Pateman said in chief that she thought there were six to eight police cars assembled. In cross-examination she acknowledged that in a statement to an investigator she had given an estimate of five to six vehicles. On either estimate, it was an extraordinary response to the intended arrest of a person suspected of a non-violent breach of an AVO said to have been committed more than a month previously. Ms Pateman observed the vehicles arrive with their sirens sounding. 

136Given this turn of events and the rebuffs by police, she gave the mechanics who were employed at the Autoport some post-it notes and asked them to write down the numbers of the vehicles. Whilst not directly germane to the plaintiff's pleaded causes of action, what occurred shortly thereafter gave a significant indication of the lack of restraint in the exercise of purported power which was manifested during this affair. 

137The task of noting the numbers was undertaken by the employed mechanics, Mr Bannister and Mr Blair. Mr Blair gave this description which was not challenged in cross-examination: 

""Once Craig and myself had finished writing down the licence plates and all the vehicle numbers we went back into the office and a detective or undercover police officer came and asked to have a look. I then handed him the piece of paper and he tore the page out and walked out and I asked why he took it and he (sic-I) said like why can't we have a copy, and he said, ""You'll get the name of the officer in charge."""" 

138No police officer called by the defendant testified to being the officer who took this document but what I took to be an attempt to justify this seizure was the calling of a Sergeant Heery, now a police prosecutor. He claimed that he had no recollection of why he came to the Autoport, as he did, but he remembered several other police vehicles both marked and unmarked being there. He said he remembered a member of the staff writing down the registrations of ""unmarked police vehicles"" but it was not the request by Ms Pateman to the mechanics to write down unmarked, as distinct from all, police vehicles. The witness conceded that he could not recall what the mechanic was writing and hence could not support his statement that unmarked vehicles were being noted. He recalled a member of the St Marys Proactive Crime Team, who was not in uniform, speaking to one of the staff. 

139I am satisfied that the mechanics were simply doing as Ms Pateman asked and taking down the numbers of a large assembly of police vehicles and they were not engaged, as Sergeant Heery was by inference suggesting, in specifically noting down the numbers of unmarked police cars. 

140As I have said, no police officer identified himself as the person who seized the document, neither was any officer said to have been a member of the ""Crime Team"" called. The paper seized by police was not produced. 

141There is another aspect to the occurrence which again offers insight into the willingness of the police officers at the scene to reject any opportunity to appropriately assess the situation. When the police refused to speak to Mr Amirreaggi, whose practice is in the City, he contacted an agent in the Western Suburbs area and asked him to go to the scene. 

142Accordingly Mr Ghobrial, a solicitor, attended. When he arrived the plaintiff was being conveyed or was already in the police wagon. Mr Ghobrial introduced himself by presenting his business card but was told that he could not speak to the plaintiff although it was indicated that he might do so later at Penrith Police Station. 

143A further, and in my view, important indication of the absence of bona fides, in the conduct of Constable Arapa in particular, is to be found in the request and subsequent charge of refusing to undergo a breath test, a matter to which I said I would return. 

144I have already referred to Constable Arapa's examination-in-chief when he claimed that his opening words to the plaintiff consisted of a request for production of a driving licence. As the constable had been at the Autoport specifically in relation to the plaintiff and knew his vehicle, his assertion that he was asking for the licence to confirm identity stretched credulity particularly in the light of his proceeding in any event to physical arrest without obtaining confirmation by licence production. Be that as it may, Constable Arapa's version in relation to the breath test refusal has some demonstrable problems. 

145The appearance of the plaintiff, variously referred to as a seizure, fit or panic attack, had caused an ambulance to be called to the scene. Constable Arapa said that after the ambulance officers had attended to the plaintiff he made a formal request of the plaintiff in these terms: 

""Because you are the driver of a motor vehicle on a road related area, in accordance with the Road Transport Safety and Traffic Management Act I require you to undergo a roadside breath test. What I require you to do is place your lips over the end of the tube and blow into the device in one long continuous breath and keep going until I say stop"". 

146He then described the actions of the plaintiff, his failure to provide a sufficient sample and further requests by him of the plaintiff so to do. 

147This description of events to which he testified is perceptibly inconsistent in a number of respects with what Constable Arapa had written in his notebook later on 1 March. The notations and some testimony about this casts some light upon the constable's state of mind and motives in executing the arrest. Cross-examination included the following: 

""Q. And your claim is that the arrest of Mr Quirk was lawful because you had arrested him for a breach of the AVO and you had told him at the time of his arrest that that is what he was being arrested for? 
A. Yes. 

Q. That's what you say, is it not? 
A. Yes. 

Q. I want you to have a look at page 65 and 66 of the original of your official police notebook F389005. Read those two pages to yourself. 

BARRY: I will undertake to tender the document. Can I hand your Honour a photocopy of it. 

Q. That is in your handwriting? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Can you please read the words that appear on pages 65 and 66 of that handwritten document? 
A. On page 65 the first line says ""Crewman ute"", then it says ""parked at bowser nearest Great Western Highway facing west. As I walked across Great Western Highway and stood on traffic island I saw Wayne open the driver's door. He looked at me and I looked at him. I ran towards him. Wayne quickly got in car and did a U-turn. I ran after him. Wayne completed U-turn and I stopped him facing east beside bowser nearest shop front. I approached driver's door and opened it. Wayne was wearing--"" 

HIS HONOUR 

Q. ""Denim jeans""? 
A. ""Denim jeans"". It's my terrible handwriting. 

BARRY 

Q. ""And a brown shirt""? 
A. ""And a brown shirt"". 

Q. I will stop you there. Is everything you have recorded there accurate? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And your recollection then of course was based upon the events that occurred virtually within a short period of time before you made this entry? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Could you just read on. 
A. ""I said, 'I have stopped you for the purpose of a random breath test. Do you have your driver's licence?'"" 

Q. Can I stop you there. Is what's recorded in quotes in your police notebook at page 66, ""I have stopped you for the purpose of a random breath test"", is that what you did? 
A. Sorry, what was that question? 

Q. Did you stop Mr Quirk for the purposes of a random breath test? 
A. Well, I've written that there, so... 

Q. Well, may we take it that it is true? 
A. Yes. 

Q. So the real reason that you stopped him was so you could administer a random breath test? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Nothing to do with the AVO, according to this document, was it? 
A. According to that, no"". 

148I conclude that the arrest of the plaintiff was not justified. It follows that his detention was unlawful. Further I am satisfied that Constables Arapa, Barnes and Wade used excessive and unreasonable force in carrying out the arrest and that their conduct constituted an assault of the plaintiff. 

149In relation to the last mentioned I have, without recounting all of the detail, referred to the evidence of employees at the Autoport, in particular Ms Pateman and Mr Bannister. Mr Potter was also employed as a mechanic. He was working nearby on the upper level and would have had a good view of what was happening. He did not impress as a person given to elaboration but there was credibility conveyed in his brief statement ""they [the police] knocked on his door [of the vehicle] and opened the doors up and grabbed his phone and just belted him and one on each side"". Mr Potter noticed a police officer take the phone from the plaintiff and throw it on the ground. Whilst other witnesses either did not see or did not recollect this, I consider it probably happened and I note that a phone was not among the plaintiff possessions which were taken into custody at Penrith Police Station when he was taken there. 

150Mr Wadebrook was passing with one of his children and witnessed the events. As elicited in cross-examination he had some personal experience of arrest. He therefore had a yardstick against which to measure whether the arrest of the plaintiff was excessively forceful. The gravamen of his testimony was that it was so excessive. I reject the attack on his credit. In respect of a particular matter he proved to be an astute observer. As the police were restraining the plaintiff he heard a woman calling on them to desist to which he heard an officer respond ""You'd want to stop or else we'll lock you up too"". As the evidence unfolded it appears that the police did in fact arrest a woman at the scene and Mr Wadebrook's evidence about that circumstance is confirmed. 

Tort liability 

151As stated, I find the plaintiff has established an entitlement for damages arising out of events of 1 March for false imprisonment and assault. The remaining tort issue is the claim for malicious prosecution. The defendant is vicariously liable for the institution of the proceedings by any police officer. I have above recounted the circumstances in which the proceedings terminated in favour of the plaintiff. It is of interest to note that (the law being as in force prior to the amendments by Act No. 107 of 2006) the failure to file the CANs within seven days as required by the then applicable s 177(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 has potential remedy in s 177(5) which provided that leave may be granted (to file the CAN with endorsement of service) after the expiry of the seven day period. No doubt the grant of leave would require cause to be shown but it was not suggested that the prosecution even contemplated seeking to proceed with the CANs after they, in effect, lapsed for want of filing. 

152This inaction which might be categorised as ""letting sleeping dogs lie"" is suggestive, at the very least, of an absence of genuine belief that the plaintiff should be brought to answer for breach of the criminal law. 

153The next issue is whether the plaintiff has proved absence of reasonable and probable cause for instituting the proceedings. I have already referred to the evidence of Constable Arapa's ambiguity about whether he was seeking to enforce the law in the sense of proceeding against the plaintiff for breach of AVO or whether he had altered his focus to the breath test and licence production ""offences"". 

154Despite Constable Arapa's claims, he did not find it necessary to view the plaintiff's driving licence in order to identify him, as his actions in proceeding to arrest demonstrated. The constable asserted that he was administering a ""random"" breath test. He did not claim that the plaintiff smelled of the prior ingestion of intoxicating liquor nor did the constable enquire whether the plaintiff had consumed any. His somewhat tentative evidence that the conduct of the plaintiff in not submitting to arrest caused him to think that the plaintiff may have been affected by liquor (or drugs), I reject. 

155Somewhat surprisingly, in s 13 of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 which replaced provisions in the Traffic Act , it appears that any police officer has a statutory authority to require any person driving or occupying the driving seat of a vehicle on a road or in a road related area, to undergo a breath test. No cause is required. That section appears in Division 3 of the Act which is headed ""Random Breath Testing and Breath Analysis"". 

156Although the provision does not in fact incorporate any notion of randomness, in the present case there was nothing random about the selection of the plaintiff by Constable Arapa and I am satisfied that the request was made by the constable seeking to draw upon authority to enable him to dominate the plaintiff and, in so far as any alleged suspicion that the plaintiff might be thought to be affected by the prior ingestion of substance or substances, it was a charade. 

157I hold that the plaintiff has proved the absence of reasonable and probable cause for the institution of the proceedings. 

158Further I am satisfied that the plaintiff has discharged the onus of proving malice in the sense that the institution of proceedings was for an improper purpose, that is to say, not for the purpose of pursuing the proper application of the law. I do not purport to determine what was the motive of Constable Arapa in particular. His overall conduct in seeking to enforce an alleged non-violent breach of an AVO was however inconsistent with untainted law enforcement function. 

159I interpolate that I am aware that the plaintiff told Mr Field, a psychologist, that Tracey Knight had ""become involved"" with a police officer and that she was ""playing with their minds"" about him and that counsel, no doubt on the plaintiff's instructions, put to Constable Warner that she kept company with a named colleague of his. There is no support for these propositions and I expressly reject them as motives for bringing the proceedings against the plaintiff. In fairness to counsel, I should record that no submission to that effect was made. 

160In summary, the plaintiff is entitled to damages to be assessed upon his claims for false imprisonment, assault and malicious prosecution in respect of the events of 1 March. 

Damages 

161Although the plaintiff was an unimpressive witness, and markedly unreliable on economic matters, he possesses his rights as a citizen. Whether his reactions to the treatment meted out to him were affected by extant psychological condition or not, he was entitled not to be the victim of tortious conduct directed upon him. 

162The bodily injury sustained by the plaintiff consisted of a number of bruises and abrasions. The sequale were not such as to inhibit the plaintiff from travelling to Queensland shortly after 1 March to pursue his interest in the cam grinding business. Whilst I would not describe the injuries as trivial, on any scale they would have to be classified as minor. The bodily injuries are directly related to the assault and these comments are limited to that sense and I am not referring to the affront which was involved in the commission of it. 

163The principal thrust of the plaintiff's claim for compensatory damages was directed to an allegation of psychiatric or psychological injury. In assessing this, the credibility of the plaintiff is integral. The plaintiff was not a reliable historian. It is impossible to derive from his evidence a coherent statement of his work and profit directed activities, and in particular to relate any claimed disability or handicap as preventing or restricting him from carrying out whatever he chose to undertake. 

164A starting point can be taken at 1 July 2003 when an angry customer at the Autoport business punched the plaintiff and fractured his nose. A few days later he was back at work when a suspension coil sprang from a vehicle upon which he was working and injured his face. In February this year he told Mr Raue, a psychologist, that he received ""multiple bony fractures"" in the first incident and ""further fractures"" in the second. These descriptions were extravagant exaggerations. 

165I accept that the plaintiff was then and he remains vulnerable to psychological injury. Shortly after the incidents in 2003 the plaintiff came under the care of Dr Robert Hampshire. He remained under his care for many years and also the care of Dr Kneebone, another psychiatrist, who I gather was, at least initially, called in as the prescription of a restricted drug of an amphetamine type could not be filled except by certification of at least two such practitioners. 

166The plaintiff at that and subsequent times complained of palpitations, shortness of breath and feeling hot, tremulous and nauseated. Dr Hampshire diagnosed these initially as panic attacks. By 2005 Dr Hampshire was made aware that, in addition to the facial insults in 2003, the plaintiff was distressed by the breakdown of his then relationship and some actions by the Road Traffic Authority in relation to the licensing of himself and the Autoport. Dr Hampshire understood that the plaintiff's business declined as a result. The source of that understanding must have been the plaintiff. 

167However, as I mentioned previously, in evidence the plaintiff claimed that he overcame the commercial handicap of the intervention by the RTA by refocussing his activity on LPG conversions for vehicles. Neither any documentation nor the analysis by the accountants supports this claim. To the contrary, as Dr Hampshire was given to understand, the business was on the verge of failure. This preceded the events which are the subjects of this action. 

168Nevertheless, as the plaintiff was an employee of the corporate entity through which the Autoport was operated, he successfully claimed workers compensation and became the recipient of weekly payments as well as the recoupment of medical and pharmaceutical expenditure. He apparently ceased active mechanical work but attended the business where he performed what he repeatedly described as ""director's duties"". I could not determine what was said to be the parameters of such duties from the plaintiff's vague descriptions. The workers compensation entitlement was based upon psychological condition related to the 2003 incidents and not upon physical handicap, 

169The plaintiff continued to receive weekly payments of compensation before and after the incidents with police in March 2006. Eventually he obtained employment at Burwood Council and then moved to his present position with Veolia, a large waste disposal company. When questioned about the receipt of workers compensation weekly payments the plaintiff continually referred to the indemnity for expenses and I found him deliberately evasive when asked about the matter. His own evidence did not coordinate with such records as were produced concerning the continuance of payments. 

170As at 2005 the plaintiff was, to the knowledge of Dr Hampshire, involved in developing some real estate. The doctor noted that he understood that the plaintiff's father had a lot of property assets and the plaintiff himself had some. It was difficult to pin down the plaintiff to some accurate timing of when he involved himself in these activities or indeed what exactly he did. It did emerge that over a period, which bridged the events of March 2006, he had on one block moved an existing structure and erected two more and on a second block had built twelve townhouses, in one of which he now resides. He has also apparently pursued an interest in some sort of unit trust concerning a property in which his solicitor is involved. 

171It appeared to me that the claim for conventionally assessed economic loss was only faintly pressed but both sides of the litigation seemed to accept the opinion of the joint medical, that is psychiatric, experts that a period of three months post incident would represent a time within which aggravation resultant upon the 1 and 7 March events would be operative. Despite the unity of submission on this aspect, I am not satisfied that that was the case. The retained experts were necessarily dependent upon the history provided by the plaintiff who was, as I have said, an unreliable historian and, I would add, on matters of an economic type, a deceptive witness. 

172Dr Hampshire was in my view best positioned to assess any psychological consequences to the plaintiff of his encounters with the police. In 2006, Dr Hampshire had seen the plaintiff twice in January, four times in February and four times in each of March and April. He agreed that the pattern remained similar as the year progressed. He agreed that there was no increase or decrease to the pattern consequent upon the incidents in March. 

173I recognise that Dr Hampshire's notes and records were apparently incomplete but I am persuaded that the probability, indeed the strong probability, is that the plaintiff's condition as indicated by the treatment pattern would have been the same whether or not the incidents of March 2006 occurred. 

174I am not satisfied that the plaintiff aggravated his psychological condition as a result of the events of 1 March and it follows that from that conclusion that the incidents of 7 March did not exacerbate or otherwise deleteriously effect some relevant consequence of the tortious conduct on 1 March. 

175It was submitted that I should award the plaintiff a lump sum to ""cushion"" him from any economic effects of tort induced condition. In an appropriate case, that is a permissible approach. This is not such a case. If the plaintiff has any physical disability preventing him from resuming his occupation as a mechanic or similar, that disability is not sourced in the events of 1 March 2006. To the extent that the plaintiff has any diagnosable psychological handicap, even assuming for the purposes of looking at the claim for economic loss that it is in any way causally related to the torts, the evidence does not show that the plaintiff's income or pursuit of profit seeking ventures has in any way been inhibited. 

176There is one aspect of the plaintiff's claimed condition which should be specifically investigated and that is the assertion that he has developed what I understand to be suggested to be a pathological fear of police. The plaintiff's beliefs which he asserted about Ms Knight playing with the minds of police officers must necessarily have been engendered before the events of March 2006. Subsequent to them, he displayed no reticence in contacting police to pursue his demand for the return of the missing gold chain. He did not attend court in relation to the CANs but said this was due to non-awareness of date, not from any fear of encounter with police. The claim about this condition is entirely dependent upon the credit of the plaintiff and I do not accept him. 

Assessment 

177Damages for the assault will include a modest amount for the minor physical injuries which the plaintiff sustained. I am not satisfied that there was any tort induced economic loss to the plaintiff nor any aggravation of a psychological condition whether it be labelled post traumatic stress disorder, anxiety state, liability to panic attack or otherwise. To the extent that the evidence includes opinions of experts to the contrary of the last mentioned, I reiterate my conclusion that such opinions are obviously critically dependent upon the assertions of the plaintiff whom I find to be unreliable. 

178Each of the torts (assault, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution) demonstrated to have been suffered by the plaintiff has potential to entitle him to compensatory, aggravated and exemplary damages. It is established that aggravated damages are a form of general damages to reflect injury, which may be intangible, resulting from the circumstances and manner of the wrongdoing. Exemplary damages are designed to restrain oppressive and arbitrary conduct by servants of the State and to vindicate and uphold the rule of law. They are also said to have purposes of punishing and deterring the wrongdoer from repetition of the conduct and to dissuade the plaintiff from any urge to seek revenge. 

179I should record that in relation to damages, counsel for the plaintiff sought that I use for guidance figures awarded in Hathaway v New South Wales [2009] NSWSC 116 in which, it was said that after appeal ([2010] NSWCA 184) the case was remitted for retrial on liability only. That was accurate in respect of a count for assault but the appellate Court entered judgment for the defendant on the count for malicious prosecution. The sequale of assault affecting the plaintiff in that action was markedly different from the injuries sustained by the current plaintiff. 

Assault 

180As stated, the physical injuries sustained in the assault were of a minor category. Any aggravation of the plaintiff's psychological condition was transient and, at the extreme, after three months the plaintiff was in no different psychological condition from that in which he was prior to 1 March 2006. 

181For strictly compensatory damages I would assess $5,000. 

182The assault was committed in an area which was comprehended within the plaintiff's place of business. The humiliation of being beaten was observed by employees and, being a ""road related area"" as asserted by Constable Arapa when seeking to administer the breath test, was open to the public, a gathering of which also would have viewed the humiliation of the plaintiff. 

183I would assess that there should be included a further $20,000 to reflect elements of aggravation. 

184Thirdly, there should be awarded a sum representing exemplary damages. These have been referred to at times as being at large but that does not mean that they should be awarded without restraint. I would assess a sum of $25,000 as being appropriate to the circumstances of this case. 

False imprisonment 

185As stated, the detention extended over a period of approximately seven hours. Again, damages are described as being at large. Interference with the right of a citizen to liberty has historically been regarded as inherently serious and the award of damages, the means of enforcement of such rights, should reflect a jealous guarding of it. 

186The substantial part of any assessment is necessarily exemplary or punitive damages and I would include $50,000 to assuage the plaintiff for sustaining this tortious conduct. 

Malicious prosecution 

187Before proceeding to assessment, some observations should be made. 

188It might be contemplated, although it was not advanced as an argument, that the prosecution for breach of the AVO might be distinguished from the other three offences. I repeat that there was no detailed evidence as to what was said between the plaintiff and Ms Knight in the telephone call on 31 January before Constable Arapa was able to hear and participate through the speaker attachment. The plaintiff's evidence was that, earlier in the day, he had met Ms Knight at the Paceway Cafe in Penrith to discuss arrangements about the children in the light of his termination of a relationship with a Mrs Carwt with whom he had become associated after breaking up with Ms Knight. It was said that a friend of Ms Knight, a prison officer named Gail, was at the meeting. No one so identified was called as a witness nor, of course, was Ms Knight. 

189As I have said, I did not find the plaintiff a reliable witness however his version was that he wanted to discuss arrangements for the children as raised earlier in the day when he telephoned Ms Knight but she raised ""numerous points that weren't anything to do with the children"" after which Constable Arapa came on the line. 

190Constable Arapa seems not to have been informed by Ms Knight about the earlier meeting but neither did he seek to learn anything about the content of the conversation before he was in a position to overhear it. 

191My conclusion is that after the events in the service station, Constable Arapa instituted proceedings for all of the offences which he thought could be brought against the plaintiff. In common parlance (borrowed, I suspect, from jurisdictions on the other side of the Pacific Ocean) he ""threw the book"" at the plaintiff. 

192I see no reason to distinguish the proceedings for breach of the AVO from the other charged offences. 

193The plaintiff did not attend on the listed hearing day for the CANs. As a result, the presiding magistrate issued a bench warrant pursuant to which the plaintiff was again taken into custody but released when brought before a court. Subsequent to this he brought the successful annulment proceedings. Any adverse feelings engendered in the plaintiff by this arrest were sourced in his own failure to attend when required. I am aware of his claim that he did not receive notification but that fact, even if true, was brought about by his own ambiguities concerning his correct address. 

194The malicious use of legal process strikes at a critical element in the conduct of an ordered society. The community needs to be confident that the administration of justice is true to its ideals. In the present case that process was abused. The condemnation of such abuse needs to be marked by a significant element of exemplary damages and I would assess $75,000 as appropriate damages for this tort. 

195In total therefore the damages are $175,000 and I direct entry of judgment for the plaintiff accordingly. 

196Liberty to apply for costs orders.

		03 June 2011",2011-06-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709649,State of New South Wales v Richardson (No. 2) [2011] NSWSC 276,"Judgment 

1The Defendant Craig Darryl Richardson stood trial in relation to 4 offences being (1) assault with an offensive weapon with intent to rob, (2) two counts of aggravated sexual assault, and (3) attempted murder. The offences all took place on 19 December 1994 on and near the beach at Byron Bay from about 10:05pm. They are referred to herein as the index offences. 

2After the complainant had given her evidence and had been cross-examined the Defendant changed his plea to guilty in relation to the 4 offences charged. 
3On 24 November 1995 he was sentenced by Newman J as follows: 

(1) For the offence of assault with an offensive weapon with intent to rob a fixed term of 6 years commencing 20 December 1994 and expiring 19 December 2000; 

(2) For the first offence of aggravated sexual assault a fixed term of 10 years commencing 20 December 1994 and expiring 19 December 2004; 

(3) For the second offence of aggravated sexual assault a fixed term of 10 years commencing 20 December 1994 and expiring 19 December 2004; 

(4) For the offence of attempted murder a minimum term of 10 years commencing 20 December 1994 and expiring 19 December 2004 with an additional term of 6 years commencing 20 December 2004 and expiring 19 December 2010. 

4Although the Defendant was eligible for parole on 19 December 2004 he was not released and he served out the balance of the additional term. 

5On 10 December 2010 the State of New South Wales applied under the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 for a continuing detention order pursuant to s 17(1) of the Act, alternatively, for an extended supervision order pursuant to s 9(1) of the Act and, until the proceedings were heard, an interim detention order under s 16 of the Act. 

6The application for an interim detention order came before me when I was sitting as Duty Judge on 17 December 2010. I made an interim detention order which expired on 15 January 2011. Subsequently, further interim orders have been made by other judges of the Court. The last such order expired on 18 March 2011 by virtue of s 16(3) of the Act. 

7Section 6(3) of the Act provided that the application could not be made until the last 6 months of the offender's then current custody or supervision. The present application was not able to be brought earlier than it was because the amendments made by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2010 (which made an application possible in the present case) only came into force on 7 December 2010. That Act widened the circumstances in which an application could be made, by enabling it to be made where another offence was being served concurrently or consecutively with a serious sex offence or an offence of a sexual nature. 

8On the first day of the hearing of the application for the final order I was informed that the Defendant had been scheduled under the Mental Health Act 2007, and that despite the imminence of 18 March his treatment was likely to be extensive while scheduled, the result being that he would not be released into the community for some period of time. 

The Defendant's background 

9The Defendant was born on 31 July 1967 in Victoria. He was the eldest of 6 children. 

10He attended primary school to Year 4 but he did not fit in well with his family or at school. When he was in Year 4 he and another boy broke into the primary school and reportedly ""trashed it"". As a result he was sent to the Travancore Developmental Centre (a boys home) when he was approximately 9 or 10 years old. Both during his time there and subsequently he continued to have difficulties including learning difficulties as well as involvement with the law. During his late childhood and adolescence he spent time at the Tallyho Village (Boys Home), Turana Youth Detention Centre and the Malmsbury Youth Detention Centre. 

11From the age of 18 he was in and out of jobs and spent some time travelling around North Queensland performing work from time to time. 

12His criminal record commenced shortly before his eleventh birthday when he was convicted of malicious damage. His subsequent criminal history consisted largely of property and traffic offences except for a conviction on 11 May 1988 (when the Defendant was almost 21) for intentionally causing injury. For that offence he was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment. 

13Thereafter, and prior to the index offences, he was convicted of burglary and theft in June 1990 and of using threatening words in a public place, hindering police and being drunk in a public place in November 1993. 

The index offences 

14In his remarks on sentence Newman J recorded that the Defendant's victim was walking to her home in Massinger Street, Byron Bay at about 10.05pm, having left her place of employment . After she had walked past the Byron Bay Surf Club building she was accosted by the Defendant who had run up behind her carrying a knife with its blade exposed. He demanded that she give him money but told her not to turn around. He placed the point of his knife on the right hand side of her spine and forced her to enter the dune area. 

15Once there, he continued to demand that she give him money, and forced her to sit down, although she initially resisted that demand. He then pulled her bag off her shoulder and went through its contents. He found, as she had told him, that she had no money. H e then began to make sexual demands on her, first demanding that she expose her breasts. Although she protested he persisted with his demands, emphasizing them by touching her chest with his knife and mouthing threats. 

16Newman J then recorded the following regarding the sexual assaults: 

Eventually, having pulled down her brassiere to look at her breasts, the prisoner, again crudely, announced his intention to have sexual intercourse. Thereupon, he utilised his knife to cut her brassiere and take it off her. He then commenced to suck her right breast. He demanded that this unfortunate woman kiss him. His efforts to do so revealed to his victim that he had been drinking alcohol. This revelation led to a conversation in which the prisoner stated that he had been drinking Tequila and port. He continued his sexual demands, accompanying them by pressing his knife to the victim's throat. 

Having been told by the victim that intercourse was out of the question because she was menstruating, the prisoner's response was to tell her that she thus had the choice of either vaginal or anal penetration. Ultimately, he forced her to remove her sanitary pad. 
During the course of conversation the victim realised that the prisoner was going to rape her and she, perhaps one might think remarkably, persuaded him to use a condom. Prior to penetrating her the prisoner used his knife to cut her panties at her hips. When he commenced to penetrate her, he again pressed his knife to her throat to force her to cooperate in the commission of the sexual act. Its performance, which involved the complainant adopting several positions as a result of the force applied by the prisoner, was physically painful. While this was taking place, the prisoner forced her to remain silent by placing the knife against her lip and threatening to cut her tongue out. 

At some stage during the commission of the sexual act, the prisoner had placed the knife on the ground. His victim, in an endeavour to make him retreat, managed to pick it up and began slashing at him with it, kicking him at the same time. Unfortunately her efforts, which I find to be both courageous and reasonable, were to no avail. To retrieve the knife, the prisoner closed the blade on her fingers, thus cutting a number of her fingers. I shall turn to the detail of this and other injuries suffered by the victim later in these remarks. 

Having regained possession of the knife, the prisoner stabbed her in the stomach. Thereafter he continued to stab at her chest and stomach. To protect herself the victim attempted to deflect the knife blows with her right hand, again resulting in her suffering wounds. A recess in the activity then occurred during which time the prisoner removed the condom and made vile remarks of a sexual nature to her. 

She, at this time, was lying on the ground while the prisoner was sitting up. Suddenly he attacked her by stabbing her on the right arm and the right side of her chest. 

Again a cessation of activity occurred during which break the victim told the prisoner she was passing in and out of consciousness and requested him to call an ambulance. He said he would once she was unconscious. She then feigned unconsciousness. The prisoner then proceeded to eat an orange which had been in the complainant's bag. 

While it is difficult to determine where the events concerning the first act of aggravated sexual assault ended, and the circumstances giving rise to the second such charge started, it seems to me that the circumstances surrounding the first charge concluded when the prisoner commenced to eat the orange. 

Again, standing alone, the objective facts surrounding the first charge of aggravated sexual assault are such as to call for the imposition of a substantial term of penal servitude. Indeed, standing alone, those facts could well cause a court to conclude that this sexual assault falls within the category of the worst kind of case, but this charge does not, like the first, stand alone. 

As I have said, the complainant was feigning unconsciousness as the prisoner was eating the orange. Hoping he had gone she opened one eye to see if he had departed. He had not. Enraged, he accused her of feigning unconsciousness so that he would leave enabling her to call the police. He then picked her up by the hair, stating that he would kill her, and ripped the knife across her throat. He began dragging her towards the beach, during which passage he stabbed her again in the throat. 

At some stage during this activity the prisoner made an inquiry about the arithmetic involved in determining what his age would be, should he be given twelve years' imprisonment for attempting to murder the complainant. 

The importance of this enquiry is that it demonstrates that whatever the prisoner's mental deficiencies might be, and whatever his state of intoxication at the time, he clearly appreciated the seriousness of his actions and the fact that retribution for them, if he were apprehended, would be severe. 

In due course the prisoner and his victim reached a point some three metres from where the first sexual assault took place. Here the ground cover was sand. The prisoner rolled the complainant over on to her stomach and penilely penetrated her vagina. Once more this was a physically painful happening for the complainant involving, as it did, the presence of sand in her vagina. 

Following the completion of intercourse the prisoner stated callously ""You felt that one, didn't you"" and then stood up. 

17Thereafter the Defendant trussed his victim by tying her hands behind her back and pinioned her legs with his belt. He jumped on her back and commenced to shovel handfuls of sand into her mouth and across her nose. 

18She managed to get her hands free and ultimately struggled with the Defendant which eventually caused him to desist his attack. She then left the Defendant, walked up to the road and met some people who took her to the police station. The whole episode from the time she was initially accosted until she left the beach lasted approximately 3 hours. 

19Newman J regarded the criminal responsibility of the Defendant at the highest level and said that the case was very close to, if not within, the category of the worst type of case. 
Legislation 

20Section 17 of the Act provides: 

17 Determination of application for continuing detention order 

(1) The Supreme Court may determine an application under this Part for a continuing detention order: 

(a) by making an extended supervision order, or 

(b) by making a continuing detention order, or 

(c) by dismissing the application. 

(2) An extended supervision order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision. 

(3) A continuing detention order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision and that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order. 

(3A) The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence. 

(4) In determining whether or not to make a continuing detention order or extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must have regard to the following matters in addition to any other matter it considers relevant: 

(a) the safety of the community, 

(b) the reports received from the persons appointed under section 15 (4) to conduct examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender's participation in any such examination, 

(c) the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender's participation in any such assessment, 

(d) the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, 

(d1) any report prepared by Corrective Services NSW as to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community, 

(e) any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender's participation in any such programs, 

(f) the level of the offender's compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an interim supervision order or an extended supervision order, 

(g) the level of the offender's compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004. 

(h) the offender's criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history, 

(h1) the views of the sentencing court at the time the sentence of imprisonment was imposed on the offender, 

(i) any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature. 

... 

(5) Part 2 applies to an extended supervision order made under this section in the same way as it applies to an extended supervision order made under section 9. 

21Part 2 of the Act deals with extended supervision orders. Section 10 enables the making of an extended supervision order for up to 5 years. Section 11 sets out conditions that may be imposed on a supervision order. These include, but are not limited to, directions requiring the offender: 

(a) to permit any corrective services officer to visit the offender at the offender's residential address at any time and, for that purpose, to enter the premises at that address, or 

(a1) to permit any corrective services officer to access any computer or related equipment that is at the offender's residential address or in the possession of the offender, or 

(b) to make periodic reports to a corrective services officer, or 

(c) to notify a corrective services officer of any change in his or her address, or 

(d) to participate in treatment and rehabilitation programs, or 

(e) to wear electronic monitoring equipment, or 

(ea) to reside at an address approved by the Commissioner of Corrective Services, or 

(f) not to reside in or resort to specified locations or classes of locations, or 

(g) not to associate or make contact with specified persons or classes of persons, or 

(h) not to engage in specified conduct or classes of conduct, or 

(i) not to engage in specified employment or classes of employment, or 

(j) not to change his or her name. 

22Sub-sections (2) and (3) of s 17 were amended to their present form, and sub-s (3A) was inserted, by the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Amendment Act 2010. Previously, sub-ss (2) and (3) read: 

(2) An extended supervision order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision. 

(3) A continuing detention order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision and that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order. 

23In Tillman v Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 327 the Court of Appeal considered that earlier form of sub-ss (2) and (3). The majority (Giles and Ipp JJA) followed the Victorian Court of Appeal in TSL v Secretary to the Department of Justice (2006) 14 VR 109, and said: 

[89] Accordingly, we would hold that the word ""likely"" in ss 17(2) and (3) denotes a degree of probability at the upper end of the scale, but not necessarily exceeding 50 per cent. The remarks Bell J made when articulating the test she intended to apply are to be understood in this sense. Her Honour said (at [29]): 

""I have approached the determination in this case upon the basis that 'likely' in this context conveys the sense that it is probable, as distinct from possible, that the defendant will commit a further serious sex offence."" 

24In Cornwall v Attorney General for New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 374 the Court said: 

[21] The expression ""a high degree of probability"" indicates something ""beyond more probably than not""; so that the existence of the risk, that is the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, does have to be proved to a higher degree than the normal civil standard of proof, though not to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, the risk or likelihood itself does not have to be a probability to the civil standard of proof, but rather a sufficiently substantial probability to satisfy the criterion ""likely"" as explained in TSL . 

25They went on then to say, in respect of s 17(3): 
[22] On that approach, when one comes to the second element of s 17(3), what is required is satisfaction to a high degree of probability (that is, beyond a mere balance of probabilities) that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order; that is, that even if there is an extended supervision order, the offender will nevertheless still be likely to commit a further serious sex offence. 

26The reasons for the changes made in the 2010 Amendment Act were set out in the Second Reading Speech in relation to that Amendment Act as follows: 

There has been considerable case law on the meaning of the word ""likely"" in this State and in Victoria, which used the same test in relation to a similar piece of legislation, the Victorian Serious Sex Offenders Monitoring Act 2005. The interpretation that is currently applied in New South Wales courts is that the word ""likely"" should be construed as meaning probable, in the sense of a high degree of probability, but not necessarily involving a degree of probability that is more than 50 percent. The authority for this interpretation is Tillman v Attorney General (New South Wales) [2007] New South Wales Court of Appeal 327, reported also at 70 New South Wales Law Reports 448 and 178 Australian Criminal Reports 133. 

Subsequent legislative activity in Victoria, including the repeal of the Serious Sex Offenders Monitoring Act 2005 and the introduction of the Serious Sex Offenders (Detention and Supervision) Act 2009, has resulted in the introduction of an unacceptable risk test. In the second reading speech to the Serious Sex Offenders (Detention and Supervision) Act 2009 the Victorian Minister for Corrections, the Hon. Bob Cameron, noted that the new test invites courts to consider not only the risk of sexual reoffending of the particular offender but also the nature and gravity of the offences the offender may commit in the future. 

As part of the statutory review of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006, many stakeholders acknowledged difficulties with the word ""likely"" and called for clarification. The statutory review also noted that recent decisions of the Supreme Court of New South Wales confirm that there is a need to clarify the use of the word ""likely"", and accordingly the requisite degree to which a court must be satisfied of risk before making an order. The statutory review recommended that one way of achieving this clarity was not to simply define the word ""likely"" but also to clarify the test that is being met, that is, to adopt the unacceptable risk test adopted in Victoria. It is noted that the equivalent Queensland piece of legislation, the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003, contains a similar test and was upheld by the High Court in Fardon v Attorney-General for the State of Queensland [2004] High Court of Australia 46. 

The statutory review of the New South Wales Act found that the arguments that preceded the change in Victoria were equally applicable to New South Wales. In addition, it was acknowledged that there was merit in the test in the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 being consistent with the tests used in Victoria and Queensland given that the schemes set up by each of the three States are similar in nature and designed to achieve the same aim, that is, the protection of the community through the management of serious sex offenders. There are also advantages in having a cross-jurisdictional body of case law being developed. As such, item [5] amends the test [ie s.9(3) and s.17(2) and (3)] to require the court to be satisfied that there is an unacceptable risk replacing the likelihood test with a test of unacceptable risk of the offender committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision. 

27The expression ""unacceptable risk"" in the corresponding Queensland legislation was referred to by the High Court in Fardon v Attorney-General (Qld) (2004) 223 CLR 575. The judges made reference to Family Court cases where the expression had been used in relation to denying a parent access to a child: M v M ( 1988) 166 CLR 69 at 78 and In re G (A minor) [1987] 1 WLR 1461 at 1469. The Judges quoted from the passage in M v M where the following appears: 

In devising these tests the courts have endeavoured, in their efforts to protect the child's paramount interests, to achieve a balance between the risk of detriment to the child from sexual abuse and the possibility of benefit to the child from parental access. To achieve a proper balance, the test is best expressed by saying that a court will not grant custody or access to a parent if that custody or access would expose the child to an unacceptable risk of sexual abuse: Gummow CJ at [60], Callinan and Heydon JJ at [225], and see also McHugh J at [22]. 

28In Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v Williams (2007) 176 A Crim R 111 the Western Australian Court of Appeal said this of the same expression, where it appeared in legislation corresponding to that under consideration here, at [63]: 

In my view, an 'unacceptable risk' in the context of s 7(1) is a risk which is unacceptable having regard to a variety of considerations which may include the likelihood of the person offending, the type of sexual offence which the person is likely to commit (if that can be predicted) and the consequences of making a finding that an unacceptable risk exists. That is, the judge is required to consider whether, having regard to the likelihood of the person offending and the offence likely to be committed, the risk of that offending is so unacceptable that, notwithstanding that the person has already been punished for whatever offence they may have actually committed, it is necessary in the interests of the community to ensure that the person is subject to further control or detention. 

29A similar approach was adopted by Steytler P and Buss JA in Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v GTR (2008) 198 A Crim R 149 at [27]: 

The word 'unacceptable' necessarily connotes a balancing exercise, requiring the court to have regard, amongst other things, for the nature of the risk (the commission of a serious sexual offence, with serious consequences for the victim) and the likelihood of the risk coming to fruition, on the one hand, and the serious consequences for the offender, on the other, if an order is made (either detention, without having committed an unpunished offence, or being required to undergo what might be an onerous supervision order). As John Fogarty points out, albeit in a rather different context (Unacceptable risk - A return to basics (2006) 20 AJFL 249, 252), the advantage of the phrase 'unacceptable risk' is that 'it is calibrated to the nature and degree of the risk, so that it can be adapted to the particular case.' 

30The matter has recently been considered in the context of the NSW legislation by RA Hulme J in State of New South Wales v Thomas (Preliminary) [2011] NSWSC 118. Although RA Hulme J was considering s 9(2) the wording is identical. He said this: 

[13] The formulation, ""poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence"" is a new one introduced into the Act by the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Amendment Act 2010 which took effect from 7 December 2010. The previous formulation which has been considered in a number of decisions of this Court both in the Common Law Division and the Court of Appeal was ""is likely to commit a further serious sex offence"". 

[14] The first part of the test in s 9(2), that is the need for satisfaction ""to a high degree of probability"", remains unchanged and has been the subject of previous consideration, both as to its appearance in s 9(2) and in the use of the same expression of the level of satisfaction in s 17(2) (which relates to the determination of applications for continuing detentions orders). It has been held that it constitutes a standard of proof which is higher than the civil standard but lower than the criminal standard: see, for example, Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWSC 605 per Bell J at [27]; Cornwall v Attorney General for New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 374 at [21]. 

[15] A seemingly important matter in considering the new ""unacceptable risk"" test is the simultaneous insertion in s 9 of sub-s 2A. It is in the following terms: 

(2A) The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence. 

[16] That provision, to my mind, is an indication by the legislature that the risk of the person committing a serious sex offence does not need to be more likely than not before it can be regarded as an unacceptable risk. Put another way, the risk may be less likely than not but still be an unacceptable risk. 

... 

[19] One matter that should be borne in mind in considering the new ""unacceptable risk"" test is the objects of the Act set out in s 3 of the Act. That section is in the following terms: 

(1) The primary object of this Act is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of serious sex offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community. 

(2) Another object of this Act is to encourage serious sex offenders to undertake rehabilitation. 

[20] Whilst bearing in mind the second of those two objects, I would regard the test in s 9(2) as being satisfied if there is a risk that the person will commit a serious sex offence which is present to a sufficient degree so that the safety and protection of the community cannot be ensured unless an order is made.

33In addition, the Defendant has been involved in 7 other events between April and September 2001 as follows: 

a. 30 April 2001: Mr Richardson barricaded his cell door and set fire to his cell in a self-harm attempt. Mr Richardson was armed with a gaol made knife. He was unconscious when staff breached the barricade and removed him from the cell. 

b. 1 May 2001: Corrective Services staff used force to restrain Mr Richardson after he picked up a plastic chair and raised it above his head threatening staff during a Risk Intervention Team meeting. 

c. 5 May 2001: Mr Richardson attempted to self-harm by tying two socks together and hanging himself. 

d. 28 May 2001: Mr Richardson scaled an internal fence and when approached by staff became aggressive and force was used to restrain him and remove him from the area. 

e. 6 June 2001: Mr Richardson picked up a plastic packing tub used for inmate property and hit an officer on the side of the head with the tub. Force was used to restrain Mr Richardson. 

f. 13 June 2001: Corrective Services staff used force to restrain Mr Richardson after he refused to hand over contraband prior to an escort. 

g. 24 June 2001: Corrective Services staff used force to restrain Mr Richardson after he abused and threatened staff and failed to comply with a reasonable direction. 

It was these events that contributed to his placement in HRMCC. 

34Apart from the breach of discipline of 18 May 2004 (the first matter in the above table), the more controlled environment of HRMCC appears to have led to a modification of his behaviour towards other people, and he has had no other breaches of prison discipline. 

35Whilst in prison the Defendant undertook a number of courses to deal with his problems. These included Positive Lifestyle (2005-2007), Anger Management (2007-2008) and Life Changes When We Change (2008 to the present). He did not complete the last of these because he was transferred from HRMCC. He took a long time to complete the other 2 programs - 22 months to complete the 10 sessions for Positive Lifestyle and 11 months to complete Anger Management. 

36Although the Defendant expressed an interest in participating in a sex offender treatment program in late 2002 he did not ultimately consent to a referral to any of the available sex offender treatment programs. In fact, he signed a non-consent form in relation to the CUBIT (Custody-Based Intensive Treatment) program on 13 May 2003. 

37There was an issue in the proceedings about why the Defendant had not undertaken a sex offender treatment program. The Plaintiff maintained that it was because he simply refused to undertake the programs. The Defendant, on the other hand, maintained that some at least of the programs were not available to him at HRMCC. Other evidence suggested that he declined to participate either because he said he did not commit the offences for which he was convicted or that he had no memory of doing so. Another reason offered was that he did not desire to revisit that part of his life where he had committed the offences because it raised confusing and negative feelings about himself. 

Expert assessments of the Defendant 

38The Defendant was assessed by Professor James Ogloff, a clinical and forensic psychologist who has a speciality in the area of adult offenders including sexual offenders. Professor Ogloff saw the Defendant on 6 August 2010 for the purposes of an assessment of the likelihood of the Defendant committing a further serious sexual offence under the terms of the Act. 

39Professor Ogloff provided a very detailed and comprehensive report which included a review of a number of files pertaining to the Defendant, and he took a detailed history from the Defendant. It is important to set out that section of Professor Ogloff's report concerning the Defendant's sexual history and behaviour. 

Despite the fact that Mr. Richardson has been convicted of two counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent and one count of attempted murder related to these offences, very little is known about his sexual history and behaviour. I reviewed this history with him in some detail using the Sone Sexual History Background Form. Mr. Richardson was generally not forthcoming in providing information related to his sexual history and behaviour. 

Mr. Richardson reported to me that he obtained most of his sexual information as a child from school. He said that sex was not discussed in his home with his parents or siblings. Mr. Richardson reported to me that he first began to understand about sex when he was approximately 10 years old. He recalled engaging in mutual kissing and touching with a girl when he was 10 years old. He stated that he was never caught or punished for sexual activities as a child. 

Mr. Richardson reported that he was sexually abused by two people on three occasions when he was nine years old. He said a school teacher and nurse abused him and filmed the abuse. They told him to do sexual things which they filmed. In my reading of his file material, Mr. Richardson had reported other incidents of sexual abuse at the hands of his mother's best friend when he was a child; however, he did not mention that experience on this occasion. Similarly, the abuse he reported at interview does not seem to have been recorded elsewhere in his file. 

He recalled that his first experience with masturbation occurred when he was 12 years old and was in custody. He reported having his first experience with intercourse when he was approximately 14.5 years old and the girl was 15 years old. His memory of the experience is positive. 

Mr. Richardson reports being strictly heterosexual. He recalled that he has had sexual relationships with approximately eight females; four before age 18 years and four after. He denied ever having had sex with prostitutes. Mr. Richardson reported that he and his partners have found their sexual experiences pleasurable. 

Although Mr. Richardson reported masturbating approximately three times per week, he became angry when asked about the kinds of fantasies he had, stating that the question was ""too personal."" While this is understandable, it is unfortunate since a central part of treatment for sexual offenders is to be able to discuss such matters with treatment providers in order to determine whether there is any sexual deviance present and to assist them in learning to control any deviant sexual arousal. 

Mr. Richardson denies engaging in any sexual behaviour with other prisoners noting that he is strictly heterosexual. 

40Professor Ogloff was unable to obtain any detailed information from the Defendant about the index offences because the Defendant claimed not to have any memory of the event. He said only that he remembered meeting the victim and believed that she looked older than 18 years. He also told Professor Ogloff that at the time of the offence, he had taken approximately 30 Valium tablets, as well as LSD and cannabis. 

41Professor Ogloff went through matters in the judge's Remarks on Sentence. The Defendant's response was ""now I believe I would have caused her a great deal of pain"". He said that he could not believe he actually did what the judge recorded since the behaviour described ""disgusts me"" and was out of character. 

42Professor Ogloff set out 4 detailed reasons why he believed that the Defendant's claimed memory loss for the index offences was most likely feigned. These reasons included the fact that he gave an account of events to the Police the following day, his responses on psychometric testing and the fact that he claimed not to have certain recall but total memory loss. 

43Professor Ogloff then turned to consider the risk of sexual re-offending and did so with reference to 2 instruments known as Static 99 and Risk for Sexual Violence Protocol (RSVP). Before doing so he sounded this caution: 

It is important to note that whilst the category of risk can be identified with some accuracy, we are still not at the stage where it is possible to determine with a high degree of accuracy precisely what an individual's likelihood of being violent or reoffending sexually is. Moreover, the risk assessment schemes that have been developed and validated have been done so overseas and relatively little is known about exactly how valid the instruments are in the Australian context. Taken together, the following information will provide a general indication of the category of risk for sexual offending in which Mr. Richardson is likely to fall. 

44Static 99 is an instrument that was developed using a purely actuarial approach. It was initially developed in 1999 based on follow up studies from Canada and the United Kingdom. Subsequently there have been 2 additional measures of Static 99 being Static 2002 and more recently Static 99-R. 

45The instrument consists of 10 items and produces estimates of future risk based upon the number of risk factors present in any one individual. The risk factors are these: 

(1) young; 

(2) ever lived with intimate partner for 2 years; 

(3) index non-sexual violence; 

(4) prior non-sexual violence - any convictions; 

(5) prior sex offences; 

(6) prior sentencing dates; 

(7) any convictions for non-contact sex offences; 

(8) any unrelated victims; 

(9) any stranger victims; and 

(10) any male victims. 


46In respect of these items the Defendant scored having non-sexual violence as part of the index conviction, having prior non-sexual violence convictions, having more than 4 prior sentencing dates, never having lived with a partner continuously for at least 2 years, having unrelated victims, and having stranger victims. Although under Static 99 the Defendant would have scored for his age Static 99-R reduces that score because the Defendant is now aged between 40 and 60 years. The end result is that the Defendant's category of risk is in the moderate to high range. 
47Professor Ogloff said that the result obtained by the Defendant's category of risk is in the moderate to high range. Professor Ogloff said that the results obtained by the Defendant indicate that his level of risk for re-offending is approximately twice the base rate for sexual offending in the samples upon which Static 99 was validated. He belongs to a group with an average sexual recidivism rate of 33% over 5 years in the population studied, 38% over 10 years, and 40% over 15 years. Professor Ogloff acknowledged that limited validation data are available in Australia but, because Static 99 demonstrates consistent results in Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and other countries, one can have confidence that the results would at least be similar in New South Wales. 

48Professor Ogloff noted that Static 99 was developed to identify the static or historical factors that have been found to relate to a risk of re-offending. The instrument is limited in scope to past risk factors and does not take into account changes to risk that may occur over time. The measure cannot assess dynamic or changeable factors. 

49In his oral evidence Professor Ogloff said that in follow-up studies of people who had scored equally to the Defendant, about 60% had not re-offended sexually after 15 years. 

50Because of the limitations of Static 99 Professor Ogloff considered an additional, more comprehensive evaluation of the Defendant's level of risk for sexual offending - the protocol known as RSVP. 

51RSVP is a structured professional judgment instrument that includes both static and dynamic factors that have been associated with the risk of future sexual violence. It consists of 5 categories of risk factors: 

(A) sexual violence history, 

(B) psychological adjustment, 

(C) mental disorder, 

(D) social adjustment, and 

(E) manageability. 

52The items are considered from three perspectives, past, present and future. Professor Ogloff said it was difficult to evaluate the Defendant on the RSVP since the instrument requires considerable information from the past and more recently regarding an individual's thoughts and behaviours pertaining to sexual offending. Because the Defendant claimed no memory for the offence, he could not enlighten Professor Ogloff about some of the matters in the RSVP. Further, because he refused to discuss the nature of his sexual fantasies assessment was made more difficult. Nevertheless, Professor Ogloff thought that most of the information required for completion of RSVP was available to him. 

53Professor Ogloff assessed the Defendant as follows: 

A. Sexual violence history 

The Defendant presented risk factors consistent with 2 of 5 items on this part of the Protocol - he used both physical and psychological coercion in effecting his sexual offence. In his favour, his sexual violent offending had not been chronic over time, he had not engaged in a diversity of sexually violent behaviours, and there was no evidence that his sexual offending escalated over time. 

B. Psychological adjustment 

The Defendant possessed 3 of the 5 of the risk factors in this section, being problems with self awareness, problems with stress or coping, and problems resulting from child abuse. In his favour he did not appear to hold attitudes that supported or condoned sexual violence and, although he claimed no memory for what he did, he did not minimise or deny the degree of sexual violence. 

C. Mental disorder 

The Defendant exhibited 4 of the 5 risk factors from this section. He had a major mental illness being schizophrenia. He also suffered from a psychopathic personality disorder. He had problems with substance abuse, and he experienced violent and suicidal ideation on many occasions. I shall discuss in greater detail below the diagnoses of these mental disorders. Professor Ogloff said it was impossible to ascertain information about the fifth factor in this section of the Protocol, that being whether the Defendant had a sexual deviation. This was because of his claimed lack of memory for the offences and his refusal to discuss his sexual fantasies. I shall return to a discussion of this later in the judgment. 

D. Social adjustment 

This area includes 4 risk factors, all of which are relevant to the Defendant. They are problems with intimate relationships, problems with non-intimate relationships, problems with employment, and non-sexual criminality. 

E. Manageability 

Again, the Defendant demonstrated difficulties with all 3 risk factors in this area both prior to and during his incarceration. They are problems with planning, problems with treatment, and problems with supervision. In relation to planning Professor Ogloff noted that he is still occasionally driven by impulse, that he had difficulty internalising and benefiting from treatment programs, and had not participated in intensive programs aimed toward reducing his risk of sexual offending. 

54Professor Ogloff's conclusion from the risk factors on the RSVP suggested to him that the Defendant had a moderate to high level of risk for sexual re-offending with many risk factors of each of the 5 sub-categories being present. Given the extreme nature of his offending and the lack of effort to reduce the risk factors, Professor Ogloff had great concern about his likelihood of sexual reoffending. That was particularly so without careful supervision. 

55In his oral evidence Professor Ogloff said that the research shows there is no positive relationship between the presence of schizophrenia and sexual offending per se. He said further that the majority of people with Antisocial Personality Disorders and even psychopathy do not offend sexually, and that most sex offenders did not have those disorders. However, there is a modest correlation between those behaviours of around .2 to .25 indicating that individuals with those personality features and behaviours do have a higher risk. 

56When considering section (C) of the Protocol Professor Ogloff had concluded that the Defendant suffered from a Psychopathic Personality Disorder. Professor Ogloff said that such a diagnosis, taken alone, was not particularly informative or helpful in determining a person's level of risk for future violence. For that reason, he administered the Psychopathy Checklist Revised (PCL-R) to the Defendant. 

57Unlike Antisocial Personality Disorder Professor Ogloff said that the construct of psychopathy consists of 2 separate factors. The first assesses personality characteristics of psychopathy (interpersonal features and affective or expressed emotion features) and the second assesses the behavioural components of psychopathy, and is more akin to Antisocial Personality Disorder. Generally speaking, he said, higher scores on the PCL-R are predictive of future offending and sexual offending. 

58Professor Ogloff found that the Defendant's overall score on the PCL-R fell at the lower end of the high range, indicating that he demonstrated most of the personality traits and behaviours associated with psychopathy. Such a finding indicated that all other things being equal the Defendant's level of risk for re-offending violently and sexually was greater than would be the case for someone with lower scores on the PCL-R. That is because individuals with characteristics of psychopathy such as those which the Defendant possesses do not have the capacity to inhibit their behaviour with the normal personality features that inhibit others (e.g., remorse, empathy and compassion). 

59Professor Ogloff also used a Protocol known as HCR-20 to determine the Defendant's overall level of risk for violent offending. Professor Ogloff said that HCR-20 indicated that the Defendant was at a high level of risk for re-offending violently in the future. Other evidence in the proceedings might tend to support Professor Ogloff's conclusions in that regard and I shall mention them later. 

60Professor Ogloff's conclusions were these: 

1. It is my opinion that Mr. Richardson presents a moderate-high risk for reoffending sexually in the future if he is not made subject to an order under the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act, 2006. 

2. Given Mr. Richardson's level of instability and lack of treatment, it is my opinion further that his level of risk could not be adequately managed by an extended supervision order at this time. 

3. Based on his pattern of offending and related factors, it is my opinion that Mr. Richardson also presents a high risk of reoffending violently. 

4. Mr. Richardson requires a trial of intensive treatment for violence and sexual offending to determine how he will respond to such treatment. The treatment should be tailored to his individual situation and needs. In particular, it must be behaviourally oriented and gradual in nature. 

5. Mr. Richardson requires continuing psychiatric care to assist him with his psychotic illness. 

6. If Mr. Richardson is ever to have a reasonable hope of being released to the community, very careful attention will be required in the provision of treatment, supervision and planning over time. This would best be done by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in the psychological and psychiatric management of this man, in addition to the security precautions required. 

7. Mr. Richardson could also benefit from treatment around his potential substance use, although he appears to have been able to control substances over the many years during which he has been incarcerated. 


Psychiatric matters 

61Pursuant to orders that I made on 17 December 2010 the Defendant was examined by 2 psychiatrists, Dr Andrew Ellis and Dr Samson Roberts. Both psychiatrists diagnosed the Defendant as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, antisocial personality disorder, and alcohol and cannabis dependence. In addition, Dr Samson diagnosed him with Benzodiazepine d ependence. 

62In relation to the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, this was first diagnosed by psychiatrists from Justice Health from about 2004. However, prior to that time he had been admitted to the D Ward of Long Bay Prison Hospital in January 1995 where he had been diagnosed with personality disorder with antisocial and schizotypal traits and depression. Further, in 2001 he was admitted because of a psychotic episode where he described an angel talking to him. 

63Dr Ellis also noted that symptoms of delusions, hallucinations and functional impairment appear to have preceded the formal diagnosis of schizophrenia . In that regard he noted that there were records of references to voices and demons going back to parole records from Victoria. 

64The Defendant appears first to have been seen by a psychiatrist, Dr Saunders when he was at Travancore in July 1982. In his remarks on sentence Newman J noted that Dr Saunders found him at that stage to be of average intellectual potential but to be functioning in the dull normal range with marked learning disorders. His academic skills were rudimentary. Dr Saunders observed that his personality assessment indicated repression and denial as defences of a psychoneurotic disorder, tending to disassociate into a borderline state under severe stress. There were features of depression present. 

65Newman J also referred to the Defendant having seen a psychiatrist Dr Jurek in October and November 1995. She took a history of the Defendant using Valium, up to thirty tablets in a day. The Defendant also told Dr Jurek of spirits speaking to him. Dr Jurek had a guarded view about that history. She said his internal voices could possibly be seen as adaptive because he was a very isolated individual. H er alternative view was that the voices might be symptomatic of an underlying psychosis. She diagnosed him as having a personality disorder with underlying and borderline psychotic features and noted that he had chronic substance abuse involving alcohol and other drugs. 

66The oral evidence of Drs Ellis and Roberts (who gave their evidence concurrently) suggested that they both accepted that the Defendant had an undiagnosed schizophrenia in his late teenage years and certainly into his twenties. 

67As far as substance abuse was concerned Dr Ellis noted that the Defendant commenced drinking alcohol from the age of 14. He described his heaviest use between the ages of 17 and 21 when he would binge drink on a weekly basis and consume two bottles of spirits in a sitting. He frequently described ""blackouts"" where he could recall events while he had been drinking. 

68He also told Dr Ellis that he started smoking cannabis at the age of 12 and reported that his heaviest use was between the ages of 15 and 18 where he would consume 12 cones of marijuana each day. He said that the cannabis had no deleterious effects on him, but relaxed him and gave him a ""heightened awareness"". By contrast, he told Dr Roberts that he used to consume thirty to forty cones per day although he also described a heightened sense of awareness from doing so. 

69He also reported to having consumed magic mushrooms on 4 occasions and that when he had done this it made him paranoid. Significantly, he reported that he took LSD for the first time on the night of the index offences. 

70As he had told Dr Jurek in 1995, he also told Dr Ellis and Dr Roberts that he was taking 30 tablets of Valium a day for a 5- year period prior to being sentenced for the index offences. 

71Dr Ellis reported the following about the Defendant's psychosexual history: 

He describes learning about sex from education classes at school and from talking with school friends. He reports that he stole his father's pornographic magazines and looked at them. He reports that his parents never spoke to him about sex. He reports that as a teenager he would masturbate 2-3 times each week, often to the images in the magazines which were all naked adult women. He reported his first sexual intercourse was at the age of 14 . He estimates that he has had 40 different sexual partners who have all been women. He identifies as exclusively heterosexual. He expressed offence when the possibility of sexual encounters with men was suggested. He estimates the age range of his partners as between 16 and 37. 

He denies ever experiencing sexual dysfunction, and described that he did not usually have sex when intoxicated with alcohol. He has not contracted a sexually transmitted disease. He denied any behaviour, desire or fantasy consistent with a paraphilia. He denied ever viewing or masturbating to pornography as an adult. 

72In relation to the index offences the Defendant said he was drinking with some associates in the park. They were drinking tequila and port. He had taken 30 Valium tablets that day, and one of the associates offered him LSD which he took. He claimed not to have any accessible memory after walking away from the people with whom he was drinking. I note that this is to be contrasted with what he told Professor Ogloff (see para 40 above). 

73In relation to the victim statement he said he ""can't believe it's me"" and ""I have never done anything like it before in my life"". Dr Roberts reported similar sentiments being expressed by the Defendant. 

74In relation to Dr Ellis's diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder, he thought that the personality problems emerged prior to the onset of psychotic symptoms. He said that the personality style was pervasive and chronic but it might ameliorate over decades with maturity, and possibly with learning improved communication skills and emotional control. He noted that the Defendant had difficulty expressing remorse, and accepting responsibility for his actions, and that he had historically displayed impulsive aggression. 

75Although Dr Ellis did not diagnose a psychopathic personality disorder he assessed the Defendant using the PCL-R that had been used by Professor Ogloff. Dr Ellis said although psychopathy is not a psychiatric diagnosis there is considerable overlap between psychopathy and Antisocial Personality Disorder. High scores on this Check List are associated with general and violent recidivism and are modestly correlated with sexual recidivism. The Defendant scored 25 which is considerably higher than the general population. However, it is only scores of over 25 for UK samples and scores over 30 for North American samples that are considered to be associated with a psychopathic personality. 

76Similarly, in this regard, Dr Roberts diagnosed Antisocial Personality Disorder including narcissistic traits but said i t was not possible to conclude upon a formal diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder in accordance with DSM-IV criteria. Although he mentioned that the Defendant spoke of violence towards others without compunction and noted that he had engaged in such violence with apparent disregard for consequences, Dr Roberts did not discuss or determine a diagnosis of Psychopathic Personality Disorder. Regrettably, nothing was directed in cross-examination to these expert witnesses, including Professor Ogloff, about that difference in diagnoses and whether it was significant. 

77Dr Ellis, like Professor Ogloff, assessed the Defendant under Static 99 instrument. He expressed qualifications about reliance on it in some similar terms to Professor Ogloff as well as for some additional reasons. Like Professor Ogloff he said that it was an a ctuarial measure which was able to allocate individuals with particular characteristics to risk groups that have been identified as possessing greater or lesser numbers of persons within the group as re-offending. The difficulty, he said, was t hat it does not discriminate between those in a particular risk group who do re-offend and those who do not. 

78The additional matters that he referred to were these. He said that the original sample used to form recidivism rates with the Static 99 was collected at a time when general crime rates, including sexual offending rates, were higher than at present. He said the confidence intervals for the moderate high-risk group on the old sample group crossed that of the moderate- low risk group. 

79He made reference to Static 99-R which has been updated with new populations that may better reflect current re-offending patterns. However, data regarding confidence intervals for this new sample has yet to be published, and 15-year recidivism data are not available. The characteristics of the ""high risk"" group are yet to be defined in detail, and he said that it maybe the Defendant was closer in characteristics to that group. He said m ore peer-reviewed publication was required on the new sample before the group characteristics could be reliably applied to individuals. 

80Dr Ellis's scoring differed from that of Professor Ogloff in relation to one item. The history that Dr Ellis obtained both at interview, and in a parole report for the Defendant in 1998 indicated that the Defendant had lived with the same partner (Ms Peters) for more than 2 years. If that was correct it would decrease the score by one point although it did not change his risk category of moderate-high. It did change the statistical group for the purpose of relative risk and confidence intervals. 

81Dr Ellis then went on to discuss clinical considerations in regard to risk of re-offending. Those included sexual deviance, personality factors, substance dependence, mental illness and treatment setting. He noted that d eviant sexual arousal was consistently identified as a risk factor for sexual re-offence. He said that the Defendant did not describe a history consistent with d eviant sexual arousal, but his assessment at interview was marked by suspicion and evasiveness. There was, however, no notation in the extensive records Dr Ellis saw to suggest behaviour or statements made that indicated deviant arousal or paraphilia. 

82He told Dr Roberts that he was heterosexual with no homosexual or paedophilic tendencies. He said he had never engaged in violence or bondage within consensual relationships and had not used pornography. When Dr Roberts asked him regarding sexual fantasies the Defendant said he was disgusted at being asked such a question but said that violence did not form a part of his fantasies. 

83Dr Ellis said that antisocial personality orientation was another factor consistently identified with sexual re-offence. It was in the context of discussing the relationship between personality disorders and re-offending that Dr Ellis made reference to the PCL-R. 

84He said substance use disorders were less consistently related to sexual re-offending but he thought in the Defendant's case they were related as disinhibiting behaviour. Although he had been abstinent for a significant period in prison, he had not undertaken substance use treatment programs despite previous heavy use and he displayed poor insight into previous use. 

85Dr Ellis said that Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia were less consistently related to repeat sexual offending although the symptoms of the disorder could contribute to disinhibition. Untreated psychosis might predispose to substance use relapse, furthering impulsive and aggressive decision-making. Dr Ellis noted that the index offences occurred in the context of untreated mental illness and intoxication and that their description indicated a lack of planning but impulsive, aggressive and disorganized behaviour. 

86In considering actuarial and clinical parameters in the absence of any treatment or supervision Dr Ellis concluded that the Defendant would fall into a group of persons with a risk of offending that was moderately high and greater than a theoretical average offender. 

87Dr Ellis thought that the Defendant would be found to be a ""mentally ill person"". If he was detained under the Mental Health Act 2007 in a secure forensic hospital his risk of commission of a further serous sexual offence would be low because he would be in a controlled environment with access to potential victims limited. 

88Dr Roberts listed 9 factors which he considered relevant to the Defendant's risk of committing further serious sex offences. These were: 

1. Treatment Resistant Paranoid Schizophrenia. 

2. A Psychopathic Personality Construct as stipulated in Professor Ogloff's report or a DSM-IV TR classification of Antisocial Personality Disorder and Narcissistic Personality traits. 

3. Substance Abuse and Substance Dependence. 

4. Insightlessness into the conditions stated above or the need for treatment. 

5. An unrealistically optimistic outlook on the future. 

6. Absence of any supports in the community. 

7. A broad history of criminal behaviour including violent offending and an index offence including repeated sexual assault and attempted murder. 

8. A propensity to externalize responsibility before the offending behaviour. 

9. An apparent absence of motivation to access support or seek therapeutic intervention aimed at addressing all the issues listed above. 

89Dr Roberts' conclusion was that by reason of the combination of those factors and, having regard for the actuarial assessments in the material he had seen, he considered it apparent that the Defendant represented an extremely high risk of general re-offending and violent re-offending and a high risk of a further opportunistic sexual offence or a violent offence taking on a sexual component. He said that the available information did not permit the diagnosis of a Paraphilia - namely that the Defendant did not fulfil criteria suggesting he had an aberrant sex drive. Dr Roberts said that the available information indicates that the offence was opportunistic in nature. 

Is there an ""unacceptable risk""? 

90Two things seem to me significant when assessing the evidence and the likelihood of re-offending. The first is the higher standard of proof imposed by the words ""a high degree of probability"". The second is the notion that ""unacceptable risk"" involves a balancing exercise between the commission of a serious sexual offence and the likelihood of that risk coming to fruition on the one hand, and the serious consequences for the Defendant either because he will be detained beyond the period of his sentence although he has not committed any further offence or he will be subject to an onerous supervision order, on the other hand. It is because of that balancing exercise that it is open to the Court to be satisfied to a high degree of probability that there is an unacceptable risk but that the result of that finding (either a continuing detention order or a supervision order) may vary in a given situation. That is also because s 17(3) provides for the further assessment that if the Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk a supervision order will not be adequate to meet the risk. 

91Two things appear to me to emerge fairly clearly from the evidence of the psychiatrists and Professor Ogloff. The first is that the likelihood of re-offending by the Defendant derives from his personality disorder rather than the other conditions or disorders from which he suffers including his schizophrenia and substance abuse. The second thing is that whilst a good deal of the material points to likelihood of further violent offending, it only points to further sexual offending in an opportunistic way as the development from an offence of violence. This appears to be the precise course of events in relation to the index offences. 

92On the whole of the evidence, but particularly having regard to the opinions of Professor Ogloff, Dr Ellis and Dr Roberts, I am satisfied to a high degree of probability that the Defendant poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision. On both of the Instruments that provide a statistical basis for the risk of re-offending, the Defendant scores in the moderate to high level of risk of re-offending. Further, all of the experts were agreed that there is a high risk of further violent offending. Support for that is also to be found in statements that have been made by the Defendant to various witnesses who assessed him within the prison system. The Defendant demonstrated grudges against those whom he perceived were responsible for his treatment and things that had happened to him within the prison system. 

93Of course, the legislation is not directed to supervising persons who are likely to commit further violent offences. The relevance of that threat of further violence by the Defendant is, according to the experts, the risk of a further sexual offence that is committed in an opportunistic way associated with a further offence of violence in a similar manner to the sex offences that formed part of the index offences. Those similar offences were so violent and so gratuitous that, in accepting the relationship between violence and sex offences expressed by the experts, I find that the Defendant poses an unacceptable risk in that way of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision. The experts point to a number of things to justify the conclusion of a risk of opportunistic sexual offending including lack of impulsivity control and lack of empathy to his victims. 

94I do not find that it is more likely than that that he will commit a further serious sex offence, but sub-s (3A) makes it unnecessary to find that it is more likely than not that he will do so before conclusion can be reached that he poses an unacceptable risk. Indeed, for reasons I will discuss, I think the likelihood of the Defendant committing a further serious sex offence is low but that the risk remains unacceptable: Thomas at [16]. 

What order should be made? 

95A good deal of time in the case was taken up with issues concerning programs that might be undertaken by the Defendant if he was subject to a continuing detention order. Some of this evidence was directed to exploring why the Defendant had not undertaken sex offender programs whilst in prison. The reasons for his not doing so seem to me to be of secondary relevance. The fact is that he did not complete them either because he was not prepared to do so or because, in any event, he never progressed beyond Level 3.3 in the Behaviour Management Levels that would have enabled him to move from the HRMCC where it was not possible to participate in such programs. 

96Whilst s 3(2) of the Act has as one of its objects the encouragement of serious sex offenders to undertake rehabilitation, I agree with what is implicit in RA Hulme J's analysis of the objects in Thomas that that is the secondary object and that the primary purpose of the Act is to ensure the safety and protection of the community. 

97In the first instance, it seems to me, the Defendant declined to participate in the programs because he did not see himself as a sex offender. That appears, in particular, from responses he made to the experts who examined him where he said that he could not believe that he had done the things about which he was found guilty. However, it also appears to be the case that even if he had been willing to participate he would not have been able to do so because of his classification and location within the prison system. His unwillingness to participate is a matter I have taken into account in reaching the conclusion that he poses an unacceptable risk of committing a further serious sex offence. 

98The other significant issue in relation to the various sex offender programs concerns the suitability of the Defendant to participate in those programs bearing in mind the various diagnoses of psychiatric illness that the experts are agreed upon, and the claimed lack of memory about the index offences. 

99When asked to consider the suitability of the CUBIT program Dr Roberts said this: 

Even if you assumed that the psychosis is well treated, it would not be considered best practice for that mode of treatment to be used with him, although it would have some utility, but it would not be primarily used if you were directing the treatment approach. 

Dr Ellis said this: 

Can I add to that. It would generally be considered that to engage in therapy around an event, even in general terms, Mr Richardson aside, but to suggest that someone should embark on a course of therapy, to address an issue that the person cannot even recall - to be polite - would be an act of futility. It would be really quite ridiculous, but to someone to embark on therapy to counsel someone on an issue that they cannot recall, is a pointless exercise. 

100Professor Ogloff also agreed that a significant aspect of programs like PREP, CORE AND CUBIT includes modules dealing with victim empathy, and that because individuals like the Defendant lack empathy and remorse in a way that seems intractable, those modules would be less effective for somebody like the Defendant. Professor Ogloff also agreed that if a person could not remember the circumstances of the offences then certain elements of the treatment were futile. He thought his psychotic illness would have to be stabilised before he would receive any benefit from the treatment programs. He thought the likelihood of getting him into the CUBIT program was very slim, and his view was that he would not put him in a group setting to treat him. 

101Evidence was also given by Jayson Ware, a registered psychologist who was the Acting Executive Director of the Offender Services and Programs for the Department of Corrective Services. He agreed that it would be necessary to stabilise the Defendant in terms of his schizophrenia before he could be put in the CUBIT Program. He agreed with Dr Ellis that one would not recommend a group program for someone who had schizophrenia unless they were in a very stable stage of it. 

102Mr Ware also highlighted the individualised intervention (as he described it) of the Corrective Services programs including CUBIT which he said continued throughout the entire treatment plan. Although I found Mr Ware to be an impressive witness who clearly understood the various programs and the benefits they could offer, he volunteered, when disagreeing with some evidence from Dr Ellis, that he had not personally assessed the Defendant. For that reason, I did not find his evidence to be as useful as the evidence provided by Dr Ellis, Dr Roberts, and Professor Ogloff. 

103Evidence was also given by Naomi Prince, a registered psychologist, who is the Acting Team Leader of the Personality and Behavioural Disorders Unit (PBDU) with Corrective Services. She, like Mr Ware, had not assessed the Defendant. She explained in her affidavit about the PBDU, and that it had been requested to develop an intervention plan to assist the Defendant to progress through the correctional system with the goal of entering CUBIT. She thought that a period of 9 to 15 months would be necessary before he would be able to enter CUBIT. This would involve the reclassification of the Defendant to enable him to move from the HRMCC. That in turn was said to be a stepwise progression based on the combined approach of ongoing psychiatric care and behavioural interventions. I note in this regard that the Defendant had not managed to achieve the appropriate classification to enable a move from HMRCC in the 9 years that he was there. 

104Ms Prince accepted in cross-examination that until the Mental Health Team decided that the Defendant was able to work with Ms Prince's team she would not be able to proceed with what she proposed. 

105Dr Roberts was asked when preparing his report to outline from a psychiatric perspective the merit or otherwise of the plan outlined by Ms Prince and Mr Ware. Dr Roberts said that the prospect of successful rehabilitation during the period of ongoing incarceration, where attempts over the past 16 years of engaging the Defendant in treatment had failed, appears bleak. He said that psychological intervention was likely to prove futile. This was because the Defendant lacked insight into his need for treatment and coerced psychological treatment was unlikely to yield a positive outcome. He did say, however, that a further period of incarceration would facilitate definitive treatment of the Defendant's psychotic illness. That cannot be a proper basis, of itself, for incarcerating the Defendant further. 

106This evidence concerning the programs offered by the Department of Corrective Services was particularly significant when considering the issue of whether the result of my finding that the Defendant poses an unacceptable risk of committing a further serious sex offence should be a continuing detention order or an extended supervision order. I am not persuaded on the balance of probabilities that if the Defendant was required to participate in these programs whilst detained in custody the programs would be likely to be successful in reducing the risk that the Defendant poses in terms of the commission of a further serious sex offence. Dr Ellis stressed that it was the personality disorder that would most likely have contributed to the sexual offences as it occurred in the index offences, and that the timeline for dealing with the personality disorder (the impulsivity, the lack of empathy etc) would be in the order of a decade. Dr Roberts seemed to have a similar view. Like Dr Ellis, he considered that the psychotic illness had to be treated first, but he did not think that the success of treatment of the personality disorder could be reasonably predicted. 

107Mr Hans Ellfeldt, a clinical advisor for the Violent Offender Programs with Corrective Services, and also a registered psychologist, also considered that there was a great deal of uncertainty about whether the Defendant could participate in general inmate joint therapeutic programs of an intensive nature. Given the doubts expressed by the psychiatrists and psychologists, it is doubtful if the other object of the Act referred to in s 3(2) (to encourage serious sex offenders to undertake rehabilitation) would be achieved by making a continuing detention order. 

108There are other matters which need to be balanced in terms of what was said by Steytler P and Buss JA in GTR about the unacceptable nature of the risk to determine the appropriate order. First, the only sex offences with which the Defendant has been charged or convicted were the sex offences in the index offences. Secondly, his criminal record only contains one other offence of violence some 6 years before the index offences when he was convicted and sentenced to 3 months imprisonment for intentionally causing injury. Both the charge itself and the sentence he received suggest that the offence could be regarded as one of low level. 

109Thirdly, it now seems clear that, although there was only that offence and the index offences which make up his record of violence and sexual offences, he was at the time suffering from the personality disorders, he had an undiagnosed schizophrenia, and he was abusing alcohol and other substances to a marked extent. One might reasonably have expected other sexual offences and, certainly, more offences of violence throughout that time, particularly when he was in his late teens and early twenties. That provides some basis for thinking that if there is further offending of any sort it will be rare. 

110Fourthly, the Defendant does not appear to exhibit any symptoms of an identifiable Paraphilia or sexual deviancy. I accept that those who examined him could not reach a final view about that matter because of the reluctance of the Defendant to speak freely about matters concerning his sexual life and fantasies. Nevertheless, there is almost nothing in any of the material from the Department of Corrective Services or Justice Health that indicates any particular interest in sexual matters by the Defendant. The Crown was able to identify only one entry in the prison records of a reference to sex by the Defendant. This appeared in the progress notes of Vicky Walcott, a counsellor at the HRMCC. On 13 August 2002 the Defendant was telling her about a male voice that he hears in his head, and he told her that it made him think thoughts he had not wanted to think about for many years. She recorded: 

Craig said ""They made me think of sexual assault things and sex"". Craig had a half- smile on his face when he said the word sex. 

111On the other hand, the Defendant freely expressed thoughts of violence to those who dealt with him within the prison system, and in some cases identified the persons against whom he wished to perpetrate that violence. That provides some basis for the view that the Defendant made almost no mention of sexual matters not because he was deliberately suppressing those thoughts from those he dealt with, but because he, in fact, has no Paraphilia or sexual deviance. 

112Professor Ogloff makes the point, which I accept, that most men who offend against adults by rape or other sexual assaulting behaviour do not have a Paraphilia of sadism or a sexual deviance. Nevertheless, where such matters are predictors of further sexual offending, and where the Defendant has expressed violent thoughts but not sexually violent thoughts, the absence of Paraphilia and a sexual deviance is a matter to be taken into account, and one which assists the view that the likelihood of further offending is low even though he presents an unacceptable risk. 

113To keep somebody incarcerated because they might commit another offence at some time in the future is a very serious matter. Although it can be accepted that the legislation under consideration was designed particularly for repeat offenders and, in particular, for repeat offenders who could be regarded as paedophiles, the legislation is clearly capable of applying to somebody in the position of the Defendant. Because it is such a serious matter to incarcerate someone against the possibility of committing a future offence, the level of satisfaction before that can be done must be to a high degree of probability. 

114The Plaintiff argues that adequate supervision would not be provided by an extended supervision order. It points to 3 matters in particular, in addition to the matters referred to in s 17(4), which have been considered earlier in this judgment. 

115The first is the statement of Professor Ogloff that ""Given Mr. Richardson's level of instability and lack of treatment ... his level of risk could not be adequately managed by an extended supervision order at this time."" Whilst his opinion is entitled to great respect, that opinion is one of a number of factors which I am required to weigh in the balance concerning the appropriate order which should be made. In any event, I would need to be satisfied to a high degree of probability that adequate supervision could not be provided by an extended supervision order. In my view, the ""adequate supervision"" which is referred in the second part of s 17(3) is not supervision that will eliminate the risk of a further serious sex offence but supervision that is reasonably likely to reduce the risk of any further offence. 

116Secondly, the Plaintiff relies on various breaches of parole and other orders to suggest that the Defendant is unlikely to comply with conditions attached to any supervision order. Whilst it can be accepted that the Defendant has breached a number of orders of that type these breaches took place between 1986 and 1990. The last breach was more than 20 years ago. This is a matter to be given minimal weight. 

117Thirdly, the Plaintiff points to concerns of both Dr Ellis and Gavin Rowan, the Senior Compliance and Monitoring Officer with the Community Compliance and Monitoring Group within Corrective Services. In his report of 28 January 2011 Dr Ellis discusses how he believes the Defendant should be treated to address long-term risks. He considers that the Defendant should be treated in a high security forensic hospital without any leave for a 2 year period. He then says that he should be kept for a further 2 years in a medium security forensic hospital where some escorted and then unescorted leave could be given. Only after that period would Dr Ellis recommend a period in the community under supervision. 

118Dr Ellis's reasons for this can be found in the last paragraph of his report as follows: 

He has a history of non-compliance with community parole supervision including non-attendance, drug and alcohol use, itinerancy and attitudes expressed which do not support supervision. He has little practiced [sic] skills to live independently. Without a robust treatment approach beforehand, supervision in the community would likely be fraught with non-compliance with orders, little scope for individual treatment engagement and breaches resulting in return to custody. 

119If the legislation enabled people to be incarcerated beyond a prison term based on risks of further criminal behaviour generally, or further violent behaviour, or further anti-social behaviour, Dr Ellis's views in this regard might have more force. The legislation is concerned only with the unacceptable risk that an offender will commit a further serious sex offence. 

120It seems clear from other portions of Dr Ellis's report that the treatment plan that he details is also concerned with the violent tendencies of the Defendant and his ""repeated threats and history of actual assaults, even within a supervised environment"" (Dr Ellis at p 14). Although I must have regard to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community the issue is whether an extended supervision order will provide adequate supervision against the unacceptable risk of the commission of a further serious sex offence. 

121Mr Rowan raises a number of legitimate concerns based on the material he has seen. Mr Rowan has not met the Defendant but I do not think that his opinions are in any way diminished by that fact. It would be fair to say that, for the most part, the concerns which he expressed in a briefing note to an officer of the Department of Justice and Attorney-General derive from the Defendant's violence issues. Those issues are overlaid by his mental health issues. 

122Mr Rowan expresses a number of concerns about the Defendant accommodating himself to life outside prison and, in particular, outside the high-security prison in which he has lived for a number of years. He identifies the significant problem that, unlike a number of long-term prisoners, the Defendant has not received lower security classifications to ease his return to the community. Those are valid concerns but cannot in themselves provide a reason for continuing to incarcerate the Defendant rather than releasing him on an extended supervision regime. 

123Mr Rowan appeared to assume that the reason particular programs in prison were not undertaken by the Defendant were not undertaken by his choice. He also seemed to assume that the Defendant has not undertaken any therapeutic programs within the custodial setting. He holds the view that if the Defendant does not complete the CUBIT program in custody his risk is considered too high for participation in community sex offender group treatment programs. 

124I have no confidence, based on the evidence of the experts, that the programs which are available within the prison system would be particularly suitable for the Defendant, nor that he would be likely to emerge from the prison system in a state any, or much, different from the state he is now in. Moreover, I have concerns arising from the fact that he never obtained a suitable level of classification whilst in the prison system that enabled him to participate in the programs. If he were put back in the HRMCC the proposed courses would not be available to him. I do not consider that the object of the Act to to encourage serious sex offenders to undertake rehabilitation would be achieved by making a continuing detention order. 

125I do not seek to minimise the concerns that Mr Rowan has expressed and I accept that those concerns go to the issue of whether adequate supervision will be provided by an extended supervision order. However, I note that Mr Rowan says that CCMG officers are trained to deal with high-risk offenders who are subject to supervision in the community, that they assist offenders to reintegrate into the community with the aim of reducing the risk of recidivism, that they assist an offender in areas of health and education and in exploring employment and rehabilitation opportunities, and that they are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with a psychologist on the staff. I note further that the Community Offender Support Program has 2 centres within the Sydney metropolitan area which provides a communal living environment similar to that of a routine gaol wing, and that these centres are staffed by welfare and support staff. 

126Further, although Mr Rowan's primary opinion is that the Defendant should not yet be released into the community in any form, he puts forward a number of highly appropriate conditions that should be attached to the Defendant in the event that he is at some time released. 

127Whilst I am satisfied to a high degree of probability that the Defendant poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision, I am not satisfied to a high degree of probability that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order, particularly bearing in mind the matters I have referred to in paras [108]-[112] above. 
128Whilst bearing in mind the drawbacks of comparing the outcome of cases based on a similarity of some of the facts in each case, I note that in Attorney-General v Fisher [2007] QSC 341 the Defendant was also a person who had been convicted of one serious sexual offence (within the meaning of the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003 (Qld)), although he had also been convicted of an offence of indecent assault which fell outside the definition. He had other convictions for violence, and the psychiatrist thought that further violent offending was likely because of his Anti-Social Personality Disorder and rating on the psychopathy scale. Further, the psychiatrist believed he would only be likely to offend sexually in an opportunistic way arising from the violence. He was a young person with limited insight into his offending and problems. He was rated by the psychiatrists using Static 99 as well as other instruments that assessed dynamic elements in a similar fashion to the RSVP. MacKenzie J considered that in all the circumstances a continuing detention order was not required but that an extended supervision order should be made with a large number of conditions attached to it. 

129It does not seem to me to be without relevance that the Defendant is now 16 years older than he was when he was admitted to prison, being now aged almost 44 years, and recently suffered such a severe heart attack that he was in an induced coma for some days and it was thought he would not survive. Even before that occurred, and for what it is worth, I note that for the 2 days the Defendant attended Court during the hearing of this matter his behaviour could not be faulted. I accept that part of the reason for that may be that he was then compliant with his medication, but I mention it because I do not have any concerns based on the Defendant's behaviour during the hearing. 

130Dr Ellis appeared to accept that scheduling under the Mental Health Act may be the appropriate care for the Defendant at least in the first instance after he is released. I have already mentioned the fact that the Defendant is currently held under the Mental Health Act 2007. The order detaining him has been extended for a 3 month period until September 2011. To the extent that Mr Rowan's concerns include self-harm by the Defendant, and a real threat of harm to others, the provisions of the Mental Health Act are available to detain the Defendant until those issues are stabilised to the satisfaction of the treating psychiatrist. 

Conclusion 

131For the reasons I have given I am satisfied to a high degree of probability that the Defendant poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision. I am not satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order. Because the psychiatrists and the psychologists stressed the length of time it would take to assist the Defendant I consider that the extended supervision order should be for a period of 5 years. 

132The parties should give consideration to the conditions of the extended supervision order and bring in Short Minutes to that effect. I can indicate to the parties that the conditions set out by Mr Rowan in his briefing note annexed to his affidavit of 17 February 2011 should be given serious consideration in this regard. I also draw attention to the conditions imposed in Fisher at [41] without necessarily suggesting that all those conditions would be necessary.

   REMARKS ON SENTENCE1. The offender pleaded guilty to the charge of Reckless Wounding contrary to s 35(4) of the Crimes Act 1900 on 23 March 2009. Previously the offender had been charged with Maliciously Inflicting Grievous Bodily Harm with Intent to cause Grievous Bodily Harm contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act. The plea to the charge of Reckless Wounding was following protracted plea negotiations between the representatives of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the solicitor for the offender.2. Initially, the question arises as to the utilitarian value of the plea. According to the original court papers the matter had been before this court on 10 occasions before the plea of guilty to the charge of Reckless Wounding was entered. When the matter was before me on 20 April 2009 the Crown argued that the utilitarian value of the plea was ‘something less” than 25% and today submitted that the discount should be 15%. Mr. Reddy who appears for the offender initially maintained that the offender is entitled to the full 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the plea, but today submitted that the discount should be 20%. 3. The issue of the utilitarian value of the plea following plea negotiations has been the subject of recent decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal, namely R v Sullivan & Skillin [2008] NSWCCA 290 at [14]-[16] per Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL, Grove J agreeing); R v Boney [2008] NSWCCA 313 at [18]-[26] per Hulme J (McClellan CJ at CL, Hidden J agreeing), and R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32] per Howie J. In the circumstances of the matter presently under consideration I am of the opinion that it is not appropriate to allow the full 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the plea. However, I propose to err on the side of generosity to the offender and allow a 20% discount for the utilitarian value of the plea.Facts4. The matter proceeded by way of agreed facts, which for the sake of convenience I will recite in full: 
     
      
      “The offender is 23 years old and was unknown to Andrew Michael Klemm (victim) at all material times relating to this incident. On Friday 19th July 2008 the offender commenced drinking with his brother and a friend at his home address. The three of them consumed a carton of full strength beer before attending Sodens Hotel Albury where they continued drinking more full strength beer whilst playing pool amongst themselves. The victim and his friends were playing pool using the adjoining table about 2.30am. 
      The offender approached a friend of the victim and said to him words to the effect of, ‘you guys are a bunch of fags and we should go outside and sort this out’. The offender, his brother and his friend began to shove and push the victim’s friends. The victim and his friends tried to calm the situation down. When the victim got in between his friend and the offender, the offender grabbed him from behind and with his arm around the neck of the victim. Then the offender took a glass and hit the victim once in the forehead with the glass. The glass smashed and the offender lot go of the victim who was bleeding by that time. Victim’s friends assisted him and the police were informed. The offender and his brother were pushed outside in view of their behaviour. 
      When the police arrived at the scene around 3.30am they observed the offender fighting with his brother. Police arrested the offender and explained his rights to him. He was then conveyed to the Albury police station and entered into custody. 
      The offender was not interviewed at that stage due to his level of intoxication. The offender voluntarily participated in an ERISP interview at 9.26am when he was able to do so where he made partial admissions although he did not have memory of the entire incident. The offender was then charged by police. 
      As a result of this incident, the victim was treated at the Emergency section of the Albury Base Hospital. The victim had two lacerations to his forehead from this incident and these lacerations had to be cleaned and sutured before he was discharged from hospital.” 
      
    5. There is no material from a medical practitioner before me. However, by consent the Crown tendered a colour photograph of the victim showing the wounds sustained in the course of the incident. That photograph shows two distinct wounds. So far as I can ascertain the smaller of the two wounds has 7 sutures and the larger of the wounds 10 or 11 sutures. The wounds are such that some cosmetic scarring would be inevitable, although the hair of the victim would cover at least part of that. Assessment of the Criminality6. It has not been particularly easy to assess the criminality in this matter. On 20 April 2009 the Crown when asked by me submitted that although the offender was reckless as to causing the wounds the act of the offender picking up a glass and swinging at the victim was intentional. Mr. Reddy on behalf of the offender submitted that the whole of the incident was reckless. Today the Crown maintained its original stance and Mr. Reddy appropriately conceded that the actions of the picking up the glass and swinging the glass was intentional but that the offender was reckless as to the wound.7. The Crown has charged and the offender has pleaded to Reckless Wounding contrary to s 35(4) of the Crimes Act 1900. I must be very careful not to infringe the principles enunciated by the High Court in Di Simoni v The Queen (1981) 147 CLR 383. In my opinion, given the manner in which the facts are stated within the Agreed Facts, the act of the act of picking up the glass and swinging in the direction of the victim after taking hold of the victim could only be an intentional act. I must proceed on the basis that the wounding was reckless. 8. Further so far as assessing the objective seriousness of the criminality I refer to R v McCullough [2009] NSWCCA 94 in which Howie J said at [37]: 
     
      
      “Malicious wounding is principally a result offence. Generally speaking the seriousness of the offence will significantly depend upon the seriousness of the wounding. That is not to say that the manner in which the wound was inflicted, the reason for the infliction of the wound and the circumstances surrounding the wounding are irrelevant. The same can be said for an offence involving the infliction of grievous bodily harm: the more serious the harm inflicted the more serious the offence: see  
      R v Mitchell and Gallagher 
       [2007] NSWCCA 296; 177 A Crim R 94 at [27]”. 
      
    9. The glass used by the offender was used as a weapon. It is to be observed that a glass thrust at a person’s head can be a particularly dangerous, and indeed lethal weapon. Indeed, the glass seems to be the weapon of choice for persons intent on doing damage to others at licensed premises. The use of the glass as a weapon is an aggravating feature – see for e.g. the decision of R v Nowak [2008] NSWCCA 89 per Buddin J (Bell JA, Barr J agreeing) at [15]-[17].10. While I accept that there may be very good reasons for this plea agreement of which I am not and should not be aware, and while these comments should not be interpreted as any criticism express or implied of either party, the manner in which this matter has been presented to me by the parties creates some interesting practical difficulties, especially considering the decision of Di Simoni. I am of the opinion that the practical reality is that I am being asked to sentence on something that is bordering on a legal fiction. The conduct of the offender was on the Agreed Facts completely unprovoked. However, doing as best I can taking into account the nature of the conduct, the nature of the injuries and the use of the glass as a weapon I am of the opinion that this matter is a little above the half way mark on the scale of objective seriousness for matters of reckless wounding.Maximum Penalty11. The maximum penalty for the offence of Reckless Wounding is 7 years imprisonment if dealt with on Indictment. This is a matter to which the principles enunciated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Doan v The Queen (2000) 50 NSWLR 115 apply. Grove J (Spigelman CJ and Kirby J agreeing) in that decision said at [35]: 
     
      
      “The result of true construction of the statutory provisions in New South Wales is that, what has been prescribed is a jurisdictional maximum and not a maximum penalty for any offence triable within that jurisdiction. In other words, where the maximum applicable penalty is lower because the charge has been prosecuted within the limited summary jurisdiction of the Local Court, that court should impose a penalty reflecting the objective seriousness of the offence, tempered if appropriate by subjective circumstances, taking care only not to exceed the maximum jurisdictional limit. The implication of the argument of the appellant that, in lieu of prescribed maximum penalties exceeding two years imprisonment, a maximum of two years imprisonment for all offences triable summarily in the Local Court has been substituted must be rejected. As must also be rejected the corollary that a sentence of two years imprisonment should be reserved for a ‘worst case’”. 
      
    Matters of General Principle12. There are very real issues of general deterrence in this matter. The offence occurred in licensed premises at something after 2am. Precisely why people feel the need to be consuming liquor at that hour of the day escapes me entirely. There are a disturbing number of matters involving drunken and gratuitous violence that come before this Court. I have in other such matters repeated a number of pronouncements of the Court of Criminal Appeal in such matters. It is appropriate that I once again repeat some of those for the benefit of this offender any other person within the community who might be like-minded.13. In the decision of R v Sayin [2008] NSWCCA 307 Howie J said at [47]: 
     
      
      The offence, popularly known as ""glassing"", is becoming so prevalent in licensed premises that there are moves on foot to stem the opportunity for the offence to be committed by earlier closing times and the use of plastic containers. The courts clearly must impose very severe penalties for such offenders, but of course within the limits afforded by the prescribed maximum penalty. In light of the fact that the maximum penalty for an offence under s 35(2), recklessly inflict grievous bodily harm, is now 10 years imprisonment, the increased maximum penalty should result in a marked increase in the penalty for offences of this nature. Had the sentence this Court is now substituting been imposed for the new offence under the Crimes Act with the increased maximum penalty, it would be arguably manifestly inadequate. 
      
    14. The offence with which that offender was charged also carried a 7-year maximum. The offence involved an attack with a glass. The injuries were more serious in that they involved wounds that required 40 sutures, emergency surgery to the eye and a broken nose. The Court of Criminal Appeal imposed a non-parole period of 2 years 3 months with a balance of term of 1 year 6 months. However, clearly enough the Court of Criminal Appeal has signalled that deterrent sentences must be imposed in respect of matters of this type that involve attacks using a glass or bottle. This also demonstrates the significance of the decision in R v Doan.15. Earlier this year McClellan CJ at CL in R v Wright [2009] NSWCCA 3 said at [1]: 
     
      
      “This is yet another case where this Court has been required to consider the appropriate penalty when a young person who has consumed a quantity of alcohol inflicts physical violence of a significant order on another. The facts of this case are not unusual. So far as the criminal law is concerned those who engage in such conduct must understand that the courts will impose significant penalties”. 
      
    16. The Chief Judge at Common Law also said, although dealing with offending more serious than that with which I am dealing, in the decision of R v McKenna [2007] NSWCCA 113 at [2]: 
     
      
      “Members of the community are entitled to walk the streets without fear of being attacked by others intent upon inflicting physical violence. Those who put people in fear and cause serious injury cannot expect any leniency from the law”. 
      
    17. In the matter presently under consideration the victim was not walking the streets but was in effect minding his own business in the hotel. I do not see that as a particular point of distinction in that as I have previously observed the offender’s conduct was entirely unprovoked.18. Further on this issue of general deterrence, Hulme J said in the decision of R v Corbett [2008] NSWCCA 42 at [10]: 
     
      
      “From time to time particular offences have become more common, either throughout the state or in particular towns or parts of it. It is an accepted practice for criminal courts to respond to such increases in offending of a particular type by increasing sentences for such offences and this without any change to the legislative proscription of the conduct or any increase in the penalty prescribed”. 
      
    19. The Court of Criminal Appeal has made it clear in a number of authorities that deterrent sentences should be imposed in respect of conduct such as I am dealing with in this matter. Further, as I have observed before in this Court, drunken, thuggish and gratuitously violent behaviour resulting in injury to others should not have to be tolerated by the citizens of this city, and such conduct will most certainly not be tolerated by this Court. Indeed, I would expect the decent and respectable citizens of Albury to expect no less.Criminal History20. His record assists the offender. There are no other matters of violence on his record. Generally, the record in New South Wales consists of driving matters, the most serious of which was driving while disqualified in respect of which he was released on a bond pursuant to s. 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. He was sentenced to 30 hours community service for a charge of drive while suspended. That was revoked because of non-compliance.21. The offender has been convicted of Burglary and Theft, Criminal Damage and Theft from a shop in Victoria. Fines were imposed in respect of all matters.Pre Sentence Report22. The Pre Sentence Report records the criminal antecedents of the offender. It is indicated, and I accept that 2007 was a difficult period for the offender as his brother to whom he was very close died. The offender before going into custody was employed with a carpet cleaning business.23. The offender began using cannabis and alcohol when he was 14. He is now 24 and was 23 at the time of the offence. He began to binge drink and this became worse when his mother died. He maintains he ceased using cannabis when obtaining work with the carpet cleaning company. 24. There is apparently no issue of the police facts, although it is recorded that he cannot remember much because of his level of intoxication. The report indicates that the offender although having given some thought to his victim did not appear to fully comprehend the severity of his actions. In this regard I note with some concern that the author of the report notes that, “the offender does not appear to understand the severity of his actions on either himself or the community. The offender appeared to have little insight into the effects of his binge drinking in regard to his behaviour.”25. The offender is suitable for supervision, but is unsuitable for Community Service and ineligible for Periodic Detention. In any event, I am of the opinion that this matter is too serious for any sentencing disposition other than full time custody.Plea in Mitigation26. When this matter was before me on 20 April 2009 Mr. Reddy for the offender put that the offender was heavily intoxicated at the time of the offence. Today Mr. Reddy submitted that the intoxication is a mitigating factor. In all of the circumstances I am of the opinion that intoxication is neutral in this matter. This is essentially because of the long period of time over which the offender has been binge drinking. Given the extensive history of binge drinking it is my opinion the offender cannot now argue that it was the alcohol on this occasion that made his act out of character. In respect of the issue of intoxication, it is with unfeigned respect that I gratefully adopt what was said by Knox SC DCJ in R v Kite [2008] NSWDC 7 at [109] in that: 
     
      
      “Intoxication is relevant in determining the degree of deliberation involved in the commission of the offence. In some cases it may mitigate the crime because it caused the offender to act out of character: R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 459 at 467. In other cases it may aggravate the offence because of the recklessness with which the offender became intoxicated. The voluntary ingestion of alcohol or drugs by an offender, who knows he has a problem with alcohol/drugs and has a history of committing offences while intoxicated may be an aggravating factor: R v Fletcher-Jones (1994) 75 A Crim R 381; R v Sotheren [2001] NSWCCA 425. In many cases intoxication will be neither an aggravating nor mitigating circumstance: R v Gordon at 467-468; R v Wright (unrep, 28/2/1997, NSWCCA, at pp 6-7). 
      
    27. I note that the decision at first instance in Kite was recently reviewed by the Court of Criminal Appeal, but I also note the findings as to intoxication did not form any part of the appeal.28. It was submitted and I accept that the offender began binge drinking in an attempt to deal with significant family tragedy including his mother dying of cancer when he was 18 years of age, and that at the time of his mother’s death there were two younger siblings. Further, an older brother died of a heart attack at the age of 27. The submission that the offender found this a very traumatic time is certainly made good. It seems that this offender has done what regrettably so many do is attempt to “drown their sorrows” in alcohol and then having difficulty in controlling their drinking. 29. Generally, it was put and I accept that the offender has a minimal education and has only basic literacy and numeracy skills. He has had a reasonable employment history and I accept the submission that he has a job waiting for him upon his eventual release.General Remarks30. I am obliged to give proper regard to sections 3A and 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It is inappropriate to impose a custodial sentence unless I first of all come to the conclusion that no other sentence other than a sentence of imprisonment is appropriate in all the circumstances. It is also appropriate that I remind myself of the decision of R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crime R 349. In that decision, the Court of Criminal Appeal (Gleeson CJ; Lee CJ at CL and Hunt J) said at p. 354: 
     
      
      “As Jordon CJ pointed out in Geddes at 556, making due allowance for all relevant considerations, there ought to be a reasonable proportionality between a sentence and the circumstances of the crime, and we consider that it is always important in seeking to determine the sentence appropriate to a particular crime to have regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively, for without this assessment the other factors requiring consideration in order to arrive at the proper sentence to be imposed cannot properly be given their place. Each crime, as Veen (No. 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472 stresses, has its own objective gravity meriting at the most a sentence proportionate to that gravity, the maximum sentence fixed by the legislature defining the limits of sentence for cases in the most grave category. The relative importance of the objective facts and the subjective features will vary: see for example, the passage from the judgment of Street CJ in Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 quoted in Mill (1988) 166 CLR 59. Even so, there is sometimes a risk that attention to persuasive subjective considerations may cause inadequate weight to be given to the objective seriousness of the case: Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594.”  
      
    31. It should be tolerably plain from the above that I have reached the very firm opinion that no other sentence other than full time custody is appropriate in this matter. The issue arises as to whether there are special circumstances. Given the age of the offender, the fact that this is his first time in custody and the need for supervision particularly on the issue of alcohol abuse, I am prepared in this matter to vary the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and balance of term.32. Having considered the objective seriousness of the offending and the mitigating and aggravating circumstances as I have found them to be I am of the opinion that the offending is deserving of a sentence of two years imprisonment. Allowing for the 20% discount for the utilitarian value of the plea and allowing for some pragmatic “rounding down” the head sentence is then 19 months. I have already indicated I find special circumstances.Formal Orders33. In respect of the offence that the offender: 
     
      
      On 19 July 2008 at Albury in the State of New South Wales, recklessly did wound Michael Klemm  
      
    34. The offender is convicted.35. Consequent upon that conviction the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 11 months to commence on 19 July 2008 and expire on 18 June 2009. Thereafter I specify a balance of term of 8 months to commence on 19 June 2009 and expire on 18 February 2010.Gordon LerveMagistrate30 April 2009

2709669,Weir v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 123,"Judgment 

1MACFARLAN JA : I agree with Garling J. 

2JOHNSON J : I agree with Garling J. 

3GARLING J: The applicant, Thomas Herbert Weir, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by his Honour Judge King on 17 June 2010 in the District Court of NSW at Campbelltown. 

4Mr Weir had pleaded guilty to two offences. The first offence was that contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 he had recklessly caused grievous bodily harm to Wayne O'Connor on 1 February 2009. The second offence was that on the same day at Waterloo he had, contrary to s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act intentionally or recklessly destroyed property, namely the front door of premises in Morehead Street, Waterloo, which was the property of the Department of Housing NSW. 

5For the first offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm, the legislation imposed a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 4 years. For the second offence of intentionally or recklessly destroying property the legislation imposed a maximum penalty of 5 years. It did not fix any standard non-parole period. 

6On 17 June 2010, Mr Weir was sentenced to the following terms of imprisonment: 

(a) On the first count of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm, Mr Weir was sentenced to imprisonment of 4 years with a non-parole of 1 year and 6 months to commence on 1 February 2009 and expire on 31 July 2010. The balance of term was of 2 years and 6 months to commence on 1 August 2010 and expire on 31 January 2013; 

(b) In respect of the second count of intentionally or recklessly destroying property, Mr Weir was sentenced to a fix term of imprisonment of 3 months to commence on 1 February 2009 and expire on 30 April 2009. 

7Mr Weir was released to parole on 27 September 2010. 

8On 6 January 2011, Mr Weir applied for leave to appeal against the sentence only on the first count and only upon the basis that he had been denied procedural fairness by the sentencing judge because, without warning, the judge had imposed a longer sentence than that which had been indicated during submissions. 

9There was no appeal against the sentence imposed on the second count. 

Facts 

10A statement of agreed facts was tendered to the sentencing judge. A brief summary is set out below. 

11On the morning of Sunday, 1 February 2009, the applicant armed himself with a claw hammer. He, having left his unit on the 11 th floor of a block of apartments in Waterloo, climbed to the 12 th floor of the same building and approached the front door of the unit directly above his. 

12It was occupied by the victim, Wayne O'Connor, who lived there by himself. The front door of the unit was ajar and held open by a wedge. Mr O'Connor was seated in his lounge room. 

13The applicant struck the front of the door with the hammer causing an indentation in the panel. This conduct gave rise to the second charge. 

14Upon hearing that noise, Mr O'Connor came to the front door. The offender swung the hammer at him but missed. The applicant followed Mr O'Connor into the unit and swung the hammer a second time. On this occasion the claw end of the hammer lodged inside Mr O'Connor's left forearm. 

15After removing the hammer from the left forearm, the applicant struck Mr O'Connor for a second time. This blow hit him on the forehead with the blunt end of the hammer. 

16Mr O'Connor sustained a laceration of the left forearm with extensor tendon injury. Clinical examination confirmed rupture of the extensor tendon to the left ring finger. Surgery was performed to repair the tendon which required a splint for six weeks post-operatively. Mr O'Connor suffered a compound fracture/dislocation of his right big toe for which surgical debridement and fixation was required. He also sustained a laceration to his forehead from the second blow of the claw hammer. 

17When the applicant was spoken to by police, he said that he visited the unit with the hammer with the intention of bashing on the door to annoy Mr O'Connor. The applicant gave a history to the police of disputes with Mr O'Connor, apparently stemming from noises emanating from Mr O'Connor's unit, which was located directly above the applicant's unit. 

18The applicant was arrested on 1 February 2009 and charged with the offences which are now the subject of these proceedings. Bail was refused. 

19On 27 November 2009, in the District Court of NSW, the applicant entered pleas of guilty to the two offences. 

Applicant's Submission on Sentence 

20The applicant, as I have said earlier, agreed with the facts, a summary of which is set out above. He did not give evidence on the sentence hearing, although he relied upon two reports of Professor David Greenberg, dated 4 March 2010 and 28 April 2010 respectively. 

21In addition, he relied upon a letter from the Mount Druitt College of the Western Sydney Institute which indicated his achievements in metal fabrication and welding studies whilst in custody. 

22The reports of Professor Greenberg provided significant material about the applicant's subjective circumstances. Professor Greenberg concluded that the applicant had a diagnosis of chronic paranoid schizophrenia associated with a chronic and persistent history of poly-substance abuse/dependence. 

23According to the history which the applicant gave Professor Greenberg, he began to abuse alcohol and various illicit substances from the age of 14 years. He disclosed a chronic and persistent pattern of use of those substances over his adolescent and adult lifetime. He told Professor Greenberg that he had had multiple admissions to various psychiatric hospitals for his psychiatric illness and had various forms of treatment including antipsychotic medication and Electro-convulsive Therapy on at least twelve occasions. 

24Professor Greenberg concluded on 4 March 2010 that the applicant's mental illness ""... may have played an indirect role in the commission of the offences for which he is currently facing charges "". 

25The applicant also disclosed a history of persistent use of cannabis. At the time he committed the offences the applicant was taking methadone for a heroin addiction. 

26It was these subjective circumstances, and the role which the applicant's mental illness played in the commission of the offence, that were the principal subject of the submissions made to the sentencing judge by the applicant. 

27As well, Professor Greenberg's opinion on 28 April 2010 to the following effect: 

""... it is imperative that Mr Weir remains abstinent from alcohol and illicit substances for an indefinite period. He may benefit from drug and alcohol counselling, and possibly anger management counselling with regard to his personality difficulties. It is imperative that he remains compliant with all psychiatric medication and psychiatric follow-up appointments with his treating psychiatrist"" 

was also pressed upon his Honour, the sentencing judge, as being a relevant consideration, in particular, when considering the extent of the non-parole period. 

28The applicant acknowledged the existence of his relatively lengthy criminal history and submitted that he had not previously spent any significant time in custody. 

Remarks on Sentence 

29The sentence was delivered by King DCJ on 17 June 2010. 

30His Honour recounted fully the relevant facts and circumstances which had been agreed and the nature of the offences. 

31His Honour found that offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness. He found that the offence of intentionally or recklessly destroying property was at the lowest end of the scale of seriousness and would ordinarily fall within the jurisdiction of the Local Court. 

32He recounted the applicant's subjective circumstances and noted in particular, that there was clear evidence that the applicant was suffering from a mental illness which required treatment and supervision, and also that the applicant's custody in respect of the matter would be his first significant period of custody. 

33His Honour had regard to the plea of guilty and the time at which it was made. He determined that a discount in the order of 10 per cent was appropriate. 

34His Honour declined to find that the applicant had expressed any genuine remorse or contrition, and he also said that he was not inclined to find that there was a good prospect of rehabilitation. However, his Honour did find that if the applicant received effective treatment, that it may substantially reduce the risk of reoffending. 

35His Honour noted that the applicant's mental illness made him ""... an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and may mean that a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily on him than others ... "". 

36His Honour having reviewed all of the circumstances then said this to the applicant: 

""You are convicted in respect of each of the two offences. In respect of the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm, after taking into account the matters referred to and some rounding down in favour of the offender, the term of the sentence will be 4 years. The Court finds special circumstances as this is the offender's first substantial period of imprisonment and also as a result of the offender suffering from a mental illness requiring supervision and treatment. Special circumstances warrant the varying of the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of term to a substantial degree. The non-parole period will be one year and six months commencing from the date on which the offender went into custody on 1 February 2009. It will expire on 31 July 2010. The balance of term is two years and six months commencing on 1 August 2010 and expiring on 31 January 2013. 

... 

I recommend that when the offender is released on parole he be subject to the very close supervision of the Probation and Parole Service for the balance of term or such period as is deemed appropriate by that service, that while on parole he accept and obey all reasonable directions from the service in relation to psychiatric assessment and/or treatment, including medication and also such directions as to any counselling or treatment in respect of drugs - that is, prohibited drugs - and/or alcohol. I also recommend that while the subject of supervision by the Probation and Parole Service, that he be required to participate in compulsory urinalysis. 

In respect of the offence of intentionally or recklessly destroying property, the offender is sentenced to a period of imprisonment of three months fixed term to be entirely concurrent with the last sentence, and to commence on 1 February 2009 and expire on 30 April 2009."" 

Ground of Appeal 

37As indicated earlier, there is only one ground of appeal. It is in the following form: 

""The applicant was denied ... procedural fairness in that the sentencing judge failed to warn those acting for him that he proposed to impose a sentence longer than that indicated during the proceedings on sentence."" 

38In order to understand the submissions on this application, it is necessary to examine, in some detail, what transpired during the sentencing proceedings. It will be necessary to set out and refer to the transcript of what occurred. 

39The sentencing proceedings took place over a number of days. 

40The first occasion was 4 February 2010. In the course of the submissions on that day, the appropriateness of having a report as to the applicant's psychiatric condition emerged. The proceedings were accordingly adjourned. 

41The proceedings resumed on Friday, 5 March 2010 when the first expert report of Professor Greenberg, dated 4 March 2010, was tendered and admitted without objection. The proceedings were again adjourned and resumed on 1 April 2010. 

42The proceedings were then adjourned until Wednesday, 28 April 2010 by which time the second report of Professor Greenberg had been obtained and was admitted without objection. 

43In the course of the submissions on this final occasion, his Honour determined that it was appropriate to directly interrogate the applicant with respect to two issues, namely, whether he adhered to his pleas of guilty in respect of the two offences and, secondly, whether he agreed that the facts stated in the document labelled ""Agreed Facts"", which had been settled between the lawyers for the Crown and the applicant, were true and correct. 

44The applicant indicated directly to his Honour that he adhered to the pleas of guilty and that he accepted the correctness and accuracy of the statement of facts. 

45The Crown then made submissions to his Honour in which it was conceded that, having regard to the contents of the reports of Professor Greenberg, that the sentencing judge would be entitled, pursuant to s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to mitigate the penalty which he would have otherwise have imposed by reason of the applicant's mental health illness or disorder. The Crown submitted that it was open to the sentencing judge to reduce the moral culpability of the applicant by reason of that mental illness, that he could reduce the importance of general deterrence when imposing a sentence, and that if there was any issue about the behaviour of the applicant upon release raised as a consequence of the contents of the report of Professor Greenberg, it was open to his Honour to impose significant conditions to ensure that the applicant was properly supervised during his period of parole. 

46The applicant's lawyer commenced to make submissions. He first turned to handing up a number of decisions, which he said were both of relevance and of assistance to the sentencing judge. 

47The applicant's lawyer then commenced to make substantive submissions by drawing to his Honour's attention to the time which the applicant had already served in custody. As he commenced to do so, the lawyer appearing for the Crown interrupted, appropriately, to inform his Honour that the period of time in custody was 14 months and 28 days. The applicant's lawyer agreed. He then commenced to make further submissions at which point his Honour interrupted him and said: 

""His Honour: Mr Kumarasinne, I am intending to return to the trial at 11.30 and I don't anticipate that I am going to be able to complete sentencing because of the material that I need to cover for Mr Weir today. I will express a tentative view because I haven't yet had the opportunity to fully consider the cases and material that has been presented today. However, off the cuff considering the matters that have been raised the facts, all of which I have read, including the reports re-read now on several occasions because of the several times it has been to Court and in fact read completely again this morning. 

My tentative view is that I would have to sentence Mr Weir to a period of full time custody, considering that the standard non-parole period is still relevant even allowing for the matters at least as a guideline, or any other appropriate phrase to refer to it. My current view is that I would be falling into appealable error if I provided at the absolute minimum anything less than an 18 months non-parole period, with a total term taking into account the need for Mr Weir's ongoing medication and assistance in relation to a number of aspects a total sentence of three years. That is my tentative view as to the best that is available to the Court. If you disagree with that you would need to persuade me. If you do not disagree with that then I will put the matter over to another date and give judgment on that date, not binding myself to that actual sentence but considering it highly likely that that would be the sentence that I would impose in relation to the recklessly wounding charge. Would you like to discuss that with your client."" 

48The applicant's lawyer then attempted to make submissions about whether the sentence which the learned sentencing judge had indicated was too harsh a penalty. By way of context, I note that on an earlier occasion, in the course of submissions, it had been submitted on behalf of the applicant, that he should be sentenced to a period in custody finishing on the day that the submissions were being made. 

49Further discussion between the applicant's lawyer and the sentencing judge ensued to this effect: 

""His Honour: ... I would be inclined to the view that it would fall within the mid range of objective seriousness for the standard non-parole offence. 

Kumarasinne: Your Honour ... 

His Honour: Mr Kumarasinne the other thing is what I think is important in relation to your client is that he has recently started medication, I think there needs to be, although I cannot increase the sentence, that I would impose, but clearly he needs to be stabilised on a medical regime before he is released and ... 

Kumarasinne: Except your Honour again what I laboured to say to your Honour is that because of that underlying, or certainly your Honour it is not a ... 

His Honour: Well those underlying matters are the only reason that I come down to that tentative figure, as I said my current view is that to go beyond that would be appellable error. I am reluctant to ask the Crown to comment on that, but ... 

Kumarasinne: I would be grateful your Honour."" 

50Ms Paul, who was then appearing for the Crown, apparently, without reluctance, then said this: 

""Consistent with the decision of Thawer that I have provided your Honour's views are shared by the Crown on the basis of that decision, because if your Honour adjusts for the matters and makes the findings as submitted are available by the Crown, much lower than what your Honour has suggested does become problematic without binding the Crown."" 

51Thawer, which the Crown lawyer mentioned, is a decision of this Court: R v Thawer [2009] NSWCCA 158. That decision concerned a Crown appeal against the manifest inadequacy of a 16 month suspended sentence imposed for an offence against s 35(2) of the Crimes Act , where there had been a stabbing attack on a victim by an offender who was suffering from a schizophrenic illness. 

52This Court held that a suspended sentence was manifestly inadequate, and resentenced the offender to a term of imprisonment which consisted of a 16 month non-parole period and balance term of 30 months. 

53The sentencing judge invited the applicant's lawyer to continue with his submissions. The applicant's lawyer then asked if he could ""... see Mr Weir and explain to him what is transpiring between your Honour and myself and the Crown, obviously in his presence "". 

54A further relatively short exchange occurred between the applicant's lawyer and the sentencing judge where the applicant's lawyer made it plain that what he was submitting to the sentencing judge was that a lesser sentence than the judge had indicated was appropriate. 

55At the conclusion of those submissions, the applicant's lawyer then asked his Honour for a short adjournment so he could discuss what had occurred with his client. His client was taken down to the custodial facilities below the Court and there had a conference with his lawyer. 

56Upon return to Court, the following exchange occurred: 

""Kumarasinne: Thank you your Honour for granting me that time for a conference with Mr Weir, does your Honour want him brought upstairs, he is quite happy your Honour, I explained to him what is going to happen now and ... 

His Honour: I think he should come up. 

Kumarasinne: Your Honour while he is not here, would 17 June, your Honour is sitting at Campbelltown, I'm quite happy to come to Campbelltown because I'm in the western region. 

His Honour: Ms Paul would you have left the service by then? 

Paul: Yes your Honour, I would need to ask to be excused. 

His Honour: Yes that would be fine. 

Kumarasinne: Mr Weir is now before the Court. 

His Honour: Yes anything further Mr Kumarasinne? 

Kumarasinne: No your Honour I certainly can't take the matter any further. 

His Honour: Ms Paul I think the position is actually because of all the adjournments, you've never in fact made any submissions other than the ones you made this morning effectively? 

Paul: That's correct your Honour, other than to provide your Honour with particular authorities in terms of an appropriate sentencing range. 

His Honour: Do you feel there is anything you need to particularly highlight for the Court? 

Paul: No your Honour in light of those authorities I think they provide reasonable assistance to your Honour. 

His Honour: Thank you ..."" 

57There was then a discussion about the date when the plea of guilty had first been entered. 

58This was followed by a discussion about what sentence ought be imposed with respect to the second offence and his Honour in respect of that offence then said: 

""His Honour: And in those circumstances Mr Kumarasinne so your client doesn't go away wondering whatever I do in respect of the primary count I will impose a concurrent sentence in respect of the damage to the door, and there is no request for a compensation order is there. I note the facts say there is $800 worth of damage but that clearly must relate to the damage inflicted over time rather than the one occasioned."" 

59The following exchange then occurred: 

""Kumarasinne: Your Honour for the record, your Honour I have completed my submissions to you. 

His Honour: Then the matter will be adjourned to Campbelltown for sentence on Thursday 17 June 2010, bail not applied for is refused. I make a s 77 order and I think that completes everything"". 

60The Court has not been provided with the transcript of 17 June 2010, although the Court has been provided with the transcript of the remarks on sentence. It is not suggested that there was any exchange on that day before the sentence was imposed which was of any relevance to the proceedings. 

61In the present context, and in the absence of any relevant exchange before the sentence was imposed, it is appropriate to set out what occurred at the conclusion of the judge's remarks. 

62Having pronounced sentence, the following exchange then occurred: 

""His Honour: Yes, is there any matter arising, Mr Kumarasinne, Madam Crown? 

Kumarasinne: No your Honour. Thank you very much. 

Hallett: No your Honour. 

His Honour: Mr Weir, if you would go with - well Mr Kumarasinne you are going to go down ... 

Kumarasinne: I will certainly go and explain all this to him."" 

63It is to be observed that although a period of a little over six weeks had passed since the final submission, Mr Kumarasinne, did not draw his Honour's attention at the conclusion of his remarks on sentencing to the discrepancy between the sentence which was imposed and the sentence which the applicant argues had been foreshadowed on the earlier occasion. 

Relevant Legal Principles 

64It is clear that an offender is entitled to procedural fairness during criminal proceedings, including proceedings on sentence: Pantorno v The Queen (1989) 166 CLR 466 at 472-3 per Mason CJ and Brennan J, 482-483 per Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ; Parker v DPP (1992) 28 NSWLR 282; Baroudi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 48; Button v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 264. 

65The particular form which procedural fairness dictates may vary. That is because the content of the requirement of fairness may be affected by what is said and done during the proceedings: Re Minister for Immigration & Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Lam (2003) 214 CLR 1 at [34] per Gleeson CJ. Here the relevant process was the sentencing of Mr Weir by King DCJ in circumstances where, the applicant contends that, King DCJ indicated the sentence that he proposed to impose. 

66The key to determining whether there has been a breach of the requirement of procedural fairness is to ascertain the consequence of any departure from the dictates of proper procedure because what is ultimately in issue is whether unfairness has resulted from the process: See Lam at [34]. The concern of the law is to avoid practical, and not merely theoretical, injustice: Lam at [37]. 

67One common basis for demonstrating that practical injustice and unfairness has occurred is where an individual has lost the opportunity to make submissions to the decision maker in opposition to a proposed course and in support of a course which he urges: Lam at [36]; Button at [18]. 

Was there a Denial of Procedural Fairness? 

68The applicant claims that he was denied the opportunity to make any additional submissions to the sentencing judge in opposition to a sentence greater than that indicated by the sentencing judge. He submits that as a consequence the balance of his term of imprisonment which he faces is an additional 12 months. This he argues, is clearly a breach of the dictates of procedural fairness with the result which is manifestly unfair. 

69I agree that in the circumstances described above that there has been a breach of procedural fairness. The sentencing judge included in his remarks on a number of occasions the phrase ""... my tentative view ..."". Ordinarily, such a phrase would not be taken as precluding departure from that view on a later occasion: Baroudi at [33]. 

70However, in this case, within a short time there were further comments which fell from the bench which included: 

(a) if the counsel disagreed ""... with that you would need to persuade me ...""; 

(b) if the counsel did not disagree with the judge's ""tentative view"" then ""... I will put the matter over to another date and give judgment ... ""; 

(c) the judge said that without binding himself he considered it ""... highly likely that would be the sentence ..."". 

71These comments were immediately followed by offering the applicant's lawyer an adjournment to take his client's instructions on the question of the proposed sentence. Once the response was made that the applicant did not wish to make any further submissions, in my view, the sentencing judge was obliged to grant the applicant an opportunity to make those submissions if he determined that he was going to impose a longer sentence. This did not happen. There was a breach of procedural fairness. 

72The Crown accepts that there is a breach of procedural fairness and that the applicant ought to have been given an opportunity to make further submissions by the sentencing judge before the imposition of the sentence which was actually imposed. 

73The Crown submits that because the sentence actually imposed was not manifestly excessive, and fell within the range dictated by the exercise of reasonable sentencing discretion, that no unfairness has resulted. It submits, conformably with the authority of the High Court of Australia in Lam , that the application ought be dismissed. 

Resulting Unfairness? 

74It is convenient here to restate some conclusions which I have earlier stated. 

75King DCJ imposed a lengthier sentence on the applicant than that which he had indicated he was minded to do. True it is that he had used the word ""tentative"" when he first expressed his view. But this was quickly followed by the expression with respect to the sentence "" considering it highly likely that that would be the sentence that I would impose "". It was then followed by his giving the applicant's lawyer the opportunity of having a conference with the applicant, specifically to obtain instructions about what the judge had said. 

76It is clear that the applicant's lawyer, having taken express instructions from the applicant during an adjournment, granted by King DCJ for that purpose, declined to make any further submissions for his client on sentence. He accepted, in short, that what the sentencing judge had indicated would be an appropriate exercise of the discretion of the sentencing judge. 

77Six weeks later, for reasons which are not apparent on the face of the record, the sentence which was imposed did not accord with that which had been indicated and upon which the applicant's lawyer had, as he was entitled to, acted. It is unnecessary to speculate about the explanation for the difference between the sentence indicated and that which was imposed: See Button at [16]-[18]. 

78That is because there has been a practical injustice and substantial unfairness in at least two respects. First, the applicant has received a longer sentence of imprisonment. True it is that the difference in what was indicated and what was imposed affected only the period that the applicant would be on parole. But this is nevertheless part of a sentence of imprisonment. The applicant during that period is constantly at risk of being returned to imprisonment if a breach of his parole occurs. It may take some time for that breach to be then dealt with by the State Parole Authority and the applicant's liberty will be lost during that period. This is not a matter of triviality. 

79Secondly, if a sentence of imprisonment is of 3 years or less, then the offender is automatically released on parole at the expiry of the non-parole period determined by the sentencing judge: s 50 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . The trigger for the release is an order of the sentencing judge. If a sentence of imprisonment is longer than 3 years, the date for release on parole is determined by the State Parole Authority. Again, that difference in mechanism for release is not a trivial one. 

80I am satisfied, that a real unfairness has occurred and that the applicant has demonstrated practical injustice. 

Resentence 

81Because of the unfairness which has occurred, the sentence imposed by King DCJ should be quashed and this Court ought to resentence the applicant. 

82The Court should re-exercise the sentencing discretion, taking into account all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles, with the view to formulating the opinion, for the purpose of s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 whether some lesser sentence is warranted in law: Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 at 287 [19]. The Court is obliged to look at the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the subjective features of the applicant and to consider what sentence achieves the purposes of sentencing set forth in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . 

83In addition to the material which was before the sentencing judge, the applicant swore an affidavit which was read as being relevant to any question of resentencing. 

84The applicant deposed that he had been released on parole on 27 September 2010, and has been subjected to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service since his release. 

85He confirmed that he had consistently been taking the antipsychotic medication prescribed by his doctor and that in addition he had been attending meetings of groups designed to assist him to deal with his addictions and to prevent relapse to his previous lifestyle. 

86He affirmed that his antipsychotic medication was not having any significant side effects and as a consequence he intended to continue to take it. 

87Clearly the applicant has taken steps since his time on release to address positively the subjective issues which were in part relevant to his being brought before the Court in the first instance. His prospects of rehabilitation appear to have improved since he was before the sentencing judge and at present he remains drug free. 

88The objective criminality of the offending was within the mid-range, but the applicant pleaded guilty and accordingly the standard non-parole period of 4 years was not directly applicable, but it remained of importance as a guideline or yardstick in the sentencing process. 

89The applicant was allowed a discount of 10 per cent for his plea of guilty. No submission was put to this Court that that was an inappropriate discount. 

90Taking all of the relevant factors into account, the applicant should be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years which consists of a non-parole period of 18 months and a balance term of 18 months. 

91That term of imprisonment should be backdated to the day upon which he entered custody, namely 1 February 2009. Accordingly, the term of imprisonment will expire on 31 January 2012. 

92I note that the applicant has already served the non-parole period. The effect of this sentence is that the applicant's parole period will continue until 31 January 2012. 

Orders 

(1) Leave to appeal granted. 

(2) Appeal upheld. 

(3) Sentence imposed by King DCJ on 17 June 2009 in respect of an offence contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 is quashed. 

(4) In lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 1 year and 6 months to commence on 1 February 2009 and expire on 31 July 2010. The balance of term is 1 year and 6 months to commence on 1 August 2010 and expire on 31 January 2012.

2709672,Michael v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 122,"Judgment 

1MACFARLAN JA : I agree with Garling J. 

2JOHNSON J : I agree with Garling J. 

3GARLING J : This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed in the District Court of NSW by his Honour Judge Michael Finnane on 11 June 2010. 

4The applicant, Glenn David Michael, was found guilty by a jury of supplying 5.87grams of a prohibited drug, namely, 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine which was not less than an indictable quantity contrary to the provisions of s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 

5The maximum penalty for the offence is 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units ($220,000) or both. No standard non-parole period applies. 

6The sentencing judge imposed an overall sentence of 4 years to commence on 10 March 2010 with a non-parole period of 2 years to commence on 10 March 2010 and expire on 9 March 2012. 

7The sentencing judge also made an order with respect to the destruction of drugs and the forfeiture of money. No application for leave to appeal is made with respect to these orders. 

Facts 

8Although the trial was conducted before a jury, not all of the facts were in dispute. For the purposes of sentencing, the learned sentencing judge made some findings of fact to which it will be necessary to refer. 

9On the evening of 19 December 2008, the applicant was at the Plantation Hotel in Coffs Harbour. He was then aged 43. 

10Police had been called to the Hotel in the course of that evening by security guards who had observed a Mr John Mostyn selling drugs to a hotel patron. In the course of dealing with Mr Mostyn, police received information which suggested that the applicant may have been in possession of drugs. 

11At about 12.20am on 20 December 2008, police approached the applicant at the Plantation Hotel and arrested him. He was searched. That search revealed that he was carrying 20 tablets on him. Ten of the tablets were contained in a matchbox, the other ten were inside a piece of foil. The applicant was also in possession of $597. Police seized this money. 

12The tablets were later analysed and were found to weigh a total of 5.87 grams of the prohibited drug, commonly known as ecstasy. The purity of the tablets was 25 per cent. 

13In addition to the offence for which he was found guilty, the applicant was also charged with an offence of supplying a prohibited drug, namely ten tablets of ecstasy, on 19 December 2008. This referred to the transaction of which Mr Mostyn in due course gave evidence at trial as having occurred on the evening of 19 December 2008 before the police spoke to and arrested the applicant. 

14The jury found the applicant not guilty of that offence. 

15A charge of unlawfully obtained goods in custody ($597) was by a certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 put before the sentencing judge. It is not clear precisely how his Honour dealt with this matter nor the basis for any orders which he made. However, the order which he made on this matter formed no part of the present application and accordingly can be put to one side. 

Applicant's Submission on the Trial 

16The applicant gave evidence at the trial. He told the jury that he was then 43 years of age, that he was the father of two children, then aged 20 and 17. He had operated a business in Coffs Harbour between 2001 and 2005, engaged in the servicing and maintaining of boats. The business ceased trading in 2005. His wife left him in that year and although he continued to care for both of his children, after some time his older son went to live with his former wife. 

17In 2006, the applicant told the jury he had had a particularly difficult year because due to the deterioration of his financial circumstances his matrimonial home was sold, his mother had fallen seriously ill that year and died, he himself had suffered from a serious illness and had been hospitalised, and of course he was unemployed and relied on social security payments throughout the period. 

18From about mid 2008 onwards the applicant had moved out of a rented home and occupied a rented mobile home with his younger son. 

19It was the applicant's case before the jury that his possession of the 20 tablets was entirely for his own use. 

20He gave extensive evidence that regularly on every second weekend throughout 2008, from about June onwards, he had been accustomed to attending at the Plantation Hotel and purchasing four ecstasy tablets at a time. It was then his regular habit to take two of the tablets immediately and then some hours later, as their effect wore off, he would take the remaining two. 

21According to the applicant's evidence, because he was in possession of more than the usual sum of money from social security in December, and he was intending to travel to Queensland to spend the Christmas period with his sister, and because he could obtain a discount on the individual tablet price if he bought 20 tablets, he had, that evening, purchased 20 tablets from Mr John Mostyn and had them in his possession for his own use. 

22That account of the applicant was challenged by the Crown in cross-examination during the trial. 

23It was the Crown's case, and the cross-examination was directed to this end, that the applicant was engaged in selling the tablets to make some extra money over and above his social security payments, and that on the particular evening in question, having supplied Mr Mostyn with 10 ecstasy tablets (about which the jury were not satisfied), that he was at the Hotel because there was a disco underway at which there were a number of young people in attendance. It was said on the Crown case that the applicant was intending to sell the drugs to those attending the disco. 

24Both the applicant's counsel and the Crown in this Court, accepted that the verdicts of the jury at the trial were explicable upon the basis that the jury had a reasonable doubt about whether the applicant sold any tablets to Mr Mostyn, and conversely, it was clear that the jury were not persuaded on the balance of probabilities that the 20 ecstasy tablets found on the applicant were for his own use. 

25The relevance of the last matter upon which counsel were agreed is to be found in s 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act . That section provides that where a person is found in possession of a traffickable quantity of the prohibited drug, then he or she is deemed to have the drug in their possession for supply unless: 

""... the person proves that he or she had the prohibited drug in his or her possession otherwise than for supply ..."" 

26Clearly, if the jury had accepted that the possession of the 20 tablets were for the applicant's personal use, then there would not have been any question of a deemed supply and the jury would not have proceeded to a conviction under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act . 

27The traffickable quantity of 3,4-methylenedioxymethylanphetamine is 0.75 grams. The indictable quantity is 1.25 grams. The weight of the drug with which the applicant was found was clearly in excess of these amounts. It was significantly less than the commercial quantity of 125 grams: Schedule 1 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act . 

Applicant's Submissions on Sentence 

28The submissions on sentence were taken on Friday, 4 June 2010. 

29The applicant did not give any further evidence on the hearing of the sentencing proceedings. The sentencing judge had the benefit of a pre-sentence report, a report of a clinical psychologist, Mr Sam Borenstein, and a letter from the applicant's sister. In addition, the applicant's son, Benjamin, gave sworn evidence. At the commencement of the hearing on that day, Mr Brewer, a lawyer who appeared for the applicant, asked for a short adjournment so that he might have a conference with and speak to the applicant. His Honour granted that request. But before standing the matter down, his Honour made this remark: 

""You go and talk to Mr Michael. I might say he's got some problems because he was caught in a hotel actually distributing drugs to people at a dance, so ..."" 

30Unsurprisingly, in light of the apparently erroneous view which these remarks represented, the applicant's lawyer reminded his Honour that that was a matter of a disputed fact and he would be making submissions about it. 

31After the adjournment, when the proceedings were resumed, it was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the judge would have regard to the fact that whilst he had a criminal record, it was not a serious one and there were no matters relating to the supply of drugs being recorded. 

32It was also submitted that the learned sentencing judge would have regard to the contents of the report of Mr Borenstein with respect to a number of aspects of the subjective case of the applicant. It was submitted that the report of Mr Borenstein and the report of the Probation and Parole Service were largely in agreement and that his Honour would take those subjective factors about the applicant's social history and psychological state into account. 

33It was put that the evidence did not suggest that the applicant was a "" career drug supplier "" and further, that the difficulties in the applicant's life to which I have made reference, were such as to provide the context and background of the applicant's engaging in this one offence. 

34In its submissions, the Crown merely recorded a submission that the matter was properly one which required the imposition of a sentence which included a period of fulltime custody, but it made no submission to the sentencing judge as to the appropriate length of that fulltime custody period. The Crown said ""... as to how long is a matter for you"" . 

Remarks on Sentence 

35With respect to the jury's guilty finding, his Honour said this: 

""However, they found him guilty of the second count. Again this was not a surprise, to have a man in his forties with a pocket full of ecstasy tablets and cash in a disco for young people at the Plantation Hotel, it was hardly a surprise that they would find him guilty on the basis that he had these drugs in his possession for the purpose of supply"". 

36His Honour recorded, briefly but accurately, the subjective case of the applicant. 

37He turned to the disputed question of fact as to the purpose for which the applicant was in possession of the 20 ecstasy tablets. His Honour resolved this question because he did not accept the applicant as a truthful witness when the applicant gave evidence that he was a user of ecstasy. In that respect, his Honour said this: 

""I do not believe him when he said he had these drugs for his own use and indeed the jury did not believe him because they found him guilty. 

It has been put to me by his counsel that he had these drugs partly for his own use and partly for sale so that he could get more money to buy more drugs. That is a fairly common occurrence of drug users. In my opinion there is no evidence that would support such a claim, except his evidence, and in my view, he is not a truthful witness. 

In my opinion he was in the Plantation Hotel with the drugs in his possession for the purpose of selling to young people who were at the disco. If he had not been apprehended by police at the time that is what he would have ended up doing. The money that he had in his possession at the time was something over $500 and in my opinion it was proceeds from sales, before he was arrested."" 

38His Honour entirely discounted the report of Mr Borenstein, the clinical psychologist, largely because it was based upon what the applicant had told Mr Borenstein, and his Honour found that he was not satisfied that the applicant was credible. 

39His Honour then recorded his findings somewhat briefly in the following way: 

""People who act to distribute drugs of addiction, such as ecstasy, can expect to receive gaol sentences and that is what he will receive. He will receive a gaol sentence that is tempered by the fact that this is the first time that he will have been to gaol and he could not be regarded as being a long term drug dealer. He should be sentenced on the basis that this is an occasion in which he took the opportunity to get drugs from someone and sell them in the Plantation Hotel for the purpose of making money."" 

40His Honour then imposed the sentence to which I have earlier made reference. His Honour expressed the view that it was: ""... a relatively modest one "". 

Grounds of Appeal 

41Four grounds of appeal are relied upon by the applicant: 

""1. His Honour erroneously fettered his discretion to impose a sentence other than one of full time custody. 

2. His Honour erred in not accepting the applicant had become a drug user in the months before his arrest. 

3. His Honour erred in concluding that the applicant did not need continuing psychological assistance. 

4. The sentence is manifestly excessive."" 

Ground 1 

42It was clear that the applicant had never previously been convicted of supplying a prohibited drug. It was submitted by the applicant that the amounts involved in this case were modest and there was a real question as to whether he could have been said to have been involved in drug trafficking "" ... to a substantial degree "". 

43This submission was based upon a consistent line of authority in this Court that where an offender has been "" substantially involved in the supply of a prohibited drug "", unless there are truly exceptional circumstances, a fulltime custodial sentence ought to be imposed: see R v Gu [2006] NSWCCA 104 per Howie J (Grove and Simpson JJ agreeing); Scott v R [2010] NSWCCA 103 at [27]-[29] per Hislop J (Allsop P and Grove J agreeing). 

44In R v Ozer, unreported, NSWCCA (9 November 1993), Hunt CJ at CL held that where an offence was a limited and isolated event, the offender was not trafficking in the sense in which he had used that expression. 

45In R v Gip (2006) 161 A Crim R 173, when considering this line of authority McClellan CJ at CL discussed two unreported decisions of this Court, namely R v Clark, unreported, NSWCCA (15 March 1990) and R v Bardo , unreported, NSWCCA (14 July 1992). These were the decisions to which Hunt CJ at CL had referred in Ozer . McClellan CJ at CL said at [13] this: 

""My understanding of these various statements is that where a finding can be made that an offender has engaged in repeated offences so that his or her activities can be described as trafficking, a full time custodial sentence should, unless there are exceptional circumstances, be imposed. However, if only one offence can be proved, but the circumstances surrounding that offence indicate that it was the result of a sophisticated commercial arrangement, the objective criminality involved may also require a custodial sentence, unless exceptional circumstances can otherwise be shown."" 

46Rothman J in Gip cautioned that the views expressed in Clark and Bardo ought not be regarded as if they were a legislative enactment. He said that the proper approach for a sentencing judge was to concentrate on the substance of what was revealed by the facts in each case. At [43]-[44] he said: 

""43. The ultimate question is whether the accused is involved, in the ordinary sense, in trafficking. The mere fact that a person has been caught on only one occasion does not mean the person is not involved in trafficking. The question for the sentencing judge is whether there are facts, proven beyond a reasonable doubt, which facts give rise to an exercise of discretion consistent with the approach in Clark . Those facts may be an agreement to supply on another occasion, and attempt to supply on another occasion, participation in a process which envisages supply on more than one occasion, participation in a syndicate, or a number of other circumstances. 

44. The ultimate question must be whether, on the application of ordinary principles of sentencing, full-time custody is warranted. In any situation where the person has been shown to have been involved (directly or indirectly) in an ongoing arrangement, or intended ongoing arrangement, for the supply of drugs, that person, for the purpose of the sentencing principle, should be taken to have been involved in trafficking. The isolated, one off incident of supply, ... does not include persons who, although charged with one offence, are otherwise shown to have an involvement in a process which contemplates supply on more than one occasion. That could be shown, as already stated, by proving any one of a range of activities which give rise to the inference of past, present or future involvement in trafficking."" 

47I respectfully agree with the statement of Rothman J as to the proper approach by a sentencing judge, in the circumstances of a case such as this. 

48The remarks of the sentencing judge which I have extracted above at [39] do not make it plain that his Honour gave any consideration to this line of authority in this Court. What his Honour was required to do for the purpose of sentencing was to determine whether this was an isolated act of supply, or whether it could properly be said that the applicant was involved in trafficking to a substantial degree or else involved in a process which contemplated supply on more than one occasion. 

49The remarks of his Honour do not indicate that he did this. Rather they indicate that he took the view that jail sentences ought automatically be imposed on people who are convicted of offences such as the applicant was. By taking this erroneous approach, the learned sentencing judge eliminated from his consideration a range of penalty options which were open for consideration as part of the proper exercise of his discretion. 

50It is to be recalled that in this case, the applicant was charged with supplying the prohibited drug upon the basis of the quantity which was in his possession. The sentencing judge made no finding that there were any facts which gave rise to any inference of drug trafficking, he made no finding that there was any drug trafficking nor that this was anything other than a single occasion when the applicant was involved in the offence of supply of drugs. On the contrary, the final sentence of his Honour's remarks seems to suggest that the conduct on the evening of the applicant's arrest was an isolated event. 

51There was a particular importance in the judge addressing this issue in this case because the jury had found the applicant not guilty of the first count in the indictment which was a count of actual supply to Mr Mostyn earlier during the evening of his arrest. Faced with the jury verdict, a finding by the sentencing judge that the applicant's conduct mandated a full time custodial sentence because he had a substantial involvement in drug trafficking, needed additional proved facts from which that inference could be drawn. They were not found by the sentencing judge and are not readily to be found in the record of the proceedings. 

52In those circumstances, his Honour was in error to take the view that the facts of this case required sentencing only to a term of fulltime custody. On the contrary, the facts of this case and one of his Honour's findings, suggested that this was an isolated incident and it was open to his Honour to consider the full range of penalty options. His Honour did not do this. 

53The applicant is entitled to succeed on this ground. 

Ground 2 

54This ground of appeal suggests an error by the sentencing judge in not accepting that the applicant had become a drug user in the months before his arrest. 

55The evidence that the applicant was using drugs in the months before his arrest was a matter of contest before the jury. 

56There were a number of sources of evidence that the applicant was a drug user. The applicant gave evidence on his oath to the jury. As well, there were the accounts which the applicant himself gave to Mr Borenstein, the clinical psychologist, to Ms Clements, the Probation and Parole Officer who compiled the pre-sentence report, and to his sister, who recorded that account in her letter to the sentencing judge. 

57The applicant's son, Benjamin, who gave evidence at the sentence hearing denied any knowledge of his father consuming illicit drugs. 

58As is plain from the jury's conviction, and as counsel for the applicant accepted, the jury must have rejected the applicant's evidence that he had the drugs in his possession for personal use. 

59His Honour, having observed the applicant give evidence both in chief and under cross-examination, formed the view that he would not believe the applicant's evidence about his personal usage of drugs. He went further and said that he was satisfied that the applicant's evidence was not truthful or honest. Although expressed in this general way, the context of the sentencing remarks suggest that this finding was directed to the disputed question of whether the applicant himself used drugs. 

60Because his Honour formed the conclusion that he could not rely upon the applicant as a witness of truth, he made a finding that he did not accept that he used drugs. This is a finding of fact which the applicant seeks to overturn. 

61This Court is confined in its approach to overturning findings of fact by a sentencing judge. McCallum J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden J agreed) said in McBeth v R [2009] NSWSCCA 235 at [30]: 

""30 Many of the applicant's grounds concern the sentencing Judge's findings of fact. It must be recalled, however, that the task of this Court is confined to determining whether there was error in the sentencing of the applicant on the principles stated in House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504-505. This Court's power to substitute its own findings of fact for those of the trial judge arises only if the Judge 'mistakes the facts' in the sense there understood. It is necessary to establish that there is no evidence to support the finding, or that the evidence is 'all one way', or that the Judge has misdirected himself: R v O'Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397 at 401 per Hunt J, Carruthers and Wood JJ agreeing."" 

62See also Furia v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 326 at [35] per R A Hulme J (Giles JA and Hislop J agreeing). 

63Particularly where demeanour of a witness while giving evidence has been a central element in the assessment of the credibility of a witness, then the circumstances are likely to be exceptional before this Court would regard itself as being in a position to come to a different factual finding. 

64The finding of fact subject to this ground of appeal was open to the sentencing judge. It is the view which the Crown contended for, and it is the view which, at least to some extent, the jury accepted. 

65Importantly, it is a conclusion in which the demeanour and credibility of the applicant was a relevant and central consideration. 

66I cannot be satisfied that the sentencing judge's finding was one occasioned by misuse of his advantage nor that the decision was the result of an absence of evidence or other error by the sentencing judge, and accordingly it is not a matter upon which this Court should intervene. 

67This ground of appeal fails. 

Ground 3 

68It is submitted in this ground that his Honour erred in concluding that the applicant did not need continuing psychological assistance. 

69The applicant submits that even if the learned sentencing judge disbelieved the applicant's evidence as to his personal drug use there remained a body of unchallenged evidence which detailed substantial difficulties encountered by the applicant in his life during the period 2005 to 2006 and in subsequent years which led to the opinions expressed that the applicant needed ongoing psychological counselling and assistance. 

70The Crown submitted that it was open to the sentencing judge to disregard the two reports as he had done. 

71The Crown tendered to the Court a Probation and Parole Service Pre-Sentence Report. It was compiled by Ms Clements on 6 May 2010. She concluded: 

"" Suitability for Supervision 

Taking into account all of the above information and incorporating a standardised risk/needs assessment process, the offender is suitable for a medium level of intervention by this Service, commensurate with the assessed risk. The individualised case plan would include strategies to address the following identified areas of criminogenic need: 

Drug and Alcohol Issues - referral to appropriate treatment programmes or counselling in regard to his drug use and monitoring of his progress. 

Mental Health Issues/Grief Issues - encourage attendance at appropriate programmes and treatment options to address issues connected to his possible depression, unresolved grief issues, and coping skills. 

Positive Activities/Employment and Training options - referral to appropriate job training and education programmes. Encourage participation in employment programs such as the personal support programme run by Centrelink."" 

72Ms Clements' report was based on an interview with the applicant, a telephone interview with the applicant's sister, a telephone interview with a friend of the applicant, and a perusal of the relevant service records, court depositions and police facts. 

73As well, the applicant's son gave evidence which corroborated, albeit in short form, the substance of the history, excluding personal drug use, which the applicant gave the Probation and Parole Service. 

74His Honour referred to information which had been provided by the applicant to the Probation and Parole Service by way of history and background. He noted that the applicant had told the Probation and Parole Service about his personal drug use which his Honour noted he did not believe. However, his Honour made no other reference to the conclusions of the Probation and Parole Service, gave no indication whether he accepted or rejected the opinions which were expressed and did not indicate whether he regarded the fact that the Probation and Parole Service had taken histories and made inquiries of people other than the applicant merited any consideration. His Honour seemed entirely to disregard the report, and he rejected the recommendation of ongoing counselling and treatment. It seems to be clear that his Honour gave the Probation and Parole Report no weight whatsoever, and only because he disbelieved the applicant on the question of his personal drug use, and found him not to be a truthful witness in that respect. 

75There was also a report by a clinical psychologist, Mr Sam Borenstein. 

76Mr Borenstein was a clinical psychologist, well qualified, who had been in practice for over 20 years and was well experienced in consulting patients with a broad spectrum of psychological conditions. 

77Mr Borenstein interviewed the applicant at length and obtained a detailed history and background. He made observations of the applicant during the examination. For example, he noted that the applicant was ""... clearly anxious, tense and agitated. His mood is deemed to be severely depressed. He presented as emotional and teary "". 

78He expressed this opinion: 

""Mr Michael ... developed a significant depressive illness typified by sleep disturbance, appetite disturbance, weight loss, reduced concentration, impaired motivation, distractibility, anhedonia, guilt, nihilistic thinking, withdrawal and isolation. 

... 

On examination, Mr Michael was clearly depressed and highly emotional. He is uncertain as to how to proceed in life. ... 

Mr Michael's decision has had a disastrous effect on him. He now reflects on his life circumstances, and as stated, is in the throws of a Major Depressive Illness. 

Mr Michael remains with unresolved grief, particularly as it pertains to his ex-wife and death of his mother. Mr Michael enjoys a very close relationship with his sister, who is twelve months older. He rarely sees his brother who is ten years his senior. 

Upon release from gaol, Mr Michael should undertake relevant psychological assistance, not only with regards to helping reconstruct his life but also to deal with his propensity to depression and anxiety. Mr Michael has not properly resolved significant losses sustained within a twelve month period between 2005 and 2006, of the sort documented in the body of this report."" 

79Mr Borenstein went on to recommend that the applicant should undertake 12 sessions with a clinical psychologist to treat his depressive illness. 

80Mr Borenstein was not required for cross-examination by the Crown, and accordingly, there has been no direct challenge to the contents of his report. When the report was tendered on 4 June 2010, the Crown simply made this submission: 

""Woods: I have seen the documents your Honour, no objection to its tender. The findings and conclusions in the report are based on the self reporting of Mr Michael to the psychologist. There is no indication that any tests were administered. Apparently there is something called deemed depression, I'm not sure what that is. What weight your Honour attaches to it is a matter for you."" 

81The fact that his Honour was not inclined to accept Mr Borenstein's report became apparent within a few minutes after it was tendered when, during submissions by the applicant's lawyer, his Honour said: 

""His Honour: Mr Borenstein's report is not worth tuppence halfpenny is it? Its not a psychologist's report, all it is the taking of a history and in the history your client apparently told him he was depressed, so he says he's depressed. He carried out no tests on him, he just accepts everything he says. Why would I think it's of any value anyway? Most people in gaol are pretty depressed, a pretty depressing place to be, so what."" 

82The applicant's lawyer submitted to the sentencing judge that in fact he would be wrong to regard Mr Borenstein's report in that way, the history and background which he had was, in fact, corroborated, and that Mr Borenstein's clinical skill and expertise was a matter which should be taken into account in deciding whether to rely upon the report. 

83In his remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge made reference to this report. He concluded that it was largely based on what the applicant had told Mr Borenstein. He noted that he did not regard the applicant's claim to be a drug user as being true. His Honour then appears to have discounted the entirety of the report without regard to the fact that much of the material in the report was corroborated both by the Probation and Parole Service Report, and also by the evidence of the applicant's son. As well, there was no reason to disbelieve the accuracy of the history which was given. There was nothing about the evidence which the applicant gave during the trial which would have enabled the sentencing judge to disbelieve that material. 

84Of the report, the sentencing judge said: 

""Mr Borenstein is also of the opinion that the offender needed continuing psychological assistance. I am unable to see on what basis that could be so."" 

85As I have said, the Crown did not cross-examine Mr Borenstein with respect to this opinion nor were any submissions made which were directed to this particular conclusion. His Honour clearly gave the report no weight whatsoever. Whatever view his Honour took about the veracity of the applicant with respect to his claim to have used ecstasy tablets in the months leading up to his arrest, I can discern no adequate basis to disregard the entirety of Mr Borenstein's report and give it no weight whatsoever. 

86Much of the material was corroborated by other reports and evidence before his Honour. As well, his Honour seems to have completely mistaken Mr Borenstein's recommendation for further psychological counselling. He seems to have believed it had something to do with the drug usage which the applicant said that he was engaged in. In fact, what Mr Borenstein recommended was psychological assistance dealing with the applicant's propensity to depression and anxiety and assisting him to resolve grief issues surrounding the significant losses sustained in the period 2005 and 2006. 

87This ground of appeal is based upon the proposition that the sentencing judge was in error in giving no weight to the conclusion of the two expert reports before him about the need for the applicant to have ongoing psychological care and assistance. 

88Error has been demonstrated. His Honour was not entitled to give these reports no weight at all. They were entitled to a consideration in the matrix of material before his Honour on the sentencing issue. What weight they ought to have been given was something which his Honour needed to consider and determine. His Honour failed to do this. 

89The relevance of the recommendations in the report is that they ought lead to a consideration of all of the appropriate sentencing options including the appropriate length of time which the applicant should spend in jail without parole, and the appropriate length of time for which the applicant ought to have been subject to supervision whilst on parole. 

90This ground of appeal succeeds. 

Ground 4 

91The applicant submits that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 

92As indicated above, I am of the opinion with respect to grounds 1 and 3 that the exercise of sentencing discretion by the sentencing judge was in error and that it has miscarried, because he ought to have had regard to matters of evidence to which he had no regard, and that he ought to have had regard to a broader range of penalty options than he did. Unless I can be satisfied on the basis of the evidence now before this Court, and having regard to proper sentencing principles, that the sentence imposed, despite the error, was an appropriate one, then the applicant is entitled to have the sentence quashed and to be resentenced: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. See Baxter v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 237. 

93In those circumstances, it is unnecessary to give detailed consideration to this ground because ""manifest excess"" is only another kind of error which is sufficient to engage the process required by s 6(3): Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [6] per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J, [59]-[60] per Kirby J; Baxter at [14] per Spigelman CJ. 

94Given the nature of this kind of offence and the variety of factual circumstances which will fall for consideration by a sentencing judge with respect to an offence such as this, it is necessary to be cautious when expressing views as to manifest excessiveness, or manifest inadequacy, of a sentence unless necessary so to do. In this case it is not necessary. 

Resentence 

95It is necessary for this Court to re-exercise the sentencing discretion, having regard to the evidence, relevant statutory requirements, and the principles of sentencing to see if it is of the opinion for the purpose of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act , that a lesser sentence is warranted in law. 

96There were particular features of this case including the subjective features of the applicant, which indicate that it is not a typical example of an offence found of this kind. 

97The offence is a serious one. It is one where the authorities require that general deterrence must be given importance. 

98On the other hand, on the facts proved, this was a single event, the quantity of the drugs of which the applicant was in possession was towards the low end of the scale, and the Crown did not establish any history of supply or any facts demonstrating ongoing participation to a substantial degree in the supply of drugs. 

99The criminality of the offence was at the lower end of the scale. The applicant had a strong subjective case and would benefit from appropriate psychological help and assistance. 

100Having regard to the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I would impose the following sentence: 

(a) Non-parole period of 15 months commencing on 10 March 2010 which was the date the applicant was taken into custody, and expiring on 9 June 2011; 

(b) A balance of term of 15 months commencing on 10 June 2011 and expiring on 9 September 2012; 

(c) The applicant is to be released on parole on 9 June 2011. 

Orders 

(1) Appeal allowed. 

(2) Sentence of Finnane DCJ of 11 June 2010 quashed. 

(3) In lieu, the applicant is sentenced as follows: 
(a) Non-parole period of 15 months commencing on 10 March 2010 which was the date the applicant was taken into custody, and expiring on 9 June 2011; 
(b) A balance of term of 15 months commencing on 10 June 2011 and expiring on 9 September 2012; 
(c) The applicant is to be released on parole on 9 June 2011.

2709678,R v Shirley Justins [2011] NSWSC 568,"sentence 

1The offender, Shirley Justins, pleaded guilty on 1 April 2011 to aiding and abetting the suicide of Graeme Wylie between 18 March and 22 March 2006. The plea was accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of an indictment charging manslaughter as the principal offence. The plea came after the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the offender's conviction for manslaughter by gross criminal negligence, following a trial in May and June of 2008 : see Justins v R [2010] NSWCCA 242. 

2The offence under s 31C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. For reasons that are wholly related to the history of the prosecution arising out of the death of Mr. Wylie, it is not appropriate to impose any custodial penalty on the offender. It is nonetheless evident from the maximum penalty that the Legislature regards conduct which assists a person to commit suicide as a serious breach of the criminal law. 

3The agreed facts for the purpose of sentence are the following. Mr Wylie, the deceased, was born in 1934 and grew up in Tasmania. From 1957 until his retirement in 1983, he was employed with Qantas as a captain. The evidence at trial suggested that he was a proud, intellectually rigorous man. He had two daughters and had separated from their mother in 1976. Mr Wylie and the offender commenced cohabiting in 1988. 

4Mr Wylie and Ms Jenning (a co-offender who died following the trial) had been friends since the 1970s. Mr Wylie introduced the offender to Ms Jenning and they became close friends. Ms Jenning was active in a pro-euthanasia organisation. 

5In March 2003, Mr Wylie was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Following his diagnosis, the disease progressed relatively swiftly. The evidence at trial established that Mr Wylie's conversation became increasingly limited, he forgot the names of old friends and of family members, he stopped reading and watching television and he appeared disoriented as to time and place. Mr Wylie's interests contracted and he became depressed. 

6By January 2005, Mr Wylie suffered severe cognitive impairment. By mid-2005 he rarely left the home. 

7In September 2005, Mr Wylie attempted suicide by cutting his wrists. The offender took him to a general practitioner who was not his usual doctor. The offender did not tell the doctor of Mr Wylie's diagnosis. 

8In late September 2005, Mr Wylie raised the idea of legal euthanasia with the offender and Ms Jenning. In October 2005, the offender, with the assistance of Ms Jenning, applied for legal euthanasia to the organisation Dignitas in Switzerland. 

9Dignitas contacted Dr Phillip Nitschke of EXIT International. Dignitas stated that they required their patients to have full command of their faculties and that they were concerned about Mr Wylie's Alzheimer's disease. Dignitas asked Dr Nitschke to assess Mr Wylie's cognitive function. 

10On 16 November 2005, Dr Nitschke visited Mr Wylie at his home. According to Dr Nitschke's evidence, Mr Wylie was unable to recall his date of birth or the number, age or sex of his children Notwithstanding this, on 24 November 2005 Dr Nitschke informed Dignitas that although Mr Wylie suffered cognitive impairment, he retained ""significant insight"" and wanted to travel to Switzerland to die. 

11In December 2005 Dignitas informed the offender that Mr Wylie's application had been rejected, due to concern about his mental capacity. Shortly thereafter, Ms Jenning offered to travel to Mexico to buy pentobarbitone for the offender to give to Mr Wylie. 

12On 2 February 2006, Mr Wylie was admitted to hospital after a fall following a failed suicide attempt. He presented with a fractured left hip and an injured right shoulder. The offender gave evidence that while he was in hospital, she discussed with him Ms Jenning's proposed trip to Mexico. 

13In February 2006, the offender, Ms Jenning and Mr Wylie agreed that Ms Jenning would fly to Mexico to purchase Nembutal. Accordingly, on 16 February 2006, Ms Jenning booked a flight to Los Angeles, departing 13 March. 

14On 20 February 2006, Mr Wylie was discharged from hospital. Three days later the offender took him to see the doctor they had previously consulted for a Maxolon prescription. Maxolon is an anti-nausea drug used to aid in the ingestion of pentobarbitone. The offender did not tell that doctor about the plan to give Mr Wylie pentobarbitone. By this time, Mr Wylie could not read and had very little conversation. 

15On 3 March, the offender and Mr Wylie attended a solicitor. The offender produced Mr Wylie's will dated 1995 that bequeathed half of his estate (worth about $2 million) to the offender and 25% each to his two daughters. The offender instructed the solicitor to change the will so that each daughter received $100,000 and the balance was payable to the offender. This will was signed by Mr Wylie on 15 March 2006, after the offender had obtained a medical certificate for him from the doctor who had prescribed the Maxolon. The offender did not tell the solicitor that Mr Wylie suffered advanced Alzheimer's disease. The offender has since acknowledged that Mr Wylie did not have testamentary capacity at this time. 

16On 18 March 2006, Ms Jenning returned to Australia from Mexico, with at least one bottle of pentobarbitone. The next day she gave the phial of pentobarbitone to the offender. 

17On the morning of 22 March 2006, the offender made the pentobarbitone available to Mr Wylie in a glass. According to the offender, Mr Wylie became unconscious within several minutes. The offender then drove to Ms Jenning's home in Woollahra and gave her the empty Nembutal bottle. The offender then went shopping with a friend, returning around 12 p.m. She did this in order to raise an alibi for the time of death. When she returned home, Mr Wylie was dead. 

18The offender then made various unsuccessful attempts to obtain a death certificate for Mr Wylie. She contacted a medical practice and a doctor from that practice attended at the home. That doctor refused to issue a full death certificate because she had not seen Mr Wylie in the two months prior to his death. 

19After the doctor left the home, Ms Jenning arrived. Police were called to arrange the transport of the deceased's body to the morgue for a post mortem. The offender and Ms Jenning told both the attending doctor and the police that they believed the drug Aricept, which was prescribed to Mr Wylie for his Alzheimer's disease, was the cause of his death. 

20On 24 March 2006 a post mortem on Mr Wylie established the cause of death as pentobarbitone toxicity. Mr Wylie's brain showed signs of advanced Alzheimer's disease. 

21The offender was charged with murder on 27 January 2007. An alternative count was in the form of the present charge. At trial the offender pleaded not guilty to both counts. However, midway through the trial the offender pleaded guilty to the alternative charge, which was not then accepted by the Crown. She gave sworn evidence during the trial admitting her involvement in both the purchase of the Nembutal and in its administration to Mr Wylie. 

22The offender was found guilty of manslaughter by gross criminal negligence on 19 June 2008. She was sentenced on 12 November 2008 to periodic detention, with a non-parole period of 22 months to date from 21 November 2008, expiring 20 September 2010, and a parole period of eight months to expire on 20 May 2011. It follows that the offender has served the entirety of that sentence, which was imposed in respect of a more serious offence than that for which the offender presently stands to be sentenced. 

23A report under the hand of Mr Borenstein, a clinical psychologist, describes the offender having ""an unremarkable personal and family history"", and a strong work ethic since the age of 16. The offender has no prior criminal history. She describes herself as ""law abiding"". The offender thought of Mr Wylie as her life partner. Her description to the psychologist of the events leading up to his death portray the offender as the passive partner in the relationship with the deceased, and in her dealings with Ms Jenning. The offender described Ms Jenning as quite forceful and dominating. The offender claimed that she only ever acted in the best interests of Mr Wylie, who had repeatedly instructed her that he did not wish to go into care. 

24The Crown takes issue with this aspect of the offender's account, in that the offender's role in changing her partner's will justifies the conclusion that her assistance in his suicide was not entirely altruistic, but was motivated to some degree by self-interest. Whilst this submission appears to be well founded, it does not materially affect the exercise of the sentencing discretion in the circumstances of this case. That is because the Crown concedes that the sentence the offender has already served adequately reflects the criminality of the offending on the present charge. 

25That concession is properly made. Had the Court been called upon to sentence the offender on the present charge in June 2008 when the plea of guilty was first offered, no greater penalty than that already imposed would have been justified. Accordingly, the only order which is appropriate in the present circumstances is that the offender be sentenced to the rising of the Court. 

26Ms Justins, you are convicted of the offence of Aid and Abet Suicide. You are sentenced to the rising of the Court.

2709687,R v Jade Carly FENNELL [2011] NSWSC 489,"remarks on sentence 

1Jade Carly Fennell has pleaded guilty to the charge of accessory after the fact to the murder of Jay Riley in that she assisted Adam John Thompson who had murdered, to her knowledge, the previously mentioned Mr Riley. 

2At the outset I should point out that it is no part of the Crown case against Ms Fennell that she had any inkling that Mr Riley was to be robbed and/or murdered. It is the Crown case that she assisted Mr Thompson in two distinct ways, one of which is the subject of this charge and the other the subject of a Form 1, to be taken into account in the sentence to be imposed. It is the Court's function, now, to impose that sentence and, before doing so, make some remarks as to the sentence to be imposed. 

3The facts of the offence, including, where relevant, the murder, should be stated briefly. Ms Fennell was in a relationship with Mr Thompson for approximately four years. They married on 23 February 2010. Mr Thompson who is charged with the murder of Mr Riley met Mr Riley through their respective employment, some six months before the murder. 

4Mr Riley supplied Mr Thompson with illegal drugs (amphetamines) on a regular basis. 

5On 14 December 2009, Mr Riley left work early alleging he was ill. He attended a medical practice in Charlestown where he was diagnosed with tonsillitis. He returned home, contacted his mother and then his girlfriend by phone and at about 5.38pm that day attended a pharmacy at Cardiff, before returning some borrowed DVDs. He was not again sighted. 

6Mr Thompson lived, with Ms Fennell, in premises in Greta, and Mr Hamilton (an alleged co-accused of Mr Thompson) lived in a shed in the backyard of the property. 

7On 14 December 2009, that is, the date Mr Riley was last seen alive, his telephone records show that he had a number of contacts with Mr Thompson, the last being a text message sent about 6.23pm. The phone was switched off at 6.30pm that day. Conversely, the telephone records of Mr Thompson reveal that Mr Riley was his only telephone contact during that day. The next use of Mr Thompson's phone was a text message sent by him to Mr Hamilton at 12.10am on 15 December 2009. Mr Thompson then made a phone call to Ms Fennell at 4.23am that day. 

8Mr Riley's mobile phone was reactivated at 11.30am on 15 December 2009, using a SIM card belonging to Mr Hamilton. The phone was later recovered from Mr Hamilton. 

9On the morning of 18 May 2010, police spoke with Ms Fennell at her new premises, at which she was staying after having separated from Mr Thompson. She attended the police station, was informed of her rights and took part in an electronically recorded interview. 

10During the course of the interview Ms Fennell told the police that she had not been home on the day in which the murder occurred. She had returned home that evening and Mr Thompson had indicated to her that he wished to speak to her. 

11According to Ms Fennell, Mr Thompson said that he had arranged to meet Mr Riley to purchase two ounces of speed. Mr Thompson told Ms Fennell that when he met with Mr Riley he produced a rifle, mainly to get the drugs. Mr Thompson said that the deceased lunged at the gun and he, Mr Thompson, panicked and the gun went off. 

12Ms Fennell told the police that she had seen a gun before. Mr Thompson had inherited a .410 shotgun from his father. She had also seen ammunition for the gun. 

13Ms Fennell told the police that Mr Thompson had told her that the gun had been taken care of and she had assumed that Mr Thompson had disposed of it. Mr Thompson had told her that there was nothing at the scene which could be traced back to him. 

14Ms Fennell also gave police details of the clothes that Mr Thompson had been wearing earlier in the day and indicated that Mr Thompson had washed them or had disposed of them. Ms Fennell denied that she had been to the scene of the shooting, at any time. She also informed the police that she had real fears of Mr Thompson on the day that she was being interviewed and had even greater fears at the time that the incident occurred. She informed the police that the Toyota Land Cruiser, which Mr Thompson had used on the day of the killing, had been subsequently sold before the two of them went to Darwin to be married in February 2010. 

15During the interview, Ms Fennell made no mention of any money being taken during the robbery or of any property of the deceased that was available either to Mr Thompson or to her. 

16Later that day Ms Fennell was arrested and interviewed. The police, apparently, offered Ms Fennell an immunity from prosecution after which Ms Fennell made certain admissions in an unrecorded conversation. At that time or shortly thereafter the police became aware that there had been some misunderstanding on their part and that they were not entitled to offer Ms Fennell an immunity. They informed Ms Fennell of these facts. 

17Some two hours later, another police officer spoke with Ms Fennell and interviewed her, the ERISP for which is before the Court. In that interview the police made it clear that there was no offer of immunity, that nothing she had said to the police earlier (i.e. after being offered the immunity) could be used against her, but that what she may say thereafter could be used in evidence against her. Ms Fennell indicated that she understood all of that, that the earlier inducement had, or would have, no impact upon any decision she made to assist, and indicated that she would continue to assist. 

18Thereafter, she informed the police that Mr Thompson told her that he had killed Mr Riley. He had arranged to meet Mr Riley at Mount Sugarloaf on the pretext of purchasing drugs. Mr Thompson had told Ms Fennell that it was Mr Thompson's intention to rob the deceased of the drugs and money, as he needed money for bills and for Christmas. Mr Thompson explained to her that Mr Riley did not know where Mr Thompson lived and, therefore, there would be no repercussions. Mr Thompson met with Mr Riley at Mount Sugarloaf, while armed with his father's loaded shotgun, and shot Mr Riley in panic, when Mr Riley lunged at the gun. 

19According to Ms Fennell, Mr Thompson said that he had placed Mr Riley's body into the boot of Mr Riley's car, which he then drove further into the bush. Mr Thompson had taken drugs and about $2,000 in cash. Mr Thompson was worried about the discovery of the deceased's body, but was sure that he was dead because he had shot him in the head. 

20Ms Fennell and Mr Thompson then went and saw Mr Hamilton, who stressed the need to dispose of the gun. Mr Thompson explained that the gun had been cut into three pieces in the shed with the serial number ground off and that it had been wiped for fingerprints. The gun was wrapped up and taped. Ms Fennell then drove Mr Hamilton in her car to Luskintyre, where two pieces were dropped into the river and then to Rutherford, where Mr Hamilton disposed of the third piece. 

21Ms Fennell then drove to East Maitland to locate Mr Riley's SIM card at the place Mr Thompson said he had disposed of it. This attempt by Ms Fennell was unsuccessful. 

22A couple of days later, approximately 16 December 2009, Ms Fennell went with Mr Thompson to Mount Sugarloaf in order to move Mr Riley's body to another location. Ms Fennell dropped off Mr Thompson and then followed him as he drove off in Mr Riley's car. She was in the company of Mr Hamilton. They went to the Minmi area, where Mr Thompson removed the deceased from the vehicle and went to another location, followed by Ms Fennell, and waited there while Mr Thompson disposed of the deceased's car. After Mr Thompson returned from disposing of the car, she drove them home. 

23Ms Fennell received the deceased's iPod, which Mr Thompson had given her as a Christmas present, and she knew that Mr Thompson had used the money stolen to pay bills, some of which were hers, and to buy Christmas presents. Ms Fennell also made enquiries, during the day on 15 December 2009, as to how one would remove records from a SIM card. 

24Ms Fennell travelled with the police to recover the iPod and took them to Luskintyre, and to Aberglasslyn where she and Mr Thompson had, respectively, disposed of the three pieces of the gun. As a result of that assistance, the police recovered part of the shotgun. 

25These versions of events were confirmed in later interviews with the Ms Fennell. 

26The effect of the confession on 18 May 2010 and following was significant. Prior to interviewing Ms Fennell, police had interviewed Mr Thompson. Mr Thompson had denied any involvement in the murder of Mr Riley. After Mr Thompson was aware that Ms Fennell had given the police all of the details to which I have referred, he confessed to the killing. 

27Apart from that effect, Ms Fennell had agreed to give evidence against both Mr Thompson and Mr Hamilton, and confirmed that agreement with a formal acknowledgement and undertaking. 

28The only other matter to which I will refer, by way of fact, is that Ms Fennell was in an extremely volatile relationship when she was with Mr Thompson. She described it that way during the course of the interviews and there is independent police evidence that confirms extensive domestic violence during the course of their relationship. 

29Mr Thompson has been arrested and is in prison on remand, charged with the murder. He has indicated that he intends to plead guilty and the matter is listed before the Court later in the year. Mr Hamilton is currently in custody for unrelated matters in Queensland, on remand, and arrangements have been made for him to be charged on his release. 

30The charge of accessory after the fact relates to the harbouring of Mr Thompson and the assistance in the disposal of the body. The Form 1 offence relates to the disposal of the weapon, or more accurately the parts of the weapon. 

31Ms Fennell, who gave evidence on sentence, testified to the fact that anytime that anything remotely concerned with Mr Riley, or the circumstances of his death, was mentioned she would be bashed by Mr Thompson. I accept that evidence. It is, therefore, less likely that, absent Ms Fennell's assistance, Mr Thompson would have confessed, and less likely that he would have discussed the matter with others in a manner which would have otherwise incriminated him. 

32The effect is that, absent the evidence of Ms Fennell, it is unlikely that a strong Crown case could have been mounted against Mr Thompson or Mr Hamilton, and perhaps no case may have eventuated. In the case of Mr Hamilton, the evidence against him is confined to the testimony of Ms Fennell and, to the extent he is willing so to do, the testimony of Mr Thompson. 

33Without the evidence of Ms Fennell, it is unlikely that Mr Thompson would have admitted to the killing. It is also unlikely that the scene of the murder, the body or the gun would have been discovered. In those circumstances, while the police may have had extremely strong suspicions that Mr Thompson killed Mr Riley, and may have been able, ultimately, to prove that fact, beyond a reasonable doubt, the assistance given by Ms Fennell was crucial in the changed attitude of Mr Thompson and in bringing some closure to the horrific death of Mr Riley. 

34The Court has heard, and read, victim impact statements prepared and read to the Court by Mr Riley's mother and sisters. There is no doubt, as one would expect, that the effect on them is devastating. Ms Fennell is not responsible for Mr Riley's death. She is responsible for delaying closure to his relatives and putting them in a state of suspense as to what had happened to their son and brother. 

35Before the Court is a psychologist report by Dr Katie Seidler, a clinical and forensic psychologist. 

36It is apparent, from the history of Ms Fennell, that drugs were a significant aspect of her life as she was growing up. Her stepfather used and supplied illicit drugs and many in her life did likewise. Her mother was her primary caregiver and support throughout her life, but finances were always a struggle, with no money for luxuries. Ms Fennell was raised in public housing. 

37Ms Fennell perceived herself to be quite a rebellious child, who caused her mother worry due to her behaviour and resistance. This was particularly so during her teenage years. Her mother abused alcohol and did so even, to her knowledge, before Ms Fennell was born. There is a suggestion of sexual abuse during her childhood and teenage years. 

38Ms Fennell also testifies to being bullied at school, but, otherwise, described her school years as average or of her being ""just your average kid"". Ms Fennell worked at the age of 14 years of age, holding two jobs, one at a shoe shop and one as a checkout operator at a supermarket. The latter role she held for three-and-a-half years. She then worked in a retail establishment before securing employment as a receptionist at a medical practice. She worked there for three months before relocating, but has not worked in any substantive way since that time. Her medical history is unremarkable. 

39Ms Fennell first consumed alcohol at or about the age of 13 years. She consumed alcohol sporadically on weekends, usually in the form of binge drinking. She was first exposed to cannabis at about the same age and was a ""heavy smoker"" of cannabis until about the age of 16 years. She started using amphetamines from about the age of 17 and these were her drug of choice. She injected up to three times per day into early 2010. In addition to amphetamines, Ms Fennell has also used crystal meth since about 19 years of age. She has also occasionally and recreationally used ecstasy, sometimes quite heavily, from 17 years of age, in addition to experimenting with both cocaine and hallucinogens. 

40Ms Fennell gave the psychologist a full account of the offending in terms consistent with that which she had told the police. From an emotional perspective she made it clear that she felt frightened because of Mr Thompson's previous violent behaviour towards her and, after learning of the murder, she understood what he was capable of went to a whole new level and frightened her because she felt that she could be next. Ms Fennell told the psychologist that it was, in part, that fear that contributed to her not going to the police and assisting Mr Thompson. 

41The psychologist opines that Ms Fennell's expressed remorse seemed genuine and described Ms Fennell as feeling ashamed of her actions and sorry that the victim's family was prevented from having closure for some months after his death. 

42There is some evidence of self-harm in Ms Fennell's teenage years. The psychologist conducted Personality Assessment Inventory Testing which showed that Ms Fennell responded in a deliberate and consistent manner. Her profile is indicative of some defensiveness associated with a minimisation of personal shortcomings and an exaggeration of certain problems. The psychologist opined: 

""Further to this, it appears that [Ms] Fennell attempted to present herself in a favourable light, such that she is free from even minor shortcomings that most people will acknowledge. There was also evidence that she may have distorted her clinical profile in such a manner that is often consistent with feigning mental disorder. Her scores in these domains were not so elevated as to invalidate the profile from further interpretation but do suggest some distortion of the profile, which should, accordingly, be interpreted with some caution. 

With the above considerations in mind, the most significant findings on [Ms] Fennell's profile on the PAI was of a history of drug abuse and dependence that has had negative consequences across a number of domains of functioning. Further, [Ms] Fennell's self-concept appears to be quite negative, such that she is likely to be self-critical and doubting and she blames herself for any perceived failing or weakness. 

Interpersonally, [Ms] Fennell seems to be someone who is warm, engaging and empathic. She prioritises harmonious relationships with others and derives much of her sense of Self through her connections with others. As such, consistent with her account at interview, she is likely to be uncomfortable and avoidant of conflict and may tend to passivity."" 

43I do not repeat all of the relevant parts of the psychologist's report. It is necessary to report that the psychologist observed the interactions between Ms Fennell and her sons and noted that the interactions demonstrated that there is a clear affection and bond between them and that both children appear settled in her presence and Ms Fennell modelled appropriate and consistent parenting skills. It is appropriate that the recommendations of the psychologist be recited. They were: 

""On the basis of the present assessment, it is recommended that [Ms] Fennell will require intervention in relation to her substance abuse, which contributed to her offending behaviour. [Ms] Fennell claimed that she has been drug abstinent for some months now, which is positive, although she noted that she has 'good reasons' for abstinence at present. As such, her capacity to maintain this over the long term is questionable, especially if she is exposed on an ongoing basis to substance abuse within her social network. As such, it is recommended that [Ms] Fennell engage in specialist intervention to assist her in developing skills for relapse prevention or risk management in relation to her substance abuse. Such treatment is available through the criminal justice system but also through her local community health resources, the outpatient clinic of most local hospitals and the counselling arms of most social welfare services, such as the Salvation Army. 

In addition to substance abuse treatment, it is recommended that [Ms] Fennell would gain from engaging in the Think First and Life Management programmes that are offered within the criminal justice system both in custody and in the community. These programmes aim to assist offenders in understanding the antecedents to their offending behaviour and the negative patterns that have developed in their lives, as well as developing skills to more effectively problem solve so as to avoid risks of reoffending. Further to this, in relation to mental health treatment, she would probably gain from engaging in counselling to assist her in resolving her experiences of abuse and this would be available through her local women's health service or through sexual assault services, which also cater to the needs of victims of domestic violence. 

Lastly, it is worth commenting on the potential risks should [Ms] Fennell be sentenced to a period of imprisonment. Not only would this likely be destabilising for [Ms] Fennell, as well as exposing her to more entrenched antisocial and substance abusing role models but any period of incarceration will also necessarily entail a separation from her children. This will obviously be distressing for [Ms] Fennell but more importantly, her two young children are likely to suffer from this occurring. Jet is only two months of age and is obviously highly reliant on his mother. However, it is suggested that Ned is at a more crucial stage in his development where he will experience any separation from his mother more keenly and this is likely to have a more deleterious impact on his developmental trajectory than it will for Jet, who is too young to remember anything specific from this time in his life. It is my understanding that Ned has already manifest a greater level of anxiety, in addition to regressing somewhat in his behaviour as a function of his mother's incarceration on remand briefly in 2010. Both children are clearly attached to their mother and it seems that [Ms] Fennell has solid parenting and child care skills, at least on the basis of my assessment of her and observations with the children. As such, both children are likely to suffer in terms of their attachment to [Ms] Fennell, however, it is respectfully recommended for the Court that the impact of this will most likely be more salient for Ned, who is at a very important time in his development and who is already seemingly a vulnerable and anxious child from being separated from his mother for several months in 2010. 

44In setting out the subjective circumstances that the Court takes into account, I should also refer to the submission on behalf of Ms Fennell as to incarceration or residence in the Mothers and Children's Program, a program of Corrective Services. The Program encourages children under school age and develops an individual Mothers and Children's Program plan, which considers the practical, developmental, social and emotional needs of the child as well as comprehensive pre and post-release planning for the mother. It is the interests of the child that is the Program's priority. 

45Inevitably, when sentencing a person who has childcare responsibilities (or responsibility for the care of others) it imposes hardship on persons other than the offender. This is not a matter normally taken into account in determining an appropriate sentence. It is not a matter taken into account in determining this sentence. However, it is, on the material before the Court, highly recommended that Ms Fennell be placed in the Jacaranda Cottages with her children and undergo the kind of program of which the Court has been informed. 

46Ms Fennell has no prior convictions. Notwithstanding her significant and long-term drug use, she has never been in contact with the police for any breach of the law. She has family support and has remained, it seems, free of drugs since her release on bail. She has already spent 57 days in custody. 

47The crime of accessory after the fact to murder is a crime with a wide variation in possible degrees of culpability: R v Farroukh & Farroukh (Court of Criminal Appeal, Gleeson CJ, Levine and Dowd JJ, 29 March 1996, unreported). While a taxonomy of offences is unhelpful and there are few offences recorded for which statistics are available, some indication of the seriousness of the offence is warranted. In R v Edward Arthur FERRETT (No 4) [2010] NSWSC 956, the Court dealt with the statistics that were then available. Care must be taken in using statistics, particularly where the offence is not a common one. Currently statistics are available only for 13 offenders, over 80% of whom received a full-time custodial sentence. In Ferrett , supra, the Court sentenced the offender to a head-sentence of 7 years' imprisonment, in circumstances where the offender was a repeat offender, the offence was committed in the course of a larger criminal enterprise and the offence was described as one that had ""few redeeming features in assessing the objective seriousness of this offence. The act was not done for familial affection, love or friendship."" 

48In R v Cowen [2008] NSWSC 104, to which judgment, I referred in Ferrett , supra, Buddin J analysed, by reference to a history of other judgments, the principles that underpin the seriousness with which offences, of this kind, are considered. His Honour said: 

""[15] In R v Hawken (1986) 27 A Crim R 32, Thomas J observed that: 

...it is in the interests of the community that murderers should be completely isolated from support and deprived of assistance and that such crimes be not covered up. The severe penalty available against accessories after the fact is a way in which the community protects itself and it is an aspect of the law's general deterrence against homicide. (at 38) 

[16] Clearly the community has an interest in ensuring that offenders who have committed serious crimes be brought to account. Accordingly, endeavours made by those who seek to assist such offenders from avoiding detection must be strongly resisted and visited with appropriate penalties. In those circumstances, the nature of the assistance which is provided, the extent to which it assists the principal offender in avoiding detection and the reasons why the assistance was extended, are all factors which are relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion. 

[17] In R v Farroukh (CCA, unreported, 29 March 1996) Gleeson CJ, with whom Levine and Dowd JJ agreed, said: 

The maximum penalty is penal servitude for twenty-five years. There is, however, a wide variation in the possible degrees of moral culpability of persons convicted of this offence. The present was not a case, as sometimes occurs, where an accessory after the fact has been personally involved in a criminal enterprise, although the involvement falls short of participation as a principal, or where an accessory is associated with criminal elements and has become an accessory by reason of that association...(at 7) 

[18] In R v Scowen [2007] NSWSC 792 Grove J observed that: 

...there is a wide variation in possible degrees of culpability. This is reflected in some statistics collected by the Judicial Commission. The sample of offences of being an accessory after the fact to murder are small, but of sixteen cases three were sentenced to wholly non custodial terms, one served a term of imprisonment by periodic detention and the balance received sentences of full time imprisonment. The minimum term element of those who received full time imprisonment ranged in a sample of eleven cases between six months and thirty six months (at par 19). 

[19] An examination of a number of decisions bear out those observations. At one end of the spectrum are cases such as R v Galea [2003] NSWSC 465 in which an effective overall sentence of 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months was imposed upon an offender who assisted the principal offender in cleaning the flat in which the murder took place and who also assisted in mutilating and dismembering the deceased and in disposing of the body parts: see also R v Elsworth [2000] NSWSC 582 and R v Faulkner [2000] NSWSC 944. 

[20] At the other end of the spectrum are cases in which sentences falling short of full-time custody have been imposed. Fully suspended sentences were imposed in R v Leung [2000] NSWSC 824, in which the offender harboured the principal offender for a period of 48 hours by providing accommodation to him, and in R v Phan [2001] NSWSC 1069; (2001) 126 A Crim R 257 in which the offender both withheld from, and also gave false information to, the police. It is to be observed however that that offender also provided significant co-operation to prosecuting authorities. For other instances in which offenders received suspended sentences after co-operating with authorities, see R v Culleton [1999] VSC 478 and R v Brown [2005] VSC 63. 

[21] A sentence of periodic detention was imposed in R v Tan Do (CCA, unreported, 7 May 1997) in which the offender agreed to provide the principal offender with an alibi and agreed to receive and retain on behalf of the principal offender the sum of $500 from the proceeds of the botched robbery which gave rise to the offence until such time as the principal offender wanted it back. A Crown appeal against sentence was dismissed. 

[22] A sentence of periodic detention was also imposed in R v Waters [1999] NSWSC 893 in which the offender agreed to drive the principal offender away from the scene, assisted in carrying the blood soaked bag containing the weapons to the principal offender's premises and then maintaining his silence about the events for a period of nearly 3 years. 

[23] In R v Dileski [2002] NSWCCA 345 Hidden J, with whom Adams J agreed, said: 

In many cases of this kind the offender's conduct is the product of emotional attachment or dependence, or a misguided sense of loyalty. No doubt, that accounts for most, if not all, of the cases in the Judicial Commission statistics which were disposed of otherwise than by fulltime custodial sentences. The present case cannot be explained in that way and, accordingly, it must be viewed as a more serious example of this type of offence. (at par [17]) 

[24] Although those remarks are apposite to the present case, none of this is to suggest of course that an offence which is committed out of a misguided sense of loyalty will inevitably lead to the imposition of a lenient penalty: see for example R v Ward [2004] NSWSC 420 at paras 49-51."" 

49The fundamental principles of sentencing are well known. The Court must have in mind the protection of society; the deterrence of this particular offender; the deterrence of others; retribution; and reform. These purposes overlap and, to some extent, pull in different directions. 

50Involvement in the disposal of a body to hide a murder or murderer increases the seriousness of the offence significantly. In this case, Ms Fennell harboured Mr Thompson for five months, which also adds to the seriousness of the offence. I accept that this assistance was provided partly because of a misguided sense of loyalty and emotional attachment and partly from dependence and fear associated with long-term domestic violence. 

51I also take into account that Ms Fennell has not before been before the Court, in prison, or come to the attention, in a negative way, of the police and is entitled to a leniency, described by the High Court in Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465, for first offenders. But murder is the most serious of crimes and assisting in its non-detection must be treated seriously by the courts. The maximum penalty for the offence is 25 years' imprisonment. However, the longest sentence ever imposed by this Court for this offence is 7 years' imprisonment (or an effective sentence of that length). 

52I consider Ms Fennell's prospects of rehabilitation extremely good. I consider her remorse genuine. I have seriously considered whether a full-time custodial sentence is necessary, but, given the objective seriousness of the offence, and taking into account the Form 1, it seems appropriate that a full-time custodial sentence be imposed. 

53I also consider that there are special circumstances. I have no doubt that Ms Fennell would be assisted by a significant time in the community under the supervision of Probation and Parole to assist her in continuing to remain free of illicit drugs and alcohol. 

54The level of assistance granted is more than significant. It has essentially led to the plea of guilty of Mr Thompson and undertakings have been given to give evidence, to the extent necessary, against Mr Thompson and, to the extent necessary, against Mr Hamilton. Ms Fennell's testimony is the major evidence against Mr Hamilton. 

55Further, the plea of guilty was taken at the earliest possible opportunity and, at the first interview by the police, Ms Fennell admitted to the conduct, which gave rise to these charges. 

56It is obvious, on the reading of the material, and listening to and seeing Ms Fennell, that she is genuinely remorseful, as stated, and that her prospects of rehabilitation are significantly improved if she were to continue to have the care of her two younger children. Her oldest child is in the care of his father. 

57This sentencing exercise is one of the more difficult. I have weighed the objective and subjective circumstances including the aggravating and mitigating factors in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The assistance given has some elements of an Ellis factor ( R v Ellis (1990) 48 A Crim R 1 and ss 22 and 22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act ). I do not provide for an Ellis discount, but I factor some of those features into the combined discount for plea of guilty and assistance, to which s 23 of the Act refers. 

58I am mindful of the judgments of this Court, and the Court of Criminal Appeal that in fixing an amount under s 23, in circumstances such as this, where there will not be more onerous conditions of incarceration as a result, a discount of no more than 40% should be allowed, other than in exceptional circumstances. These are exceptional and I will allow in the order of 45% for the combined plea of guilty and assistance, of which 15% is for future assistance. I will round the result. The sentence I would otherwise have imposed is 3 years (s 23(4)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act ). 

59I find special circumstances as there is a need for a lengthy parole period under the supervision of Probation and Parole and, if available, the Mothers and Children's Program. I backdate the sentence by 57 days to account for time already in custody. 

Conviction and sentence 

60Jade Carly Fennell, you are convicted of accessory after the fact to the murder of Jay Riley by Adam John Thompson on 14 December 2009 at Seahampton in the State of New South Wales in that you did assist the said Adam John Thompson. 

61You are sentenced, taking into account the matter on the Form 1, to a non-parole period of 12 months' imprisonment, commencing 30 March 2011 and concluding 29 March 2012, with a balance of term of a further 12 months' imprisonment, concluding 29 March 2013. I direct, pursuant to the terms of s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , that you be released on parole not later than 29 March 2012 under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. 

62I strongly recommend that you be accommodated, while in prison, at Jacaranda Cottages and be subject to the Mothers and Children's Program during your imprisonment and, to the extent available, while on parole. I direct that these Remarks on Sentence be provided to Corrective Services for the purpose of classification.

		27 May 2011",2011-05-25 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709699,Police v Sidney Lee Burchett [2011] NSWLC 15,"JUDGMENT 

Reasons for Decision 

Background 
1The offender comes before the Court charged with one count of disseminating child pornography and two counts of possessing child pornography, contrary to s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). 

2The offences are said to have taken place between May 2009 and July 2010 and the charges were laid immediately thereafter. The matter came before Liverpool Local Court on seven occasions, the first of which was 13 August 2010 and then again on 10 September 2010, at which time orders were made for the service of the brief of evidence. On each occasion that the matter came before the Court for the first five appearances, it was anticipated that further charges would be laid and the file was sent by the NSW Police Prosecutorial Branch to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions on the basis that the Director would take carriage of the matter. However, the Director returned the file to NSW Police and carriage of the matter remained with them as the prosecuting authority. On 16 February 2011, the sixth occasion on which the matter came before the Court, and following charge negotiations, a plea of guilty was entered to sequences 1, 2 and 3, with sequences 4 to 9 being withdrawn. 

3There is now a long line of authority that the utilitarian value of a delayed plea is reduced and, consequently, any discount to be applied on sentence is to be reduced accordingly. This applies in circumstances where there has been a plea bargain: R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 and R v Boney [2008] NSWCCA 313, or where an offender waits to see what charges are ultimately brought by the Crown: Sullivan v R; Skillin v R [2008] NSWCCA 296. Having regard to s 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and the principles enunciated in R v Thomson; R Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, R v Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56 and R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 , I take into account the plea of guilty and I allow a 20% discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas. 

Facts 
4The matter proceeded by tender of an agreed Facts Sheet. There was no objection to any of the material contained therein and sentence was based on those facts, in part, and on additional material tendered, to which I will make reference later in these reasons. I have, throughout this judgment, included details of the content of some of the written communications between the offender and others as well as the pictures and videos found in the offender's possession. I have done so not for sensationalist or malevolent reasons but, rather, so as to provide some background as to where these offences lie on the scale of objective seriousness. 

5In late 2009, a Joint Investigative Response Team tasked with child protection duties investigated and laid charges against a mother and father alleged to have committed sexual assaults on their nine-year-old son. Upon their arrest, a search warrant was executed over their home during which two computers, containing a large number of saved Yahoo chat logs, were seized. The Facts Sheet describes the Yahoo chat site as a peer-to-peer chat program in which one uses the internet as a gateway in order to communicate with other users in real time in the form of a social networking program. Six of the saved chat logs revealed online communications from 21 May 2009 to 12 October 2009 between the parents of the nine-year-old child, using their chat username 'sydney_bi_couple_m50f42' and the offender, using the username 'louise_69r'. 

6An investigation revealed that the member details of the username 'louise_69r', the two email addresses attached to the account, the internet account, and the IP (internet protocol) addresses associated with the account were all registered in the name of the offender. 

7As a result of the execution of a search warrant over the offender's premises on 6 July 2010, police seized two computers belonging to the offender. The contents of the hard drives were forensically examined and were found to contain 6379 chat logs consisting of conversations between the offender (via his username 'louise_69r') and 1806 other users. The chat logs ranged between 2005 and 2010 and their review identified a further 28 persons of interest, with the content of communications between such persons and the offender similar to the chat logs forming the basis of sequence 1, referred to below. Some of the chat logs retrieved from the hard drive of the offender's computer include lewd conversations to the following effect: - 


Offender: ""how's your son?"" 
Other party: ""out playing with his friend at her place round the corner."" 
Offender: ""is she a nudist also?"" 
Offender: ""i have been chatting to a female with a 6yr old daughter, she lives on the north shore, she wants some photos taken, I have told her I would be willing to do so."" [referring to nude photos of the woman and her daughter] 
Offender: ""she wants some photos of me & her daughter together, she want (sic) her to sit on my lap but to put my cock between her legs."" 
Offender: ""your son almost sticking his dick in the girl would be a good photo."" 

8After being made aware that the son of the other party is nine years old, the offender continued. 


Offender: ""yes he (sic) cock would be the right size for her pussy, I could be fucking mum while your son does the daughter & we could swap... giving the daughter a cum bath."" 

9In other chat logs, the offender purported to be a woman and engaged in the following communication with a different chat user of the Yahoo internet chat site: - 


Offender: ""hubby wants to fuck a young girl...... What is the youngest girl you have fucked"" 
Other party: ""9... my grand-daughter (sic)."" 
Offender: ""k hubby wants to (sic) a younger girl."" 

The other party then detailed how he has his grandchildren aged six to eight perform fellatio on him. The offender continued. 


Offender: ""How did you get them to suck u (sic) at that age."" 

The other party then described that he has grandchildren aged two, four and five. The offender continued. 


Offender: ""Have they done it yet"" 

The other party responded in the negative but suggested next time. The offender continued. 


Offender: ""would love to see that ...... you should just take in the bedroom 7 (sic) do it to them"" 

10In other chat logs, the offender communicated with a different chat user of the Yahoo internet chat site and made reference to his (the offender's) twelve-year-old son's penis and about him being in the room naked. The offender engaged in the following communication: - 


Offender: ""[he] is good lloking (sic) for a 12 1/2 year old ...... but I am bias (sic)"" 
Other party: ""nice penis?"" 
Offender: ""yes cut also ... ... long and thin ...... I can't believe I (sic) talking about my sons (sic) cock ...... about 2 to 3 inches so far."" 

The other party asked whether the offender's son was in the room naked yet to which the offender responded in the affirmative. 

11In other chat logs, the offender discussed the 15-year-old daughter of a different chat user of the Yahoo internet chat site and enquired as follows: 


Offender: ""is your daughter a smoothie ...... only way to be is a smoothie."" 

The other party asked the offender what he likes to see to which the offender replied: - 


Offender: ""young girls"" 

The other party sent the offender a photograph (presumably over the internet) and enquired as to whether the offender liked it. The offender replied: - 


Offender: ""yes ...... I like girls between 10 & 15yrs (sic) old"" 

12In other chat logs, the offender discussed the 13-year-old daughter of a different chat user of the Yahoo internet chat site and, when asked what he (the offender) would like to do with her, the offender replied: - 


Offender: ""feel her pussy ...... is it smooth"" 

13In other chat logs, the offender is asked by a different chat user of the Yahoo internet chat site how open he (the offender) is with his 13-year-old son. The offender replied: - 


Offender: ""I suck him off 7 (sic) let him fuck me."" 

14It was conceded by the offender that he was the author of the chat logs; that his communications encouraged the sexual abuse of children; and that he had received numerous images of child exploitation and bestiality material that he downloaded and stored on his computer. There is no evidence to suggest that he had ever engaged in sexual acts with children and he maintained that he engaged in the communications as a means of ""talking it up"" and to see how far people would take them. 

15In relation to the possess child pornography charges preferred by sequences 2 and 3, the Facts Sheet discloses that an examination of the hard drives of the two computers seized from the offender's home revealed a number of images and videos depicting child exploitation of children. Located on the desktop computer were 154 images of child exploitation material and 16 video files depicting children engaged in sexual acts. Located on the laptop computer were 122 images of child exploitation material. There is no evidence to suggest that the offender disseminated these images or videos. I will elaborate further on the content of these computers later in these reasons, again, with a view to accurately categorising the level at which the possession offences lie along the spectrum of objective seriousness. 

16Along with the Facts Sheet, the prosecution tendered a Statement dated 1 November 2010 of Federal Agent Clare Frances Fitzpatrick attached to the Sex Crimes Squad. In her Statement, the officer separated the material found on the offender's two computer hard drives into five categories according to the typology enunciated in the English Court of Appeal guideline judgment of R v Oliver [2003] 1 Cr App R 28. I accept that whilst I have no evidence to confirm that the officer is an authorised analyst appointed under ss 289A and 289B of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (in relation to the use of random sample evidence in child abuse material cases), her Statement, although containing opinions of the various ages of the children depicted in the images and videos, is instructive in assessing the nature and content of the material located on the offender's computers on the basis of the examples provided by her. It was submitted by the offender's counsel that I would have to accept that the officer's evidence as to the ages of the respective children depicted in the images and videos was opinion evidence. There was no objection by the offender's counsel to the tender of the Statement and the contents therein. 

17The Statement categorised the images and videos according to the increasing scale of severity (the Oliver scale) ranging from levels 1 to 5. A different scale for Combating Paedophile Information Networks in Europe (the COPINE scale) provides a descriptive analysis of 10 levels of severity based on increasing sexual victimisation for offences investigated in Europe. According to the Oliver scale, the following five levels of activity form the basis of the classification: - 

Level 1 - Erotic posing with no sexual activity 
Level 2 - Sexual activity between children or solo masturbation by a child 
Level 3 - Non-penetrative sexual activity between adults and children 
Level 4 - Penetrative sexual activity between adults and children 
Level 5 - Sadism and bestiality 

18According to the officer's Statement, the material located on the offender's two computers was categorised as follows: - 

Level 1 - Erotic posing with no sexual activity 
97 images of children between four and 14 years of age depicting the children naked, posing erotically while focusing on their genitalia. 
Example 1 - Image of a naked female who appears to be approximately eight years of age sitting on a bucket with her legs spread apart exposing her genitalia. The female is urinating into the bucket (File name: !!06pee1.jpg) 
Example 2 - Image of a naked female who appears to be approximately nine years of age lying on a bed, with her legs spread apart, using her hands to expose her genitalia (File name: 2077.jpg). 

Level 2 - Sexual activity between children or solo masturbation by a child 
5 images and 9 videos of children between eight and 14 years of age performing sexual acts on themselves and on each other. 
Example 1 - Image of two naked males, approximately 12 years of age, with one male inserting his penis into the other male's mouth (File name2785.jpg). 
Example 2 - Video footage of a naked male and naked female, approximately 10 years of age, with the female masturbating the male's penis. The male then inserts his penis into the female's vagina and they proceed to have sexual intercourse. The video is 1 minute and 22 seconds in duration (File name: jenny compl.mpg). 

Level 3 - Non-penetrative sexual activity between adults and children 
28 images and 2 videos of children between eight and 14 years of age engaging in non-penetrative sexual activities with adults. 
Example 1 - Image of a naked female approximately 12 years of age lying on a bed with her legs spread apart touching her genitalia with her fingers. An adult male is kneeling next to her with an erect penis positioned at her chest. There is white fluid that appears to be semen around the tip of the male's penis. The female has her mouth open and there is similar white fluid around her lips and her chin (File name: -!!!Ohdaddy1.jpg) 
Example 2 - Video footage of a female who appears to be approximately 14 years of age kneeling while masturbating an adult male penis which is situated in front of her face. The adult male ejaculates and the semen is deposited over the female's face and chest. The video is 29 seconds in duration. (File name: kimm14 no.2.wmv) 

Level 4 - Penetrative sexual activity between adults and children 
42 images and 5 videos of children between four and 14 years of age engaged in penetrative sexual intercourse or sexual activities with adults. 
Example 1 - Image of a naked female, approximately eight years of age, sitting on top of an adult male who has his erect penis inserted into her vagina. There is an adolescent male standing next to him holding his penis in his hand (File name: 000091.jpg). 
Example 2 - Video footage showing a female approximately 10 years of age lying naked on a bed. An adult male penis is being repeatedly inserted and removed from her anus. The video is 34 seconds in duration (File name: sex10.wmv). 

Level 5 - Sadism and bestiality 
4 images of children approximately 12 years of age engaged in sadistic acts. 
Example 1 - Image of a naked female approximately 12 years of age with her arms and legs bound with rope and a large white object stuffed into her mouth (File name: wanab1.jpg). 

Legislation 
19Historically, offences such as these were categorised as child pornography, whether they involved dissemination, production or possession. Amendments to the Crimes Act 1900 introduced the words 'child abuse material' which came to be statutorily defined in a widely encompassing fashion to cover all forms of material including still images, videos, and words, in which a child is described as a victim of torture, cruelty, physical abuse, sexual posing or sexual activity. Throughout this decision, I have used the words child pornography and child abuse material interchangeably. 

20Section 91H of the Crimes Act 1900 provides: - 

91H Production, dissemination or possession of child abuse material 

(1) In this section: 

disseminate child abuse material , includes: 
(a) send, supply, exhibit, transmit or communicate it to another person, or 
(b) make it available for access by another person, or 
(c) enter into any agreement or arrangement to do so. 

possess child abuse material includes, in relation to material in the form of data, being in possession or control of data (within the meaning of section 308F(2)). 

produce child abuse material includes: 
(a) film, photograph, print or otherwise make child abuse material, or 
(b) alter or manipulate any image for the purpose of making child abuse material, or 
(c) enter into any agreement or arrangement to do so. 

(2) A person who produces, disseminates or possesses child abuse material is guilty of an offence. 

Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 10 years. 

21The definitions applicable in the interpretation of s 91H are set out in ss 91FA and 91FB of the Crimes Act 1900 as follows: - 

91FA Definitions 

For the purposes of this Division: 

child means a person who is under the age of 16 years. 

child abuse material - see section 91FB. 

data includes: 
(a) information in any form, or 
(b) any program (or part of a program). 

material includes any film, printed matter, data or any other thing of any kind (including any computer image or other depiction). 

91FB Child abuse material - meaning 

(1) In this Division: 

child abuse material means material that depicts or describes, in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive: 


(a) a person who is, appears to be or is implied to be, a child as a victim of torture, cruelty or physical abuse, or 
(b) a person who is, appears to be or is implied to be, a child engaged in or apparently engaged in a sexual pose or sexual activity (whether or not in the presence of other persons), or 
(c) a person who is, appears to be or is implied to be, a child in the presence of another person who is engaged or apparently engaged in a sexual pose or sexual activity, or 
(d) the private parts of a person who is, appears to be or is implied to be, a child. 

(2) The matters to be taken into account in deciding whether reasonable persons would regard particular material as being, in all the circumstances, offensive, include: 


(a) the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults, and 
(b) the literary, artistic or educational merit (if any) of the material, and 
(c) the journalistic merit (if any) of the material, being the merit of the material as a record or report of a matter of public interest, and 
(d) the general character of the material (including whether it is of a medical, legal or scientific character). 

(3) Material that depicts a person or the private parts of a person includes material that depicts a representation of a person or the private parts of a person (including material that has been altered or manipulated to make a person appear to be a child or to otherwise create a depiction referred to in subsection (1)). 

(4) The private parts of a person are: 


(a) a person's genital area or anal area, or 
(b) the breasts of a female person. 

Criminal history of the offender 
22Other than convictions for drink driving in 1989, for which he received a fine, and larceny as a servant in 1990, for which he performed 200 hours community service, the offender has no criminal record of any relevance to the present offences for which he is to be sentenced. 

Pre-sentence report 
23The Court was provided with a Pre-sentence Report dated 20 April 2011 prepared by Probation and Parole Service, describing the offender as having had a stable upbringing within his family environment and benefiting from close relationships with two of his brothers and his wife of 16 years. He has five children ranging from twin daughters aged 18 months and three sons aged four, five and 15 years of age. Despite the strain on their relationship as a result of these offences, it would appear that his wife is supportive. Due to these offences, however, he was initially suspended, but later resigned, from his employment in the public transport industry in July 2010 and his income ceased in November 2010, following which he did not access government support, rather, utilising the family's savings. The Probation and Parole Officer noted, however, that although he did not dispute the police facts, the offender appeared to minimise and justify the offences claiming that it was his curiosity that drove him to access internet chat sites and, indeed, was surprised by how easy it was to access child pornography. Whilst he conceded that the images were of real people, the offender did not appear to recognise or express any concerns regarding the welfare of the child victims. The offender denied receiving any sexual gratification from the images. 

Psychiatric Report 
24Counsel for the offender tendered a report of Dr O Nielssen, Psychiatrist, dated 2 April 2001. In his report, Dr Nielssen outlined the offender's history, generally in accordance with the submissions made by the offender's counsel. The offender stated that he had never met in person any of the people with whom he had communicated via the internet chat site and that exchanges were a way of pushing the boundaries to see how far the others were willing to go in the conversation. He said that he made up the story and said that he had no intention of doing anything of the kind, believing that all of the comments were fantasy. He had never touched his children or any other children, nor had he ever performed any of the acts described in the exchanges and denied having an attraction to underage children. 

25Dr Nielssen reported that the offender was not aware that he was breaking any laws by writing what he wrote, but after speaking with police and obtaining legal advice, he realised he had committed an offence. He said that the images found on his computers were both solicited and unsolicited and that while he did not review the images he had received, he regretted not deleting the images immediately. At this stage, I should interpose one salient point, namely, that the offence of possession of child pornography does not require that an offender view any or all of the material the subject of the charge. The offender had never sent any images of his own and had never circulated any images he received. Clinically, he had never been prescribed any kind of psychotropic medication, neither did he suffer any periods of severe depression beyond the understandable effect of criminal charges he now faces. There was no history of symptoms of psychotic illness. Indeed, from the point of view of his mental state, the offender did not present especially anxious or depressed, and seemed, according to Dr Nielssen, rather indifferent to the loss of his job and the risk of a term of imprisonment. 

26Dr Nielssen concluded by stating that there was no medical evidence to suggest that the offender had any disorder of abnormal sexual interest, such as paedophilia. He reported a stable marriage of some 16 years with no history of offences of a sexual nature and, in the doctor's opinion, the offender's participation in chat room communications with people he had no intention of meeting appeared to be an example of a cultural phenomenon that has been created by widespread access to the internet, in circumstances where the communications of complete fantasy bear little resemblance to the personality of the offender in real life. Dr Nielssen reports the offender presenting a fatalistic attitude to the many losses associated with his charges, and agrees that any term of imprisonment would place a considerable burden on his wife and young children as his wife did not have much in the way of support without him. 

Relevant principles 
27There are a number of relevant considerations to which I must now turn before reaching a conclusion as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed. The first is the purposes of sentencing. 

28Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) enunciates the purposes for which a court may impose sentence as being, namely, punishment, protection of the community, promotion of rehabilitation and accountability, deterrence, both specific and general, denunciation and a recognition of the harm done to the victim of the crime and to the community at large. In my view, sentencing for offences of this kind must comprise a real denunciatory emphasis, with particular regard to general deterrence. One must be especially cognisant of the fact that offences involving child pornography and child sexual abuse material, of whatever kind, are not victimless crimes and in circumstances where technological mediums such as the internet facilitate the exchange of offending material, courts should be vigilant in protecting a vulnerable section of the community from the predatory practices of those who deal with such material. The paramountcy of general deterrence and denunciation as considerations based on the exploitative nature of these offences was made clear in the decision of Simpson J in R v Booth [2009] NSWCCA 89 wherein her Honour (with whom McClelland CJ at CL and Howie J agreed) held, at [40]: - 

""40 ... It seems to me that possession of child pornography is an offence which is particularly one to which notions of general deterrence apply. Possession of child pornography is a callous and predatory crime. 

41 In sentencing for such a crime, it is well to bear firmly in mind that the material in question cannot come into existence without exploitation and abuse of children somewhere in the world. ... The damage done to the children may be, and undoubtedly often is, profound. Those who make use of the product feed upon that exploitation and abuse.... 

43 And every occasion on which an internet child pornography site is accessed (or when such material is accessed by any means at all) provides further encouragement to expand their activities to those who create and purvey the material. 

44 It is for that reason that this is a crime in respect of which general deterrence is of particular significance. In my opinion the sentencing judge too readily dismissed from consideration the need to convey the very serious manner in which courts view possession of child pornography."" 

29In R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370, reference was made to the decision of Morden ACJO in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R v Stroempl (1995) 105 CCC (3d) 187 at 191 in which it was held that: - 

""The possession of child pornography is a very important contributing element in the general problem of child pornography. In a very real sense, possessors such as the appellant instigate the production and distribution of child pornography - and the production of child pornography, in turn, frequently involves direct child abuse in one form or another. The trial judge was right in his observation that if the courts, through the imposition of appropriate sanctions, stifle the activities of the prospective purchasers and collectors of child pornography, this may go some distance to smother the market for child pornography altogether. In turn, this would substantially reduce the motivation to produce child pornography in the first place."" 

30The next relevant consideration is the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences. The Court of Criminal Appeal has provided guidance in relation to assessing offences of this kind. In R v Gent , Johnson J at [99] identified a number of factors to assist in the assessment of objective seriousness: - 

""(a) the nature and content of the pornographic material - including the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed; 

(b) the number of images or items of material possessed by the offender; 

(c) whether the possession or importation is for the purpose of sale or further distribution; 

(d) whether the offender will profit from the offence. 

It might be worth noting, however, that the number of images as such may not be the real point. In a case of possession of child pornography for personal use only, the significance of quantity lies more in the number of different children who are depicted and thereby victimised."" 

31More recently, RA Hulme J in Minehan v R [2010] NSWCCA 140 at [94] (with whom Macfarlan and Johnson JJ agreed) identified the following factors as having relevance to an assessment of the objective seriousness of child pornography offences: - 

""1. Whether actual children were used in the creation of the material. 

2. The nature and content of the material, including the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed. 

3. The extent of any cruelty or physical harm occasioned to the children that may be discernible from the material. 

4. The number of images or items of material - in a case of possession, the significance lying more in the number of different children depicted. 

5. In a case of possession, the offender's purpose, whether for his/her own use or for sale or dissemination. In this regard, care is needed to avoid any infringement of the principle in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. 

6. In a case of dissemination/transmission, the number of persons to whom the material was disseminated/transmitted. 

7. Whether any payment or other material benefit (including the exchange of child pornographic material) was made, provided or received for the acquisition or dissemination/transmission. 

8. The proximity of the offender's activities to those responsible for bringing the material into existence. 

9. The degree of planning, organisation or sophistication employed by the offender in acquiring, storing, disseminating or transmitting the material. 

10. Whether the offender acted alone or in a collaborative network of like-minded persons. 

11. Any risk of the material being seen or acquired by vulnerable persons, particularly children. 

12. Any risk of the material being seen or acquired by persons susceptible to act in the manner described or depicted. 

13. Any other matter in s 21A(2) or (3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (for State offences) or s 16A Crimes Act 1914 (for Commonwealth offences) bearing upon the objective seriousness of the offence."" 

32So far as the possession charges are concerned, paragraphs (c) and (d) of the Gent factors would appear to have no application in that there is no evidence of possession or importation for the purpose of sale or distribution or for profit on the part of the offender. However, paragraphs (a) and (b) of the Gent factors have direct application as do paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Minehan factors. The offender was found in possession of 16 videos and 176 images, 192 items in total, stored across two computers, with children varying in ages between four and 14, with 24% of material falling within the upper range of the Oliver scale (level 4) and 2% at the top of the scale (level 5). The number of images present in Gent's case was 601. When turning to the Minehan factors, in particular paragraph 3, it would seem that the volume of material illustrative of penetrative sexual activity between adults and children at level 4 and sadism and bestiality at level 5 carries with it a real and genuine concern of the cruelty and physical harm occasioned to the children portrayed in those images and footage. Counsel for the offender conceded that there would not have been a significant overlap in the number of children depicted in the material and I understand from that submission that it is of some significance that there would have been numerous children victimised by the activities portrayed in the images and videos as referred to in paragraph 4 of the Minehan factors. It was submitted by counsel for the offender that for the purposes of assessing paragraph 10 of the Minehan factors, the offender acted alone in his pursuits and never met any people of the chat room sites and indeed that there was no evidence that he participated in any activity with the nine-year-old child whose parents were also apprehended by police. Whilst I accept that submission, paragraph 10 of the Minehan factors is quite specific in its application requiring a sentencing court to consider whether the offender acted alone or in a collaborative network of like-minded people. Unlike the Gent factors, which deal primarily with possession of child pornography, the Minehan factors deal with possession, dissemination and production of child pornography. I accept that not all of the 6379 chat logs consisting of conversations between the offender (via his username 'louise_69r') and 1806 other users consisted of offending material. In fact, the Facts Sheet makes it clear that the chat logs ranged between 2005 and 2010 and their review identified a further 28 persons of interest, and it is the content of the communications between those persons and the offender which are similar to the chat logs forming the basis of sequence 1, which I have set out earlier in these reasons. The dissemination offence, by virtue of the chat log conversations, cannot be considered in a vacuum. In my view, there is a clear and unambiguous network of participants, at varying levels along the spectrum of criminality which pervades the standards of morality, decency and propriety enjoyed by mainstream society. 

33Another relevant consideration is that of increased penalties. Most of the leading cases dealing with the possession of child pornography were decided prior to the amendments carried through principally by the Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2008 (NSW) and to a lesser extent the Crimes Amendment (Child Pornography and Abuse Material) Act 2010 (NSW). By virtue of the Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2008, which commenced on 1 January 2009, the maximum penalty for being in possession of child pornography was increased from five years imprisonment to 10 years imprisonment. This had the effect of imposing the same maximum penalty for possessing child pornography as had already existed for producing or disseminating child pornography, thus merging the various child pornography offences into a single offence. The significance of this point is that when maximum penalties are raised, this is an indication that higher penalties should be imposed. In R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [52], the Court held that: - 

""Traditionally any intention on the part of the legislature that the offence should attract a heavier sentence has been manifested by an increase in the statutory maximum: R v Sha (1988) 38 A Crim R 334; R v Peel [1971] 1 NSWLR 247. The courts are expected to recognise and reflect that intention when sentencing offenders for offences after such amendments are made: R v Slattery (1996) 90 A Crim R 519 at 524 and R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 227."" 

34An increase may represent a change in the community feeling or expectation as to the sentence appropriate for such an offence, although it must be understood that such a change will not necessarily have a wholly determinative or conclusive effect: R v Crump (unreported, 30/5/94, NSWCCA). 

35Another consideration is that in structuring a sentence with multiple charges, I am required to have regard to the principles of totality. The effect of the totality principle is such that the Court is required to pass ""a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed ... [and] to review the aggregate sentence"" to determine whether it is 'just and appropriate': Mill v R (1988) 166 CLR 59 at [63]. 

36In assessing the objective seriousness of an offence where the offender has committed multiple offences, the court should not indulge in a global assessment: R v R eyes [2005] N SWCCA 218. The laying of two separate charges for the 'possess' offences appears to have been so as to discern the material found on one computer from the other. In R v Saddler [2008] NSWDC 48, each charge was based on the location of material on separate electronic devices and cumulative sentences were imposed to reflect this. Other than the fact that the images and videos were found on two different computers in the offender's home, the desktop computer and the laptop computer respectively, there is nothing, in my view, which makes one 'possess' charge objectively more or less serious than the other or distinctive in any way and, noting that Saddler's case was decided by a single judge in the District Court of NSW, I distinguish Saddler's case , to the extent that it constitutes any form of persuasive authority. Accordingly, any sentence to be imposed for the two 'possess' charges preferred by sequences 2 and 3 should, in my view, be concurrent as between the themselves. The same cannot be said, however, for the 'disseminate' charge preferred by sequence 1 and the sentence to be imposed for that offence should, in my view, be made partially cumulative and partially concurrent to the offences for sequences 2 and 3 so that, to use the words of Howie J in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1 at [27], the sentence for one offence could ""comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence"" and that if it could not, the sentences should at least be: 

""... partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality"". 

37Another consideration which falls for assessment is that of sentencing statistics. Counsel for the offender tendered a number of sentencing statistics of cases decided in this jurisdiction. Whilst they are instructive and I have had regard to them, their use must be tempered with the cautions referred to by Campbell JA in Han v R [2009] NSWCCA 300 at [2] wherein it was held that: - 

""Sentences imposed on other people for crimes that bear some similarity to the crime in question can legitimately be looked at as part of the process of a judge fixing a sentence. But in themselves they will not inform the judge of the range of sentences that would properly be open in a correct application of sentencing principles. It is the sentencing principles themselves that it is the duty of the judge to apply. They include taking account of the maximum penalty that Parliament has prescribed for the offence in question, and how the criminality of the particular mode of committing the offence that is being sentenced for compares to the criminality of the various possible ways in which a contravention of the particular prohibition that creates the offence could occur. 

3 Statistics about the sentences that have been imposed for a particular offence can be of some assistance in informing the judge about the range of sentences that have actually been imposed for that offence. But the use of such statistics is limited. Part of the reason why that is so is because consideration of the range of sentences actually imposed is at best a check that the judge is correctly applying the sentencing principles. Part is because the statistics leach out many of the objective facts and all of the subjective circumstances that must be taken into account in a sentencing decision. Part is because the limited number of sentences that make up the sentences summarised by the statistics do not necessarily cover the full range of circumstances in which that particular crime can be committed. This list does not purport to be exhaustive."" 

38A more comprehensive list was enunciated by Spigelman CJ in R v Bloomfield (1998) 44 NSWLR 734 (with Sully and Ireland JJ in agreement). What must be borne in mind when considering a particular sentence are the specific findings as to objective seriousness of the offence and culpability of the offender, rather than a comparison with statistical figures and percentages. The critical question is whether the sentence imposed is appropriate for the particular case: Sinkovich v R [2011] NSWCCA 90 at [41]. 

39The English Court of Appeal in R v Oliver gave some direction as to sentences for offences involving possession of images depicting child pornography at [17]: - 

""We agree with the Panel that the custody threshold will usually be passed where any of the material... in cases of possession (consist of) a large amount of material at level 2 or a small amount at level 3 or above. A custodial sentence of up to six months will generally be appropriate in a case where (a) the offender was in possession of a large amount of material at Level 2 or a small amount at Level 3 ...... A sentence of between six and twelve months will generally be appropriate for (b) possessing a small number of images at Levels 4 or 5 ...... In relation to more serious offences a custodial sentence between 12 months and three years will generally be appropriate for possessing a large quantity of material at Levels 4 or 5, even if there is no showing or distribution of it to others."" 

40It should be borne in mind that the maximum penalty applicable in Oliver for possession of child pornography was five years, not 10 years as in the present case. 

Aggravating and subjective factors 
41The written submissions tendered by counsel for the offender do, for the most part, correctly identify the aggravating factors weighing against, and the mitigating factors weighing in favour of, the offender for the purposes of s 21A(2) and (3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, including the aggravating factor that the offence involved images and videos of multiple victims: s 21A(2)(m); and the mitigating factors that the offender is generally a person of good character, save for the convictions for unrelated offences to which I have referred earlier in these reasons: s 21A(2)(f); the poignant reminder that these proceedings would leave him with such that he is unlikely to re-offend: s 21A(2)(g); his good prospects of rehabilitation: s 21A(2)(h); and his plea of guilty: s 21A(2)(k). I do not believe that the offender is wholly incorrigible despite the pernicious nature of these offences. I am permitted by s 21A(1)(c) of the Act to take into account any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offences and, for the reasons given earlier in this decision, I confirm my view that the 'disseminate' offence is one which I view as being exacerbated by virtue of it having been committed in a collaborative network of like-minded persons. It should be remembered that good character, to the extent that it is applicable, is accorded lesser weight in sentencing for offences of child pornography. So much is made clear from R v Gent at [64] wherein it was held that: - 

""There is a foundation for the approach that less weight should be attached to the evidence of prior good character on sentence for offences of importing child pornography. ......General deterrence has been referred to as the paramount consideration on sentence for this class of offence (Assheton). The fact that the offence is, in a sense, committed in secret is also relevant to this issue."" 

Assessment of the Criminality 
42It is the depiction and descriptions of child sexual abuse, through the chat logs of online communications between the offender and others which, by their sordid nature, offend, grossly in my view, the standards of morality, decency and propriety referred to in the legislation, that form the basis of the 'dissemination' charge preferred by sequence 1. It is the presence alone of the images and videos of children engaging in sexual poses and sexual activities and the portrayal of children as victims of sexual abuse, which reasonable persons would regard as offensive in all the circumstances, that by their inherent nature form the basis of the 'possession' charges preferred by sequences 2 and 3. 

43As no election was made by the prosecution to proceed with this matter on indictment before the District Court of NSW, the charges retain their classification as indictable offences punishable summarily by virtue of s 260(1) and Table 1 of Schedule 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. That being the case, the maximum term of imprisonment that the Local Court may impose for an offence is, pursuant to s 267 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, two years, or five years, in the case of consecutive sentences (or partly concurrent and partly consecutive sentences) for multiple offences, by virtue of s 58 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

44The maximum penalty for the offences with which the offender is charged is, if dealt with on indictment, 10 years imprisonment. The matter presently under consideration is one to which the principles enunciated in the Court of Criminal Appeal decision of R v Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115 (per Grove J at [35]) apply such that sentence is imposed according to the gravity of the offences by reference to the statutory maximum, not the jurisdictional limit of the Local Court. 

45In relation to the 'disseminate' charge (sequence 1), I am of the opinion that because of the pervasive nature of the chat logs carried out over a broad technological medium such as the internet, across a network of like-minded participants, over a lengthy period of time, the offending conduct falls below the half way mark of the scale of objective seriousness. Initially, I assess the criminality of sequence 1 deserving of a total sentence in the order of three and a half years. This is the significance of the decision of R v Doan . 

46For the purpose of proceeding to sentence in relation to the remaining two 'possess child pornography' charges (sequences 2 and 3), the offending conduct falls between the low end and half way mark of the scale of objective seriousness. Initially, I assess the criminality of sequences 2 and 3, severally, deserving of a total sentence in the order of two and a half years each, again, on the basis of the reasoning in R v Doan . One should be circumspect, however, in interpreting the words 'low end' as constituting trivial. On the contrary, the categorisation of the offending conduct is such that I may now proceed to assess all factors, both objective and subjective, which have a bearing upon the sentencing exercise with a view to imposing a sentence which is condign in all the circumstances. So much is made clear from the decision of McColl JA in R v King [2004] NSWCCA 444 at [130], with whom Howie and Buddin JJ agreed, in which her Honour held that: - 

""The sentencing judge must reach an 'instinctive synthesis' which takes account of and balances the 'conflicting and contradictory' factors which bear upon the sentencing exercise."" 

47The discounts for the pleas of guilty referred to earlier in these reasons are applied to the initial assessments of criminality set out in the preceding two paragraphs rather than from the Court's jurisdictional limit of two years. 

Sentence 
48When deciding to sentence an offender to a term of imprisonment, I am required to undertake a number of steps before finally determining the appropriate sentence. The individual steps require me to consider the objective gravity of the offence and balance that finding against the subjective circumstances of the offender. The decision of Howie J in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [23] is authority for the proposition that it is the first of these considerations that will determine, essentially, which of the available sentencing alternatives the Court should adopt. Bearing this in mind, I have considered and rejected all possible alternatives to a full-time custodial sentence. Taking all of the relevant considerations into account, I am of the opinion that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate: s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I am of the opinion that the sentence to be imposed in this matter must be one that emphasises general deterrence and denunciation and for these reasons, I am also of the view that the sentence would be bereft of its deterrent effect if I were to suspend it. Accordingly, I decline to do so. 

49I make the following orders: - 

Sequence 1 - Disseminating child pornography 
The offender is convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years commencing on 27 May 2011 and expiring on 26 May 2013. On the basis that this will be the offender's first time in custody ( R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 and Wright v R [2006] NSWCCA 122), coupled with my proposal to partially accumulate the sentence for this offence with the remaining two offences which I propose to make wholly concurrent as between themselves ( Hejazi v R [2009] NSWCCA 282) and the need for long-term supervision with a view to effective rehabilitation, I find special circumstances and, pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I vary the statutory ratio prescribed therein and I impose a non-parole period of 14 months commencing on 27 May 2011 and expiring on 26 July 2012 and a balance of term from 27 July 2012 to 26 May 2013. 

Sequence 2 - Possessing child pornography 
The offender is convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years commencing on 27 August 2011 and expiring on 26 August 2013. For the same reasons as above, I vary the statutory ratio and I impose a non-parole period of 14 months commencing on 27 August 2011 and expiring on 26 October 2012 and a balance of term from 27 October 2012 to 26 August 2013 

Sequence 3 - Possessing child pornography 
The offender is convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years commencing on 27 August 2011 and expiring on 26 August 2013. For the same reasons as above, I vary the statutory ratio and I impose a non-parole period of 14 months commencing on 27 August 2011 and expiring on 26 October 2012 and a balance of term from 27 October 2012 to 26 August 2013. 

50The overall effect of the sentences imposed is that of a 17-month non-parole period of custody, making the earliest date of release 26 October 2012. 

51Following his release, the offender is to be subject to supervision on parole.

		06 June 2011",2011-05-26 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2709713,Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118,"Judgment 

1SIMPSON J : The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court on 26 March 2010 following his pleas of guilty to three counts of offences against the administration of justice. Pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"") he asked that four additional offences listed on a Form 1 be taken into account. These offences also related to the administration of justice. 

2The charges to which the applicant pleaded guilty were two counts of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice (each of which, pursuant to s 319 of the Crimes Act 1900, carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years) and one count of giving false or misleading evidence at a hearing of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (""ICAC"") (which, pursuant to s 87(1) of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 (""the ICAC Act""), carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years). 

3On the Form 1 were two offences of making false statements to an officer of ICAC, and two further offences of giving false and misleading evidence to a hearing of ICAC. If charged separately, these offences carry, respectively, maximum penalties of imprisonment for 1 year (s 80(c) of the ICAC Act) and 5 years (s 87(1) of the ICAC Act). 

4Sorby DCJ sentenced the applicant as follows: 


on the count of giving false and misleading evidence, to imprisonment for a fixed term of 8 months, commencing on 26 March 2010 and expiring on 25 November 2010; 

on the first count of acting with intent to pervert the course of justice, to imprisonment for a fixed term of 14 months, commencing on 26 September 2010 and expiring on 25 November 2011, and therefore accumulated by 6 months on the earlier imposed sentence; and 

on the second such count, and taking into account the Form 1 offences, to a term of imprisonment of 2 years, made up of a non-parole period of 14 months and a balance of term of 10 months, commencing on 26 July 2011, and therefore accumulated by 10 months on the previous sentence. The non-parole period applicable to that sentence will expire on 25 September 2012, the balance of term on 25 July 2013. 

5The aggregate sentence is one of imprisonment for 3 years and 4 months commencing on 26 March 2010, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, expiring on 25 September 2012, with a balance of term of 10 months, expiring on 25 July 2013. 

6In so sentencing the applicant, Sorby DCJ allowed, by reason of the pleas of guilty, which he found had been entered at the first opportunity, a 25 per cent reduction in the sentence he otherwise would have imposed; pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, he found special circumstances justifying departure from the proportion between the non-parole period and the head sentence that would otherwise have applied. 

7The offences had their origin in the applicant's involvement in the administration of community service orders made under the Sentencing Procedure Act. By way of preliminary, and in order to permit an appreciation of the facts, it is necessary to begin with a reference to certain provisions concerning sentencing procedures. 

8In s 3A, the Sentencing Procedure Act spells out ""the purposes of sentencing"" for criminal offences. These include, inter alia , ensuring that an offender is adequately punished for the offence, the promotion of rehabilitation, holding the offender accountable, and denunciation. By s 5(1) a court is enjoined not to sentence an offender to imprisonment unless satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. 

9In accordance with that philosophy, the Sentencing Procedure Act goes on to provide for a number of non-custodial options available, within stated limitations, to sentencing judges. These included, at the time the applicant was sentenced, periodic detention, home detention and good behaviour bonds. Importantly for present purposes, they also included community service orders (s 8). 

10Part 7 contains more detailed provisions relevant to the imposition of a community service order. An offender must be assessed as a suitable person for community service work, and a court must be satisfied that arrangements exist in the area in which the offender resides for him or her to perform community service work, and that community service work can be provided in accordance with those arrangements (s 86). Administration of community service orders is assigned, by the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (""the Administration of Sentences Act"") to the Commissioner of Corrective Services, through the Probation and Parole Service. Regulations made under the Administration of Sentences Act contain more detailed provisions. 

11It will be seen that a community service order as an alternative to a sentence of imprisonment is a valuable sentencing option, and one that potentially provides enormous benefits to offenders who otherwise might face a term of full or part-time imprisonment. As its name suggests, the option involves offenders performing work considered to be of value to the community. Necessarily, that involves participation by members of the community, who are prepared to provide work of the necessary kind, and voluntarily undertake to supervise the performance of that work by the offenders. Supervision involves maintaining a record of the hours worked. For this purpose, the Probation and Parole Service provides a form for record of attendance, with provision for the dates and the hours worked. The form requires, against both the starting time and the finishing time, signature by the voluntary (community) supervisor, and by the ""worker""; and for the initials of a ""CCO (sic - probably CSO) Supervisor"". These are referred to as ""Time Sheets"". It is essential, in order to achieve the purposes of sentencing set out above, that the offender recognise that the order contains both punitive and denunciative, as well as rehabilitative, elements. The integrity of the system and its efficacy depends upon the integrity of all who participate in it. That includes the voluntary, or community, supervisors. If that integrity is not forthcoming, it may be that this valuable (and compassionate) sentencing option will be lost. 

The facts 

12An Agreed Statement of Facts was put before the sentencing judge. The statement discloses the following. 

13On 11 July 2005, at Burwood Local Court, Mr John Tourni was sentenced (in respect of his fourth motor vehicle offence) to perform 100 hours of community service. Oversight of the order was assigned to the Bankstown Probation and Parole Office where Mr Michael Ishac, a Probation and Parole officer, held the position of Community Service Organiser. He had overall supervision of Mr Tourni's community service. Mr Ishac assigned Mr Tourni to the St Nicholas Antiochian Orthodox Church. The commencement date of the order was 8 August 2005. 

14The applicant was the Parish priest at St Nicholas, and undertook the community supervision of Mr Tourni's order. 

15On 16 December 2004, at Sutherland Local Court, Mr Brian Khouzame was sentenced (in respect of an offence of driving whilst disqualified) to perform 200 hours of community service, and (in respect of an offence of breach of a bond) to perform a further 150 hours of community service. After appeal, the total number hours was reduced to 250. Mr Khouzame's order was assigned to the Bankstown Probation and Parole Office and also came under the supervision of Mr Ishac. Mr Ishac also assigned Mr Khouzame's order to the St Nicholas Antiochian Orthodox Church, under the community supervision of the applicant. 

16Neither Mr Tourni nor Mr Khouzame performed any of the community service ordered. By 25 November 2005 an administrative assistant at the Bankstown Probation and Parole Service was beginning to make inquiries about Mr Tourni's non-performance. On 25 December 2005 Mr Tourni was again apprehended and charged with driving offences, driving whilst disqualified and driving an unregistered vehicle. His failure to perform any of the community service previously ordered would, plainly, be a highly relevant factor in the sentencing decision in respect of the most recent offences, which were due to come before the court on 27 February 2006. At about the same time, procedures were being put in place, under s 115 of the Administration of Sentences Act, to seek the revocation of Mr Khouzame's community service order, by reason of his non-compliance. Pursuant to sub-s (3) of s 115, revocation would expose Mr Khouzame to re-sentencing, and, inevitably, a more severe penalty. 

17With the active assistance of Mr Ishac, both men arranged for the applicant to falsify the time sheets with which they were provided for the purpose of verifying the performance of the community service work. Mr Tourni enlisted the help of his mother who, it seems clear, intervened with the applicant. Although it is not specifically so stated in the Statement of Facts, it may be that Mr Khouzame's mother also intervened, to request the applicant to falsify his time sheets. The applicant agreed to do so. He did so in a highly unsophisticated way. Mr Khouzame took his time sheet to the applicant, who completed it and signed for a series of commencement and finishing times purporting to show that Mr Khouzame had performed community service work of 6 or 7 hours on various identified dates. This was false. Mr Khouzame had, at most, worked at the church for half an hour on any given day. 

18Mr Tourni had lost his time sheet. On 22 February the applicant photocopied Mr Khouzame's time sheet, whited out Mr Khouzame's name, and substituted that of Mr Tourni. Over two different days, and using two different pens, the applicant signed the spaces provided for the voluntary supervisor. By these signatures, he purported to confirm that Mr Tourni had performed work during the hours stated - 7 hours on each day mentioned. The confirmation was entirely false. Mr Tourni had attended the Church only for the purpose of having the false confirmation made. 

19On 27 February 2006 Mr Tourni appeared in the Fairfield Local Court in relation to the recent driving offences. Acting on information supplied from the database of the Probation and Parole Service, which, in turn, had been falsified by the entry of the false information from the time sheet, the duty Probation and Parole officer told the court that Mr Tourni had successfully completed his previous community service order. Mr Tourni falsely confirmed that that was the case. 

20Mr Tourni was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 6 months, but, pursuant to s 12 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, execution of the sentence was suspended. It may reasonably be inferred that the false information provided to the magistrate concerning Mr Tourni's completion of community service work was a significant factor in this outcome, and that, had the true position been known, Mr Tourni would have been facing a significantly more severe penalty, including part or even full-time imprisonment. 

21Mr Khouzame's and Mr Tourni's purported time sheets were both falsified for the explicit purpose of perverting the course of justice; in Mr Tourni's case, to secure a more favourable outcome in respect of the subsequent charges; in Mr Khouzame's case, to subvert the process of enforcing the order made, or seeking revocation of the order. The falsification of the time sheets constituted the two offences of doing an act to pervert the course of justice to which the applicant pleaded guilty. 

22It was expressly acknowledged that the applicant neither sought nor received any financial reward or advantage for his involvement. 

23The activities of Mr Ishac were under the investigation of ICAC. The investigation extended to the role of the applicant and his participation in the administration of the community service orders arrangements. On 14 March 2006 he participated in a recorded interview with officers of ICAC. He gave evidence in a compulsory examination on 20 February 2006. On each occasion he falsely denied any knowledge of or involvement in any wrongdoing associated with the administration of community service orders. 

24On 12 April 2006, when giving evidence in a public inquiry at ICAC, the applicant retracted his evidence, and admitted that the evidence and information he had previously given was false in a number of respects. 

25The false answers he gave in the interview of 14 March constitute the first two offences on the Form 1, of making false statements to officers of ICAC; the false evidence he gave in the compulsory examination constituted the two offences of giving false or misleading evidence at a hearing of ICAC, the third and fourth offences on the Form 1. 

Personal circumstances 

26Relatively little information was before the sentencing judge concerning the applicant's personal circumstances. What there was came from a Pre-Sentence Report prepared by an officer of the Probation and Parole Service, and evidence given by the applicant himself. In addition, a large number of personal testimonials were made available and two friends also gave evidence, essentially of character. 

27From that material the following emerges. The applicant was born in March 1948, in Tripoli, Lebanon, to an Orthodox Christian family. He left school at the age of 13 and entered the Antiochian Orthodox Monastery in Tripoli. He was ordained as a Deacon in 1963 and remained in that role in Tripoli until 1974, when, with the majority of his family, he migrated to Australia. For the next eight years he worked as a storeman for a manufacturing company. He married in 1979 and he and his wife have two now adult children. In 1982 he was ordained as the Parish priest at St Nicholas. Until 1996 the parish was geographically very large, extending from Newcastle to Wollongong. From 1996 it encompassed the Canterbury/Bankstown areas. The applicant was heavily involved in the work of the Church, and put in extremely long hours. The author of the Pre-Sentence Report asserted that the applicant was ""inducted"" as a community service order supervisor some years earlier, and ""reinducted/reaccredited"" in May 2002. (The source of the information about ""induction"" and ""re-induction"" was not disclosed.) Notwithstanding this assertion, the officer accepted that the applicant never fully appreciated his legal obligations with respect to the administration of the community services order scheme. 

28The officer also accepted that the applicant did not appreciate or understand the significance of his circumstances at the time he was interviewed by officers of ICAC, or at the time he gave evidence. He said that by the time of sentencing, the applicant accepted responsibility for his actions. 

29The officer commented on the difficulty he had experienced in obtaining cooperation and information from the applicant (for the preparation of the report), by reason of the applicant's failure adequately to appreciate the significance of the assessment he was seeking to make. 

30The officer otherwise observed in passing that the applicant had acted in response to requests from the mothers of Mr Tourni and Mr Khouzame. He said that the applicant acknowledged that, by this response, he had allowed those requests to take precedence over his obligations as Community Service Order supervisor, but that he considered the infraction insignificant at the time. 

31The applicant's evidence was not very much more informative. He said that the offence had: 

""... brought humiliation to myself, to my church, to my parish, to the community I serve, to my family also and since this happened, took place, my wife and my daughter were very stressed because of it."" 

He assented to a question which suggested that his wife and children could not attend the sentencing hearing because of anxiety. 

32He said that he himself had been very stressed since the ICAC inquiry, so much so that he suffered a heart attack in June 2007, and that he continued to suffer stress, and would like to overcome the mistake he had made. 

33He explained his motivation for committing the original offences, saying that he acted out of compassion, having been begged by the mothers of Mr Tourni and Mr Khouzame to do what he did. 

34He gave some evidence of the extent of his responsibilities in the Parish, and said that these responsibilities extended through the Blue Mountains to Dubbo, north to Newcastle and Forster, and south to Wollongong. He said that he had suffered abuse from some parishioners. He recognised that he was going to feel disgraced. He rejected the proposition that he had not cooperated with the Probation officer preparing the Pre-Sentence Report, and either misunderstood, or was evasive about, a proposition that he had used different pens to falsify the records (implying a level of sophistication and criminality contrary to his claim of naivety or ignorance). 

35Not surprisingly, the two friends who gave evidence were supportive. 

36The testimonials included one from the Primate of the Antiochian Orthodox Church of Australia and New Zealand, who wrote of the heavy responsibilities the applicant had undertaken in the course of his duties. He added: 

""Unfortunately due to this desire to help his parishioners, and due to the tremendous needs of the refugees, [the applicant] came to the conclusion that the end justified the means."" 

37It is unnecessary to refer to content of the remaining testimonials. 

The Remarks on Sentence 

38Sentencing proceedings took place in relation to the applicant, Mr Ishac, Mr Tourni and Mr Khouzame on the same days. However, while Messrs Ishac, Tourni and Khouzame were all sentenced on 27 November 2009, the applicant was not sentenced until 26 March 2010. 

39In sentencing the applicant, Sorby DCJ recounted the facts, drawn from the Statement of Facts to which I have referred. The transcript records that he then said: 

""These facts reveal objectively serious offences committed by a man of considerable standing in the general community as a parish priest, and in particular a man of high standing in his own religious community. He was in a position to know clearly the difference between right and wrong and the difference between a falsehood and a truth. The offences strike at the heart of our system of justice and the administration of justice in New South Wales. 

The purpose of an appropriate sentence in this class of case is not only to punish the offender but to deter others and make a claim [sic - make it clear] that the commission of these types of offences will normally be visited with serious punishment. General deterrence is therefore a very important aspect in this type of case."" 

No issue is, or could be, taken with those observations. 

40His Honour then dealt with the evidence of the applicant's personal circumstances. As I have mentioned, this was relatively limited. 

41He noted that the applicant has no prior criminal convictions and that he had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. He therefore allowed ""the full 25 per cent"" reduction in sentence on the principles stated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. 

42He found that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend, and that his self analysis and reform constituted special circumstances enabling him to vary the ratio stated in s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act between the non-parole period and the head sentence. 

43He then said: 

""Before formulating the appropriate sentence for each offence and the overall sentence I must determine where the offences fall on the range of objective seriousness for each offence."" 

(This is a clear reference to the regime of sentencing laid down in Pt 4 Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act. It is, however, a regime which applies only to sentences subject to a statutory standard non-parole period. I deal below with the appropriateness, in sentencing for offences that do not come within that regime, to attempt to fit the offence or offences within a range of objective seriousness.) 

44He repeated that the two offences of perverting the course of justice were: 

""... very serious, striking as they do at the heart of the judicial system."" 

45His Honour said that the role of the applicant was pivotal to the success of the scheme, and that neither Mr Tourni nor Mr Khouzame could, without his involvement, have presented false time sheets to secure the objectives they sought. He said that the magistrates dealing with the two men were entitled to place trust in the signature of the applicant because of his position as a priest and a designated community service order supervisor. (This was not strictly an accurate comment: so far as the evidence goes, no application for revocation of Mr Khouzame's Community Service Order was made, and accordingly, in his case, no magistrate was deceived by the applicant's false attestation. The very purpose of the falsification of Mr Khouzame's time sheet was to avoid the involvement of any magistrate. That his Honour was well aware of this is clear from the preceding paragraph, where he commented that the applicant falsified Mr Tourni's time sheet in the knowledge that a magistrate would rely on it in determining the sentence for the December offences. The slip is of no moment.) His Honour noted that the applicant received no direct benefit, either financially or otherwise, for himself. 

46He held that the offences of perverting the course of justice were ""well above"" the mid-range of objective seriousness for offences of their type, and that the offence of giving false or misleading evidence to an ICAC hearing fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness. 

47He proceeded to impose the sentences mentioned above. 

The application for leave to appeal 

48The notice of grounds of appeal, which was filed on 22 October 2010, raised only one ground of appeal. That was that the sentence: 

""... is manifestly excessive and too severe in all the circumstances."" 

In written submissions of the same date, however, it was sought to expand the ground of appeal to raise the following (which I will treat as separate grounds): 

""I His Honour gave insufficient weight as to the effect of the Applicant's pleas [of guilty] given that remorse and contrition were found to be genuine ...; 

II His Honour gave insufficient weight, or no weight to the issue of a substantial delay (of about three years and eleven months); 

III His Honour gave insufficient weight, or no weight, to the motives of the Applicant in committing the [perverting the course of justice] offences ...; 

IV His Honour expressly found in favour of rehabilitation and special circumstances ... However, the structure of the sentence as to its imposition and effect made no adjustment to the NSW Statutory ratio with the non-parole period comprising seventy-five percent and the parole period comprising twenty-five percent; 

[Ground IV is intended, as I understand it, to complain that, despite the finding of special circumstances, the aggregate sentence restored the statutory formula and did not reduce the proportion of the overall non-parole period to the overall head sentence. No submissions were directed to this ground.] 

V His Honour was in error in concluding that the [perverting the course of justice] offences were well above the mid-range; 

VI That the sentence was manifestly excessive in all of the circumstances."" 

49The submissions do not identify whether this last contention is made in relation to each of the individual sentences, or to the aggregate of all sentences imposed, taking into account the extent of accumulation. It does appear to be accepted that Ground VI can succeed only if fresh evidence, upon which the applicant seeks to rely, is admitted. I will deal with that below. 

50Before coming to the fresh evidence issues, I will deal with the grounds numbered I-V. 

Ground I: the weight given to the pleas of guilty 

51The complaint that insufficient weight was given to the applicant's pleas of guilty cannot be sustained. He was allowed the maximum reduction envisaged in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 in respect of the utilitarian value of the pleas. Sorby DCJ spent a good part of his analysis referring to the applicant's evidence of humiliation and disgrace, and accepted that the applicant, by the time of sentencing, recognised the significance of his offences, and was remorseful. Those matters were plainly properly taken into account. There was no call to specify any additional reduction attributable to the pleas of guilty, and to have done so would itself have constituted error. 

Ground II: delay 

52The two offences of perverting the course of justice were committed over a period between 19 February 2006 and 25 February 2006. The offences of making false statements to an officer of ICAC were committed on 14 March 2006. The offences of giving false or misleading evidence at an ICAC hearing were committed on 20 March 2006. The applicant admitted the falsity of the information and evidence he had given on 12 April 2006. Court Attendance Notices were not issued until 24 June 2008. The applicant entered pleas of guilty on 4 August 2009, and was sentenced on 26 March 2010. 

53This chronology certainly suggests some tardiness in the prosecution process, but not only in the prosecution process. There appears in the papers before this Court no explanation for the lengthy delay. Delay in sentencing can be a relevant consideration: R v Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517; Blundell v R [2008] NSWCCA 63; 70 NSWLR 660; Blundell v R [2008] NSWCCA 92; 184 A Crim R 120 , but it is necessary that the sentencing judge be in a position to appreciate the reasons for the delay. There was evidence from the applicant that, in June 2007, he had suffered a heart attack, and this, it may be inferred, may have been the explanation for some part of the delay, but there was no evidence to that effect. 

54Counsel for the applicant provided, to the sentencing judge, lengthy and detailed written submissions. These included, in two different sections, references to the delay and its relevance to sentencing. The submissions were couched in somewhat flamboyant language. They attacked ICAC for the delay, but gave no indication of any evidentiary basis for the accusations they made. They were, in my view, hardly calculated to assist the judge in determining the relevance of the delay to the sentences selected. 

55In this respect the sentencing submissions were unenlightening. Notwithstanding that, reference was made to authority supporting the proposition that delay was a relevant sentencing consideration, and I accept, in this case, that it was. 

56The applicant was not a young, and not a very healthy, man. He was 58 years of age when he committed the offences: he was 62 when sentenced. That no attention was paid in the Remarks on Sentence to the delay, even when it had been expressly raised, in my opinion, signifies error in that an important sentencing consideration was overlooked. 

57I would uphold this ground of the application. I will deal with its consequences below. 

Ground III: the applicant's motives 

58It was again reiterated that the motives of the applicant did not suggest self-interest or pecuniary benefit. Such evidence of motive as there was came from the applicant's own testimony. He said that he did what he did as ""an act of compassion"" that ""they"" (the mothers of Messrs Tourni and Khouzame) had begged him to sign the false time sheets in order to allow the offenders to maintain their employment and therefore their income. He had already given a similar account to the author of the Pre-Sentence Report. 

59Sorby DCJ did not overlook that the applicant stood personally to gain nothing from his offences. (That may be true of the offences of perverting the course of justice; but as was acknowledged, it is not so with respect to the ICAC Act offences, in respect of which he stood to gain much by way of self protection.) 

60In my opinion, it is a clear inference on the evidence that the applicant acted as he did with little or no regard for the law, or the importance of integrity in the operation of the Community Service Orders system. He put the interests of his parishioners before both the interests of the community and his responsibility to the administration of justice. The absence of any motive of self-interest is quite neutral. There is no substance in this ground. 

Ground IV: the structure of the sentences 

61As I have mentioned above, no submissions, written or oral, were directed to this ground. That seems to me to have been an oversight. 

62It is correct that the sentencing judge found, pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, that special circumstances existed justifying a reduction in the proportion the non-parole period carries to the head sentence. In respect of the longer of the pervert the course of justice offences (on which he imposed a sentence of 2 years), he reduced what would, on s 44(2) proportions have been a non-parole period of 18 months, to 14 months. In respect of the other two sentences, because he imposed fixed terms, s 44(2) did not apply. 

63However, after the accumulation, the aggregate sentence (3 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months) conforms precisely with s 44(2). 

64Whether this denotes error or not depends upon the purpose the sentencing judge sought to achieve by the finding: see Baudromo [2007] NSWCCA 43 at [32]. The reasons his Honour gave were the unlikelihood of re-offending and the ""self-rehabilitation"" achieved by the applicant. This, in my view, makes it clear that his Honour intended to afford the applicant the benefit of the finding of special circumstances in a real and practical sense. That is not achieved if the application of the variation is made only internally, to an individual sentence that is subsumed in the overall, or aggregate sentence. 

65On behalf of the Crown it was accepted that these circumstances justify a grant of leave to appeal; however, the Crown put, first, that, notwithstanding the finding, no other sentence is warranted in law (see Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6(3); R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704), and, alternatively, that any intervention warranted is ""particularly limited"". 

66In my opinion this ground of appeal ought to be upheld. 

Ground V: objective gravity 

67The finding to which objection is here taken concerns the two offences of acting to pervert the course of justice. His Honour found that those offences were ""well above the mid-range of objective seriousness for such offences"". 

68In respect of the false and misleading evidence counts, he found that they fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness. He does not appear to have made a finding in respect of the false and misleading information offences (they having been dealt with as Form 1 offences), but it may be inferred that, had he done so, it would have been commensurate with the false and misleading evidence charges. 

69The applicant takes issue with the finding that the pervert the course of justice offences were ""well above"" the mid-range of offences of their type. 

70The express finding by the sentencing judge that the pervert the course of justice offences were ""well above the mid-range of objective seriousness for such offences"" reflects a practice that has developed and has been sponsored by, the introduction, with effect from February 2003, of Pt 4 Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, and is reflective of the language in that legislation. Section 54A (which opens Div 1A) prescribes, in respect of certain identified offences, standard non-parole periods. The purpose of a standard non-parole period is explained in sub-s (2) as follows: 

""(2) For the purposes of sentencing an offender, the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences in the Table to this Division."" 

71Assessment of the objective gravity of any offence has traditionally been an essential element of the sentencing process: R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554; R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349. It should not be doubted that any sentencing decision calls for attention to be paid to the objective gravity of the offence: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357. 

72While the assessment of objective gravity is an essential part of the sentencing process, it would be erroneous to commence with that assessment, select a sentence, and step down, bit by bit, to take account of mitigating circumstances, personal to the offender: Markarian at, for example, [39] and [50]. The process to be undertaken is an ""instinctive synthesis"" of which objective gravity is an essential, but not the only, element. Built into this process are notions of relative gravity: Way at [77]. 

73Offences to which Pt 4 Div 1A, however, call for an additional step to be taken: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [72]. There, this Court said: 

""72 It is evident that the sentencing exercise which is now required for Table offences requires a critical focus, not only upon the objective seriousness of the particular offence before the Court, but also upon the abstract, or putative, offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, in respect of which the standard non-parole period is specified."" (bold added) 

It is the second part of this process which was introduced by Pt 4 Div 1A, and which is new, but which is not apposite to offences to which Pt 4 Div 1A does not apply. 

74Thus, while an assessment of objective gravity is, in all cases, a necessary aspect of the sentencing determination, it is only in respect of offences that, pursuant to Pt 4 Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, carry a standard non-parole period that an evaluation of where, on a putative or notional scale of objective gravity an offence falls, is necessary. Indeed, it has been held that to make such an assessment with respect to an offence to which that legislation does not apply is to fall into error: R v Georgopolous [2010] NSWCCA 246, per Howie AJ. 

75In Georgopolous , which concerned an offence to which Pt 4 Div 1A did not apply, Howie AJ said: 

""30 Because the offence did not carry a standard non-parole period, it was unnecessary for his Honour to embark upon a detailed finding as to where the offence lay in relation to a mid range of objective seriousness for an offence of this type. It is likely to lead to confusion and misinterpretation when the offence does not carry a standard non-parole period. 

... 

32 Further, it seems to me that the course adopted by the (sic) Conlon DCJ leads to a 'two-step' approach to sentencing by dividing the 'instinctive synthesis' into a decision on the objective seriousness of the offence followed by a consideration of the subjective circumstances of the offender: cf Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [35] to [39]. In a case where a standard non-parole period applies the court is forced by the terms of the legislation to engage in a stepped approach to sentencing involving, as the first step, a consideration of the objective seriousness of the offence followed then by a consideration of the matters in s 21A [of the Sentencing Procedure Act]: see MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271; 164 A Crim R 93. But where that legislation does not apply, a court should avoid embarking upon an independent and detailed analysis of objective seriousness ."" (bold added) 

76Howie AJ's remarks, particularly the last (emphasised) sentence in [32] ought not to be read as discouraging sentencing judges from undertaking the traditional task of making an evaluation of objective gravity. What they ought to be taken as suggesting is that the introduction of Pt 4 Div 1A has created a statutory encroachment on the otherwise forbidden two-step process frowned upon in Markarian . By reason of s 54B(2), in cases to which that Part applies - and only in cases to which that Part applies - a two-step approach has been mandated, and is inevitable. In my opinion Howie AJ did not intend to say that, in non-standard non-parole period cases, a sentencing judge should avoid analysing objective gravity. So to suggest would run counter to accepted and traditional sentencing procedure. 

77It is hypothesising a notional, or putative, mid-range offence, where the relevant legislative provisions do not call for such a hypothesis, that Howie AJ decreed is contrary to principle. If, contrary to my opinion, Howie AJ did intend to say that, in non-standard non-parole period cases, sentencing judges should avoid making an assessment of objective gravity, I would respectfully disagree. 

78Although this was not the foundation of the argument put on behalf of the applicant, I have come to the view that the finding, using the language of Pt 4 Div 1A, was apt to denote an erroneous approach. That, however, is far from finding that the conclusion that followed was erroneous. In King v R [2011] NSWCCA 46, where a similar finding had been made at first instance, Hall J came to a contrary view; he did this after examination of the whole of the remarks on sentence. I do not perceive Hall J to have held that such a finding could not denote error; the result in King depended upon a close analysis of the approach taken at first instance. 

79In support of the argument, various features sometimes associated with offences of perverting the course of justice were identified - violence, intimidation of witnesses, personal gain. I accept that, where they are present, these are all factors that affect objective gravity, and, of course, that all are absent from the present case. 

80I am not prepared to find that the assessment was not open to the sentencing judge, or that it was wrong. There were two offences of perverting the course of justice committed virtually simultaneously; they were intended to, and did, have the effect of subverting the operation of a very important sentencing option. It is obvious that, if community participants cannot be trusted to exercise the functions and responsibilities (and privileges) conferred upon them with integrity the entire scheme will fail, to the obvious detriment of both the community and offenders who can be given the benefit of a non-custodial penalty. 

81I accept that intention is a significant aspect of the offence, and that there is, in the materials, some suggestion that the applicant did not fully appreciate the ramifications of what he did. 

82In this respect I anticipate some material with which I will deal when I come to the application to adduce fresh evidence. There are, there, suggestions that the applicant was inadequately trained, or inducted, into the scheme. At this stage, it is only necessary to say that the only evidence before the sentencing judge was that contained in the Pre-Sentence Report, that the applicant had, on two separate occasions, been ""inducted"" or accredited as part of the scheme. Moreover, he gave no evidence that he did not understand what he was doing. 

83I would reject ground V. 

Ground VI: manifestly excessive 

84In support of this ground reference was made to a number of decided cases, and to statistics provided by the Judicial Commission of NSW (the limitations of the use of which are well known). 

85Although it was not clearly stated in the written submissions, it appears, from the nature of the submissions, that this ground is solely, or at least primarily, directed at the pervert the course of justice offences. That may be because a sentence of 8 months for giving false and misleading evidence to an ICAC inquiry, could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be considered to be manifestly excessive. 

86In respect of the pervert the course of justice offences, the applicant was sentenced, respectively, to imprisonment for a fixed term of 14 months and imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 10 months. When the accumulation of 10 months is taken into account, for the two offences the applicant was sentenced to a combined term of imprisonment of 2 years and 10 months, made up of a non-parole period of 2 years and a balance of term of 10 months; that was partially accumulated (by 6 months) on the 8 month sentence for the false and misleading evidence offence. This, it is to be remembered, is in respect of two (almost identical and almost concurrent) offences, and against a statutory maximum penalty of 14 years. 

87The submissions made on behalf of the applicant referred globally to statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission, but these were not provided to the Court. It was put that; 

""... in the higher courts fulltime prison was imposed in 47 per cent of cases. Of the 47 per cent of cases attracting fulltime prison, head sentences inclusive of consecutive and non-consecutive terms ranged from 6 months to 54 months [4 years and 6 months]. Non-parole periods ranged from 6 months to 30 months [2 years and 6 months] with the mean at around 12 months."" 

Since the Crown did not take issue with this short summary, it is appropriate that it be accepted as reflecting what the statistics disclosed. 

88The sentences the subject of the statistics do not appear to reflect the serious view this Court has repeatedly and consistently expressed concerning the gravity of offences of this kind: see R v Taouk (1992) 65 A Crim R 387 at 415; Marinellis v R [2006] NSWCCA 307 at [10]-[11]; Taylor v R [2007] NSWCCA 99 at [39]-[40]. See also R v Einfeld [2009] NSWSC 119, per James J at [183] (upheld on appeal: Einfeld v R [2010] NSWCCA 87; 200 A Crim R 1 ). 

89It is worth examining some of the individual cases. The most obvious with which to begin is Einfeld . 

90The offender was a former judge of a superior court. He was charged with, and pleaded guilty to, two offences, one of perjury, and one of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice. The perjury charge arose out of evidence the offender had given in a Local Court hearing, where he faced a charge of driving at a speed exceeding the prescribed speed limit. He falsely denied that he had been the driver of the vehicle at the time it was observed (by a speed camera) exceeding the speed limit. 

91The perverting the course of justice charge arose out of his subsequent elaborate and carefully constructed attempts to avoid being charged with perjury, after it was discovered that the evidence he had given was false. 

92The offender was not quite 68 years of age at the time of the offences, retired from the judiciary, and in indifferent health. In sentencing him on the pervert the course of justice offence, James J took into account, inter alia : 


that the offence was ""clearly premeditated""; 

that the offence involved considerable planning; 

the motive for the offence (self protection); 

that, by reason of the offender's long career in the law, he clearly was in a position to appreciate the significance of his conduct. 

93With respect to that offence, James J imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 2 years and 3 months, made up of a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months, and a balance of term of 1 year (for completeness, I mention that this sentence was partially accumulated on the sentence imposed in respect of the perjury offence; the overall sentence was of 3 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years, and a balance of term of 1 year.) 

94While the applicant is of an age comparable to that of that offender, the premeditation, planning, motive and that offender's career in the law and consequent appreciation of the significance of his criminality, all distinguish his case from that of the applicant, and operate to the applicant's advantage. On the other hand, it cannot be overlooked that the applicant committed two offences of this kind, as well as the other offences for which he was sentenced. 

95In Marinellis , the offender, who was in custody on remand in respect of serious fraud charges, wrote two letters, one to his wife and one to his girlfriend, in each case urging the intended recipient to contact police officers involved in prosecuting the charges, and offer them bribes. The letters were intercepted by prison officers and did not reach the addressees. He was charged with, and pleaded guilty to, one offence of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice; the second offence was taken into account on a Form 1 pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. The sentence imposed was of 3 years and 8 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months and a balance of term of 11 months. That sentence was not disturbed on appeal. 

96In Taylor , the offender also was in custody on remand, facing charges arising out of a stabbing. The offender made numerous calls to a potential Crown witness, urging her to give false evidence of her observations of the events the subject of the stabbing charge, which would inculpate another person. He made similar approaches to his mother. He pleaded guilty to two charges of doing an act to pervert the course of justice. On the first, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years and 3 months, made up of a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months, and a balance of term of 12 months; on the second, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years, to be served wholly concurrently with the first. 

97I would accept that the offences in Marinellis and Taylor were objectively more serious that those of the applicant. So also was the offence in Einfeld , made particularly so by the degree of planning and elaborate preparation, the degree of self interest sought to be protected, and the status of the offender. But in Marinellis and Taylor the greater objective gravity was reflected in both the head sentences and the non-parole periods imposed. And in Einfeld , the aggregate sentence (in respect of only two offences) was only slightly less than that imposed upon the applicant. 

98This survey and analysis of comparable cases persuades me that the individual sentences imposed upon the applicant are not out of line with accepted sentencing practice. The various observations of this Court concerning the need to maintain the integrity of the administration of justice and therefore to deal severely with attempts to pervert it establish, in my opinion, that these sentences were not in themselves manifestly excessive. 

99Nor, in the circumstances, could it possibly be said that the sentence of imprisonment for a fixed term of 8 months in respect of the false or misleading evidence at an ICAC hearing was manifestly excessive. 

100There remains a question whether the degree of accumulation of the sentences resulted in an overall term that is manifestly excessive. I will return to this after I have considered the fresh evidence. 

Fresh evidence 

101The application for leave to appeal was listed for hearing on 28 March 2011. By Notice of Motion filed on 23 March 2011 the applicant sought additional orders, including that he be granted leave to rely upon additional evidence. The additional evidence was identified as: 


two psychological reports of Mr Timothy Watson-Munro dated 17 May 2010 and 18 October 2010; 

a psychiatric report of Dr Olaf Nielssen dated 19 October 2010; 

three psychiatric reports of Dr Bruce Westmore dated 18 October 2010, 19 October 2010 and 20 October 2010; 

an affidavit of counsel who had represented the applicant at sentencing sworn on 10 November 2010. 

102The questions to which the proposed fresh evidence are directed concern the level of the applicant's intellectual functioning, and his mental and/or psychological condition. There was no such evidence provided to the sentencing judge. An explanation for its absence was given in counsel's affidavit. 

103The Crown objected to the reception of this evidence on the basis that it does not come within the principles applicable to the admissibility of fresh evidence with respect to applications for leave to appeal against sentence. Since the Court was not in a position to rule upon the application on the date allocated for hearing, the Crown sought and was granted leave to produce its own additional evidence in response, of the same kind (ie psychiatric and/or psychological reports) after the conclusion of the hearing. Since that time the Court has received an affidavit sworn by a solicitor employed by the Director of Public Prosecutions, annexing a report of Dr Susan Pulman, psychologist, dated 18 March 2011, and two reports of Dr Yvonne Skinner, psychiatrist, dated 18 March and 13 April 2011. 

The principles applicable to the tender of fresh evidence in applications for leave to appeal against sentence 

104The general principle is that parties to litigation, including criminal litigation, are bound by the manner in which their cases are presented at first instance and will not be permitted to enhance their cases on appeal by producing fresh, or new, evidence: R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677; R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 at p 377. That applies no less to applications for leave to appeal against sentence than it does to conviction appeals. 

105The rule is far from absolute, and has been diluted over the years. In criminal cases it has long been recognised that the rigour with which it is applied must be tempered in order to accommodate the interests of justice: Green v The King [1939] HCA 4; 61 CLR 167, per Latham CJ; Ratten v The Queen [1974] HCA 35; 131 CLR 510 per Barwick CJ. In criminal cases, two important but competing policy considerations collide: 

(1)that the administration of justice requires finality in litigation; in general, parties to litigation (including criminal litigation) have one, and one only, opportunity to present their cases in the best light they can, and are bound by the conduct of their cases at first instance; 

(2)that error in the sentencing process, however caused, that is the occasion of injustice, ought to be remedied. 

But there are limits as to the extent to which the court may legitimately accept additional evidence. There is no call here to consider the application of the principles in appeals against conviction: these have most recently been considered in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417 and Aouad and El-Zeyat v R [2011] NSWCCA 61 at [282] and following. These remarks are confined to the circumstances in which this Court may properly, and will, admit and take account of additional evidence on applications for leave to appeal against sentence, in respect of which a distinct sub-set of principles has evolved. 

106I say ""additional evidence"" because a distinction has been drawn between ""fresh"" evidence and ""new"" evidence: see Abou-Chabake , per Kirby J, at [63]. 

107""Fresh"" evidence has been defined by Mason J (as he then was) in Lawless v The Queen [1979] HCA 49; 142 CLR 659 at p 675 as: 

""... evidence of which the accused was unaware at the time of his trial and ... evidence which he could not have discovered with reasonable diligence."" 

""New"" evidence, on the other hand, is evidence that does not qualify as ""fresh"", either because it was available, but not used, at first instance, or because, in the exercise of reasonable diligence it could have been obtained. The distinction is important in the present case. 

108If evidence qualifies as fresh evidence, its admission may depend upon a further criterion - the evaluation of its capacity to have affected the outcome of the proceedings at first instance. If it is not judged to have that capacity, its admission is pointless, and, while it has to be considered in order for that evaluation to be made, the evidence may not, in the result, be acted upon: see, for example, Fordham . 

109It may be thought that, on the definition as stated by Mason J, evidence of facts, circumstances and events that have arisen subsequently to the first instance decision would qualify as fresh evidence because it meets both critera. However, with respect to applications for leave to appeal against sentence, there is an additional, sometimes intractable, barrier to admissibility. Jurisdiction of this Court in sentencing matters derives from s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The powers of the Court are spelled out in s 6(3) which is in the following terms: 

""6(3) ... the court, if it is of the opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal."" 

110A fundamental pre-condition to the exercise of the power of the Court to quash a sentence and pass another sentence is the formation of the opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed . In other words, this Court, as a matter of law, cannot interfere with a sentence passed at first instance unless it has identified some error, either in the sentencing process or in the outcome of the sentencing process. That has this additional implication: axiomatically, evidence of events or circumstances or facts that have arisen entirely since sentencing cannot be taken into account, no matter how compelling they may be. If the facts did not exist at the time of sentencing, it cannot have been an error for the sentencing judge not to have taken them into account. In those circumstances, the impact on the sentence is a matter for the executive government: R v Munday [1981] 2 NSWLR 177. 

111The issue has arisen, and the principle I have stated has been applied, in a number of cases concerning applicants who have, post sentencing, provided assistance to prosecution authorities: Scullion v R (NSWCCA, 15 July 1992, unreported); JM v R [2008] NSWCCA 254; R v Willard [2001] NSWCCA 6; 120 A Crim R 450; Munday (supra). 

112The same principle would, no doubt, be held to apply where additional evidence of a medical nature is sought to be adduced on appeal, but where the relevant condition did not exist at the time of sentencing. 

113Too rigid an application of the principle clearly has potential to be the cause of injustice, and has led to the development of the sub-set of evidentiary propositions peculiar to the admission of additional evidence in applications for leave to appeal against sentence. Where it is held that the facts or circumstances of which evidence is sought to be adduced existed at the time of sentencing, even if not known, or imperfectly understood, at that time, then, where the interests of justice have so dictated, the Court has admitted the additional evidence (sometimes properly categorised as fresh evidence) in order to correct the misunderstanding. It appears that the justification for this is that, although on the state of the evidence before the sentencing judge, no error could be identified in the process or the sentence, the sentencing proceeded upon an erroneous view of the factual circumstances. This proposition is sometimes traced back to the decision of the Supreme Court of South Australia in R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587 at 588. In all cases the power to admit the additional evidence is a discretionary one; ""proper grounds"" must be established as a foundation for the exercise of the discretion to admit the evidence: R v Lanham [1970] 2 NSWR 217. 

114Two classes of case have emerged. I have already referred to cases in which evidence of post sentencing assistance to authorities has not been admitted. However, in other cases, where it has been held that the circumstances existed at the time of sentencing, even if not put before the sentencing judge, the evidence may be admitted. An example is R v Many (1990) 51 A Crim R 54. An extension occurs where there is some evidence of assistance, but subsequent events show that its significance was not fully appreciated: Springer v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 289; 177 A Crim R 13. 

115Another, and increasingly common, category concerns medical evidence. Examples of these are R v Abbott (1984) 17 A Crim R 355; R v Ehrenburg (NSWCCA, 14 December 1990, unreported ); R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359; R v Ashton [2002] NSWCCA 498; 137 A Crim R 73; Iglesias v R [2006] NSWCCA 261; Stumbles v R [2006] NSWCCA 418; Einfeld v R [2010] NSWCCA 87; 200 A Crim R 1. 

116In Abbott , one relevant consideration was that the applicant had been incompetently represented, with the result that evidence that could have been available as to her psychiatric condition was not presented. Similar arguments were, on the facts, rejected in R v Goodwin (1990) 51 A Crim R 328 and Stumbles . 

117Caution must be exercised in the admission of the evidence. As I have already indicated, in Lanham , it was held that a proper basis for the admission of the evidence must be established. In Ehrenburg , Loveday J, with whom Gleeson CJ agreed, described the case as ""most unusual""; Samuels JA, who also agreed, cautioned against allowing sympathy to lead the Court, against its duty to the community, to make an error of principle. In Ashton , Howie J warned that the Court must be careful to maintain a principled approach in dealing with appeals before it, and be scrupulous to ensure that there is a proper basis for receiving evidence of events that occur after sentence where there is no error established in the sentence imposed. 

118One question which has arisen, but not, so far as I am aware, finally decided, concerns the proper identification of the evidence that is said to have been unavailable, or not presented, at the time of sentencing. That was expressed by Basten JA in Einfeld in the following way: 

""45 Whether the relevant 'event or circumstance' is the psychological condition, or the diagnosis, is one of the matters which has not been definitively resolved. There are fine distinctions to be drawn, in a practical way, between susceptibility to and suffering from a particular condition, different degrees of a known condition and the development of a syndrome (such as AIDS) from an infection (with HIV). 

... 

50 ... there is a fine line between a psychiatric condition which existed at the relevant time and a diagnosis which occurred subsequently."" 

119In Fordham , Howie AJ (as he then was) referred to a psychological report that had been prepared after sentencing. He held, accordingly, that the report was either fresh or new evidence (and admissible only if proper grounds were established). 

120For myself, I would question the too ready acceptance that a psychological report post dating sentencing, is, because it is prepared after sentencing, fresh or new evidence. The substance of the evidence is not the existence of the report, but the history and opinions expressed in the report concerning the applicant's psychological condition. That may or may not be something of which the offender was (or his legal representative were) aware at the time of sentencing, but it is almost certainly evidence that, in the ordinary course, could with reasonable diligence have been obtained prior to sentencing. 

121That the evidence may cast light on circumstances known, but not fully appreciated, at sentencing, does not dictate that it will be admitted. The judgment remains a discretionary one. It is proper for the Court examine the circumstances of, and any explanation for, the non-production of the evidence - a deliberate decision on the part either of the applicant, or his or her legal representatives, ignorance in the applicant of the significance of the evidence, resulting in its not being communicated to the legal representatives, incompetent legal representation. At the outer limits, the cases also include those in which post sentencing circumstances are taken into account as relevant to known pre-sentencing circumstances (for example, Springer ). Also relevant will be the potential significance of the evidence to have affected the outcome at first instance (for example, Ashton ). 

The proposed evidence 

122In his affidavit counsel who represented the applicant at sentencing deposed to having had great difficulty in conferring with the applicant prior to the sentencing proceedings. He expressed the view, in effect, that the applicant was in denial, and refused, or was unable, to confront the reality of the potential sentence. He recounted a conversation with the applicant, in which, counsel said, he suggested to the applicant that the applicant was incapable ""of mentally coming to grips with what has occurred to you"", and that he may need ""medical help"". He said that the applicant replied: 

""That is ridiculous. I am a priest, I am not mad. I have a lot of work to do and a lot of people depend on me. I don't have time for psychiatrists and I certainly don't think I am mental. I am offended you think that way."" 

123Counsel said that he felt somewhat intimidated by this response, which had the effect of deterring him from pursuing the question of ""psychiatric assessment and intervention"". He added that the applicant kept his wife and adult children out of their conferences, and that the atmosphere generally was ""most uncomfortable"", and that, on the day of sentencing, the applicant did not allow any member of his family, other than his brother, to accompany him. (This is difficult to reconcile with the applicant's evidence in the proceedings on sentence, elicited by his own counsel, that the applicant's wife and children were unable to attend because of anxiety.) 

124Counsel then said that it did not occur to him to call psychiatric evidence. He said that despite having been warned of the real possibility of a prison sentence, the applicant told nobody that, on the evening sentence was to be imposed, a party had been arranged for his son's 21 st birthday, which he fully expected to attend. 

125I turn now to deal with the various expert reports on which the applicant seeks to place reliance as fresh evidence. 

126Mr Watson-Munro is a consultant forensic psychologist. In his first report, dated 17 May 2010, he noted a number of circumstances, all drawn from the history he took from the applicant, which he considered to be of relevance. They were: 


in June 2007 the applicant suffered a heart attack which he claimed was stress related; 

the applicant had ""an extraordinarily onerous workload""; this included a large geographical area, very long hours and demanding and occasionally traumatic duties, including administering the last rites to terminally ill patients; 

the applicant was also involved in other community related work, and assisted the Department of Community Services in difficult family situations; 

the applicant administered Mass, and undertook regular and intensive marriage guidance and counselling; 

the applicant's family members have been traumatised by his current situation, adding to his own significant emotional distress; 

the applicant's mother died in March 2006; 

the ICAC intervention took place on the day after her funeral, and he was interviewed by ICAC officers a week later. In Mr Watson-Munro's opinion, the applicant's grief and depression occasioned by his mother's death had a deleterious impact upon his capacity to deal with ICAC; 

despite the protracted and onerous nature of his workload, the applicant never had more than one clerical assistant at any one time. 

All of these are factual matters, of which evidence could have been elicited from the applicant. Indeed, that he suffered a stress-induced heart attack in 2007 was the subject of evidence given by him. 

127Mr Watson-Munro went further, and provided a professional opinion based on this factual background. He expressed the view that the applicant had been suffering from a range of undiagnosed and hence untreated symptoms for a number of years, inclusive of significant anxiety and at times intense reactive depression. 

128In his report of 18 October 2010, following psychometric testing, Mr Watson-Munro described the applicant as ""cooperative though somewhat disoriented"". He found, by psychometric testing, deteriorating cognitive ability over the years. He described ""a prodigious work ethic"", involving seven days a week, up to 12 hours per day. He described very poor health, including morbid obesity, congenital coronary disease, and sleep apnoea. 

129Mr Watson-Munro diagnosed an adjustment disorder, related to the ""unrelenting nature"" of the applicant's work. He diagnosed severe depression and substantial anxiety. Importantly, having regard to the argument now advanced on behalf of the applicant, he found the applicant to be functioning in the low average category of intelligence, a level significantly less than would be expected for a person discharging his duties. 

130Dr Nielssen is a psychiatrist. When he reported, he had available to him both reports of Mr Watson-Munro. He recorded a history similar to that of Mr Watson-Munro. Dr Nielssen was of the view that the applicant's ""limited intellectual ability"" suggested that he was incapable of performing complex administrative work, and had a reduced understanding of the effect of his conduct. He found no sign of the depression on which Mr Watson-Munro had commented. 

131Dr Westmore added little, but did express the opinion that the applicant's offending behaviour does not arise from an inherent anti-social personality disorder. He thought that factors of relevance included his feelings of compassion for the mothers of Mr Tourni and Mr Khouzame (although this did not extend to others who he admittedly also did not properly supervise). Dr Westmore thought that a degree of naivety may also have been present, and that all these factors played a role in the offending behaviour. He thought that the risk of his re-offending was low to non-existent. 

132Each of these experts took a history which included assertions by the applicant that he had not been properly informed about his obligations in participating in the community service orders arrangements. It will be necessary to consider this below. 

Applying those principles to the present case 

133This case does not fit easily into any of the precedents I have discussed. It crosses the boundaries of some of the categories of cases I have discussed. 

134The evidence showed that the applicant made a deliberate, though spontaneous, decision not to obtain the evidence. Although the evidence included evidence of a psychiatric condition (depression and anxiety) the real focus of the argument lay on Mr Watson-Munro's findings concerning the applicant's level of intellectual functioning. That, in my view, provides part of the explanation for his refusal to participate in psychiatric or psychological examination and testing. Also relevant is the less than firm and fearless advice given to him by counsel (who, admirably enough, exposed his own inadequacy in his affidavit). It was not suggested that this inadequacy reached the level of incompetence referred to in Birks and in Abbott . It is, nevertheless, a relevant consideration. 

135I have earlier referred to the question of whether it is the opinion of the experts, or the substance of the condition, that is the subject of the evidence. That is, in the present case, a highly relevant question. If the Fordham approach is to be followed, it would be a simple matter to hold that the reports of the various experts, not having been in existence at sentencing, meet the first limb of the fresh evidence definition. However, such a finding would, in the light of s 6(3), also mean that they cannot establish error in the sentencing process, even in the extended meaning to which I have alluded. 

136In my opinion attention is to be directed, not to the form in which the evidence is presented, but to the substance of the evidence. What is now sought to be put before the Court is evidence of the applicant's psychological and mental (intellectual) condition as at the time of sentencing. Necessarily that takes the form of reports. But the condition, it is clear, is said to have been in existence at sentencing, and, indeed, at the time of the offences. That is the whole point of the evidence. The evidence is therefore not excluded on the basis of s 6(3). 

137By reason of the second limb of the definition of fresh evidence, however, the evidence does not qualify as fresh. It plainly could have been obtained in the exercise of reasonable diligence. 

138In Many , the Court accepted the applicant's explanation for failing to produce evidence of his assistance to authorities as sufficient to justify reception of that evidence on appeal. 

139In the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case, I would conclude that, as a result of the combination of circumstances - the inadequacy of the legal advice given to the applicant, and the strength of the evidence, the evidence ought to be received. 

140That means that the Court must consider the additional evidence also provided by the Crown. Dr Skinner appeared to take issue with the intelligence level assessed by Mr Watson-Munro. This, it seems, was because that assessment showed the intelligence to be lower than would be expected of a person with the applicant's qualifications. She accepted that the applicant might have been functioning at a level above his ability, but proposed that, at the time of Mr Watson-Munro's testing, he might have been affected by anxiety. As I read Dr Skinner's report, she reached this conclusion because she accepted that the applicant was functioning well in performing his complex religious duties and was highly regarded as a counsellor, and that he fluently speaks a number of languages. The difficulty with this reasoning is that the latter observations are all based upon acceptance of the applicant's own report. That was questioned by Dr Nielssen. Dr Skinner thought that the offences could not be explained by intellectual deficit, but might be explained by excessive workload and insufficient time to learn what was expected of him. She thought the reasons for the offending were: 

""... multiple factors including his failure to appreciate the serious responsibility of his position as community order supervisor, time pressures due to his heavy workload, his need to feel that he was helping parishioners."" 

Dr Skinner did reserve the possibility of revising her judgment about the applicant's intellectual capacity if testing by another psychologist confirmed the result of Mr Watson-Munro. However, when that happened, she adhered to the view she had originally expressed. 

141Dr Pulman's results in fact were similar to those of Mr Watson-Munro. She assessed the applicant as functioning within the low average range of intellectual ability, below the level expected given his responsibilities. She thought it likely that his actual abilities had always been well below the level expected of a parish priest. 

142Notwithstanding this opinion, and her express reservation of the possibility of revising her opinion, Dr Skinner, in a subsequent report, maintained the view she had previously expressed. She said that low average to average intellectual functioning would not explain the offences. 

143She repeated that, at around the time of the offences the applicant had functioned effectively as a parish priest, was capably performing complex religious duties, and was highly regarded as a counsellor. In this she continued to rely upon the applicant's self assessment. Her opinion, accordingly, remained unchanged. 

144I would give little weight to these opinions. As I have previously mentioned, the basis for Dr Skinner's opinions was solely information provided to her by the applicant. Dr Skinner can not have known how effectively he was functioning as a parish priest, how capably he was performing his religious duties, or how highly regarded he had been as a counsellor. The foundation for the opinion expressed is quite inadequate. Contrary to her original position, Dr Skinner paid no credence to the findings of Dr Pulman. 

145For my part, I would accept the findings of Dr Pulman, and those of Mr Watson-Munro, Dr Nielssen and Dr Westmore. 

146In my opinion, the applicant's low level intellectual functioning would have been an extremely relevant circumstance had it been made known to the sentencing judge. 

147I mentioned above that there was secondary evidence concerning the extent to which the applicant had been apprised of his obligations as a community supervisor of community justice orders. The evidence is not sufficient to justify a finding that there was, within the system, some failure of communication. Far more relevant, in my opinion, is the incapacity of the applicant to reach an appreciation of obligations with or without instruction. 

148On the basis that two of the pleaded grounds of appeal have been made out, and that the fresh evidence that I would admit establishes error in the sentencing process, I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, and re-sentence the applicant. 

149I could not be satisfied that any of the individual sentences was, even in the light of the additional material, manifestly excessive. Indeed, each individual sentence was lenient. It is in the accumulation of the sentences, and in the failure to translate the finding of special circumstances into the overall sentence, that I consider error is demonstrated. 

150In sentencing, there is another consideration. That concerns the sentences imposed on the various co-offenders. 

151I wish to make it clear that no ground of appeal raised any issue of parity, and this is not a finding of error on that basis. But, in re-sentencing, this Court must have regard to the sentences imposed on the co-offenders. The most relevant of these is, of course, that imposed on Mr Ishac, to which I will come. 

152Mr Tourni faced one count of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice, and two of giving false evidence to an ICAC inquiry hearing. On the first count he was, at first instance, sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 20 months, made up of a non-parole period of 12 months and a balance of term of 8 months. On each false evidence charge, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 months, to be served concurrently. The pervert the course of justice sentence was specified to be partially accumulated by 4 months, giving an overall sentence of 2 years with a non-parole period of 16 months. After appeal ( Tourni v R [2010] NSWCCA 317), the sentences were adjusted to produce an overall term of 20 months, with a non-parole period of almost 11 months and a balance of term of 9 months. 

153Mr Khouzame pleaded guilty to one charge of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice and one of giving false and misleading evidence. He asked that three further offences (presumably of giving false evidence) be taken into account. On the charge of giving false and misleading evidence, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months; on the pervert the course of justice (taking into account the additional offences), he was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months, made up of a non-parole period of 12 months and a balance of term of 6 months. After accumulation, his overall sentence was a total of 20 months, with a non-parole period of 14 months, and a balance of term of 6 months. 

154Mr Ishac pleaded guilty to three counts, one of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice, one of being an accessory to such an offence (which carries the same maximum penalty) and one of giving false evidence to a hearing of ICAC. He asked that four further false evidence offences on a Form 1 be taken into account. On the accessory count he was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 10 months; on the false evidence charge, to a fixed term of 6 months; and on the pervert the course of justice charge, and taking into account the Form 1 offences, to imprisonment for 22 months, made up of a non-parole period of 12 months and a balance of term of 10 months. Partial accumulation gave an overall sentence of 2 years and 4 months, with a non-parole period of 18 months, and a balance of term of 10 months. 

155It is of some interest that, in Mr Ishac's case, his Honour expressly took into account the delay in bringing the charges. Apart from that, it is impossible to see why Mr Ishac, whose breach of trust was plainly greater than that of the applicant, was treated significantly more leniently. As I have said, parity was not raised as a ground of appeal, and it would be inappropriate to make any direct findings in that respect. 

156Nevertheless, the sentences imposed on Mr Ishac are of considerable relevance, given that this Court must exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. I emphasise that the sentences that I am about to propose are not those that I would consider appropriate if I were approaching this sentencing exercise with a clear slate. The sentences imposed on the co-offenders, and the sentences I propose, are, in my opinion, markedly lenient when one considers the gravity of the offences. But justice must be done in context, and, here, the context includes the sentences imposed on the co-offenders, particularly Mr Ishac. 

157I propose the following orders: 

(1)Leave to appeal against sentences granted; 

(2)Appeal allowed, sentences quashed; 

(3)In lieu thereof, the applicant be sentenced as follows: 


(i)On the charge of giving false and misleading evidence to an ICAC hearing: imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 months, commencing on 26 March 2010 and expiring on 25 September 2010; 


(ii)On the first charge of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice: imprisonment for a fixed term of 10 months, commencing on 26 April 2010 and expiring on 25 February 2011; 


(iii)On the second charge of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice and taking into account the four offences on the Form 1: imprisonment for 22 months, commencing on 26 May 2010, with a non-parole period of 12 months, which will expire on 25 May 2011; the head sentence to expire on 25 March 2012.

2709716,R v Hawi & ors (No 7) [2011] NSWSC 1653,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR : A picture is said to be worth a thousand words; sometimes a firsthand look can be worth a thousand pictures. 

2This trial is concerned with events that occurred at the Qantas Domestic Terminal, Terminal 3, at Sydney Airport on 22 March 2009. The Crown case is that some of the accused were involved in an affray in the vicinity of Gate 5 and that there was a subsequent riot and murder in the departure hall. 

3The Crown has today made an application that the jury be taken to a view of the scene. There were a number of reasons advanced by the Crown Prosecutor in her submissions in support of the application. 

4Significant renovations have been carried out in the departure hall since 22 March 2009. The Crown Prosecutor referred to the very distinct possibility that jurors may have seen the terminal either before it had been renovated or after it had been renovated. It was submitted that a view would be of considerable benefit so that the jury can be accurately appraised of the scene and explanations given as to how it appeared on 22 March and what subsequent changes have been made. 

5It was submitted that issues such as distances and the general layout of the terminal might be dealt with by way of photos and plans but the jury would be able to make a better assessment of those aspects by seeing the scene for themselves. For example, there is a significant part of the evidence which is concerned with the distance between some bi-fold doors which lead from the secure to the unsecure areas of the terminal. Whilst that distance may be measured, it was submitted that a better perspective of that distance can be obtained by seeing it personally. 

6The response by counsel for the accused was varied. Mr Grant on behalf of the accused Hawi opposed the application. He questioned the utility of a view, noting that the conditions at the scene had undergone considerable change. He referred to the fact that the jury will have before it CCTV footage, scale plans, still photographs, eye witness accounts and the evidence of crime scene examiners. The submission was, in effect, that that body of evidence would more than adequately acquaint the jury with the scene of the events in question. 

7As to the jurors having a pre-existing personal knowledge of the scene, Mr Grant reminded me that it would be necessary to give the jury a direction, sometimes referred to as a "" Skaf direction"", which would overcome that problem by stressing to the jury that they must be guided by the evidence as opposed to any personal knowledge they may have, or may acquire by their own observations. 

8There was some discussion during the course of submissions about whether jurors would be permitted to attend Terminal 3 on their own, for their own purposes, during the course of the trial. It is not practical, nor fair, to impose upon the jury a requirement that they not do so. This, to my mind, is a matter that militates in favour of having a properly supervised, Court sanctioned, view. It obviates the risk of jurors assessing the evidence from their own assessment of the scene without an accurate explanation of the changes which have occurred. 

9Mr Gordon, on behalf of the accused Kisacanin, did not ""formally oppose"" the application but raised a matter for consideration. That was to do with the indication to be given to the jury of the effect of the renovations that had been carried out in terms of the removal of check-in counters in the departure hall. That is a logistical matter which needs to be borne in mind but does not bear upon the merits of the application itself. 

10Mr Stratton SC, on a behalf of the accused Menzies, supported the application. It was his submission that the CCTV footage does not provide an adequate representation of the actual layout and he submitted that a better appreciation of distance could be obtained by viewing the scene in person. 

11Mr Stratton drew attention to the evidence of two critical witnesses in the prosecution case, that is, the witnesses known as SP and AL. SP has, apparently, given accounts of witnessing the fatal assault upon the deceased and has given accounts which vary to some extent in what is said about where that occurred. In the case of AL, there is, apparently, a question as to whether the witness had the perspective of the events that he claimed to have had. The submission was that the jury attending the scene to view it for themselves would enable them to better assess the reliability, and perhaps credibility, of those two witnesses. 

12Mr Trevallion, on behalf the accused Mr Abounader, and Mr Conwell, on behalf of the accused Mr Padovan, supported the application, whereas Mr Driels, on behalf of the accused Potrus, and Mr Felton, on behalf of the accused Eken, did not wish to be heard. 

13The application is brought pursuant to section 53 of the Evidence Act 1995 which, relevantly, is in the following terms: 

53 Views 

(1) A judge may, on application, order that a demonstration, experiment or inspection be held. 

(2) A judge is not to make an order unless he or she is satisfied that: 

(a) the parties will be given a reasonable opportunity to be present, and 

(b) the judge and, if there is a jury, the jury will be present. 

(3) Without limiting the matters that the judge may take into account in deciding whether to make an order, the judge is to take into account the following: 

(a) whether the parties will be present, 

(b) whether the demonstration, experiment or inspection will, in the court's opinion, assist the court in resolving issues of fact or understanding the evidence, 

(c) the danger that the demonstration, experiment or inspection might be unfairly prejudicial, might be misleading or confusing or might cause or result in undue waste of time, 

(d) ... 

(e) in the case of an inspection-the extent to which the place or thing to be inspected has materially altered. 

... 

14It was held by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Milat , NSWSC, 12 April 1996, unreported, that there is no requirement that the accused be present at a view; although he or she should have the opportunity of being present. In the present case, counsel for each of the accused have previously indicated that their clients do not wish to be present. The legal representatives of each accused, as well as the Crown, would of course be present. 

15I am satisfied that a view will assist the jury in understanding the evidence. The Crown proposes to call some 140 witnesses who observed certain aspects of either or both of the two incidents. They will each be giving evidence of what they observed from vantage points that vary greatly. Whilst I expect that many jurors might well have a broad familiarity with the terminal, it will assist the jury in their assessment of the evidence of many of the witnesses to have a better understanding of the scene and to have particular locations of interest pointed out to them. 

16There is no danger that the view might be unfairly prejudicial or confusing, but there is a risk that it might be misleading because the place to be inspected has materially altered. I indicated earlier that the layout of the terminal has undergone significant alteration since 22 March 2009. Most significantly this involves the check-in counters between and around which the riot is said to have occurred having been completely moved away from where they were on the date. It is expected that evidence will be given by many witnesses as to what they observed by reference to the location of these counters. 

17The Crown proposes to allay this concern by having the area that was formally occupied by the check-in counters marked out in some way so that the jurors would be able to obtain an appreciation of where they were on 22 March 2009. In these circumstances I am satisfied that any potential for the view to be misleading will be avoided. 

18Qantas, who have control over the terminal, have indicated to the Crown a range of times in which it would be convenient to hold the view. Convenience is a relative term in this context, having regard to the fact the location is a busy public place. The Crown has suggested that the most suitable time in the range suggested by Qantas would be on a Tuesday at midday. Apparently Tuesday is the quietest day of the week and midday is the quietest time. The alternative times suggested by Qantas were all out of business hours. Conducting a view out of business hours might be a slightly better option in terms of the terminal being less busy. However, having regard to the time that it would take to convey jurors to and from Mascot, and the time that the view itself will require, that option in my judgment would involve too much inconvenience for jurors. 

19Having regard to all of the foregoing matters I am satisfied that it is appropriate to grant the application. Pursuant to section 53 of the Evidence Act I order that an inspection be held at terminal 3 at Sydney Airport.

		09 February 2012",2011-05-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709717,R v Hawi & ors (No 6) [2011] NSWSC 1652,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: This trial is concerned with two incidents which occurred at the Qantas domestic terminal on 22 March 2009. The Crown alleges that members and associates of the Comanchero and Hells Angels motorcycle clubs engaged in an affray near Gate 5 and a riot in the departure hall which culminated with the murder of Mr Anthony Zervas. 

2The prosecution case depends heavily upon eyewitness testimony. There were a great many members of the public and airline and airport staff who witnessed relevant events. None of these witnesses knew any of the participants. The Crown relies upon the descriptions given by witnesses of the participants to identify the roles played by the various accused. 

3The present intention of the Crown is to call in excess of 140 such witnesses. The evidence is expected to occupy at least a month of the trial. 

4Counsel for the Crown and for each of the accused are concerned about the prospect of contamination of witness testimony if any of the witnesses yet to give evidence become aware of the evidence that has been given by others. I acknowledge that concern. When this issue was raised on 11 May 2011, it was the unanimous position of the parties that certain non-publication orders should be made to address this concern. It was also proposed that a non-publication order be made in relation to two particular witnesses. 

5The Crown Prosecutor provided a draft schedule of orders (MFI 1). Counsel for each of the accused agreed with the proposed terms. It was sought that there be non-publication of: 

1. Any photographs, images, caricatures or other material depicting the accused. 

2. Any descriptions of the accused given in evidence. 

3. Any descriptions of participants in the events on 22 March 2009 in evidence. 

4. The names of [SP] and [AL] and members of their families. 

6Despite the unanimity of the parties, I indicated on that occasion that I wished to give further consideration to the issue. It seemed to me, both at the time, and upon subsequent reflection, that some of the proposed orders were extreme in their reach and were unusual in the extent to which they would prohibit publication of a major proportion of the evidence in a trial of considerable public interest. 

7Given that the trial will be concerned with a substantial body of eyewitness testimony which includes descriptions of participants in the events at the airport on 22 March 2009, it seems to me that images of the accused should not be available to such witnesses prior to their giving evidence. 

8It is my understanding that the media well recognise that there are sensitive issues involved in cases concerned with identification, description or similarity of appearance evidence. It is often the case that visual news reports in such cases either remove entirely any depiction of the accused, or use some technique, such as pixelation, to conceal certain aspects of a person's appearance. Nonetheless, it seems to me to be appropriate to make order 1 in the list of proposed orders in a slightly modified form. 

9As to proposed order 4, the two witnesses referred to are men who were members of the Comanchero motorcycle club who have pleaded guilty for their involvement in the events at the airport and have undertaken to give evidence for the prosecution. There is a concern about their safety and that of their families and it seems that promotion of such safety underlies the application for proposed non-publication order 4. None of the accused took issue with this. I propose to make that order. 

10It is the proposed orders 2 and 3 that are of concern. The Crown case depends substantially upon the evidence of eyewitnesses. There is some evidence of what occurred at the airport that is revealed by closed circuit video camera footage but it is far from complete and the images vary in their quality. A far more complete account of what occurred, both visually and aurally, can only be derived from the eyewitness testimony. Preventing publication of such evidence would frustrate the public interest in open justice generally, and, specifically, would substantially frustrate the ability of the public to be informed as to what occurred during two very disturbing incidents that occurred in such a public place. 

11When the issue was re-visited on 17 May 2011, the Crown Prosecutor indicated that orders 2 and 3 were no longer proposed by the Crown. Counsel for each of the seven accused, however, maintained the position that such orders should be made. 

12Mr Driels, for the accused Potrus, led the submissions with a contention that publication of the evidence with which orders 2 and 3 are concerned would likely be inaccurate and might mislead the jury who he expected would read, hear or see news reports. In his submission, this would impose a burden upon defence lawyers ""to scrutinise all media reports on a daily basis to see whether they are actually reporting accurately what has occurred during the course of the day"" (T287). 

13The jury will be instructed to determine their verdicts upon the evidence and not upon media reports. Mr Driels' submission was, with respect, of no assistance. 

14Mr Stratton SC, on behalf of Mr Menzies, was more concerned with the issue of potential contamination of evidence of witnesses who had not yet given evidence. He acknowledged that the witnesses have all made statements and there would be an expectation that they would give evidence in accordance with such statements. However, he submitted that some who gave evidence at the committal hearing gave evidence that was at odds with their statements. As an example of how witness testimony can be contaminated by news reporting, Mr Stratton referred to some witnesses purporting to identify an accused based upon images they had seen in the media of people being arrested. 

15Mr Stratton did not oppose the media being free to publish evidence about what witnesses say they observed the participants to be doing in the events at the airport. He did, however, oppose publication of descriptions of the appearance of the people alleged to be doing such things. 

16Mr Grant referred, by way of example, to a witness who had made a statement and then purported to identify Mr Hawi, Mr Peter Zervas and Mr Anthony Zervas from having seen photographs in newspapers. It seems that what occurred was that the witness provided descriptions of these three men (and others) in her statement and subsequently purported to assign names to them from what she had seen in newspapers. 

17Counsel for Messrs Abounader, Eken, Padovan and Kisacanin supported the submissions that were made by others. 

18In R v Hawi & Ors (No 2) I made reference to authorities concerned with principles of open justice and a fair trial. There is no need to repeat that reference now but I acknowledge the application of those principles to the present question. In particular I note the following from the judgment of Spigelman CJ in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of NSW [2004] NSWCA 324; (2004) 61 NSWLR 344: 

[21] From time to time the courts do make orders that some aspect or aspects of court proceedings not be the subject of publication. Any such order must, in the light of the principle of open justice, be regarded as exceptional. (See, for example, Raybos Australia Pty Ltd v Jones (1985) 2 NSWLR 47 at 50D-E and 54G.) 

19Making a non-publication order is no light matter. I am not persuaded that there are sufficient grounds for making proposed orders 2 and 3. 

20A significant matter to take into account in relation to the concern of counsel for the accused about the potential for contamination of witness testimony is that all of the witnesses have made statements. Many who saw critical events gave evidence at the committal hearing. If there is any departure from what is presently on record it will be open to the Crown, and counsel for the accused, to explore the basis for it. If there is any suggestion of a witness having been influenced by media reporting, that no doubt will be a factor adversely affecting the reliability of the evidence. It would be prudent for the Crown to counsel the witnesses against taking any notice of media reporting until after they have given their evidence. 

21I also take into account an expectation that media reporting will be responsible. I have earlier indicated my awareness that responsible media well know the sensitivity that applies to reporting of a case involving evidence of the type which will be important in this trial. It will be necessary for the media to approach the reporting of this trial with care and circumspection. 

22This judgment, and all others that I have given before the commencement of the trial, and those given in the absence of the jury during the trial, will not be available for publication until the trial has concluded. I do, however, propose that this judgment be made available to the media through the Court's Public Information Officer so that the media is aware of the orders made and of the need for care in the reporting of this trial. 

Orders 

23There is to be no publication until further order of: 

1. Evidence of photographs, images, caricatures or other depictions of the accused. 

2. The names of the witnesses known as SP and AL and of members of their families.

		09 February 2012",2011-05-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709722,R v KF [2011] NSWLC 14,"JUDGMENT 

1An application has been made for a permanent stay of proceedings, and this judgment gives reasons for the dismissal of that application. As this is the second such application I have dealt with in a matter of months, I have put my reasons in writing lest there be any assistance to other magistrates considering such an application, and so that my reasons are clear for both parties to consider. 

2The defendant, KF, was born in 1931. He has no prior convictions, has been married for the past 55 years, did not attend high school and has farmed for all of his working life. He has a seriously disabled granddaughter (who I shall refer to as A) who is aged in her 20's and has been diagnosed with PCDH19 gene mutation. A's cognitive ability is similar to a three-year-old child. She resides in specialist intensive supported accommodation. 

3During a visit with A, the defendant is alleged to have deliberately rubbed her breast for sexual gratification. The facts state that a disability support worker witnessed the incident and reported it to the Program Co-ordinator immediately who contacted the police. 

4The defendant has been charged with aggravated indecent assault. An application has been made that these proceedings be permanently stayed as the defendant, through his legal representative, claims that he is unfit to be tried. 

5This judgment is written without the benefit of the transcript of the submissions from the parties. 

Legal Issues 

6There are five legal issues which need to be considered before moving to the evidence supporting the application: 


""Fitness to Plead"" or ""Fitness to be Tried"" 

Permanent Stay in the Local Court 

The onus and standard of proof 

The "" Presser "" test 

Later cases 

Fitness to be Tried 

7During the application, the term ""fitness to plead"" was used synonymously with ""fitness to be tried"" by defence counsel. In my view, the latter term is the correct nomenclature for such an application. Fitness to plead, that is to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty, may be an element of fitness to be tried, however it is not the only element as discussed below. 

8Part 2 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 relating to ""Unfitness to be Tried"" and ""Special Hearings"" specifically applies only to the District and Supreme Court and not to the Local Court (see s 4 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990). Thus there is an hiatus in respect of legislative direction on fitness to be tried issues in the Local Court 

Permanent Stay in the Local Court 

9There is ample authority for the proposition that the Local Court has the power to permanently stay proceedings where the charge is one that would ordinarily be dealt with to finality in the Local Court: see Jago v District Court of NSW (1989) 168 CLR 23. In indictable matters, the position is less clear. In Grassby v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 1 Dawson J at 10, 16 and 17 said: 

10. In Connelly v DPP views were expressed, notably by Lord Devlin and Lord Pearce that every court has a power to decline to hear proceedings on the ground that they are oppressive and an abuse of process of the court.... Whether such comments were correct in relation to inferior courts exercising ordinary judicial functions has been doubted, but it is clear that they do not extend to a magistrate hearing committal proceedings. 
... 

16. On the other hand, a magistrate's court is an inferior court of record with a limited jurisdiction which does not involve any general responsibility for the administration of justice beyond the confines of its constitution. It is unable to draw upon the well of undefined powers which is available to the Supreme Court. However, notwithstanding that its powers may be defined, every court undoubtedly possesses jurisdiction arising by implication upon the principle that a grant of power carries with it everything necessary for its exercise. 
17. It would be unprofitable to attempt to generalise in speaking of the powers which an inferior court must possess by way of necessary implication. Recognition of such powers will be called for whenever they are required for the effective exercise of a jurisdiction which is expressly conferred but will be confined to so much as can be derived by implication for statutory provisions conferring particular jurisdiction. 

10Lord Pearce in Connelly v DPP [1964] AC 1254 said at p 449: 

""The Court has, I think, a power to apply, in the exercise of its judicial discretion, the broader principles to cases that do not fit the actual pleas and a duty to stop a prosecution which on the facts offends against those principles and creates abuse and injustice"". 

11The charge against the defendant is a Table One offence; that is it is an indictable offence which may be dealt with summarily absent election by the Director of Public Prosecutions. In his case, the DPP has not elected, and the Local Court was notified of this on 16 September 2010 and again on 18 November 2010. In my view, where there has been no election by the DPP, the court is vested with the necessary power to permanently stay the proceedings. The prosecution did not cavil with that proposition. 

12There is some debate as to whether the application, if successful, leads to a permanent stay of proceedings, or a discharge of the defendant. On point is the following passage in Mantell v Molyneux [2006] NSWSC 955 per Adams J at 28 and 29 

Even though, in the case of a charge being heard in the Local Court, there is no statutory enactment either dealing with determination of the question of fitness to be tried or as to what should occur if a person is found unfit to be tried, it seems to me that, where a defendant is found not fit to be tried, he or she must be discharged. So much is the effect of the judgment in Ngatai v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 1 at 7-8, per Gibbs, Mason and Wilson JJ- ...If the incapacity is due to unsoundness of mind the accused will of course be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the legislation in force on the subject of mental health, but in a case where there is no mental or physical disability, there may be no statutory enactment under which the accused can continue to be detained. In such a case no doubt he should be discharged. In this case there is no relevant mental disability that would bring the appellant within the provisions of the Mental Health Act and the consequence must be that, if unfit to be tried, she must be discharged; see also Pioch v Lauder [1907] VicLawRp 90; (1976) 13 ALR 266. 

13This was also the result in Police v AR (Children's Law News, 18 November 2009) discussed below where Judge Marien sitting as President of the Children's Court made an order as follows: 

The appropriate order is therefore that those proceedings be dismissed and the defendant be discharged with respect to those proceedings. 

14This is curious, as I would have thought that discharge is only available as a result of a successful s 32 application, and not for a permanent stay. Thus, the result of an application for a permanent stay would be an order permanently staying the proceedings, not discharging the defendant. Nevertheless, the authorities above are at the very least highly persuasive, and in the absence of authority to the contrary, I would be minded to make an order discharging the defendant. 

The Onus and Standard of Proof 

15The onus is on the applicant to satisfy the court on the balance of probabilities that the applicant is not fit to stand trial. In R v Basha (1989) 39 A Crim R 337 Hunt J said at 338: 

The onus is upon the accused in such cases to demonstrate that the disadvantage or prejudice which he would suffer during the course of such a trial is in the relevant sense unacceptable to the extent that the trial would be unfair: Barron v A-G (1987) 10 NSWLR 215 at 219 

16It is clear that a permanent stay is a remedy which is unusual, and ought be granted only in the most extreme of cases: see Watson v Attorney-General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 685. Mason CJ in J ago v District Court of NSW at p 34 said: 

""To justify a permanent stay of criminal proceedings, there must be a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences"". 

17More recently, Hodgson JA expressed the opinion that an applicant for such an ""extraordinary remedy"" bears a ""heavy onus"": R v Littler [2001] NSWCCA 173. 

18There are of course practical and evidential problems in the Local Court in dealing with such applications. In the higher courts, the practice is that the Crown arranges for the assessment of the defendant by an expert of the Crown's choosing. That is most unlikely in the Local Court. Thus, usually, the only evidence will be the defendant's psychiatric report and other reports. There are no matters of this type I am aware of where the prosecution has even sought to cross-examine the authors of the reports. 

19There are special reasons to be cautious in dealing with these matters in the Local Court. Firstly, the result of a successful application is that the proceedings are stayed or the defendant is discharged. There is no supervisory regime, treatment plan, conviction, criminal record or detention as in the higher courts. Secondly, there are well known cases where people have successfully feigned physical and mental conditions, which later turn out to be fictional devices to avoid liability. Thirdly, there is no ability to return the matter to court should the defendant not comply with a treatment regime as there is with matters dealt with under s 32. Finally, there is no ""seriousness"" test in an a stay application - the Local Court deals to finality with matters of increasing seriousness - as there is in a s32 application. 

The ""Presser Test"" 

20In R v Presser [1958] VR 45, Smith J said at 48: 

""He needs, I think, to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceeding, namely, that it is an enquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all the various court formalities. He needs to be able to understand, I think, the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; and he needs to be able to make his defence or answer to the charge. Where he has counsel, he needs to be able to do this through his counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence; but he must, I think, have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and his counsel, if any."" 

21In Mantell v Molyneux the appellant was charged with an assault arising out of an incident where she wielded a knife at her brother. The tendered reports revealed the appellant as a vulnerable person with a history of mental health issues compounded by long-term alcohol abuse and intellectual disability, at significant risk of self-harm. The picture was complicated by a long history of severe sexual abuse by the appellant's foster father. The appellant had periodic involvement with Disability Services over a period of about ten years. She had been admitted a number of times to the Shellharbour Hospital Psychiatric Unit and was plainly distressed on many occasions when workers had attempted to counsel and assess her. Caseworkers were of the view that it was inappropriate for the appellant to appear in relation to her court matter, as there was a substantial risk of increased symptoms of anxiety, self-harm and relapse into alcohol consumption. Orders had been made by the Guardianship Tribunal giving the Guardian custody of the appellant to the extent necessary to determine where the appellant could reside, what health care and medical treatment she may need and make decisions on her behalf concerning major services to which she should have access. The appellant was housed in fully supervised mental health accommodation. She was medicated with Celepram and Largactol daily 

Mr Hudman, a psychologist, had written a report after the benefit of consultations with and reports from relevant and qualified personnel who had been dealing with the appellant over a considerable period of time. Mr Hudman himself had interviewed the appellant on a number of occasions. His report contained the following - ""Interviews with [the appellant] regarding an assessment of her understanding of court processes (in particular her foundational and decisional competence) were conducted over several sessions to allow time for rapport to be established. Several interviews also provide a better indication of her ability to retain new information over time. During the sessions, [the appellant] demonstrated some knowledge as to her solicitor's name, but did not understand the roles of the basic elements of the court, such as the prosecutor, judge, jury or what a plea was. Nor was she able to demonstrate an understanding of the words guilty or innocent. Furthermore, [the appellant] was not able to discern between a truth and a lie. It is considered unlikely that [she] would be able to use reasoning to either relate relevant information to her legal counsel or make informed choices about alternate courses of action in making decisions in her defence. Decisions may have been further impeded if she was intoxicated at the time of the offence. [The appellant] has little appreciation of her current legal predicament and was unable to state what outcomes may occur from her impending court appearance. [The appellant] was able to understand the conditions of a bond after it was explained to her."" He concluded that the appellant's functional independence was limited to very limited, with her performance comparable to that of an average person aged between nine and ten years. Similar assessments were made of her motor skills, her social interaction and communication skills and her personal and community living skills. 

22Mr Hudman was of the view that whilst the appellant understood what she was charged with, she did not understand what it meant and did not understand the possible outcomes; she did not understand the difference between a serious offence and a minor one, having a view that all offences are serious and everything at court would lead to her being imprisoned; although the appellant would say guilty or not guilty she would not know what such a plea meant; she did not understand the difference between the truth and a lie; it is very likely that she would simply be mute. Mr Hudman thought that, due to the appellant's low level of cognitive ability the appellant would not understand the nature of the proceedings and pointed out that, in the proceedings before the Guardianship Tribunal, where DADHC workers explained to her several times what was happening, it was clear that she did not comprehend these proceedings at all. Mr Hudman thought that the appellant would not be able to follow the course of proceedings as she was unable to follow abstract ideas or events and could not follow sequences, with a poor ability to recall new information or even things that are shown to her. Nor would the appellant follow the substantial effect of the evidence given against her, in particular evaluating it in the light of her own experience of events. Although the appellant could say what did or did not happen she could not, in Mr Hudman's opinion, evaluate the significance of what happened and, in particular, her own intentions or motivations at the time, for example the effects of intoxication, any fear of being beaten herself or whether she could have simply departed from the scene. Indeed, Mr Hudman thought that she could not give evidence in chief without being prompted. Mr Hudman thought that she would not be able to give her version of events to the court, would probably be unable to decide what defence to rely on and would have significant difficulties in following cross-examination. 

23Ms Pikett, the solicitor for the applicant gave evidence concerning her communication with the appellant over a long period of time, concluding that the appellant did not understand her role as her lawyer, or the roles of the prosecutor or the magistrate, how the court functioned, what ""guilty"" and ""not guilty"" mean and what happens in court. Ms Pikett said that if the appellant was required to give evidence, she would be stressed, frightened, intimidated and in all likelihood remain mute; she would also be likely to agree with everything put in a leading question and would disagree with anything that her brother said in the witness box. The court found that having regard to the length of Ms Pikett's connection with the appellant, her evidence ought be given considerable weight. 

24As in this case, the prosecution called no evidence, nor did they seek to cross-examine the medical expert. I have repeated this material in some length to show the extensive, long term and detailed features of the evidence in that case. 

25Adams J found that the Magistrate erred in finding that the applicant was fit for trial and said at 32: 

It is evident that the prosecution and, for that matter, the learned Magistrate accepted that the evidence of both Mr Hudman and Ms Pikett was both accurate and reliable. In dealing with that material, as appears from the extract of the learned Magistrate's judgment which I have set out above, his Honour concluded that the appellant had some ability to understand the proceedings, noted that she had given a version of events and, I think, accepted that she was handicapped both in giving evidence and responding to other evidence given in the proceedings, these being matters which the court ""would have to take into account"". 
33 It seems to me, with respect, that the learned Magistrate erred in considering that a balancing process was involved in determining whether it would be fair to conduct a trial in the circumstances. If a defendant is not fit to stand trial in the Presser sense, the trial is by virtue of that very fact necessarily unfair and the public interest in the trial of the person charged with criminal offences must give way. Some elements of unfairness may be able to be overcome by, for example, requiring the cross-examiner not to put leading questions to the appellant, but such an order strikes me as involving an inappropriate interference with the conduct of the trial by the prosecution. It is difficult to think of any other orders that might compensate for the fundamental limits in understanding and ability to communicate, especially an ability to communicate in the court environment, which were identified by Ms Pikett and Mr Hudman. 
34 As the Crown Advocate pointed out during submissions in this Court, the learned Magistrate did not make any finding that the appellant was unfit for trial. His Honour approached the question facing him as being whether he could, by making some adjustments in the way in which the proceedings were undertaken, ensure that the trial was fair. 
35 In my view, the question of fitness for trial is fundamental. In some cases, adjustments can be made to overcome the defendant's unfitness, as by providing a deaf person with a signing interpreter. But this is not to make the trial of a person who is unfit for trial a fair one: it is to remove the unfairness. 
36 In my respectful opinion, there were no orders that the Court could have made that were capable of overcoming the appellant's unfitness. Where a defendant does not understand the nature of a plea, the elements of the charge and the essential nature of the proceedings, it does not make such a trial fair even though he or she is able to give a version of events. At all events, a fundamental problem identified both by Mr Hudman and Ms Pikett was that the appellant was simply not in a position to give that version of events in the court environment and deal with even an entirely proper cross-examination. Sympathetic allowance for the appellant's problems in this regard does not overcome the fundamental unfairness which her unfitness in respect of these matters demonstrates. This is not less so because it appears, as it happens, that the appellant has a good defence to the charge which might well result in her acquittal. 

26In the case of Police v AR , Marien DCJ sitting as President of the Children's Court of New South Wales was considering an application under s 32 and for a permanent stay for a young person who was charged with serious offences. Some of those offences were clearly Children's Court matters, and others were capable of committal to higher courts. Accordingly, there are jurisdictional issues not relevant in this case. 

27The facts alleged in AR were essentially a carjacking, a serious assault and a daylong deprivation of liberty. 

28The evidence supporting the application was from a wealth of health and care professionals, including a report from Dr Susan Hayes, who found that the applicant had a mental age of a pre-school child or a child in the early years of primary school: 

Dr Hayes is of the opinion that the defendant is unfit to plead. She states that he does not know the charges against him and does not understand what a plea of guilty or not guilty means. She states that he did not in any way understand what the court proceedings were about. She states he does not show any capacity to follow the course of the proceedings or to be able to remember or understand any evidence which may be given against him. She expresses the opinion that he cannot make his defence or instruct his counsel or solicitor about what his version of events is, because he cannot remember anything about what occurred. As I have said, the prosecution did not request her or any of the other experts who prepared reports to be present for cross-examination. 

29This contention was supported by other health practitioners, including the DADOC Psychiatrist Dr Dossetor: 

Dr Dossetor states that at his review of the defendant in May 2009 he observed that he did not recognise any of the familiar faces, did not remember what he had done from day to day and had no capacity to plan his day or to anticipate the future. Dr Dossetor states, ""AR clearly has no capacity to know whether something is right or wrong."" Dr Dossetor states that he generally observes the defendant's moral development as like that of a two to three-year-old child. 

30The evidence was further corroborated by junior counsel for the applicant who attested to her attempts to obtain instructions: 

She deposes that she has not been able to do so. Ms Cook deposes that while she used basic English and basic concepts during those conferences, it appeared to her that the defendant was not able to understand her role as his lawyer, was not able to understand the role of the prosecution or the magistrate, was not able to understand the nature of the charges laid against him or the nature of the proceedings or the effect of the evidence against him; was not able to understand what is meant by pleading guilty or pleading not guilty, was not able to make his defence or answer the charges and was not able to provide a version of events or instructions. She also deposes that the defendant has not been able to follow her advice or respond appropriately when questioned. The prosecution did not seek to cross-examine Ms Cook. 

31Marien DCJ concluded: 

However, it is to be remembered that the Presser tests do not include whether the defendant has some degree of memory loss or whether the defendant has difficulty verbalising demands or is able to independently make decisions. The Presser tests are directed to the question whether a defendant comes up to minimum standards which the defendant needs to attain before he or she can be tried without unfairness or injustice. 
As I have previously stated, under the Presser tests the defendant needs to understand what he or she is charged with, needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise the right of challenge. The defendant needs to understand generally the nature of the proceedings and needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings and be able to make their defence or answer the charge, instruct counsel and if necessary, tell the court their version of events. On these specific issues, the expert evidence, as well the unchallenged evidence of Ms Cook, all point in one single direction, namely, that the defendant is unfit to plead and is incapable of understanding and participating in the criminal proceedings. 

32It should be noted that the court draws a clear distinction between having some degree of memory loss and having difficulty in verbalising demands and the minimum standards of the Presser test. 

The Evidence for the Applicant 

33The sole evidence for the applicant was a report from Dr Bruce Westmore together with his CV and medical notes. Dr Westmore saw the applicant once, and consulted with no other health professionals. It is apparent from that report that the applicant is suffering from Dementia and from Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood. 

34On the issue of fitness Dr Westmore opines at p 6: 

""while he has a reasonably good understanding of the various roles of the people in court, he also understands what he has been charged with and how he wishes to plead to the charges, my principle concern about his fitness is his identified cognitive problems. His ability to recall information during the trial will be compromised because of his cognitive difficulties. In addition his ability to express himself in a clear and precise way will also be compromised because of his problems with communication. Increased anxiety in the court situation will aggravate these difficulties. His ability to provide his legal representatives with clear consistent and ongoing instructions during a trial will be affected by his cognitive deficiencies and that is why I think he should be considered to be unfit. As noted earlier, this condition will not change in the next 12 months."" 

35I note that this opinion was reached after the application of a test which indicated ""the presents (sic) of mild dementia"" and his ""clinical presentation at times was more consistent with moderate dementia"" particularly when anxious or under pressure. 

36It is apparent from the report that the applicant knows the nature of the charges he is facing, states that he is not guilty, gives an alternate scenario and has a detailed knowledge of the role of the Magistrate, the jury, the oath, sentencing, witnesses and the truth. 

37The applicant though submits that this report supports a conclusion that in any trial the defendant would not be able to properly instruct his legal representatives. This is based upon the conclusion of Dr Westmore. 

38The prosecution contends that the report suggests his immediate recall is intact, he asserts clearly that he is not guilty, that he understands the allegations against him, that he has a precise recollection of the events which occurred and an innocent explanation is provided that he was simply looking for a ball which had fallen down the front of the alleged victim. The prosecution contends that the applicant understands the nature of the proceedings. 

39I agree with the submissions of the prosecution, and there is evidence contrary to each aspect of the Presser test in the report. A careful reading of the report shows that the applicant understands what he has been charged with, he understands the nature of the proceedings and he has a version of events about which he can instruct counsel. It is insufficient that his ability to provide counsel with ""clear and consistent"" instructions will be ""affected by his cognitive difficulties"". I can take judicial notice that clients often cannot provide counsel with such instructions unaffected by cognitive difficulties. 

40Mr Kumarasinge counters such contentions with the conclusion of Dr Westmore that he ought be ""considered unfit"". With respect to Dr Westmore, his ultimate opinion as to whether the applicant is unfit to stand trial is not conclusive. That is a judicial and legal determination, not a medical one. The value of the report lies in Dr Westmore's observations and testing of the applicant, his discussions with family, and the appraisal of that material based on medical knowledge to make conclusions as to the defendant's state of mind and abilities. 

41There are also notable differences between the evidence in this case, and that of Mantell v Molyneux and Police v AR. In this case there is a notable absence of evidence from his lawyers, general practitioners and health professionals who have been dealing with the applicant for a period of time. There is no evidence of guardianship, or of an inability to distinguish truth from a lie. Dr Westmore saw the applicant once. In Mantell and AR the corroborated evidence was that the applicant did not understand the role of the defence lawyer, or the roles of the prosecutor or the magistrate, how the court functioned, what ""guilty"" and ""not guilty"" mean, what happens in court, or what the outcomes of court could be. A specific mental age was arrived at in each of the other cases, again absent in the present case. 

42I am not satisfied on balance that the Presser test has been met, or that there could not be a fair trial for this defendant. Indeed, it is imperative that an early hearing date be obtained, lest the defendant deteriorates further. 

43Defendants come in all shapes and sizes, some with good memories, and some with poor. Some defendants have high cognitive function, and some have low. Some are colour-blind, hopeless at calculating distances and cannot estimate time in minutes. For many defendants without English as their first language they are inhibited in understanding the nuances of prosecution witnesses, even with interpreter assistance. There is much in the literature regarding the dangers of asking leading questions, eye contact and the trial process with unsophisticated aboriginal defendants. For the uneducated, expert evidence often flies completely over their head. Under pressure, many defendants find it difficult to remember important matters. These are all matters that may disadvantage defendants, but they do not make for an unfair trial. 

44It is for this reason that the majority of the High Court in Ngatayi v R (1980) 147 CLR 1, said that the test of capacity or fitness needs to be applied in a ""common sense fashion"" and that the accused ""need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence or to act wisely in his own best interests"". 

45In my view, this case is typical of where a person's memory is fading as a result of Alzheimer's disease. That is a tragedy, however it does not make for an unfair trial. The trial may need to have more time allocated than normal, there may need to be breaks to allow counsel to work through evidence and obtain instructions more slowly and cross-examination will need to be more cautious and perhaps more gentle than usual. Allowances such as this can easily be made. 

46The delay in this case has been occasioned in part by this application being made on a hearing date. The prosecution witnesses were there, ready to give evidence. In future, the intention to make such an application ought be made at the time the matter is set down for hearing, and a timetable for service of reports, medical examinations and responses can be made. In appropriate cases no doubt a stay would not be opposed by the prosecution negating the necessity for the hearing date to be kept. Springing such an application on the court and the prosecution on a hearing date does not assist in the effective administration of justice. 

Orders 

47The application is dismissed, and an urgent hearing date will be allocated.

2709724,"TRAN, Hoai Vinh v R [2011] NSWCCA 116","Judgment 

1WHEALY JA: I agree with Hidden J and the orders he proposes. I also agree with the additional observations made by Johnson J in his judgment. 

2HIDDEN J: After a trial before Mathews AJ and a jury, the applicant, Hoai Vinh Tran, was found guilty of murder. A co-accused, Cheltona Im, was acquitted. Mathews AJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 26 years, commencing on the date of his arrest, 7 November 2007, comprising a non-parole period of 20 years and a balance of term of 6 years. He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. 

Facts 

3In her remarks on sentence her Honour arrived at findings of fact after a careful examination of the evidence in the trial. The deceased, Peter Dang, had been the proprietor of a caf and a brothel in premises at Yagoona. He had been known to the applicant and his family for some time. He owed the applicant's aunt a considerable sum of money, and he also owed a lesser amount to the applicant's mother. The applicant had been trying to contact the deceased by phone about these debts, but the deceased did not return his calls. 

4In the afternoon of 8 May 2006, the applicant recruited Mr Im to drive him to the deceased's premises. Unknown to Mr Im, he was armed with a knife. Her Honour found that he did not plan to stab the deceased, but he did intend to assault him to extract the money from him. He had the knife, as her Honour put it, ""to frighten the deceased and to have it available if the situation called for it"". Her Honour also found that he took Mr Im with him ""as a form of support"". 

5As to the events leading to the fatal stabbing of the deceased at his premises, her Honour concluded that the applicant had initiated the violence by assaulting the deceased. Immediately after entering the caf, he punched the deceased and demanded money. However, the deceased retaliated, attempting to fight back. Most likely, it was at this stage that the applicant stabbed the deceased to the chest, inflicting three wounds later observed at a post mortem examination. These wounds were the cause of death. 

6Her Honour also concluded that at this stage Mr Im became involved in the altercation, trying to separate the other two men. There was then a confrontation between the deceased and Mr Im, during which the applicant stabbed the deceased four times in the back. These wounds were much less serious than the three frontal wounds, and could not themselves have been fatal. 

7Her Honour observed that whether this was ""the precise scenario"" could not be known. However, she found two things clearly established by the evidence: first, that the stabbing of the deceased was preceded by a fight between him and the applicant and, second, that it was the applicant who had initiated that fight. 

8Immediately after the stabbing, the applicant took Mr Dang's wallet and he and Mr Im left the scene. In the wallet was $250, which the two of them later spent playing poker machines and buying heroin. The applicant was not arrested until 7 November 2007, there being insufficient evidence to implicate him until a friend of his provided information to police in July 2007. When interviewed by police that month, he denied having been to the deceased's premises on the day in question. When interviewed further following his arrest, the effect of what he said was that he had gone to the premises with Mr Im but it was Mr Im who stabbed the deceased. That was his case at the trial. 

9Her Honour appears to have dealt with the applicant on the basis that he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm, not to kill. She recorded a submission to that effect by his counsel and continued: 

""In one sense that might be right. I very much doubt whether the offender at the time actually adverted to the probable consequences of his actions. Had he done so, however, he must have realised that the infliction of the three deep chest wounds carried, at the very least, a significant threat to life."" 

That passage also appears to reject a finding of reckless indifference to human life, which had been left to the jury. However that may be, it is clear, and was accepted by the parties in this Court, that her Honour did not find an intention to kill. 

10Turning to aggravating and mitigating factors under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, her Honour found as an aggravating factor that the offence was committed in company: subs (2)(e). As a mitigating factor she found that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity: subs (3)(b). However, she noted that that mitigating factor was ""tempered"" by a degree of planning, in that the applicant took the knife with him to the premises, concealing it from Mr Im. 

11Her Honour expressed the view that, if the applicant had gone to the caf ""with the positive intention of using the knife to seriously injure or to kill the deceased"", she would have regarded the offence as being above the mid-range of objective seriousness. The fact that he did not have ""a prior positive intention to stab the deceased"", she found, ameliorated the seriousness of the offence. On the other hand, she noted not only that the applicant ""deliberately initiated the fist fight with the deceased in an endeavour to extract money from him"", but also that ""it took only relatively minor resistance from the deceased to spur the offender into using the knife, with devastating consequences."" 

12Having regard to all relevant matters, her Honour concluded that the offence fell ""generally within the middle range of seriousness for murder."" The 20 year non-parole period which she set is the standard non-parole period for murder, and she found no reason to depart from it. 



Subjective Case 

13The applicant was 26 years old at the time of the offence and 30 at the time of sentence. He is now 31. He had been in custody in respect of this matter since his arrest on 7 November 2007, and her Honour backdated the sentence to that day. 

14He has a lengthy criminal history, commencing in 1996, when he was 16 years old, and extending over the following 10 years. It records convictions (or findings of guilt) mainly for drug offences, offences of dishonesty and driving offences. There is one conviction for assault, imposed in a Local Court in 2001. In 1998 he was given the benefit of a recognisance for armed robbery but, following a successful Crown appeal in the following year, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years: R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109. On several occasions thereafter he was sentenced to lesser terms of imprisonment for the assault, and for supplying prohibited drugs, offences of dishonesty and some driving offences. 

15He was born in Australia, the son of Vietnamese refugees. His parents separated when he was an infant, and for the next few years his mother brought him up. She then remarried, and had two daughters. The applicant's stepfather treated him badly, apparently resenting his presence in the home, and on occasions inflicted violence on him. The situation became so bad that his mother sent him to a country boarding school in year 10 to get him away from his stepfather. In the event, he left school before finishing year 12. His mother and stepfather divorced in 2000. 

16Unfortunately, from the age of 15 he embarked upon an escalating pattern of drug abuse, which continued until well after the murder. Her Honour saw his difficult childhood and youth, largely caused ""by his domineering and aggressive stepfather"", as one of the major causes of his taking to illicit drugs at an early age. 

17During an earlier period of imprisonment in 2006, he came into contact with Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist. Dr Westmore thought that he was of high average intelligence. He diagnosed him as suffering from drug induced schizophrenia, a condition which could be controlled by medication. Dr Westmore reported that his mental illness was relatively unstable and that further psychotic episodes could not be excluded if there was poor compliance with a regime of medication, a return to abuse of illicit drugs, or exposure to significant psychological stress. 

18Her Honour noted that there was nothing to suggest that his mental condition had any causal connection to the murder, and was of the view that his mental health was not such as to render him an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. She found him not to be remorseful, in the light of his behaviour after the murder. She noted that immediately after the stabbing he took Mr Dang's wallet and he and Mr Im spent the money that was in it, despite the fact that his stated reason for going to the deceased's caf was to recover money owing to his mother and his aunt. Moreover, both prior to and at his trial he sought to shift the blame for the stabbing onto Mr Im, who was innocent. 

19Her Honour found that it was ""not possible to say that he has good prospects of rehabilitation or that he is unlikely to re-offend."" Nevertheless, she noted that he had ""the intellectual capacity to lead a constructive and purposeful life."" She saw his inability to do so in his life thus far to be ""plainly the product of his drug taking."" She recognised the benefit of a lengthy period of parole eligibility, but declined to find special circumstances because the application of the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period to the sentence she proposed would provide that opportunity. 



The application 

20Neither the Crown prosecutor in this Court nor counsel for the applicant, Ms Rigg, had appeared before Mathews AJ. Ms Rigg argued the application on two grounds: 

(1) Her Honour erred in finding that the offence was aggravated because it was committed in company. 

(3) It was not open to her Honour to assess the offence as falling within the middle range of objective seriousness. 

Aggravating factor 

21Before her Honour it was contended by the Crown, and accepted by defence counsel, that the offence was aggravated by its having been committed by the applicant in the company of Mr Im. Her Honour was not referred to relevant authority which establishes that for an offence to be committed in company the offenders must share a common criminal purpose. So much is apparent from this Court's examination of the offence of aggravated sexual assault under s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900, where the circumstance of aggravation alleged was that the offender was in the company of another person or persons, in R v Button & Griffen [2002] NSWCCA 159, 54 NSWLR 455: see the judgment of Kirby J, with whom Heydon JA and Greg James J agreed, especially at [120]. His Honour's analysis was applied to s 21A(2)(e) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in Huntingdon v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 196: per Hislop J, with whom Giles JA and James J agreed, at [9] ff. 

22While Mr Im was present when the applicant stabbed the deceased, he was in no way complicit in that act. This follows from his acquittal by the jury, from which it must be concluded that Mr Im's physical involvement in the incident was to separate the applicant and the deceased and was not part of a joint criminal enterprise with the applicant to attack the deceased. As noted above, this was her Honour's conclusion in determining the facts for the purpose of sentence. The Crown prosecutor in this Court conceded that this ground is made out. 

23That said, Ms Rigg for her part acknowledged that the applicant's purpose in having Mr Im with him must have been to add greater weight to his demands upon the deceased, and may well have increased the fear the deceased experienced in the course of the applicant's attack. As I have said, her Honour found that the applicant had Mr Im with him as a form of support. Ms Rigg also conceded another factor aggravating the offence to which her Honour did not refer, that is, the use of a weapon: s 21A(2)(c). However, the Crown prosecutor acknowledged the significance which her Honour obviously placed upon the fact that the applicant had taken a knife with him to the premises and had resort to it after only a brief encounter with the deceased. 

24In the result, it appears to me that her Honour gave the applicant's use of the knife the weight it deserved in assessing his criminality, even though she did not expressly refer to the relevant provision in s 21A. On the other hand, there is some force in the Crown prosecutor's submission that the presence of Mr Im did not play as important a role in her Honour's assessment. Nevertheless, her Honour's finding that the offence was committed in company was clearly relevant. As error in that respect has been established, it is open to this Court to intervene and, in determining whether it should do so, to make its own assessment of the objective gravity of the offence. 

Objective gravity 

25That being so, it was not necessary for Ms Rigg to pursue the second ground of the application, that is, that it was not open to her Honour to assess the offence as falling within the middle range of objective seriousness. However, the Crown prosecutor submitted that we should arrive at the same assessment. 

26In written submissions, the Crown prosecutor set out a series of features of the case which, he argued, would lead us to that conclusion. Ms Rigg accepted that all of them were relevant factors, but argued that they pointed to an assessment of objective gravity below the mid-range. They were: 


the offence involved the use of a weapon (a knife); 

the applicant deliberately went to the deceased's premises armed with that knife with the intention of using it to intimidate and/or frighten the deceased if necessary as part of his plan to retrieve money; 

although the applicant did not go to the deceased's premises with the intention to use the knife in the murder of the deceased (that is it was not a premeditated murder), he did go there with the intention to intimidate the deceased to obtain money - therefore there was premeditation for a criminal offence - albeit not murder; 

the applicant started the physical violence towards the deceased deliberately in an endeavour to extract money from him; 

the applicant needed only slight resistance before producing and using the knife - showing a predisposition to use the knife as soon as he felt like it; 

the offence involved the infliction of seven stab wounds; 

the three stab wounds in the chest area were deep and inevitably carried with them a significant threat to life; 

all the stab wounds were inflicted to an unarmed man; 

there was no aspect of self defence in the use of the knife; 

there was no action that could amount to provocation by the deceased; 

the applicant committed these deliberate acts out of anger towards the deceased; 

there was no mental illness or mental health issues of the applicant that had a causal relationship with the murder; 

the applicant's behaviour after the murder was callous in leaving the deceased with no assistance having taken his wallet. 

27Ms Rigg focussed on the fact that the stabbing was not premeditated, it was a spontaneous act indicative of a loss of self control, and it was not accompanied by an intention to kill. It was not an act, as she put it, of ""detached brutality"". That conclusion, she said, was not inconsistent with the applicant's failure to seek assistance for the deceased, which should fairly be seen as the product of fear rather than callousness. 

28Although the second ground need not be determined, it is appropriate to make brief reference to some decisions of this Court in murder sentence cases to which were referred by counsel. The Crown prosecutor also referred us to the remarks on sentence of Fullerton J in R v Sullivan [2010] NSWSC 755, in which her Honour cited some other relevant authorities. The outcome of these cases is not material. My focus will be upon the assessment in each of them of the objective gravity of the offence. 

29In Apps v R [2006] NSWCCA 290, the offender shot the victim in circumstances which were unclear. He intended to kill him, and the sentencing judge described the shooting as a ""brutal and cowardly assassination"". His Honour held that the intention to kill placed the crime above the mid-range of objective seriousness. Moreover, there were other aggravating features of the offence, being the use of the weapon and the fact that the crime was committed in the victim's home. In the light of those additional features, his Honour placed the offence ""well above"" the mid-range. However, the offender had a mental condition causally related to the killing. 

30This Court found that his Honour had fallen into error in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, because he regarded the intention to kill alone as sufficient to place it above mid-range and had not given consideration to the offender's mental state: see the judgment of Simpson J, with whom Hunt AJA and Whealy J agreed, at [51] - [52]. Her Honour concluded that the offence lay ""at approximately the mid-range of objective gravity"": [80] - [81]. 

31In the course of her judgment, at [49], Simpson J said: 

""Certainly, in a case of murder, the state of mind in which the offence is committed is a relevant consideration going to objective seriousness. As is well known, murder may be established by proof of an act causing death committed when the act is accompanied by any one of three states of mind: in descending levels of seriousness they are: an intention to kill, an intention to cause grievous bodily harm, or reckless indifference. I have no doubt that an intention to kill as distinct from either of the two alternatives, is a consideration tending to greater objective seriousness rather than lesser. So much is obvious. ..."" 

Her Honour went on to observe that an intention to kill alone could not establish that a particular murder was above the mid-range of seriousness, as it was not the only circumstance relevant to that assessment. Affirming that the state of mind in which a murder is committed is not necessarily determinative of the question, Hunt AJA added at [4] that ""the standard non-parole period relates to a crime in the middle of seriousness relating to all the various states of mind which may constitute that crime."" 

32In Yun v R [2008] NSWCCA 114, 185 A Crim R 58, the offender and the deceased had consumed alcohol and, while they were walking in a street, they got into an argument which developed into a fight. The offender returned to his home in anger, obtained a knife and left, telling his mother that he was going to kill the deceased. He stabbed the deceased, fatally, in the street. The trial judge expressed the view that the fact that he intended to kill the deceased placed the crime ""somewhere between the mid-range of seriousness and a higher range"". The Court found that his Honour had fallen into error in that approach, referring to Apps . That error and another error identified in his Honour's reasoning led the Court to re-sentence. In so doing, the Court accepted that there was ""force in the Crown submission that the objective seriousness of this offence, given the applicant's intent, the use of a weapon and some level of premeditation is at the middle of the range of offences of this kind"": at [34]. 

33Nguyen v R [2007] NSWCCA 363, 180 A Crim R 267, was an appeal against conviction and sentence by four men found guilty of participating in a pre-meditated murder. Three of them succeeded in their appeals against conviction. It remained for the Court to consider the sentence appeal of the remaining man. Without going to the detail of the offence, it is sufficient to say that the victim was shot by that offender, who intended to kill, in what the sentencing judge described as ""a cold blooded execution"". The offence was committed in company, and the shooting occurred in a courtyard where a number of people were present, with disregard of the risk to others who were present and for public safety: see the leading judgment of Smart AJ at [138]. The sentencing judge found the offence to be substantially above the mid-range of objective seriousness. 

34The Court was comprised of Mason P, Adams J and Smart AJ. Smart AJ, with whom Adams J agreed but with Mason P dissenting on this point, found that the sentencing judge erred in assessing the objective gravity of the offence as he did. Smart AJ placed it in the mid-range of objective seriousness, expressing the view that an intention to kill and premeditation are ""usual elements"" in a murder in the mid-range: [143] - [144]. 

35In these three cases the Court found error in the sentencing judge's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence and arrived at its own assessment. In each of the remaining two cases the Court found that the sentencing judge's assessment of objective gravity was open on the evidence. 

36In Collon v R [2009] NSWCCA 187, the offender and the deceased were homeless men who were sharing accommodation provided by a charitable organisation. The killing occurred at those premises, against the background of friction between the two men over a period of about two months. The offender stabbed the deceased with two knives and a pair of scissors in a ferocious attack. The killing was spontaneous, the product of a loss of self control, but the offender intended to kill. He was intoxicated by a combination of drugs and alcohol, and there was psychiatric evidence that his mental capacity was to some extent impaired as a result of a very deprived upbringing. The sentencing judge found the seriousness of the offence to be in the mid-range. Kirby J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J agreed, concluded that that assessment was ""plainly open"": [39]. 

37In Versluys v R [2008] NSWCCA 76, the Court upheld a finding that a murder accompanied by the intent to inflict grievous bodily harm fell within the mid-range of objective gravity. The offender killed his de facto wife by manual strangulation because he believed she had been unfaithful to him. About a month earlier he had held a knife to her throat and tried to strangle her for the same reason. In the interim he told her mother that she was ""playing up"" on him, and threatened that he would kill her if she ever did it again. In the week leading up to the killing he told an acquaintance that she had been having an affair and that he felt like strangling her. The sentencing judge found that on the occasion of the killing he ""at least"" intended to cause her serious bodily harm. He noted that manual strangulation was a particularly horrible way for a person to die, and that the offender had in the past threatened to do exactly what he did. He also noted a ""vast physical difference"" between the offender and the deceased, making the killing ""a most cowardly crime"". 

38His Honour characterised the objective seriousness of the offence as ""well within the mid-range although at the high end of that range."" He added that if the crime had been premeditated he would have placed it beyond the mid-range. The Court held that his Honour had made an appropriate determination of the seriousness of the offence. Citing the judgment of Hunt AJA in Apps at [4], McClellan CJ at CL, with whom Simpson and Price JJ agreed, observed that although ""where there is an intention to kill the objective seriousness of the offence is likely to be greater, it does not follow that where the intention is confined to an intention to cause grievous bodily harm the objective seriousness will fall below the mid range"": [32]. As to the lack of premeditation, his Honour said at [34]: 

""It may be accepted that a murder which is not premeditated would usually be less serious than one which involves planning. However murder is a crime which can be committed under a very wide range of circumstances and the absence of premeditation does not dictate a finding that the objective seriousness of the particular offence falls below the mid range."" 

39What emerges from these cases is what one would expect. Whether a killing was premeditated or, in any event, whether it was accompanied by an intention to kill are important questions in an assessment of where a murder lies in the range of objective gravity, but of themselves are not necessarily determinative. Invariably, there will be other circumstances in the particular case bearing on that assessment. In Versluys at [36], McClellan CJ at CL said: 

""When assessing the objective seriousness of any offence the court is required to identify the relevant facts and form an intuitive judgment based upon the experience of the courts in sentencing for the particular offence. This is true of murder as it is of any other offence ... ."" 

Of course, the assessment of the objective gravity of an offence is an important aspect of any sentencing exercise, and one which requires careful consideration. For obvious reasons, this is particularly so when sentencing for offences for which a standard non-parole period is prescribed. 

40Turning, then, to the present case, the applicant had a legitimate grievance against the deceased but the way he went about addressing it involved serious criminality. He went to the deceased's premises, armed with a knife, determined to recover the money owing by intimidation or force, if necessary. His behaviour after the killing, however it might be explained, was reprehensible. It was he who initiated the violence upon his arrival at the premises, and he had resort to the knife after relatively little resistance from the deceased. Seven stab wounds were inflicted, three of them serious. All that said, however, the killing was spontaneous and the applicant did not intend to cause death. Clearly, he was in an angry state and his resort to the use of the knife is consistent with a loss of self control. In all the circumstances, I would assess the objective gravity of the offence as below the mid-range, although not far from it. 

Re-sentence 

41I am satisfied that this Court should intervene and re-sentence the applicant. In so doing, it is necessary to have regard to his criminal history and personal background, which I have summarised. I would respectfully share her Honour's somewhat guarded assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation. Like her Honour, I would not find special circumstances because the application of the statutory ratio to the sentence which I propose would produce a substantial period of parole eligibility. In my view, the appropriate sentence is imprisonment for 24 years with a non-parole period of 18 years. 

42I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. I would quash the sentence passed by Mathews AJ, and would re-sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 18 years, commencing on 7 November 2007 and expiring on 6 November 2025, and a balance of term of 6 years, commencing on 7 November 2025 and expiring on 6 November 2031. 

43JOHNSON J : I agree with the orders proposed by Hidden J and with his Honour's reasons, but would add one further observation. 

44Although it will generally be the case that an intention to cause grievous bodily harm is less culpable to a greater or lesser degree than an intention to kill in a case of murder, that is not always so and there may be circumstances where an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm could reflect similar criminality to other cases involving an intention to kill: R v Nelson (NSWCCA, 25 June 1996, unreported); R v Hillsley [2006] NSWCCA 312; 164 A Crim R 252 at 258 [16]. 

45These statements have been made in decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal which predate the standard non-parole period system ( R v Nelson ) and which postdate that system ( R v Hillsley ). The statements are pertinent to the determination of objective seriousness of a crime of murder under the standard non-parole period system and, in my view, should be kept in mind in conjunction with the authorities and principles referred to in the judgment of Hidden J.

		20 May 2011",2011-05-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2709751,R v Steven KROTIRIS [2011] NSWDC 111,"SENTENCE 

1. I am sentencing Steven Krotiris for the crime of stealing property in a dwelling house. When I am sentencing him I will take into account another offence of attempted break and enter with intent to steal to which Mr Krotiris has pleaded guilty and I sign a certificate to the effect that I have taken it into account. 

2. Stealing property in a dwelling house is an offence against section 148 of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament has fixed a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment to that crime. 

3. The crime which I am taking into account of attempt break, enter and steal is, on the face of it, even more serious, carrying a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period but I am satisfied in the circumstances of both offences that it is an appropriate offence to go on to the Form 1. 

4. It is always important for a judge, in sentencing an offender, to first describe what happened in the crime so that the basis of the sentence is clear and so that an assessment can be made of how serious the crime is. 

5. Mr Krotiris and another man named Andrew Schoultz were in Birriga Road, Bellevue Hill, in the early hours of Tuesday, 9 December 2008; in fact it was about 4.30 in the morning. There was a security gate around a block of units in Birriga Road. The gate was about two metres high. Both of them climbed over the security gate and went down a flight of stairs to the first unit. 

6. They tried to get into one of the units. They were seen by one of the occupants who reported what had happened and Mr Krotiris and Mr Schoultz left the scene. They were heard talking by the occupants of the unit they tried to get into and they were seen looking into cars parked in a nearby block of units. The occupants of the unit that they tried to get into called the police. 

7. Not knowing that the police were on their way, Mr Krotiris and Mr Schoultz continued with their criminal escapade. They got a makeshift ladder and climbed on to the balcony of a unit in another block of units nearby. The sliding door had been left slightly open for fresh air. It was Mr Schoultz who actually got on to the balcony. 

8. He then walked through the sliding door and picked up a computer and a watch which belonged to one of the occupants. He in fact was in the bedroom of one of the occupants. She woke up and not surprisingly screamed and woke her partner who jumped out of bed and told Mr Schoultz to clear off. Mr Schoultz did just this and jumped over the balcony and discarded what he had taken. 

9. The man was heard running up Birriga Road and voices were heard saying, "" The cops, the cops are here ."" 

10. The police arrived and Mr Schoultz was arrested whilst he was running away. He was wearing a sock on one hand and had a screwdriver and a latex glove as well. They then found Mr Krotiris. They found that Mr Krotiris had 
Mr Schoultz's phone number on Mr Krotiris' phone. Police asked Mr Krotiris what he was doing and he said, "" I was at the top of the street doing 500 steps, push-ups, 500 steps, push-ups."" 

11. Mr Schoultz pleaded guilty to his crimes and on 24 September 2009 was sentenced by his Honour Judge King SC to two years imprisonment with a non-parole period of one year. On the other hand, Mr Krotiris pleaded not guilty and went to trial. 

12. The trial was listed in November 2009 but vacated because Mr Krotiris changed his legal representation. It was then listed again in July 2010 but was vacated because Mr Krotiris was sick. It was listed again in October 2010 but was vacated for a third time because a Crown witness was not available. 

13. It came on for hearing before me on 17 January 2011. I heard a voir dire and admitted certain evidence. After admitting that evidence, Mr Krotiris pleaded guilty. He, therefore, pleaded guilty at a very late stage, whereas his co-offender, Mr Schoultz, had pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity and was allowed a 25 per cent discount from his sentence by Judge King. I propose to allow Mr Krotiris a discount of something over 5 per cent in respect of his sentence. 

14. Mr Krotiris has a bad criminal record. He has served prison sentences for stealing, for possessing implements to break into a car, for having goods in custody. He received a two year prison sentence for supplying prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis. He has been sentenced for break, enter and steal and obtain money by deception. It is a very bad record for a man who is now thirty-four years old. 

15. Interestingly, he committed no offences as a juvenile. His offending commenced after he had turned eighteen. 

16. Ms Sinosic, who appeared for the prosecutor, pointed to some aggravating features of the crime that I am sentencing Mr Krotiris for. He has a record of previous convictions, including convictions for this sort of crime. The offence was committed in company. It was also committed whilst he was on conditional liberty. She also argued that the offence was planned but I do not take that into account. I think it likely that it would be available but I am not sufficiently satisfied to take it into account against him. 

17. It needs also to be borne in mind that Mr Krotiris was not the person who actually entered the unit, it was his co-offender. On the other hand, he has pleaded guilty to the offence. 

18. His Honour Judge King found that the same offence, which was also committed by Mr Schoultz, fell within the lower range, as his Honour said at that stage, "" of objective seriousness "". I would not use that very expression, nor would I expect his Honour nowadays but I would find that the offence objectively, as compared to other offences, falls within the lower end of the range but, on the other hand, I have to take into account that he has his previous convictions and was on conditional liberty at the time. 

19. It is important for a judge in sentencing a person to also take into account their personal circumstances. In this case Mr Flynn of counsel, who appeared for Mr Krotiris, tendered a psychologist's report from Mr Tim Watson-Munro dated 4 April 2011. He also called his client. That report confirmed information given or evidence given by Mr Krotiris that he has had a serious heroin habit for some years. He has been through the Drug Court and been part of the program administered by that Court. He was successful for some time but then relapsed when tragically a woman who was pregnant to his children suffered a miscarriage. When he committed the offence I am sentencing him for and the other offence, he was at that stage of relapse. 

20. Mr Schoultz himself was also a heroin addict and both men were obviously behaving in a predatory way, breaking into the property of other members of the community in order to steal things which could be sold to feed their drug habit. 

21. Mr Krotiris has struggled with his heroin addiction and, to his credit, has re-established himself on the methadone program at the present stage. 

22. Mr Watson-Munro described Mr Krotiris as depressed and anxious, which is hardly surprising given his circumstances and his drug history. 
Mr WatsonMunro did note that Mr Krotiris "" expressed considerable remorse for his behaviour, which I believe to be genuine."" This remorse was confirmed by Mr Krotiris and I take it into account as well. 

23. The psychologist noted that he was willing for treatment which can be offered to him and he has commenced contact with an organisation which will assist him in that process of treatment. He has undertaken programs through the Drug Court as well, as I have already said. 

24. Mr Flynn argued that this is a case which could warrant an intensive correction order by way of a penalty. He acknowledged that, of course, I had to determine the sentence first because if the sentence was over two years then Mr Krotiris would not be eligible for such a penalty. 

25. Given Mr Krotiris' criminal record and the fact that he was on conditional liberty at the time that he committed this offence and was in company, I regard an appropriate penalty as three years imprisonment. I propose to discount that by two months to represent his plea of guilty. That is a period of a little over 
5 per cent. 

26. Normally a sentence of thirty-four months, which represents two years and ten months, would attract a non-parole period of two years and one month, that is twenty-five months, which is approximately 75 per cent of thirtyfour months. However, I would propose to reduce the non-parole period to eighteen months. It follows from the sentence which I have announced that an intensive correction order is not available as a penalty for Mr Krotiris. 

27. There was some evidence and argument over three things which should affect when the sentence starts. The three things were the time that 
Mr Krotiris has already served in custody, which may be attributable to this offence, directly or indirectly. The second is a bail condition of curfew for overnight for most of the time, if not all, that he has been on bail. The third was a daily reporting condition. 

28. Nothing was put to me from which I could comfortably conclude or be satisfied, even on the balance of probabilities, that time spent in custody by 
Mr Krotiris attributable for this offence was anything more than the sixteen days which the prosecution acknowledged could be taken into account. On the other hand, the bail conditions were reasonably onerous, although the curfew was overnight, when one would expect someone to be sleeping. 

29. Mr Flynn argued that I should make an allowance of some six months. I regard that as far too much. I propose, however, to - I expect somewhat generously - allow a period of two months for the period he has spent in custody, directly or indirectly attributable to this offence, as well as his onerous bail conditions. Accordingly, I propose to backdate the sentence by two months and I have, I can see, made an error in some calculations and I will allow that in favour of Mr Krotiris. I have actually fixed a non-parole period of sixteen months and I have backdated it by two months and I will give him the benefit of that miscalculation on my part. 

HIS HONOUR: All right, I am going to sentence you now, Mr Krotiris. 

30. For the crime of stealing property in a dwelling house and taking into account the attempted break, enter and steal with intent to steal, I fix a 
non-parole period of one year and four months to commence on 13 March 2011 and to expire on 12 July 2012. The balance of the term will be one year and six months to commence on 13 July 2012 and to expire on 12 January 2014. 

31. The overall sentence will be two years and ten months from 13 March 2011 until 12 January 2014. I direct your release on parole on 12 July 2012. 

32. Now, two things Ms Sinosic and Mr Flynn. The two things are, first, whether I have got the sums correct, whether the sentences I have announced and the dates are consistent. And, secondly, what conditions of parole I should fix. Thirdly, perhaps I should add, any factual errors or matters which I have not taken into account which I should have or I have taken into account and should not have, which I might be able to correct under section 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

FLYNN: Your Honour, there were two factual errors that I picked up. 
HIS HONOUR: Yes, tell me. 
FLYNN: Firstly, your Honour said they, referring to both offenders, obtained the ladder. The statement of facts indicates that it was-- 

HIS HONOUR: You are quite right, it was the co-offender who obtained the 

makeshift ladder; you are right. 

FLYNN: And the other error that I picked up was a slip, actually, probably; that your Honour indicated that we went to trial 17 January 2010 and, of course, it's 2011. 

HIS HONOUR: Thank you. The trial was listed to commence before me 

17 January 2011. Thank you. 

FLYNN: They're the only two factual issues and as far as the mathematics and calculations, my solicitor tells me they are correct, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Okay. Ms Sinosic? 

SINOSIC: I believe that's correct and I am sure your Honour would formally 

convict the offender. 

HIS HONOUR: Thank you, I do. I thank you for reminding me. 


33. I convict Mr Krotiris of the offence of stealing property in a dwelling house. 

SINOSIC: Your Honour, I understand that the agreed facts don't actually refer to this offender's role. Does your Honour wish to make - I think my friend and I both indicated that he was willing and able to assist. 

HIS HONOUR: Oh well, he has pleaded guilty to the offence. 

SINOSIC: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: So that carries with it an admission of being there. 

SINOSIC: If your Honour's satisfied with that, I won't take it any further. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes. Mr Flynn, your client admits, I assume, that he was willing and able to assist the primary offender, or Mr Schoultz? 

FLYNN: Well, it's silent but the assistance was, as I understand it-- 

HIS HONOUR: Being available. 

FLYNN: --being available. 

HIS HONOUR: Outside. 

FLYNN: It goes no further than that. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes, I have taken that into account, that that was the level of his assistance. That was reflected in my comment about him not being on the inside. 

All right, now what about conditions of his parole, please? 

SINOSIC: There's obviously the standard conditions. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes, there will be standard conditions of good behaviour but does he need supervision? 

SINOSIC: Your Honour, the Crown would be asking that there be-- 

HIS HONOUR: See, he's got a year and six months on parole. 

SINOSIC: That the supervision of Probation and Parole Service, in order to assist him with his rehabilitation in relation to drugs. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes, I'll do that. Mr Flynn? 

FLYNN: Nothing. I don't respond to that, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Okay. 

34. The conditions of parole are these: 
(1) That he be of good behaviour; 
(2) That he attend court, if called upon to do so; 
(3) That he notify the Office of the Probation and Parole Service of any change in his residential address during the period of parole; 
(4) That he accept supervision from the Probation and Parole Service, including any reasonable recommendations and directions which they may give with particular reference to drug rehabilitation. 

35. I give the exhibits, including the voir dire exhibits, to my associate to put on the file, including the MFI's and the transcript. 

Does your client want a short amount of time with his mother before-- 

FLYNN: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Not too long. The Corrective Services are here for a purpose. He is not to leave the courtroom but if he wants a minute or two with his mother, then I'll allow that. 

FLYNN: Please the court.

		29 August 2011",2011-05-12 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709755,Police v Kevin Francis Barlow (No 1) [2011] NSWLC 19,"JUDGMENT 

1On 12 May 2010 and on 14 June 2010 there were fires at a dwelling on the property 'Carinya' on Mitchell's Road, some few kilometres east of the town of Culcairn. The first fire was limited to the roof cavity and caused about $5,000 of damage. The dwelling was completely destroyed as a result of the second fire. The accused has been charged in respect of those fires. There are four charges that fall for determination. I note that at the beginning of the hearing of this matter on Monday 9 June 2011 the accused pleaded guilty to charges of Drive Unregistered Motor Vehicle, Drive Uninsured Motor Vehicle and Enter Inclosed Lands. Those matters are irrelevant to my consideration of the four outstanding and far more serious matters, and I ignore those minor summary matters for the purposes of my consideration of the remaining charges. 

2The charges that remain for consideration are: 

(1)That (he) on 12 May 2010 at Culcairn in the State of New South Wales did dishonestly with a view to making gain for himself, the said Kevin Francis Barlow by means of fire damage property, (namely) dwelling house on the property 'Carinya' Mitchell's Road, contrary to s. 197(1)(b) Crimes Act, 1900, and 
(2)That (he) on 12 May 2010 at Culcairn in the State of New South Wales did intentionally or recklessly damage by means of fire, certain property, (namely) dwelling house the property of Sharon Lee Hart (nee Barlow), contrary to s. 195(1)(b) Crimes Act, 1900, and 
(3)That (he) on 14 June 2010 at Culcairn in the State of New South Wales, did dishonestly with a view to making gain for himself the said Kevin Francis BARLOW, by means of fire destroy property, (namely) dwelling house on the property 'Carinya', Mitchell's Road, contrary to s. 197(1)(b) Crimes Act, 1900 and 
(4)That (he) on 14 June 2010 at Culcairn in the State of New South Wales did intentionally or recklessly destroy by means of fire certain property, (namely) dwelling house on the property 'Carinya', Mitchell's Road, the property of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. 

3These matters are all criminal charges. Therefore before I can find the accused guilty on any one or more of the charges I would need to be satisfied of his guilt, and satisfied of that guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The words 'beyond reasonable doubt' are ordinary English words and are to be given their ordinary English meaning. No further elaboration is necessary or desirable. The onus is on the prosecution from beginning to end to prove its case and to prove it beyond reasonable doubt. There is no onus whatsoever on the accused. If I refer to the prosecution having to prove something, I am very much aware the standard is the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt. 

4As part of the directions on the onus and burden of proof I also direct myself that suspicion, not even the gravest of suspicion can be a substitute for proof beyond reasonable doubt. 

5Subject to what is contained within the paragraph immediately following this, each charge must be considered separately, and a separate verdict must be returned in respect of each charge. The evidence in respect of each charge must be considered separately. It is uncontroversial that there were two fires at the same premises, namely the residence at the property 'Carinya' some few kilometres to the east of Culcairn. Sequences 1 and 2 relate to the fire on 12 May 2010 and sequences 3 and 4 relate to the fire on 14 June 2010. 

6The charges as set out above are in the order in which they appear (i.e. sequences 1 to 4 inclusive) on the court papers. It was made clear at the beginning of the case on 9 May 2011 that the prosecution relied upon sequence 2 as an alternative or a back up to sequence 1, and sequence 4 as an alternative or ""back up"" to sequence 3. Upon inquiry of both advocates it was agreed that I would adopt the procedure of firstly considering whether the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt in respect of sequence 1 and sequence 3. If I were so satisfied I would not be required to give a verdict in respect of sequences 2 and 4. However, if I were not satisfied of the guilt of the accused in respect of sequence 1 I would then go to consider whether I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in respect of sequence 2. Further, if I were not satisfied of the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt in respect of sequence 3 I would then go to consider whether the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt in respect of sequence 4. 

7As I have already directed myself, there is no onus on the accused. The accused in this matter did not give evidence. Therefore there are a number of essential directions I must give myself, and bear firmly in mind as I embark upon my task in assessing the evidence and determine whether the prosecution has proved its case. 

8The accused is certainly not obliged to give evidence. As the tribunal of fact I cannot and must not draw any inference adverse to the accused by reason of the fact he did not give evidence. The onus is on the prosecution from beginning to end to prove its case and to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. There might be many good reasons why an accused might not give evidence and I must not speculate as to what those reasons might be. The fact that the accused did not give evidence cannot be used by the prosecution, or indeed myself as the tribunal of fact, to plug or fill any gaps or holes in the prosecution case. For more abundant caution I remind and direct myself that no adverse inference can be drawn against the accused because he did not give evidence and that the onus is on the prosecution from beginning to end to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. 

9However, it is not the situation that the accused has remained completely silent in the course of the investigation. The accused submitted to being electronically interviewed by Detective Simmons. The accused maintains in the course of that interview that he was not responsible for either of the fires. The prosecution also rely on some of the answers in that interview to establish what the prosecution maintain are lies. I will return to this issue later when I come to summarise the contents of the record of interview 

10It is not every syllable that is uttered in the course of evidence or every word that is written in tendered documents that the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt. What the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt are the essential elements or essential ingredients of the charge. Counts (or sequences) 1 and 3 are in identical terms, save as to the dates of the respective fires, and counts (or sequences) 2 and 4 are identical save as to the dates of the fire and the owner of the property. Accordingly, it seems to me that I need only direct myself as to the essential elements of a charge contrary to s 197(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 and s 195(()(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. It seems that it is uncontroversial that between the two fires the Commonwealth Bank who was the mortgagee took possession of the property. This accounts for the difference in the nominated owner of the property. 

11Section 197(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 provides: 

(1) A person who dishonestly, with a view to making a gain for that person or another, destroys or damages property is liable: 
(a) to imprisonment for 7 years, or 
(b) if the destruction or damage is caused by means of fire or explosives, to imprisonment for 14 years. 

12The essential elements or ingredients of the charges in sequences 1 and 3 are: 

(1)The accused; 
(2)Damaged or destroyed; 
(3)Property by means of fire 
(4)With a view to making a gain for himself; and 
(5)The accused was acting dishonestly. 

13So far as the second element is concerned I note that the subject premises at 'Carinya' were damaged by fire in the first fire, but destroyed in the second fire that occurred on 14 June 2010. 

14So far as the element of the accused acting dishonestly is concerned, I direct myself in accordance with s 4B of the Crimes Act 1900, which relevantly provides that ""dishonest"" means ""dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people and known by the defendant to be dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people"". 

15I observe (at the risk of repetition) that it is not controversial there was a fire on 12 May 2010 that damaged the property at 'Carinya' and that there was a second fire on 14 June 2010 that destroyed the subject premises. The live issues in the matter that I have to determine is whether the prosecution have proved beyond reasonable doubt (1) that it was accused who set the fires causing the relevant damage or destruction, (2) the accused had a view to making a gain for himself, and (3) he was acting dishonestly. 

16I now turn to the charges in counts (sequences) 2 and 4, namely the charges contrary to s 195(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. That section relevantly provides: 

A person who intentionally or recklessly destroys or damages property belonging to another or to that person and another is liable: 
(a) to imprisonment for 5 years, or 
(b) if the destruction or damage is caused by means of fire or explosives, to imprisonment for 10 years. 

17I raised with both advocates at the conclusion of addresses the issue of the accuracy and adequacy of these directions as to the essential ingredients of the charges. Neither advocate took apparent objection to these directions on the issue of the essential ingredients. 

18The prosecution case is obviously that the accused's actions were intentional. Again, there is no issue between the parties that there was damage to the property on 12 May 2010 and the property was destroyed on 14 June 2010. The live issues in respect of the alternate or ""back up"" counts is whether the prosecution can prove beyond reasonable doubt it was the accused who was responsible for setting or lighting the fires and therefore responsible for the resultant damage. 

19This case is one where the prosecution are relying on inferences. It is appropriate I direct myself in terms that a trial judge would direct a jury on the drawing of inferences. Inferences are conclusions of fact rationally drawn from a combination of proved facts. Inferences may be valid or invalid, justified or unjustified, correct or incorrect. As the matters that I am considering are criminal charges where the prosecution has the onus and burden of proving its case in each matter beyond reasonable doubt, as the tribunal of fact I should be extremely careful about drawing any inference. I should examine any possible inference to ensure that it is a justifiable inference. As these are criminal charges that I am considering, as the tribunal of fact I should not draw any inference from the direct evidence unless it is the only rational inference in the circumstances. 

20The case that the prosecution brings against the accused is essentially circumstantial. In the circumstances of the case, noting that there are competing inferences as it has been presented to me the accused is entitled to a circumstantial evidence direction. The nature of the circumstantial case in the matters presently under consideration is very much in the nature of ""strands of a cable"" rather than ""links in a chain"". A case based on circumstantial evidence may be just as convincing and reliable as a case based on direct evidence, depending on the nature of the circumstances relied upon when considered as a whole (not individually or in isolation) and the degree of clarity and certainty to which that evidence may lead inevitably to the conclusion that the prosecution has established its case. As the tribunal of fact I must not engage in conjecture or speculation. If I draw an inference adverse to and in favour of the Crown, it must be the only inference which, in my view, can be drawn beyond reasonable doubt. This being a circumstantial case I am unable to return a verdict of guilty in respect of any one or more of the counts that fall for my consideration unless I am of the opinion the guilt of the accused on the circumstantial evidence is not only an available conclusion but also the only rational and reasonable conclusion on the evidence. 

21I turn now to the facts and circumstances surrounding the first fire, i.e. the fire that occurred on 12 May 2010. 

22The accused was not the beneficial owner of the premises. His estranged wife, Sharon Lee Hart (as she now is) was the owner of the premises at least as at 12 May 2010. She and the accused were married in 1990, separated in 2007 and were formally divorced in 2008. The property at 'Carinya', Mitchell's Road, Culcairn was acquired in 2002 with finance being provided by the Commonwealth Bank, which held a mortgage over the property. Ms Hart lives in Sydney with her new husband Ronald Hart. There is obvious acrimony between the Harts and the accused. Ms Hart left 'Carinya' in about November 2007. There has been no finalisation of the matrimonial property. 

23Ms Hart had difficulty in servicing the mortgage and ultimately voluntarily went into bankruptcy. The accused remained living at 'Carinya' although he did not contribute much to the repayments. According to the uncontradicted evidence of Ms Hart he contributed a total of $1,700 after separation, although initially he contributed $20,000 from a compensation payout. There were some negotiations (the accused offering to pay in the vicinity of $20,000) between the accused and Ms Hart, but it seems from the evidence of Ms Hart that she was not prepared to meet some of the conditions insisted upon by the accused. 

24Further, Ms Hart gave evidence to the effect that in two different conversations in 2009 the accused threatened to burn down the premises. On the first of such occasions according to Ms Hart the accused maintained that he would set a fire using a candle which would set fire to other material after it burned down, and that it would look like and accident. On the second occasion Ms Hart sought permission from the accused for a valuer to attend the property. The accused threatened that if a ""For Sale"" sign was erected he would pull it down and burn the place down. Curiously, the threats included on both occasions that he would burn down the place with him inside the house. 

25These threats form part of the circumstantial case put forward by the prosecution. As I observed in the course of submissions, sitting in the Local Court, particularly when dealing with applications for Apprehended Violence Orders the court often hears of threats made to burn down premises. The cross examination was to the effect that no such threat was made. Ms Hart was not shaken in her evidence. She was obviously anxious and nervous but I saw no reason to disbelieve anything she said. What removes the threats from the category of usual idle type of threat to which I have just referred is the contents of the first conversation where the accused gave or spoke of a method. The evidence of the threats are merely part of the circumstantial case. 

26Both Mr and Ms Hart were cross-examined to the effect that they would like to see the accused in gaol over the fires. Both answered to the effect they would if he had done it. It was that qualification that both put on that answer that in my view added to their credit. Both gave evidence of being unable to insure the property as they were required to answer honestly a question by the insurance company as to whether there had ever been a threat made in respect of the property. This too, is one of the reasons why I accept the threats were made. 

27The premises were insured by virtue of a policy taken out by the accused in 2009 with ""Comminsure"" through the Commonwealth Bank. Exhibits 3 and 4, the reports by the Loss Adjuster (Mr Robert Bowler) indicate that the policy number was [xxx xxxxxxx]. 

28Further on the issue of insurance is the evidence of Chelsea Huggard contained within her statement, which is exhibit 52. Ms Huggard works at the Albury branch of the Commonwealth Bank and served the accused at 2.34pm on 20 April 2010. In the course of the business the accused was transacting he made an inquiry as to the date on which his home and contents insurance policy was to expire. Ms Huggard explained that it expired in July, but because of direct debits it would simply ""roll over"". It is significant that the accused inquired as to his insurance policy relatively close in time to the first fire. 

29The Commonwealth Bank, had however commenced action in respect of the property before the first fire on 12 May 2010. Exhibit 30 is a statement by Mr Bruce Moreland, who at the relevant time was a Sheriff's Officer at Albury. On 28 April 2010 Mr Moreland attended 'Carinya' and affixed to the premises a Notice to Vacate. The Notice was to the effect that all occupants were required to vacate the premises by 8.30am on 20 May 2010. 

30On 20 May 2010 Mr Moreland attended with his superior officer within the Sheriff's Office and a locksmith. The Writ of Possession had issued. Mr Moreland noticed that the Notice to Vacate that he had previously affixed had been removed. He noticed that there was paint missing from where he had affixed the notice with packing tape. 

31The fact that the Commonwealth Bank had commenced the action to take possession of the property is another of the circumstances relied upon by the prosecution, essentially going to motive as to why the accused would want to destroy the property by fire. 

32Ms Toni Leanne Hasler, a neighbour of the accused who lives (and lived at the relevant time) in Mitchell's Road passed the property 'Carinya' on the morning of 12 May 2010. She had known the accused for some few years. As she drove past the accused's premises she saw the accused just coming off the veranda, holding a container that he quickly dropped, and then wave to her. She was unable to further describe the container. The significance of the evidence is not the dropping of the container, but rather Ms Hasler places the accused at the house approximately half an hour before the fire was reported. Mr Quilter for the accused was at pains to point out that the time given by the witness was approximate. However, I am of the opinion that the fact that the accused was at the premises within half an hour or so of the fire is a very significant piece of circumstantial evidence, particularly so far as opportunity is concerned. 

33The container, as I have indicated is of no significance. It is agreed between the parties that there was no trace of an accelerant found at the scene of the first fire. 

34Indeed, it would seem that it was Mr Hasler who initially raised the alarm. He was working for Mr Scholz, who owned and operated the neighbouring farming property. Incidentally, although it is not particularly relevant to any issue that I have to decide, Mr Scholz now owns the property where the house was situated. Mr Hasler saw smoke coming from the house, telephoned his employer Mr Scholz who in turn contacted the authorities by 000 call. The Rural Fire Service of which Mr Hasler was part attended the scene and assisted in extinguishing the fire. Exhibit 27 is a Statement from Mr Mark Stewart of the Culcairn Fire Brigade, which indicates that the call was received at 11.45 am on 12 May 2010. 

35Mr Hasler rang Mr Desmond Godde and told him that he could see smoke. Mr Godde went to investigate and found smoke coming from the roof of the accused's house. He turned off the power to the house. Mr Desmond Godde was aware that the accused was working for his (Godde's) brother Wayne and accordingly, Desmond Godde telephoned Wayne Godde and asked that the message then be passed on. Mr Wayne Godde telephoned the accused on the accused's mobile telephone. 

36The accused had been at the property not long before the fire started. He went to the residence of Michelle King, a friend of his within the township of Culcairn. He drove his unregistered utility into town. For my present purposes the fact that the vehicle was unregistered by itself is of no consequence whatsoever. Ms King could not remember the exact date, but clearly she was giving evidence relating to 12 May 2010, the date of the first fire. The accused asked Ms King to drive him out to 'Carinya'. Ms King indicated that she had no petrol in her vehicle, the accused lent her $20 with which she purchased fuel at ""Biti Motors"", a local dealer at Culcairn. She then drove him out to 'Carinya'. According to Ms King the accused asked her to drive him out to 'Carinya' as the police would be there and his vehicle was unregistered. 

37Further, according Ms King, on the way to the property the accused's mobile telephone rang. He announced it was Mr Des Godde, who informed him that there was a fire at his home. Ms King maintained that the accused said something about not knowing whether it was a joke or not. She was not sure whether the accused said something about the police being there before or after the accused received the phone call. 

38Potentially there is some room for some confusion as to when it was that the accused became aware of the fire at his house on 12 May 2010. Ms King was recalled. It is tolerably plain so far as I am concerned that the accused attended upon the premises of Ms King and asked her to drive him out to his property. This and these general circumstances in my opinion substantially add to the prosecution's circumstantial case. Even adopting the view of the evidence most favourable to the accused it seems to me that it is truly remarkable that anyone being aware that there might be a fire at their home would concern themselves about driving an unregistered vehicle and then delay in getting out to the premises by having to purchase fuel. The usual and expected reaction of anyone would be to get to the scene as soon as humanly possible. The conduct of the accused in this regard is another ""strand"" in the prosecution's ""cable"". 

39Ms Aphton King also gave evidence. She had known the accused for about 7 years. On 12 May 2010 she went shopping in Culcairn and saw the accused's vehicle. Through a phone call she found out about the fire at the accused's home at 'Carinya'. She decided to go to the scene. She recalls that there was conversation about the fire being caused by electrical fault. 

40Electrical fault can be ruled out as a cause of both fires. Likewise, given the uncontradicted evidence in the form of the statement of Ross Wheeler (exhibit 36), lightning strikes can also be eliminated. There was no lightning within a 100 kilometre radius of Albury on 12 May 2010, or for that matter on 14 June 2010 (date of the second fire). Culcairn and the property 'Carinya' are well within that 100 kilometre radius of Albury. 

41Inspections of the property after the fire on 12 May 2010 were carried out by Mr Robert Bowler, a Loss Assessor; Mr John Baker, an Inspector with the Rural Fire Service of New South Wales and Mr Neil Barns, a Forensic Consultant. Mr Bowler made arrangements for emergency accommodation for the accused after the fire. 

42The photographs within exhibit 2 clearly show the extent of the damage as a result of the fire on 12 May 2010. The damage was limited to the roof cavity. Paragraph 12 of Mr Bowler's statement (exhibit 1) sets out a description of the damage that he observed: 

""The roof was in two sections with a damaged gabled roof to the south alongside an intact skillion section to the north. Both Barlow and I climbed onto the skillion roof in order to inspect the damaged gabled section. Much of the timber was still in place but had been exposed when the metal roof material was removed. I presumed the roof metal had been removed by fire brigade officers as they extinguished the fire. I observed there was charring at various points particularly the ridge beams. The ridge was split into two sections in the original construction with a shorter section at the eastern end and this was burnt out in the centre. The interesting thing was there was no obvious connection between the various charred areas. There was a quantity of roofing insulation similar to sisalation that appeared to have been installed between the roof timbers and the roof metal...I was unable to locate a definite origin for the fire damage..."" 

43Mr Baker whose statement was tendered and is exhibit 7 was of the opinion that the point of origin of the fire was at the western edge of the structure about 1.5 metres from the western edge. Grey and green coloured wiring was seen, but there was no evidence of arcing. The grey wire was found to be connected to nothing electrical. The process of arcing was described in the course of his evidence on 9 May 2011. It was described as electricity meeting resistance and the metal breaking down. Mr Baker was of the opinion that the fire was suspicious in origin. 

44Neil Barnes is a highly qualified and very experienced Forensic Consultant who has been investigating fires and explosions for in excess of 30 years. No challenge was made to his expertise, and in my opinion no such challenge could reasonably have been made. He too was of the opinion that the fire was not electrical in origin. He too was of the opinion that there was no evidence of arcing. He described in his evidence distinctive burn patterns on the three ceiling bearers. He maintained in his evidence that for such burning to have occurred something had to have been placed on those bearers. He was of the opinion that the fire was not accidental. There were no signs of accelerant. 

45In the course of the police investigation police recovered from a vehicle belonging to the accused that was removed from the property on 13 May 2010 what is described as a ""Molotov cocktail"". It is in fact an empty beer stubby, which contains the ends of cigarette butts. Attached to that bottle is a ""Jim Beam"" cap through which is threaded what is described as ""wick"". It is old material of some description. That item is exhibit 42. 

46Had this been a jury trial, I am not certain whether I would have admitted the evidence of the finding of that Molotov cocktail by reason of the danger of unfair prejudice given the nature of the charge, taken with the fact that there is no suggestion of an explosion in respect of either fire. For the purpose of deciding the matters I have to decide I ignore that Molotov cocktail, save and except for the nature of material constituting the wick. 

47Mr Barnes, the Forensic Consultant was shown exhibit 42 and asked a number of questions about the material constituting the wick. He maintained whatever was placed on the bearers would have been a little wider than the wick in exhibit 42. 

48At the conclusion of his evidence, in order to ensure that I properly understood the evidence, I asked a question to the effect of whether he was saying that the burn pattern on the bearers that he observed was consistent with something being placed on them, or whether he was going further and saying that for the result that he observed something had to have been placed on the bearers. He indicated that it was the latter. I inquired of both advocates as to whether they wished to ask any questions as a result of that answer and both declined. 

49Given the combined evidence of Messrs. Barnes, Baker and Bowler, but particularly the evidence of Mr Barnes, I am satisfied that the fire on 12 May 2010 at the home of the accused was deliberately lit by someone placing some type of combustible material and the bearers and setting it alight. 

50I have summarised above the evidence available to the prosecution so far as the first fire is concerned. Taking all of the necessary warnings into account I am, however, satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused deliberately lit that fire in the morning of 12 May 2010. There is another issue relating to the primary and alternative counts relating to each fire to which I will later return. 

51I have not yet dealt with the version of the accused as contained within the record of interview. For reasons, with which I will deal when considering the second fire, I reject the version of the accused as it appears in the record of interview. I have come to my stated decision in respect of the first fire very much aware of the fact that as the tribunal of fact I do not have to accept the version of the accused in order to have a reasonable doubt. 

52I have indicated my finding in respect of the first fire at this stage of my reasons as the finding beyond reasonable doubt that it was the accused lit that first fire potentially impacts on the prosecution case. The Prosecution in this matter has served a Co Incidence Notice on the accused. That Notice is exhibit 39 in the proceedings. There was no apparent objection to the tender of the Notice, nor was there any objection to me hearing the evidence in respect of both fires in the one hearing. As I understood the submissions of counsel for the accused, the issue was not so much the admissibility of the evidence, but rather, what use I might make of that evidence. 

53The Notice appears to conform with the requirements of the Evidence Act 1995 and the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v AN (2000) 117 A Crim R 176 [2000] NSWCCA 372 at [61]-[62] and R v Zhang (2005) 158 A Crim R 504 at [131]. I note again that no apparent issue was taken with the Notice when it was tendered. 

54As I understand the decided authorities on Co-Incidence evidence before it can be used by the tribunal of fact the various matters relied upon must be proved to the criminal standard, i.e. beyond reasonable doubt - see for e.g. HML v The Queen [2008] HCA 16. Further, as was made clear by Simpson J in DAO V R [2011] NSWCCA 63 co-incidence (and indeed tendency) evidence is much in the nature of circumstantial evidence, and accordingly, subject to the relevant directions on circumstantial evidence. 

55Although I now turn to consider the fire on 14 June 2010, I have before me the evidence relating to the fire on 12 May 2010, and the decision I have made so far as that fire is concerned. So far as co-incidence evidence is concerned, juries are directed to the effect that (using the context of the matters I am considering): 

""That evidence is before you because sometimes there may be such a similarity between two different acts and the circumstances in which they occurred that a jury may be satisfied that the person who did one act (or set of acts) must have done the other(s). That is to say, there is such a similarity between the acts, and the circumstances in which they occurred, that because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, it establishes that the accused committed the act ( or had the state of mind) that is the subject of the offence(s), because coincidence is a very unlikely explanation for the similarity(ies). 

In this case, the Crown says that, provided you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused deliberately lit the fire at Carinya on 12 May 2010 then that act and the circumstances in which it was done, were so similar to the act(s) that the Crown says amounts to the offence(s) alleged, that you would conclude that the accused must have deliberately lit the fire on 14 June 2010. 

I repeat that the evidence of the pattern of behaviour can only be used in the way the Crown asks you to if you are firstly satisfied that the accused did the other acts beyond reasonable doubt"". 

56It is appropriate I direct myself accordingly. Accordingly, before I can as the tribunal of fact use the fact of the accused deliberately lighting the fire on 12 May 2010 in the determining whether the accused deliberately lit the fire on 14 June 2010 I would need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt not only that the accused lit the fire on 12 May 2010, but also the circumstances in which the fire of 14 June 2010 was lit there is such a similarity between the acts, and the circumstances in which they occurred the improbability of the acts occurring co incidentally it establishes that the accused deliberately lit the fire on 14 June 2010. 

57Mr Quilter in his final submissions on behalf of the accused argued quite forcefully that the test should be ""striking similarity"". I do not accept that submission. The expression ""striking similarity"" is drawn from the common law authorities before the Evidence Act 1995 was enacted. As was made plain by the decision in R v Ellis (2003) 58 NSWLR 700; 144 A Crim R 1; [2003] NSWCCA 319 the provisions of the Act are to be followed in preference to the common law that developed on similar fact evidence. Special Leave to appeal to the High Court was granted but revoked - see Ellis v The Queen [2004] HCA Trans 488, with the High Court indicating that the decision in Ellis was correct. 

58Mr Quilter also strongly argued that the test for admissibility of co-incidence evidence is higher where the issue is identity of the offender or perhaps more correctly, the identity of the accused as being the person responsible for the criminal act. The decision of R v Tektonopoulos [1999] 2 VR 412 was cited as authority for the proposition. I also reject this submission as I am of the opinion considering the law that has developed in New South Wales on the issue does not support that proposition. I particularly refer to R v Fletcher (2005) 156 A Crim R 308, Zhang (2005) 158 A Crim R 308 and more recently DAO [2011] NSWCCA 63. 

59The fire on 14 June 2010 completely destroyed the dwelling. The extent of the destruction is obvious in the photographs within exhibit 9. 

60Returning to the evidence of Mr Bowler, the Loss Assessor, he received a call from Detective Simmons on the evening of 14 June 2010 to say that the house had burnt to the ground. Mr Bowler attended the scene on 16 June 2010. It was observed that the electricity metre box was still sealed. There is evidence that that box was sealed on the date of the first fire, i.e. 12 May 2010. Accordingly, as there was no electricity connected to the premises, electrical fault can be quickly eliminated as a possible cause of the fire on 14 June 2010. Mr Bowler says (paragraph 40 exhibit 1) that when he was at the scene with the accused the accused ""suddenly observed there was no trace of his large chest freezer as there should have been at the time of the fire. Barlow observed that there must have been a theft at some stage during his absence. He did not seek to make a connection between the possible theft and the fire"". A close examination of the debris was not made at that point in time as there was friable asbestos and a strong wind blowing. 

61Mr Bowler also maintains (paragraph 43) that the accused told him that he (the accused) had only been to the scene once since the first fire. This is in contrast to other versions the accused has given, and the evidence of Mr Scholz, to which I shall shortly return. 

62Mr Barnes, the Forensic Consultant made a far more thorough examination of the scene and the debris in particular. He was of the opinion that the intensity of the second fire consumed all combustible material. There was no indication of an accelerant, but the fire was such that any accelerant would have been consumed in the fire, and accordingly he would not have found any. There were no metal tins or containers found within the debris. The glass from the windows was within a metre or so from the where the building would have been. This indicates that there was no explosion. 

63Of particular significance was Mr Barnes' evidence of inspecting the debris for signs of the remains of furniture and the like. In what would have been the main bedroom Mr Barnes found the remains of metal bedside lamps, but found no evidence of the remains of any bed. He maintained that the coiling would have remained and been visible. In answer to questions 190 and continuing in his interview with Colin Brockwell (see exhibit 6) the accused maintains that his bed was valued at about $5000. Mr Brockwell was the investigator retained by Comminsure to investigate the fires on behalf of the insurance company. His statement is exhibit 5. 

64The disputation between the accused and his ex-wife Ms Hart is also relevant to the second fire, as is the material relating to the Commonwealth Bank foreclosing. The bank had in fact foreclosed by the time of the second fire, and accordingly, is nominated as the owner of the property in the averment in sequence 4 of the Court Attendance Notice. 

65The accused in the course of the record of interview (exhibit 41) maintained that he was making regular payments in respect of the mortgage on the property - see answers to questions 219-226. It is clear from the considerable volume of bank records in exhibit 37 that the accused was making no such payments. 

66Further on this aspect the accused told Mr Brockwell, the Insurance Investigator (answers to questions 240 and continuing of exhibit 6) that he paid in $20,000. Again, the bank records indicate that this is simply not so. 

67I return now to the evidence of Mr Murray Scholz. He was the immediate neighbour of the accused, and now in fact owns the land after an auction in February 2011. Mr Scholz could see the house at 'Carinya' from his own house, although as is obvious from the photograph exhibit 44 tendered by the accused, there are trees at least partially obscuring direct vision. Mr Scholz gave evidence to the effect that he owns 4,100 acres either side of Mitchell's Road, Culcairn. He was aware of the accused living at 'Carinya' by himself for about 4 years. 

68Specifically relating to the fire on 14 June 2010 Mr Scholz recalls receiving a telephone call, going to his window and seeing the house alight, with the roof flat on the ground. He rang 000 and then contacted his employee Mr Hasler in order to arrange the attendance of the local Rural Fire Service equipment. He also attended the fire and observed the roof to be flat on the ground and the whole area around the blaze to be ""very hot"". 

69Mr Scholz also gave evidence that on the night of the first fire there was a lot of activity at the property of the accused, such activity including the driving away of the gold coloured Ford sedan in which exhibit 42 was found several weeks later. That vehicle had apparently been under a carport at the accused's premises. Further between the two fires the accused, or at least someone with the same physical appearance, walk and hair came to the premises 5 or 6 times. There was no real challenge in cross-examination to Mr Scholz nominating the accused as the person who attended the premises. I note in any event that Mr Scholz had numerous opportunities to observe the accused over the years they had been neighbours. Mr Scholz also saw the Sheriff's officers attend at their second visit to the property. 

70Mr Scholz I found to be a very credible and impressive witness. He was quite impassive in the witness box and indicated when he was not sure of details. He answered honestly about when asked if it was the accused who attended the premises. He said it was someone who looked like the accused, was the same size, had the same walk and hair. He was not shaken in cross-examination. I accept his evidence that the accused attended the property on about 5 or 6 occasions between 12 May 2010 and 14 June 2010. 

71On this issue the answers to questions 500 and continuing of the record of interview are very relevant, and in my opinion very significant. The accused told police that he had been there except to pick up his dogs. At question 503 he was asked, ""So you haven't been back since the roof's been?"" to which he replied, ""Nuh. I haven't been back on the place because it's too heartbreaking"". At question 561 he maintained he went out to collect his mail ""a couple of weeks back"". The interview was conducted on 14 June 2010. See also answers to questions 247 - 249. 

72It was argued on behalf of the accused that Mr Scholz could not give a great deal of detail about any of the occasions. That is indeed the case. He was hazy about the specifics. Mr Scholz's acknowledgement of such merely adds to his credibility in my opinion. 

73The accused has for some time had a relationship with Ms Irene Ragitsch. He stayed at her premises the night and early morning of 13 and 14 June 2010. Ms Ragitsch was obviously a reluctant witness, who in fact was brought to court by virtue of a warrant when she failed to answer a subpoena. She was declared to be an unfavourable witness without objection. 

74Part of her evidence related to the accused being aware of the Notice to Vacate posted at the property by the Sheriff's officers. On an occasion between the fires she was at the property of the accused with the accused and her daughter. The accused saw the Notice that had been posted by the Sheriff's officers, said words to the effect of, ""what's this"" and tore down the notice. This is in clear conflict with what he told Mr Brockwell, the Insurance Investigator, and indeed what he told investigating police in the record of interview. 

75On this issue at answers to questions 172 and continuing in the interview with Mr Blockwell (exhibit 6) he maintains he was not aware of the foreclosure action by the Commonwealth Bank. Likewise he maintained to police (see for e.g. answers to questions 239 at p 21 and 303 at p 26) that he did not know of the foreclosure action by the Commonwealth Bank. 

76In any event, it seems uncontroversial that the accused was with Ms Ragitsch until about 5 am on 14 June 2010. On 13 June 2010 at about 8pm Mr Wayne Godde contacted the accused to offer him work on 14 June 2010. Mr Godde requested that the accused be at a property at Walbundrie by 6am. The accused indicated that he would meet Mr Godde at Walbundrie at 7am. 

77At about 5.50 am on 14 June 2010 Mr Desmond Godde heard a car coming up Mitchell's Road, but cannot be any more specific about the vehicle. The noise was from the vicinity of Murray Scholz's property. Mr Desmond Godde readied himself for work and left about 6.30am and went to the property of his brother Wayne Godde. The accused was at the property at the time that Mr Desmond Godde arrived. 

78There is evidence in the statements of Detective Simmons about the travelling times - see paragraph 19 and continuing of exhibit 10. The net effect of the evidence of Desmond and Wayne Godde, taken with that of Det. Simmons on the issue of travelling times is that the accused would certainly have had the opportunity to travel from Albury to 'Carinya', set the fire and then travel to the Godde's property. 

79I observe that the statements of Desmond and Wayne Godde were tendered without opposition and without those two persons being cross-examined. At paragraph 12 of Wayne Godde's statement the following appears: 

""We were working there till about 2.00pm when I got a call on my mobile phone. It was Kevin's girlfriend and she asked to speak to him. After he got off the phone he told me that his house had burnt down. I didn't notice any difference in K evin, he was just carrying like he normally does"". 

80Using common sense and experience of human affairs, as the tribunal of fact it beggars belief that anyone who had just been informed that their house had burnt down would not react at all and simply continue working. There was apparently no request to his employer that he leave early. The lack of reaction is consistent with the fact that the house had burnt down not being news to the accused. 

81Detective Simmons was cross-examined on crime statistics for arson type matters in the Culcairn area. As I understand the evidence, the only other house fires reported to the authorities in the Culcairn area were accidental, and there was a grass fire in addition. This is certainly not consistent with there being an arsonist at large randomly targeting dwellings. 

82On 16 June 2010 the accused spoke to Ms Any Weckert of the Commonwealth Bank relating to him lodging a claim on the insurance for the house. Ms Weckert's statement is exhibit 29. After some discussion, Ms Weckert contacted someone at Comminsure and commenced to give details. The accused reacted by sighing when told that the insurance company would rebuild the house and replace the contents. Despite the urgings of the prosecution, I am not prepared to put much weight on this. The reaction is equally consistent with someone who is frustrated with dealing with insurance companies and bank officials. 

83The prosecution argued strongly that the accused told a number of lies. The prosecution went further and submitted that the lies should be dealt with as going to consciousness of guilt. That is an issue that should have been resolved before the addresses, and in that regard I am as much at fault as either of the advocates. Specifically the lies relate to the issues of the accused being aware of the foreclosure action by the bank, the number of occasions he had been to the premises, his attendance at Brocklesby, and his financial contributions to the property. 

84In answer to questions 259 and continuing of the record of interview the accused maintains that he went to Brocklesby, realised he had to be at Walbundrie and went to sleep there and Trevor woke him up. 

85The version of the accused so far as his contributions to the property, his knowledge of the foreclosure action by the bank and the number of occasions on which he had been to the premises are lies. As much was virtually conceded by the accused's counsel. I was urged, however, by counsel for the accused that these matters are collateral and I should ""be very careful about placing too much weight on the lies"". The answer to most of the issues about which the accused told lies was ""so what!"" as it really does not take the matter too far. 

86A Mr Matthew Lawry came to the attention of police in the course of the investigation. He gave evidence on 10 May 2011, but was not cross-examined. He was at Corowa on the night of 13 June and the early hours of the morning of 14 June 2010. It seems he discovered the fire. He went to the premises, checked for signs of life and left and went to play golf. In the circumstances, there could be no reasonable suggestion that Mr Lawry was responsible for the fire on 14 June 2010. 

87Given the decision in Edwards v The Queen I am not prepared to admit the evidence of the lies, or use the evidence of lies going to the consciousness of the guilt of the accused. However, there are a number of lies going to what in my opinion are relatively important matters. This is particularly so relating to the number of visits and his knowledge of the foreclosure action. Clearly, the accused told lies about those matters. 

88I direct myself that I must not follow or engage in a process of reasoning to the effect that just because a person is demonstrated to have told a lie about something that is evidence of guilt. Clearly in this case, given what I have said immediately above, those lies do not go to consciousness of guilt. However, I am firmly of the opinion they reflect adversely on the credit of the accused to the extent that I am of the opinion I am entitled to reject his version of events as set out in the record of interview, exhibit 41. At the risk of repetition I remind myself that I do not have to accept the version of the accused to entertain a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. 

89As will be obvious I have prepared these reasons overnight after hearing the final addresses of counsel. I do not have a transcript of the evidence, although it needs to be observed a great deal of the evidence is in written statement form, and was not subject to cross-examination. I have summarised the circumstances upon which it seems to me the prosecution rely. 

90I return to the issue of the co incidence evidence. Mr Quilter argues that as there are only two events the significance of the co incidence evidence is not as great as it would be if there were more events. That submission has some appeal. However, the circumstances are that it was the same premises, the accused had motive, and opportunity, and there was the conflict with Ms Hart (the accused's ex-wife) and the bank taking foreclosure action. I am of the opinion that I should use the evidence of the deliberate lighting of the fire on 12 May 2010 as co incidence evidence, taking into account the various warnings and directions I have given myself in this regard. In particular, that it is merely another piece of circumstantial evidence, noting the directions and warnings on circumstantial evidence. I indicate, however, that my decision would have been no different had I come to the opposite conclusion on this issue. 

91The prosecutions submissions were very helpfully reduced to a ""dot point"" summary of the evidence, supplemented by oral submissions. In particular I raised with the prosecution the elements of sequences 1 and 3 relating to the accused having a view to making a gain for himself. The prosecution strongly argued that what was important was what was in the mind of the accused as demonstrated by the objective evidence. In particular in this regard the prosecution relied upon the accused's inquiries about insurance before the fire, and his attendance on Ms Weckert on 16 June 2010, i.e. only two days after the second fire. The prosecution argued further that the accused had an insurable interest with the contents. 

92The prosecution emphasised the lies. I mean no disrespect to the prosecutor in dealing with this submission so briefly. I have already dealt with the issues relating to lies in some detail above. There is no point in repeating those findings and decisions in dealing with the submissions. 

93Further, the prosecution submitted in respect of the first fire, I would find the evidence of Ms Michelle King very important, and moreover very telling. I have dealt with this issue when dealing with Ms King's evidence. It is obvious that that part of the evidence is relatively important. 

94It was emphasised by the prosecutor that the prosecution have eliminated accident as a cause of both fires. Certainly, electrical fault can be eliminated from both fires. Likewise, lightning strike can also be excluded. However, just because accident has been eliminated does not by that fact implicate the accused. The directions relating to circumstantial evidence need to be very clearly borne in mind. 

95The prosecution then went through and highlighted the issues and detailed the circumstantial evidence upon which the prosecution relied. I have dealt with those issues when summarising the evidence. Not surprisingly, the prosecution also submitted that I would use the first fire as co incidence evidence. I have dealt at length with that issue. 

96Mr Quilter must be congratulated on the structure and clarity of his address. He submitted that the strands in the cable were motive, opportunity, the attendance of the accused on the property between the fires, the threats, lies, and the unusual behaviour. 

97Different people, so it was submitted, will react differently to various situations. For example, it was submitted that the fact that the house was to be repossessed might account for the accused's reaction when told of the house burning down. Further, it was submitted that not much could be read into the threats. I have dealt with that issue when summarising that part of the evidence. However, the point was well made that neither Mr nor Ms Hart saw fit to go to the police at or near the time that the accused is said to have made the threats. 

98It was put that the evidence of Toni Hasler was ""not a useful strand"" as she was only giving approximate times. There were submissions on the issue of the container. Again, I have dealt with these issues when summarising that part of the evidence. The point is well made that Ms Hasler was giving approximate times. The significance of the evidence is however, obvious. The accused clearly had the opportunity to set that first fire. 

99So far as the various observations of Mr Scholz is concerned, it was submitted that he was obviously busy attending to his farm, and the various tasks in hand. He was ""oblivious"" to persons coming and going. Again, I have dealt with those issues in summarising his evidence. 

100In respect of motive, it was submitted that it would be a natural reaction of property owner whose property burnt down to lodge an insurance claim. This situation in the matters presently under consideration is a little different as there must be doubt as to whether the accused had an insurable interest save and except for the contents. 

101According to submissions by counsel for the accused it is highly significant that Mr Scholz did not make any mention of the accused driving or having access to a maroon Mitsubishi vehicle, as this was apparently the only vehicle to which the accused had access. I do not agree. Mostly, Mr Scholz was silent on the type of vehicle. In any event, the fact that there was no evidence of the presence of such a vehicle does not assist in arriving at a decision. 

102Mr Quilter then went to address the various versions given by the accused. I have said earlier in these reasons, there is room for confusion in the evidence of Michelle King. So far as the accused not being in a hurry to get to the premises, it was put that he would be of little use. It beggars belief, quite frankly, that any home owner who was informed of his house being on fire would not want to get to the scene as quickly as possible. So far as the phone call with Mr Godde, the accused was not sure as to whether or not it was a joke. 

103So far as the morning of 14 June 2010 was concerned, the submission was put that it is equally consistent with the accused going to the wrong place in error and he was embarrassed. The point that it is difficult for the prosecution to prove a negative, however, has some appeal. 

104It was put on behalf of the accused that the lies are consistent with the accused being in a state of panic. I reject that submission. The lies were numerous and made in respect of relatively important aspects. I note that the interview with Mr Blockwell was several months after the fire. The accused was cautioned by police. 

105I have essentially dealt with the submissions relating to the co incidence evidence in dealing with that. Mr Quilter urged that there must be a striking similarity. That in my opinion, does not accord with the present state of the law on that subject. 

106Although there is no onus on the accused, other hypothesis were ventilated on behalf of the accused. There appears to have been a problem with the sliding door to the premises. It was argued that the premises are relatively isolated, and any number of people could have had access to the property. Further, in this regard it was argued that the property was essentially abandoned after 12 May 2010 and vandals may well have been responsible. However, the evidence from Det. Simmons in my opinion negates the possibility of an arsonist being at work. 

107However, despite those submissions, and taking into account all of the warnings set out earlier in these reasons, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused deliberately lit the fires on 12 May 2010 and 14 June 2010. The only matter now remaining the additional elements in sequences 1 and 3, i.e. relating to the dishonest conduct of the accused and him acting with a view to make a gain for himself. 

108While I am strongly suspicious of the motives of the accused, noting in particular his inquires about the insurance only a few weeks before the first fire, there are other inferences equally available. In particular, these other inferences include revenge, noting in particular the threats I have found were made by the accused to his ex wife. 

109For these reasons I entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused in respect of fourth element of sequences 1 and 3. However, for these reasons I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused deliberately lit both fires, and accordingly, I find sequences 2 and 4 proved. 

110I will now hear counsel as to what course they wish me take in relation to sentence.

2709771,R v Hawi & ors (No 3) [2011] NSWSC 1649,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: The accused, David Padovan, is due to stand trial with a number of other men for offences that are alleged to have arisen from two incidents which occurred at the Qantas Domestic Terminal at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport on Sunday 22 March 2009. The various accused are charged with offences of murder, riot and affray. Mr Padovan is charged with affray in respect of the first incident and riot, alternatively affray, in respect of the second incident. It has been estimated by counsel for the Crown and most of the accuseds' counsel that the trial will take some 6 months. 

2By notice of motion filed on 31 March 2011, Mr Padovan sought a trial separate from eight named co-accused. The name of a ninth co-accused was inadvertently omitted. A number of co-accused have since entered pleas of guilty. Mr Padovan now seeks a trial separate from that of the remaining six co-accused. Central to the application is the fact that Mr Padovan was a member of the Hells Angels motorcycle club whereas the co-accused were all members, or associates (hereafter simply ""members"") of the Comanchero motorcycle club. 

3The motion was returnable before me on 8 April 2011. The hearing was deferred, ultimately until 9 May 2011, in order to permit the resolution of other issues which may have possibly had a bearing upon the application. Mr Padovan relies upon an affidavit of his solicitor, Mr Philip Stewart, of 31 March 2011. Written submissions were provided by the Crown Prosecutor and Mr Conwell, counsel for Mr Padovan. Those submissions were supplemented with oral submissions on Monday of this week. 

Prosecution case 

4Briefly, it is the prosecution case that there was animosity between the Hells Angels and Comanchero motorcycle clubs. This is relevant to explaining events which occurred at the airport on 22 March 2009 when there was confrontation between members of the rival clubs in two incidents which occurred a short time apart. 

5Five Comanchero members, including the National President, were on a flight from Melbourne. By chance, so too was the President of the Hells Angels. When they became aware of this fact, contact was made by telephone with members of their respective clubs in Sydney in order for them to attend the airport. It is the prosecution case that those on the flight, and those who were summoned to the airport, contemplated (at least) the possibility of violence. 

6The first incident involved a fight at Gate 5 following the disembarkation of passengers from the flight from Melbourne. Five of the seven accused, including Mr Padovan, are charged with affray in respect of this event. It was relatively short-lived and it seems to be the case that the Comancheros outnumbered the Hells Angels. 

7The second incident involved a considerably more violent fight involving a greater number of members of the rival groups in the main departure hall of the terminal. It culminated in the death of one of the Hells Angels, Mr Anthony Zervas. The six Comanchero accused are charged with murder, alternatively, riot. Mr Padovan is charged only with riot and, in the alternative, affray. 

8Mr Zervas died as a result of wounds inflicted with a knife and a pair of scissors and blunt force injuries likely caused by having been struck with bollards. The latter were items used for queue control at the check-in counters that were taken up by some of those involved in the fighting in order to be used as weapons. Investigators recovered knuckle dusters and a knife from the crime scene. A broken pair of scissors was found embedded in the deceased's clothing. Another knife was recovered by police some months later in a drain outside the terminal as a result of information they received that one of the accused had disposed of it there upon fleeing the scene. The Crown alleges that it was this knife that was used in the attack upon the deceased. 

9As to the initial affray, it is alleged that Mr Padovan was directly involved in the altercation, although it is accepted by the Crown that he was outnumbered by members of the Comanchero. The Crown relies upon evidence which establishes the following: 


Mr Padovan was a member of the Hells Angels. 
He (and other Hells Angels members) came to the airport as a result of calls made by their president who was on the flight from Melbourne. 
Upon arrival at the airport he proceeded through security screening and went to Gate 5 where the Melbourne flight was due. 
With another Hells Angels member, he met up with their president when he, the president, disembarked from the flight. 
The affray started with a larger number of Comancheros and a smaller number of Hells Angels. There was a short verbal altercation before fighting commenced. Mr Padovan was the only Hells Angel involved in the fighting and he was outnumbered by the Comancheros. He lost his shirt during the course of it. 
At one point, Mr Padovan ran towards one of the Comanchero members with his arms swinging, yelling out, ""come on"" . He repeated these actions a number of times. 

10As to the subsequent riot, the Crown relies upon evidence that establishes the following: 


After the affray had concluded, Mr Padovan walked with two other Hells Angels members through the security doors towards the departure hall area. 
The brawl in the departure hall commenced and Mr Padovan ran towards it. 
He was present in the area where the brawl took place. 
He was present in the area at the end of the brawl. 

11The foregoing has been derived from the summary of the evidence in the Crown Case Statement (as amended 6 May 2011). 

12The case for Mr Padovan has been the subject of pre-trial disclosure pursuant to the case management provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. I will say more about it shortly. 

Submissions for Mr Padovan 

13Mr Conwell perceives that the prosecution case is that Mr Padovan and other Hells Angels members attended the airport with an awareness of the potential for violence and that some of them participated in the violence that in fact occurred. It is put that the prosecution case is that some Comanchero members were armed but that none of the Hells Angels were armed. I have previously noted the evidence that Mr Zervas was attacked with weapons including a pair of scissors and a knife (later found within his clothing and in a drain respectively), and that another knife and some knuckle dusters were found at the crime scene. 

14Mr Conwell perceives that it is the case for the Comancheros that the Hells Angels were armed with at least one knife, at least one set of knuckle dusters and a pair of scissors and that they used these weapons to confront the Comancheros. This perception is derived from questions asked of a witness at the committal hearing by counsel for the Comanchero, with answers given that tended to support the proposition. 

15The witness I have just referred to is a Comanchero member who has pleaded guilty and been sentenced and has given an undertaking to give evidence for the prosecution. Up until now he has been referred to by the initials ""SP"". He agreed in cross-examination at the committal that the deceased attacked one of the Comanchero members with a pair of scissors and also that it was possible that the deceased was armed with a knife as well. He agreed that he ""believed"" that the deceased's brother, Mr Peter Zervas, was armed with knuckle dusters. 

16From the pre-trial disclosure response, and Mr Conwell's written submissions, it emerges that Mr Padovan's case is that he was not at the airport for the purpose of engaging in unlawful violence; no weapons were taken to the airport by any of the Hells Angels; and that no scissors, knives or knuckle dusters were used by any of the Hells Angels. (How Mr Padovan would know that none of his fellow Hells Angels were armed, and how he would know that, in the course of what seems to have been a wild melee, none of them used any weapons, is not apparent). Mr Padovan intends to put in issue self defence in relation to any involvement by him in the two incidents. 

17As a result of the prosecution case being that the Hells Angels were not armed, and the Comancheros' case being that they were armed, it was submitted that Mr Padovan will be required to not only defend himself against the Crown case but also against the Comancheros' case. It was submitted that this did not amount to a ""typical cut throat defence"". Accordingly, it was submitted that Mr Padovan would be the subject of ""positive injustice ... that would be impossible to overcome"". 

18Mr Conwell acknowledged that if there was a ""cut throat defence"", there would be a desirability of avoiding inconsistent verdicts and this would militate against ordering separate trials: R v Beavan (1952) 69 WN (NSW) 140; Annakin v The Queen (1988) 17 NSWLR 202; Webb and Hay v The Queen [1994] HCA 30; (1994) 181 CLR 41. However, he submitted that this was not a consideration as the defence was not of such a nature. 

19Mr Conwell accepted that separate trials would result in a number of witnesses being required to give their evidence twice. However, a mollifying consideration, so it was submitted, was that ""given the nature of the two different prosecutions, the witnesses required will be significantly streamlined"". Certain categories of witness evidence were suggested and, it would seem that if the Crown were in agreement, there is a potential for quite a significant reduction. 

20It was also submitted that there was the possibility that a separate trial of Mr Padovan could take place in the District Court or, ""with charge negotiation"" in the Local Court. The latter seems rather unlikely and I do not see the former as having much, if any, significance. A defended hearing of the matter would likely consume a similar degree of resources no matter what the jurisdiction. 

21There is an implicit acknowledgement at page 3 of Mr Conwell's written submissions that the assertion made on page 1 that the prosecution case was that ""the Hells Angels were unarmed when they arrived at the Qantas Domestic Terminal"" was not quite accurate. On page 3 it is said that the prosecution submissions at the committal hearing "" did not suggest that any Hells Angels came to the airport armed"" (emphasis added). It is said, similarly, that the Crown Case Statement "" does not suggest that any Hells Angels were armed prior to attending the airport other than the deceased possibly being armed with a pair of scissors"" (emphasis added). Even if the deceased was so armed, I note the assertion on page 1 of the written submissions that such scissors came from a check-in counter and were not brought to the airport. 

22Mr Conwell also referred (at page 4 of his written submissions) to the statement of facts that was tendered by the prosecution in the proceedings on sentence concerning the deceased's brother in the Local Court for his involvement in the incident. Again, it is said, ""there is no suggestion that any Hells Angels came to the airport armed"" (emphasis added). Similarly, reference is made to the statement of agreed facts in the sentence proceedings of Pomare Pirini whom I sentenced on 18 March 2011. Again, there was no "" suggestion by the Crown that any Hells Angels members went to the airport armed. The Crown case is that the Comancheros brought weapons to the Qantas Domestic Terminal"" (emphasis added). 

23The positive injustice that it is submitted that Mr Padovan will suffer if he is to stand trial along with the Comanchero accused is that if the jury were to accept the Comanchero assertion, which is not the prosecution's assertion, that the Hells Angels were armed when they attended the airport, it will more readily accept that the purpose of their attendance at the airport was to engage in violence which, Mr Padovan, as a Hells Angels member, denies. Accordingly, ""the weaker [and different] joint criminal enterprise Crown case is strengthened"": see the first and third of the three matters listed by Hunt J (as he then was) in R v Middis , New South Wales Supreme Court, 27 March 1991, unreported, which were approved in R v Baartman , New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 6 October 1994, unreported, as matters relevant to a consideration of a separate trial application. On the second of those three matters it was submitted that although the evidence which it is anticipated will be led in the defence of the Comancheros will be admissible against Mr Padovan, it will be ""highly prejudicial"" to him for the same reasons. 

24It was submitted that there would be difficulties in summing up both the prosecution case and the case for the Comanchero accused in a manner that would avoid ""a positive injustice"" to Mr Padovan and that the jury may convict Mr Padovan because of assertions that do not form any part of the prosecution case. 

25Mr Conwell sought to characterise the defence as not being in the nature of a ""cut throat"" defence in this way. It was submitted that the prosecution case is that some of the Comancheros are guilty of murder; that the Comancheros started ""the disturbance""; that some of the Comancheros brought weapons to the airport; and that some of the Comancheros used such weapons. On the other hand, the prosecution does not allege that Mr Padovan is guilty of murder; that he started ""the disturbance""; that he or any other Hells Angel brought weapons to the airport; or that he or any other Hells Angel used scissors, knives or knuckle dusters. The differences in the two cases mean that a concern about inconsistent verdicts does not arise. 

26A ""cut throat"" defence was characterised as one in which the prosecution alleged that ""both A and B are guilty of the crime charged"" and that the defence cases are that the crime was committed but that A blames B whilst B blames A. Mr Conwell submitted that this is not the situation in this case. 

27In oral submissions Mr Conwell put that even if the Crown case allowed for the possibility that Hells Angels members were armed, that is quite a different proposition to Mr Padovan having to face the Comancheros' case that will positively assert that they were. As an example of this being asserted against the Hells Angels by the Comancheros, Mr Conwell referred to the possibility that tendency evidence concerning the deceased may be led on behalf of the accused Hawi. Mr Dunn, senior counsel for Mr Hawi, confirmed that he was contemplating leading evidence that about a week before the airport incident, the deceased had stabbed a police officer. I take it that this will be said to give weight to a claim that at an early stage of the incident in the departure hall, the deceased sought to stab Mr Hawi with a pair of scissors. 

Crown submissions 

28The Crown Prosecutor sought to make clear what the Crown case was in respect of weapons as this aspect appears to be at the core of the application. The weapons known to be present, and which must have been brought to the airport, comprised two knives and a set of knuckle dusters. There is also evidence of the involvement of a pair of scissors but it is unclear whether they were brought to the airport or were picked up from one of the check-in counters. 

29It is not part of the Crown case that any particular participant brought weapons to the airport with the possible exception of Mr Abounader. The Crown allows for the possibility that one or more Hells Angels may have brought weapons. There is also the possibility that one or more Comancheros brought them. A third possibility is that a member, or members, of both groups brought weapons. It is not possible to prove any of these three scenarios beyond reasonable doubt, nor is it necessary for the Crown to do so. The only thing that can be said with any certainty is that there is evidence from which the jury could conclude that the deceased was armed with a pair of scissors and possibly knuckle dusters and that Mr Abounader was armed with a knife. However, whether they were so armed when they attended the airport, as opposed to them acquiring them at the airport, cannot be established with certainty. 

30As to the contention that the deceased was armed with scissors, the Crown Prosecutor submitted that the evidence would be that Mr Padovan arrived at the airport and proceeded through security screening to Gate 5, whereas the deceased arrived separately and remained in the unsecure part of the terminal. Thus, the deceased and Mr Padovan did not come together at all before the riot started and so it was highly unlikely that Mr Padovan would have been aware that Mr Zervas was armed. 

31The Crown claims to have a viable case that the Hells Angels members came to the airport with a realisation that there might be a violent confrontation, regardless of whether they were armed. This is so, whether their intention was to defend themselves and fellow Hells Angels if necessary, or it was to assault the Comancheros. 

32The Crown Prosecutor acknowledged that a question of joint or separate trials is discretionary and involves a consideration of both the interests of justice and the interests of the accused: R v Merritt and Roso (1985) 19 A Crim R 360 at 364. 

33Generally speaking, however, where multiple accused are jointly charged with committing the same crime they should be tried together: Symss v The Queen [2003] NSWCCA 77 at [66] - [77], particularly: 

[76] For present purposes I regard it as sufficient to emphasise the factors identified by King CJ in Collie and Webb and Hay and adopted by Toohey J in Webb and Hay in the High Court. There are important reasons of principle and policy why persons charged with committing an offence jointly ought to be tried together, particularly where each seeks to cast the blame on the other. The dangers from the admission of evidence which would not have been admitted if the appellant had stood trial alone can be obviated by express and careful directions as were given in this trial. 

34In this case, the Comancheros contend that the Hells Angels were the aggressors, particularly in relation to the second incident. The Hells Angels, on the other hand, contend that the Comancheros were the aggressors. Each group will contend that it was members of the other group who were armed. In the light of this, the Crown contends that there is a ""cut throat"" defence. 

35The Crown accepts that the Comancheros were the aggressors. However, it also contends that the Hells Angels were willing to fight and chose to remain and do so. Specifically in relation to Mr Padovan, the Crown proposes to negate his claim of self defence by pointing to evidence that he chose to engage in fighting at Gate 5 in contrast to his fellow Hells Angels members who did not. In relation to the riot, the fighting had already commenced and Mr Padovan ran towards it. Accordingly, the Crown contends that Mr Padovan cannot have had a belief that it was necessary to do what he did in defence of either himself or anyone else. Even if there is a reasonable possibility that he did, his response was not reasonable in the circumstances as he perceived them. 

36As to the assertion that Mr Padovan will be required to defend himself against the Crown case as well as the case for the Comanchero accused, the Crown submits that this moves from the inaccurate premise that the Crown case is that none of the Hells Angels were armed. From what has been said earlier, it is clearly not the case that the Crown accepts that the Hells Angels were unarmed. It acknowledges that they may have been but cannot prove that they were. 

37The Crown also contends that the case against Mr Padovan is not weaker than the case against the Comanchero accused and it is not one that will be unfairly strengthened by Mr Padovan being tried jointly with them. It was submitted that the evidence concerning the affray at Gate 5 and the riot within the terminal is virtually the same for all of the accused. The Crown alleges that the Comancheros were the aggressors and so, it is submitted, that might result in a finding that their criminality was greater. However, that fact does not mean that the case against the Hells Angels is ""weaker"". 

38Another aspect relevant to the interests of justice is the fact that the Crown presently proposes to call some 140 eyewitnesses in respect of the two incidents. That body of witness evidence is said to be relevant to all of the accused who are charged in respect of the two incidents, whether they be Comancheros or Hells Angels. Some witnesses will have to travel from overseas. It may well be possible to reduce the witness list by eliminating those whose evidence specifically concerns only the actions of participants outside the presence of Mr Padovan, but the reduction would not be substantial. It will still be necessary to call a large number of witnesses, some having to travel considerable distance, twice if Mr Padovan is to be tried separately. This is a factor militating against separate trials. 

39So, in summary, the Crown submits that the evidence against Mr Padovan is not significantly weaker and different to the evidence against the Comanchero accused. The eyewitness and crime scene evidence is the same. It is submitted that the evidence against the Comanchero accused is not prejudicial to the Hells Angels accused. The contention that there will be unfairness in that the Comanchero will allege that the Hells Angels were the aggressors is balanced by the fact that the Hells Angels will allege the contrary. The contention that the Comanchero will allege that the Hells Angels were armed will be similarly balanced. Finally, the Crown submits that this is not a case in which a weaker case will be made immeasurably stronger by the jury hearing evidence admissible only against the Comanchero accused that is prejudicial to Mr Padovan. 

Consideration 

40There are many authorities dealing with the issue presently under consideration. I have found the review by Sheller JA in Symss v The Queen , above, at [68] to [76] particularly helpful. 

41The application for a separate trial is put on a very discrete basis. It is not suggested that there is evidence in the Crown case that will be admitted against other accused but not Mr Padovan that will be prejudicial to him. The application is confined to the manner in which the case for the co-accused is expected to be conducted. 

42As I currently perceive it, there will be no issue that Mr Padovan and most, if not all, of the Comanchero accused were involved in some fashion in the fighting that occurred. Who were the aggressors and the extent, if any, to which anybody acted in defence of themselves or of others will be significant issues. 

43I do not accept that the case against Mr Padovan is necessarily weaker than the case against the Comanchero accused in respect of the offences with which Mr Padovan has been charged. There is an added dimension to the case against the Comanchero accused in that they are also charged with murder but that is of little present significance. 

44Mr Conwell's perception that the Crown case is that the Hells Angels were unarmed is incorrect. The Crown is neutral on the subject aside from it accepting that it is a reasonable possibility that the deceased had a pair of scissors. However, the Crown does not allege that Mr Padovan himself was armed, or that he was aware that any other Hells Angels were armed. In addition, there is no suggestion, at least at this stage, that there will be any such allegation made on behalf of the Comanchero accused concerning Mr Padovan. 

45It is a necessary component of a joint trial that the jury be directed that separate consideration must be given to the case against each individual accused. That will be particularly important in this case because the accused will not only be identified as individuals but also as members of one or the other motorcycle club. It will, of course, be essential that the jury consider the case of an individual accused upon the basis of his own thoughts and actions, albeit within an appropriate context. 

46The concern about prejudice and positive injustice was expressed in terms of the jury accepting that "" the Hells Angels were armed prior to attending the airport"" and reasoning from this that it would be more readily concluded that ""the purpose of the Hells Angels attendance at the airport was to engage in violence"" (emphasis added). The jury will be directed that they must not adopt such global reasoning. 

47Accordingly, I do not see any real basis for the asserted concern that the prosecution case against Mr Padovan will be strengthened by the manner in which the Comanchero case is conducted. Even if that was to be so, I do not see any real basis for concluding that this would be unfairly prejudicial to Mr Padovan and result in a positive injustice. 

48Where accused persons are charged with committing a crime jointly, the prima facie position is that they should be tried together: Webb and Hay v The Queen , above, at 88-89 per Toohey J, Mason CJ and McHugh J agreeing. This is said to be ""particularly so where each seeks to cast the blame on the other"". The present is not a typical ""cut throat defence"" case. That is usually where two (or more) persons are charged with committing a crime against someone else and each accused seeks exculpation by blaming the other accused. Here, the prosecution alleges that the accused were involved in attacks by one group against the other. The fact remains, however, that Mr Padovan will be blaming the Comanchero accused and they, or at least some of them, will be blaming Mr Padovan and his fellow Hells Angels. 

49A joint trial is not justified in all cases where one accused blames a co-accused, or multiple accused all blame each other. The principles discussed by Sheller JA remain to be considered whatever the nature of the defence. In this case, however, I am satisfied that it would not be unjust for Mr Padovan to be tried with the other accused. The interests of justice in having the one jury decide the case concerning each and every accused in the one trial is a powerful consideration. Less persuasive, but not insignificant, are the considerations of cost and convenience. 

Conclusion 

50The application by Mr David Padovan for a trial separate is refused.

2709776,Osborne v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 112,"Judgment 

1JOHNSON J: I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by Price J. 

2HALL J: I agree with Price J 

3PRICE J: Beau Allan Osborne, the applicant, seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed upon him in the District Court at Newcastle on 19 May 2009 by Coolahan DCJ (the judge). He had been arraigned upon an indictment containing six counts of robbery contrary to s 94 Crimes Act 1900 and had pleaded not guilty to each count. Following a trial before a jury, the applicant was found guilty of each of the offences. 

4The judge imposed a total effective sentence of 6 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years. The earliest date the applicant is eligible for release to parole is 21 April 2012. The individual sentences were as follows: 

Counts 1 and 2: On each count, imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years commencing on 22 April 2008 and expiring on 21 April 2010; 

Counts 3 and 4: On each count, imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years 2 months commencing on 22 October 2008 and expiring on 21 December 2010; 

Count 5: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years 4 months commencing on 22 April 2009 and expiring on 21 August 2011; and 

Count 6: Imprisonment for 5 years commencing on 22 October 2009 and expiring on 21 October 2014 with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months expiring on 21 April 2012. 

5An offence contrary to s 94 Crimes Act is punishable by imprisonment for 14 years. 

6In this appeal the applicant is self-represented. The sole ground of appeal is that the [total] sentence was excessive. 

7Before proceeding further, it is convenient to record the facts of each of the offences as found by the judge (AB 13-14): 

""The charges arise out of robberies which took place on four building societies. The brief facts are that at about 9.20am on 22 July 2006, the offender, who was partly disguised but who had some part of his face visible, entered the premises of the Greater Permanent Building Society at Tanilba Bay. He walked up to Ms Brady who was behind the teller counter and pushed a grey plastic shopping bag through the bars saying, ""This is a robbery, put all your money in the bag."" Ms Brady took money from her drawer and put it into the bag. The offender then took the bag and walked to Ms Hawkins who was in an adjacent teller's booth, saying, ""You too"". Ms Brady described the offender as being as cool as a cucumber. Ms Hawkins, in her evidence, confirmed the evidence of Ms Brady. She described the offender as being very calm. A total of $6,800 approximately, was taken during the course of the robbery [counts 1 and 2]. 

On 8 December 2006 at about 11.30am, the offender entered the Greater Building Society branch at Rutherford and walked up to Ms Rennie who was working at her workstation. She was serving a customer. The offender went to the counter and said, ""This is a robbery. Fill up the bag."" He has pushed a green plastic shopping bag over the counter. Ms Rennie placed money in the bag and the offender then walked to the next teller, Ms Pearce. Ms Rennie described the offender as being very calm. Ms Pearce said that a man appeared in front of her teller box saying, ""This is a robbery, put all the money in the bag, 50s and 20s"". She started to fill the bag up, he said, ""Don't be stupid, give it all to me"". A total of around $3,600 was obtained from these robberies [counts 3 and 4]. 

On 8 June 2007, just before 1pm the offender entered the premises of the Newcastle Permanent Building Society at The Junction and went up to Ms Luton, a member services officer, who was working at her teller box. He pushed a scrunched up plastic shopping bag through the window, saying, ""Put the money in it"". As she was doing this, he said, ""All of it"". He then left. Ms Luton described him as being very assertive in what he was saying. A total of approximately $7,000 was taken [count 5]. 

On 29 June 2007 at about 9.10am, the offender entered the Greater Building Society branch at Toukley and went up to Ms McPherson who was employed there as a senior teller. He said, ""This is a robbery, give me the money"". She described the offender as being matter of fact in what he said. A total of approximately $4,000 was obtained [count 6]."" 

8The judge observed that in none of the robberies were letters or notes of demand produced, no actual threats of violence were made nor were weapons produced. His Honour found that the offences were serious, being committed on building societies and the tellers or customer service officers being put in fear by ""the implicit threat involved in the demands for money"". The victims, his Honour said, were in a vulnerable position and specific reference was made to the victim impact statements made by Ms Rennie and Ms Brady. The judge observed that general deterrence and the protection of the community ""must feature highly in sentencing considerations"" (AB 4). 

9His Honour found the vulnerability of the victims to be an aggravating factor as was the degree of planning involved in the commission of the offences. Another factor of aggravation was that in all but the offences committed at Tanilba Bay (counts 1 and 2), the applicant was on conditional liberty in relation to Local Court matters. At least so far as Ms Rennie and Ms Brady were concerned, the judge considered ""some real degree of harm was occasioned"" but said that he would have thought ""that any victim of a robbery would be likely to suffer similar problems as those two victims"" (AB 19). Whilst the applicant had a gambling problem, the judge said that it would appear that the proceeds of the robberies ""by and large, were spent on household items and living expenses"". His Honour considered that the offences should be assessed ""as being somewhere below the mid point of seriousness"" (AB 20). 

10The applicant did not give evidence during the sentencing proceedings but had given evidence during the trial. A report from Peter Champion, a psychologist was tendered as was a report from Christine Bridekirk, an alcohol and other drugs worker from the Metropolitan Special Programs Centre. 

11At the time of sentence the applicant was 27 years old. He was unemployed and in a de facto relationship to which a child had been born. His lengthy criminal record included convictions for offences involving violence and offences involving dishonesty. The judge found that whilst the applicant had a significant criminal history, it did not contain offences of a similar nature to robbery and could not be regarded as an aggravating factor. 

12In a report dated 16 April 2009, Mr Champion reported that the applicant had a history of mental health issues for which he was currently medicated. He had given a history of a troubled upbringing and a history of poly substance abuse with dependency/addiction. He reported medical problems. 

13The psychologist stated that the applicant ""presents with a history of significant mood/disturbance depression, for which he is currently in receipt of anti depressant medication, as he has been in the past; there being a number of potential causes for this disorder, including his inability to resolve a series of traumatic losses"" (AB 49). 

14In his sentencing remarks, the judge considered in some detail the psychologist's report and accepted what the applicant had told Mr Champion about his continuing pain, his long standing drug problems and his mood disorder. The judge observed that there was ""a history of a motor vehicle accident in 2000 which apparently has left the offender with a serious back disability, for which he is also being medicated and for which, in the past, he has to attend a pain clinic"" (AB 17). His Honour also accepted that the applicant had seen Ms Bridekirk for one on one counselling sessions and that he had actively participated and demonstrated insight and motivation to address his substance abuse and related issues. 

15The judge did not, however, accept that the applicant's history of a dysfunctional upbringing and mental health issues had a bearing on the commission of the offences. His Honour said that he was unable to identify any mitigating factors. Although his Honour could not say that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation, he was prepared to accept that the applicant had some prospects of rehabilitation. 

16Special circumstances were found so as to justify a variation in the statutory ratio referred to in s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, being the applicant's first substantial period in custody and his need for rehabilitation. 

17As I have indicated, the sole ground of appeal is that the sentence is excessive. To establish this ground of appeal, the applicant must demonstrate that the sentence was manifestly excessive in the sense of being unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357. 

18In written submissions, the applicant contends that the six robberies were all done in exactly the same way, not one being worse than the other. He considers that on all counts the sentences should be comparative and did not know why the sentence for count 6 was so excessive. The applicant argues that there were no mitigating or aggravating circumstances within his crimes and complained that leniency had not been shown to him as this was his first charge of robbery. He asks why his sentences were increased two months for every sentence. He asks the Court to consider that the sentences for counts 3 to 6 be made comparative with the sentences for counts 1 and 2. 

19In oral submissions, he argues that there were mitigating circumstances in the commission of the crimes. He referred to no weapon being involved and there being no physical harm to the victims. His principal complaint is that the sentences increased as they were pronounced. 

20There are a number of difficulties with the applicant's submissions. Although the applicant had not committed any robbery offences before he robbed the Greater Permanent Building Society at Tanilba Bay on 22 July 2006 (counts 1 and 2), by the time he came before the judge, he was being sentenced for six robberies. These were individual offences and it is of little consequence that they were committed in the same way. His repeat offending demonstrated a continuing disregard for the law and considerations of retribution, deterrence, both personal and general and protection of society were important considerations in his Honour's sentencing task: Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465; R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566. It is unsurprising that the overall length of the sentence imposed for count 6, being the sixth offence of robbery, was significantly longer than the sentences imposed for counts 1 to 5. 

21I would disagree with the applicant's contention that there were no aggravating factors. The judge correctly identified the factors of aggravation as being the limited degree of planning involved in the commission of the offences, the vulnerability of the victims, the emotional harm occasioned and the commission of offences when the applicant was on conditional liberty. 

22At the time the applicant committed the robbery at Rutherford, he was awaiting a hearing in the Local Court for an offence of low range PCA, which was finalised at Newcastle Local Court on 2 February 2007. When he committed the robberies at The Junction and at Toukley, he was on bail for offences, including goods suspected to have been stolen, driving whilst disqualified, possession of an unregistered firearm and ammunition without a permit. He had been charged for these offences on 11 February 2007 and was sentenced in the Wyong Local Court on 9 July 2007. He had also been charged on 8 April 2007 for driving under the influence, which was ultimately dealt with by the magistrate at the same time as the other offences. I do make it plain to the applicant that the commission of an offence whilst on conditional liberty has long been regarded as a factor of aggravation requiring the passing of a deterrent sentence: see, for example, R v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28 at [40] - [42]. 

23As the judge was sentencing the applicant for six offences, he was obliged to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence as well as questions of totality: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610. His Honour expressly referred to the principle of totality when formulating and structuring the sentences that were imposed. 

24In relation to the first two counts during which an amount of approximately $6,800 was stolen, concurrent fixed terms of 2 years imprisonment were imposed, as they were effectively the same offending but with two victims. The applicant was not on conditional liberty at the time but his unattractive prior criminal record did not warrant leniency. The sentences for counts 3 and 4, which were committed at Rutherford on 8 December 2006 and an amount of around $3,600 was stolen, were for the same reasons made concurrent. As a consequence of the accumulation of these sentences upon the sentences for counts 1 and 2 by six months, the total sentence for the first four charges was a fixed term of 2 years 8 months. The sentence for the robbery at the Junction on 8 June 2007 during which $7,078 was stolen (count 5) was accumulated upon the sentences for counts 3 and 4 by six months. The overall result was a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 years 4 months for counts 1 to 5. In my opinion, these sentences could hardly be described as being excessive. 

25The overall sentence for the robbery at Toukley on 29 June 2007 (count 6), during which $4,046 was stolen, was imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months. As this sentence was fixed to commence on 22 October 2009, the mandatory period of incarceration that is solely referable to this offence is confined to 8 months. The applicant was on bail at the time that counts 5 - 6 were committed. I would reject the contention that the sentence for count 6 is excessive. 

26In a little over 12 months, the applicant robbed four Building Societies. A strong element of personal and general deterrence was called for in the sentences. Furthermore, it was necessary that the sentences reflected the existence of six different victims of the four robberies, as to whom there was direct evidence in the form of victim impact statements from two as to the detrimental effect of the crimes upon them. One of the purposes of sentencing is to recognise the harm done to the victims of crime and the community: s 3A(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . In my opinion, the sentences imposed were well within the legitimate exercise of his Honour's sentencing discretion. I am far from being persuaded that the sentences are manifestly excessive. Accordingly, the orders I propose are: 

(i) Leave to appeal granted 

(ii) Appeal dismissed.

2709836,Shaun Paul Hardcastle v R [2011] NSWCCA 87,"JUDGMENT 

1SIMPSON J: I agree with Grove AJ. 

2DAVIES J : I agree with Grove AJ. 

3GROVE AJ : This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence imposed by Neild A/DCJ in Sydney District Court on 17 June 2010. 

4The applicant had pleaded guilty to two counts of an indictment as follows: 

""1. On or about 19 March 2005 at Jesmond in the State of New South Wales being armed with an offensive weapon, did rob Gang Wang of a sum of money, a quantity of cigarettes, a laptop computer and an OMP3 player. 

2. On or about 8 May 2008 at Merewether in the State of New South Wales, being armed with an offensive weapon, did rob Ian Harris of a sum of money."" 

5His Honour was also asked to take into account two further charges namely: 

""1. Breaking and entering and stealing on 27 April 2008 and 

2. Robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon on 8 May 2008."" 

6On Count 1 the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 12 February 2010 and expiring on 11 February 2012 with a parole period of 1 year 9 months and on Count 2 (taking into account the scheduled further charges) to imprisonment consisting on a non-parole period of 1 year 9 months commencing on 12 May 2011 and expiring on 11 December 2013 with a parole period of 2 years. 

7The total sentence was therefore a term of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. 

8The applicant seeks to reply upon on a single ground of appeal: 

""1. the sentencing judge failed to give proper weight to the applicant's mental condition (including giving too much weight to the issue of general deterrence)."" 

9It was conceded in written submissions and confirmed orally by counsel that ""but for the applicant's mental condition, such total sentence could not be challenged on appeal."" 

10The facts in relation to the indicted counts were put before the Court in an agreed statement which was substantially incorporated in his Honour's remarks on sentence. 

11At about 2.20 am on 19 March 2005 the applicant and a co-offender, each masked in a balaclava, entered a service station in a suburb of Newcastle. The co-offender was armed with a rifle. He remains unidentified. Under menace of the weapon the service station console operator was forced to hand over various items nominated in the indictment. 

12An attempt was made to remove a tape from a security camera. DNA swabs were taken from it by investigators. On 5 January 2009 a match identifying the applicant was made. On 26 February 2009 he was arrested and charged in respect of these facts which became Count 1 on the indictment. 

13At 3.50 pm on 8 May 2008 the applicant, wearing a hooded top and wearing sunglasses, entered Merewether Post Office where two employees were behind a counter serving customers. The applicant was wearing gloves and brandishing a metal pistol. It was accepted that this was probably a replica rather than a genuine firearm. One of the customers was an elderly gentleman whom the applicant grabbed and pushed to the floor. He then pointed the pistol at the employees and demanded the contents of their cash drawers. He received $1,053 and then decamped. The victim nominated in Count 2 was one of the two employees. 

14The applicant was driven from the scene in a vehicle which was occupied by several others. It is not necessary to recount details of the flight from the Merewether area but in due course police investigation led to the arrest and interview of some of the occupants of the car as a result of which the applicant was identified as the offender who had entered the Post Office. He was arrested and charged on 14 October 2008. 

15As I shall describe in greater detail, the applicant sustained a major head injury on 2 June 2008. When invited to participate in interview after each of his arrests (14 October 2008 and 26 February 2009 respectively) he said he had no recollection of the events concerning either offence. 

16The learned sentencing judge said he did not ""know the circumstances in which the offender committed the breaking and entering and stealing offence on 22 (sic 27 th ) April 2008"". The Form I signed by the applicant on 22 March 2010 contained this short description: 

""On Sunday, 27 April 2008 the offender gained entry to Whittaker's Jewellers located at 2/93 Darby Street, Cooks Hill by smashing the glass on the front door. Inside the premises a cement block was used to smash a display case, to gain access to a large amount of jewellery housed therein. The total value of items stolen was $71,688.95. 

During the offence bloodstains were left on the display cases that matched with the DNA of the offender."" 

17The second charge on the schedule related to the robbery at Merewether Post Office nominating the second employee who had been behind the counter as the victim. 

18The mental condition of the applicant, in central focus of the ground of appeal, was evidenced in a report by Professor David Greenberg who examined the applicant (then in custody) on 19 February 2010. Professor Greenberg had reference to reports and other documentation which are recorded in his report of 9 March 2010. His Honour's findings in these regards were as follows: 

""10. On 2 June 2008, the offender was the victim of a vicious assault. He was quite severely injured. He was admitted into the brain injury clinic of John Hunter Hospital at Newcastle. He was found to have suffered: 

(1) bilateral fracture of the skill, 

(2) a right temporal extradural haemorrhage, 

(3) a left temporal lobe extra-axial haematoma, 

(4) a fracture of one of his ribs. 

He underwent emergency surgery. He was in the intensive care ward from 2 June 2008 to 15 June 2008 and the neurological ward from 15 June 2008 to 24 June 2008, and the Rankin Park Inpatient Rehabilitation Centre from 24 June 2008 to 31 July 2008. He has been left with 

(1) a right-sided hemiparesis, 

(2) impaired memory, 

(3) impaired balance, 

(4) slurred speech, 

(5) impaired hearing, and 

(6) depression."" 

19He further found: 

""However, whatever the future holds for him, he will need considerable care and supervision in his day-to-day living, whether provided for by his mother, the Probation and Parole Service, or the brain injury unit of a hospital, or a community mental health team."" 

20It is convenient to note at this point that the ground of appeal does not contend that there were physical consequences of injury which constitute an incapacity which should have led to amelioration of sentence. His Honour was not provided with any information as to why the supervision of the mother was required but the implication would seem to be that any such need was founded in mental deficit. 

21His Honour referred again to the applicant's mental state when determining to alter the statutory apportionment between non-parole period and total term to the advantage of the applicant. 

22In a somewhat formulaic style which could scarcely be perceived to discharge an obligation to convey to the offender in language that he could understand the reasons for the sentences being passed upon him, his Honour made reference to s 21 A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and stated: 

""(32) As to the first offence, the aggravating factors are those letters E, J, L, M, N and O in s 21A(2). 

(33) As to the second offence, the aggravating factors are those lettered B, L, N and O in s 21A(2). 

(34) As to both offences, the mitigating factors are those letters A, I and K in s 21A(3)."" 

(Above paragraphs quoted as transcribed). 

23His Honour continued: 

""(35) One factor not mentioned in s 21A is deterrence. I consider that, although the offender is not an appropriate vehicle for personal deterrence, as he has suffered organic brain damage and has been left with significant disabilities, general deterrence is important. It is something which cannot be ignored or under-valued. People who think of doing what the offender had done - and what he did was relatively easy to do - must be deterred from doing so by sentences imposed upon offenders."" 

24It has long been recognised that mental handicap, short of providing a defence of mental illness, is a basis for reduction of sentence, for example R v Smith (1958) 75 WN (NSW) 198. To be relevant it is not necessary that there be a causal connection between the handicap and the offending ( R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67). Both the indicted and both the scheduled offences occurred before the applicant was injured. 

25However a significant but not exclusive focus of case law has been upon the possible diminution in the weight to be given to general deterrence in sentence assessment where mental handicap is present. His Honour's remarks about general deterrence gave rise to the principal contention of error argued by the applicant. 

26A useful collation of principle and authority has been provided by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194: 

""[ 177] Where an offender is suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems the courts have developed principles to be applied when sentencing: see, eg, R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; R v Tsiarias [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40] - [48]; Lauritsen v R [2000] WASCA 203; (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [43] - [51]; R v Harb [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35] - [45]; R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255; R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33] - [36]; R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102 at [32]; Courtney v R [2007] NSWCCA 195 at [14]-[18]; and R v Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28]. They can be summarised in the following manner: 

Where the state of a person's mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [254]; Miller v R [1999] WASCA 66 at [23]; R v Jiminez [1999] WASCA 7 at [23], [25]; Tsiaras at 400; Lauritsen at [51]; Israil at [23]; R v Pearson [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43]; Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28]. 

It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed: Engert at 71; R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 50 - 51; Israil at [22]; Pearson at [42]; Henry at [28]. 

It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced: Tsiaris at 400; Jiminez at [25 ]; Israil at [26]; Henry at [28]. 

It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence: Courtney at [14]; Tsiaras at 400; Israil at [25]; JW at [192]. 

Conversely, it may be that because of a person's mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence: Israil at [24]; Henry at [28]. Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public: R v Lawrence (2005) NSWCCA 91 per Spigelman CJ at [23] - [24]. 

[178] I should stress that the mental health problems of an offender need not amount to a serious psychiatric illness before they will be relevant to the sentencing process. The circumstances may indicate that when an offender has a mental disorder of modest severity it may nevertheless be appropriate to moderate the need for general or specific deterrence: R v Skura [2004] VSCA 53; R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102; (2007) 16 VR 269 at [5]."" 

27As the above extract from his Honour's remarks on sentence demonstrates, he did not elaborate upon why he considered that the applicant was not an appropriate vehicle for personal deterrence. As the Crown Prosecutor pointed out, the applicant committed further offences, although of considerably less seriousness than those presently under consideration, subsequent to his injury. 

28However his Honour did expressly take into account that, due to disabilities, the applicant was vulnerable to harm and may find prison life therefore more onerous. That finding would seem to operate as some counter weight to the reflection in sentence assessment of the negative expression concerning personal deterrence. 

29His Honour's remarks about general deterrence, whilst, of course, they do not contain any measurement of the weight which he attributed to this factor, suggest that he might have attributed some significance to it, or on the other hand, bearing in mind the contextual statement that the applicant had suffered significant brain damage, he was attributing such weight as would be appropriate to an offender whom he recognised was so affected. 

30The absence of clarity however leads me to conclude that the applicant's ground should be considered to have been made out. Nevertheless the question remains whether this Court should intervene. 

31The applicant was born in 1986. He had a disruptive and unstable childhood. He was introduced to illicit drugs within the familial environment. He is the estranged father of a four year old daughter. 

32By the time he appeared for sentence on these matters the applicant, although young, had accumulated a considerable record of offending commencing with nine appearances in Children's Courts between February 2001 and March 2004 resulting in convictions for some thirty offences of various kinds. Between June 2004 and February 2007 he had eight appearances before Local Courts acquiring convictions for some twenty-five offences. None of these offences, it should be acknowledged, approached the elevated criminality involved in those currently being examined. 

33I have already observed that the applicant continued to offend after the injury sustained in June 2008. 

34Count 1 involved the production of a firearm by the co-offender and the balaclavas worn by them both clearly showed that the robbery was planned. Count 2 involved the menacing of victims with a pistol which they would have had no means of knowing whether it was lethal or otherwise. Importantly to the assessment of the seriousness of this offence was the collateral act of striking to the floor the elderly customer of the Post Office. 

35As his Honour noted, he was not provided with detail about the breaking and entering and stealing of the jewellers at Cooks Hill which was the first charge in the schedule. He was informed however that the value of items stolen was $71,688.95 and the identity of the applicant as the offender was not established until a DNA match was made. It can fairly be deduced that this would have been some time after the occurrence of the offence and there has been no suggestion that any recovery of the stolen jewellery had been achieved. 

36His Honour assessed a sentence of 4 years 6 months for each offence on the indictment (taking into account the scheduled offences on Count 2) and applied a discount of 15% (rounded off) for the pleas of guilty which had been indicated for the first time in the week before a trial was listed to commence. He observed that the applicant was subject to a bond to be of good behaviour when the first offence was committed. The guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 indicated a range of sentences (after utilitarian discount of 10%) for a ""typical"" armed robbery at 4 to 5 years. The facts of these offences would classify them as more serious than a ""typical"" case. There were, of course, two offences and there was need in particular to give account to the far from minor breaking, entering and stealing of the jewellery store. 

37As has been authoritatively pointed out Henry establishes guidelines not ""tramlines"". Nevertheless it should be noted that this applicant could not qualify under the very first expression of a young offender with no or little criminal history. I have already mentioned the applicant's continuing adverse encounters with the criminal law. Nor would I include the forcing to the floor of the elderly customer at the first offence as ""limited"" actual violence. 

38Whilst as I have indicated, there is at least some ambiguity about his Honour's remarks concerning personal and general deterrence, I am unpersuaded that, giving full weight to the applicant' handicaps consequent upon his injury, any lesser sentence than that imposed by his Honour is appropriate. 

39I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal.

2709837,R v NR [2011] NSWSC 280,"Judgment 

1On 27 February 2009, NR killed DA at an abandoned house in Bayview Road, Canada Bay. 

2He did so by walking up behind DA, who was sitting unsuspectingly in a lounge chair, and striking him with a forceful blow to the head with a piece of timber. 

3The blow fractured DA's skull and caused serious brain injury. He did not recover and on 3 March 2009, DA died without ever having regained consciousness. 

4NR was arrested on 28 February 2009 and has been in custody ever since. He was charged with murder. 

5On Monday, 22 November 2010 when arraigned in front of the jury, NR pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder but guilty to the offence of manslaughter. The Crown declined to accept this plea in full discharge of the indictment. 

6The trial proceeded. On Friday 3 December 2010, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of murder but they found NR guilty of manslaughter. 

7It is now time for NR to be sentenced for his crime. The Crimes Act 1900 provides that there is a maximum term of imprisonment for the offence of manslaughter of 25 years. 

Judicial Task on Sentencing 

8In the circumstances of this present case, it is appropriate that I remind myself of the judicial task on sentencing. 

9In the present system of criminal justice I must exercise a discretion as to what sentence should be imposed upon NR by applying well identified principles of law to the facts which I find: R v MacDonell (NSWCCA, 8 December 1995, unreported) per Hunt CJ at CL at 1. 

10The principles of law are well established and are conveniently summarised in the following way: 

""1. Where, following a trial by jury, a person has been convicted of a criminal offence, the power and responsibility of determining the punishment to be inflicted upon the offender rests with the judge, and not with the jury...; 

2. Subject to certain constraints, it is the duty of the judge to determine the facts relevant to sentencing. Some of these facts will have emerged in evidence at the trial; others may only emerge in the course of the sentencing proceedings ...; 

3. The primary constraint upon the power and duty of decision making ... is that the view of the facts adopted by the judge for purposes of sentencing must be consistent with the verdict of the jury ...; 

4. A second constraint is that findings of fact made against an offender by a sentencing judge must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt ...; 

5. There is no general requirement that a sentencing judge must sentence an offender upon the basis of the view of the facts, consistent with the verdict, which is most favourable to the offender.... However, the practical effect of 4 above, in any given case, may be that, because the judge is required to resolve any reasonable doubt in favour of the accused, then the judge will be obliged, for that reason, to sentence upon a view of the facts which is most favourable to the offender ..."". 

R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 377-378; See also Cheung v The Queen (2001) 209 CLR 1 at [14] and at [169]. 

11I will apply these principles in the course of this sentence. 

The Relevant Legislation 

12The Parliament of NSW has determined the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender. Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that those purposes are: 

""(a) To ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence; 

(b) To prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences; 

(c) To protect the community from the offender; 

(d) To promote the rehabilitation of the offender; 

(e) To make the offender accountable for his or her actions; 

(f) To denounce the conduct of the offender; 

(g) To recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community."" 

13Because NR was 16 years 11 months old at the time he killed DA, I am obliged to exercise my sentencing functions having regard to some further principles determined by the Parliament of NSW, which are to be found in s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. Those principles include: 

""(a) ... 

(b) That children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance; 

(c) That it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption; 

(d) ... 

(e) That the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind; 

(f) That it is desirable that children who commit offences be assisted with their reintegration into the community so as to sustain family and community ties; 

(g) That it is desirable that children who commit offences accept responsibility for their actions and, wherever possible, make reparation for their actions; 

(h) That, subject to the other principles described above, consideration should be given to the effect of any crime on the victim."" 

Principles of Sentencing 

14The courts have developed clear guidance for the exercise of the sentencing discretion by every judge. These principles are to be found in decided cases. 

15The courts have recognised for many years that sentencing for the crime of manslaughter is a difficult task. That is because the range of conduct which can result in the death of an individual is very great. In all cases of manslaughter, matters of fact and degree arise. Views as to the relative importance of particular facts and matters will undoubtedly differ. 

16However, one principle which is important for a sentencing judge to always keep in mind when considering the crime of manslaughter is that the starting point for consideration of the appropriate penalty, and a key element in assessing the gravity of the objective circumstances of the case, is that what is involved in this case, and in every case of manslaughter, is the felonious taking of a human life: See R v Blacklidge (NSWCCA, 12 December 1995, unreported), per Gleeson CJ. 

17Manslaughter, as an unlawful homicide, however it occurs, has always been regarded by the law as a most serious crime. That is because the protection of human life and personal safety is a primary objective of the system of criminal justice: See R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510, per Gleeson CJ (James and Ireland JJ agreeing). 

18But NR is not the first juvenile to commit a manslaughter. The courts have in many cases examined the principles involved in sentencing juveniles on manslaughter and other charges: See R v AJC [2010] NSWCCA 168; APT v R [2009] NSWCCA 230 at [19] per Grove J (Macfarlan JA and Hoeben J agreeing); R v Carroll [2008] NSWCCA 218 at [8] per McClellan CJ at CL (Hislop J agreeing); KT v R (2008) 182 A Crim R 571 at 577-578 per McClellan CJ at CL; R v Adamson (2002) 132 A Crim R 511 at [29]-[32] per Beazley JA (Bell J agreeing); R v Pham & Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 at 135 per Lee CJ at CL (Gleeson CJ and Hunt J agreeing); R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 at 115-116 per Mathews J (Gleeson CJ and Samuels JA agreeing). Those principles include, and I recognise that my sentencing exercise must include, these matters: 

(a) Considerations of general deterrence and principles of retribution are, in most cases, of less significance than they would be when sentencing an adult for the same offence; 

(b) In recognition of the capacity for young people to reform and mould their character to conform with society's norms, considerable emphasis is placed on the need to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation; 

(c) The law recognises the potential for the cognitive, emotional and/or psychological immaturity of a young person to contribute to their breach of the law. Accordingly, allowance will be made for the offender's youth, not just their biological age; 

(d) Although accepted to be of less significance than when sentencing adults, considerations of general deterrence and retribution cannot be completely ignored when sentencing young offenders. There remains a significant public interest in deterring anti-social conduct. Of course, the weight to be given to a person's youth diminishes the closer the offender approaches the age of maturity: 

(e) The emphasis given to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution when sentencing young offenders may be moderated when the young person has conducted him or herself in a way an adult might conduct him or herself and has committed a crime of violence or considerable gravity. 

19I will need to bear in mind the legislation by which I am bound and the principles which the courts have determined upon, when proceeding on my exercise of sentencing NR. 

The Facts 

20I find the facts of the matter to be as follows. 

21NR was in a relationship of boyfriend and girlfriend for about eleven months, on and off, with JC. They were both 16 at the time. Their relationship ended in mid-February 2009. 

22On 27 February 2009, JC met up with several friends who were also known to NR. Those friends included the deceased DA who was at that time about 19 years old. They spent the morning and most of the afternoon together hanging out in an abandoned house in Bayview Road, Canada Bay. From time to time they were smoking cannabis. 

23NR spent the day at work as an apprentice greenkeeper with the Ryde Municipal Council. On a number of occasions during the day, NR tried telephoning JC, but he did not succeed in having a conversation with her. 

24NR also telephoned one of the other young people who was present. And perhaps on more than one occasion. It does not matter. On one occasion, NR learnt that JC and the other young people were at the abandoned house, although he did not know the address. 

25He must have suspected that JC and DA were alone together because he asked the other young person to whom he spoke whether he knew what they were doing. He was told that the young person did not. 

26At about 4pm, having finished work, NR managed to speak directly to JC on a mobile telephone. They arranged to meet later that afternoon at the McDonalds restaurant at Five Dock, on Parramatta Road. 

27JC, accompanied by DA and another, arrived at McDonalds first. They sat at one of the outside tables. A short time later NR arrived, having been taken to McDonalds by his mother. Although there is some differing evidence at the trial, I am satisfied that when NR arrived, he shook hands with DA, greeted him and said something to the effect that he had not seen him in a long time. 

28NR and DA were known to each other. They had first met some many months before this incident. 

29NR and JC left the other two young men at the outside table and walked into one of the disabled toilets at McDonalds. They closed the door. It is clear that they had an argument in the disabled toilet. While that was happening, DA and the other young man left McDonalds and walked back to the abandoned house. 

30In the course of the argument in the disabled toilet, NR noticed a mark on JC's neck which he thought indicated that she had been kissed by someone. After some persistent and rather heated questioning, NR was told by JC that she and DA had been kissing during the course of the afternoon. Upon hearing this, NR got very angry and became quite distressed. He punched the wall with his fist. He immediately left the disabled toilet to look for DA, but soon realised that he was no longer at McDonalds. 

31NR then persuaded a very reluctant JC to take him to the abandoned house to where they both assumed DA had gone. He said that he wanted to confront DA when he found him and to have a fistfight with him. 

32There is a complete conflict of evidence between JC and NR as to a central fact which occurred at some point on the walk from the McDonalds restaurant to the abandoned house. The conflict of fact concerns where, and at what stage, on the walk NR picked up two items, one of which he discarded, but either of which could be used as a weapon to assault DA. 

33JC gave evidence that in the car park outside OfficeWorks which was immediately adjacent to McDonalds, NR first picked up a block of concrete and walked some distance with it, indicating his intention to take it to the abandoned house. He then placed it back on the ground apparently because it was too heavy and awkward. She said that he then picked up a piece of timber in the same carpark, and carried it with him, at least for some part of the way, in a furtive and concealed manner, as they walked to the abandoned house. 

34NR denied this version of the events when he gave evidence at the trial, and said that he had picked up a concrete block for a few moments when they were well into the walk, but had replaced it, and he had then continued the walk to the abandoned house. He said that he had only picked up the piece of timber when he was in relatively close proximity to the house and only after arriving in Bayview Road. 

35I am not persuaded that I should accept JC's version of this event. I think the version of the facts which is more consistent with the jury's verdict is that of which NR gave evidence. That is because the jury's verdict means that they were not satisfied that NR had the intention to kill DA or cause him grievous bodily harm. Carrying the piece of timber from the OfficeWorks carpark for a period of at least ten minutes and concealing it in a furtive manner suggests a clear intention to use it in a way which would have caused DA serious physical harm. 

36The evidence of NR that when he left McDonalds he intended to have a fist fight with DA, was I find compelling. In order to do that he did not need any weapon. His evidence that he realised upon turning into Bayview Road, in Canada Bay, that this was the street in which a very close friend of his had died in traumatic circumstances, was corroborated and I also found compelling. 

37NR's evidence that he only picked up the piece of timber after turning into Bayview Road, and whilst in a distressed state of mind, seems to me to better accord with the likelihood of what occurred. 

38I am not satisfied in any event, in weighing up the evidence of JC as against the evidence of NR, the manner in which they each gave their evidence, and the probabilities of which of the two is the more likely version of events, that I would be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that NR picked up in the timber in the car park at OfficeWorks as JC suggested. 

39Accordingly, I proceed in this sentence on the basis that the piece of timber was collected in Bayview Road in the general proximity of the abandoned house where the offence took place and only a short time before the offence. 

40NR gave evidence that when he left McDonalds and commenced the walk to the abandoned house, and throughout the entirety of that walk, it was his intention to have a fist fight with DA. He said that he was very angry with him, he felt he had been betrayed by a person who he regarded a good friend, and that he was going to express his feelings through a fist fight. 

41There is no doubt that NR was very angry with DA and that he maintained that anger throughout his walk from the McDonalds restaurant to the abandoned house. 

42This was his state of mind when he entered the abandoned house. 

43NR, who was carrying a bag over his shoulder, put that bag down outside just before he walked into the house. He carried the piece of wood into the house. 

44It is appropriate at this point to provide a description of the piece of timber involved. The piece of timber was a little over half a metre long. It was light, weighing less than one quarter of a kilogram. A visual examination of the piece of timber does not suggest that it was likely to be very strong. 

45However, the evidence from Mr John Ford, a consultant botanist, satisfies me that the timber was the wood of a larch tree, which is in the middle range for strength, hardness, stiffness and shock resistance. These features, which were not known to NR, provide an explanation for the very severe consequences in this case, which resulted from the blow he delivered to the head of DA. 

46The room in which DA was seated was not the first room that NR entered. He walked through one of the other rooms of the house before walking momentarily through the door of the room where DA was. In that room there were a number of other people. Some were facing away from NR, some were facing towards him. 

47The evidence suggests that he stepped back out of the doorway and then very quickly thereafter re-entered the room, and hit DA over the head with the piece of wood. 

48DA immediately slumped forward in the arm chair and was clearly unconscious. NR took about 30 minutes before calling an ambulance. He then received instructions from the 000 operator and made an attempt in accordance with those instructions to revive DA. That attempt was unsuccessful. 

49It is clear that when DA slumped forward, as a consequence of the blow on his head, he began to make snoring noises. NR was very agitated. He prevented others in the room from calling for an ambulance. In evidence, he said that he expected DA would recover immediately and they would have a fist fight. He said that he had panicked and that they were the reasons why he did not permit an ambulance to be called. 

50I am persuaded that NR was clearly in an agitated and panicked state. He was angry when he arrived. He did not intend to kill DA or even to cause him serious bodily harm. But his blow had produced a result which was inconsistent with his intention. In those circumstances, and in the context of these young people gathering in an abandoned house where they had no right to be, I am satisfied that he would have panicked. The steps which he took immediately, in particular refraining from calling, and not allowing the others to call for, an ambulance, reflected that panic and nothing more. I do not accept the Crown's submissions that this conduct was a demonstration of the intent which NR had towards DA when he entered the house. 

51When the panic subsided he made all of the efforts which he was required to make in accordance with the instructions of the 000 operator. 

52Police and ambulance were called and it is clear that the police and the ambulance officers were all given an entirely false story. In the course of the trial, the Crown seemed to be attempting to prove that NR was the person responsible for making up that story and requiring the others to tell it. 

53For the purposes of sentencing, I am not so satisfied. JC gave evidence, which I accept, that it was her idea to make up the false story and the others all went along with it. I therefore do not take into account that false story in considering what the extent of the culpability of NR was at the time of the offence. 

54DA was taken to hospital by ambulance. He had very serious head injuries as a consequence of the blow which was struck. He did not ever recover consciousness. On 3 March 2009 his life support system was turned off and he died. 

Police Investigation 

55NR and JC were taken to the police station. Two of the other people present when DA was attacked left the scene and ran away. 

56Initially, NR and JC when questioned by police officers adhered to the false account of what happened. Eventually, after police had spoken to one of the other people present, JC and NR were informed that the police did not accept their accounts and regarded them as false. 

57At about 4.50am on the following morning, 28 February 2009, NR admitted that the account which he had given was false and that it was he who had struck a blow which caused the injuries from which DA was then suffering. 

58He was arrested and charged at that time. He has remained in custody since then. 

Specific Sentencing Considerations 

59Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act identifies a number of matters as aggravating factors to which regard must be had in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed. In applying that legislation in this case there are a number of these aggravating factors. The first is that the offence involved the actual use of violence: See s 21A(2)(b). However, given the nature of the crime of manslaughter, I am satisfied that this aggravating factor is accounted for as being an element of the offence, and that I should not have additional regard to it. 

60The second aggravating factor which is applicable to this case is that NR actually used a weapon, namely the piece of timber. I have already recorded the salient features of the piece of timber. I have found that NR would not have known the inherent features of the timber. To him, the timber would have appeared as a light weapon which was unlikely to cause serious harm. However, it was a weapon and that matter is an aggravating factor to which I have regard: s 21A(2)(c). 

61The offence was committed in the presence of a number of people under the age of 18 and that is a further aggravating factor: s 21A(2)(ea). 

62The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act also identifies a number of matters which are to be taken into account as mitigating factors. Leaving aside the plea of guilty by NR to which I will come in due course, mitigating factors include the fact that he did not have any record of any previous conviction, and, as my findings will in due course show, he is unlikely to reoffend and has good prospects of rehabilitation: s 21A(3)(g) and s 21A(3)(h). 

63One relevant mitigating factor is whether an offender has shown remorse. But this can only be considered if an offender has accepted responsibility for his actions and has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage which he has caused: s 21A(3)(i). 

64I am satisfied that NR has shown remorse in the way which the legislation requires. The evidence of NR himself, is that he is remorseful. In particular, the evidence of Dr Katie Seidler, an expert clinical and forensic psychologist, in her report of 15 February 2011, is most persuasive to me on this issue. 

65I will take this factor into account and, particularly having regard to the context of the offence and NR's age, I attribute importance to these matters. 

The Criminality Involved 

66In my opinion, the criminality involved was serious. The general course of conduct followed by NR leading up to the blow being struck was not accidental but was intentional. He intended to go to the abandoned house in Canada Bay and there confront DA. He intended to have a fistfight with him. Shortly before entering the house he picked up the piece of wood and then used it. 

67I am satisfied, consistently with the verdict of the jury, that I should find that this was a thoughtless act. NR did not intend to cause DA any serious physical injury by using the timber. He intended to strike him and thereby provoke a fight between them. It was a cowardly, brutal and thoughtless attack. He gave DA no chance to defend himself. But rather he chose to get in the first blow. 

68The Crown submits that this matter is one which ought to be regarded as ""... a worst case scenario for manslaughter "" because: 

""This was adult behaviour involving planning, the use of a weapon and an intention to, at least, inflict actual bodily harm. He made no attempt to assist the victim having whacked him with considerable force."" 

69The Crown also submits that the Court would have regard to the fact that NR's understanding and reasoning were unimpaired by intellectual deficits, or the effect of drugs or alcohol. 

70I do not accept the Crown's submission that this offence ought to be so regarded. This offence, namely hitting DA over the head and, thereby, causing his death, was not adult behaviour as that term is discussed in the authorities, nor was it planned (or premeditated). On the contrary, it had all of the hallmarks of a lack of emotional maturity and an inability of NR to control his impulses and feelings. 

71It cannot be overlooked, as the Crown's submissions seem to, that in the lead up to and at the time of the offence, NR was distressed about two matters. They were: First, finding out that JC, who he seems to have still thought of as his girlfriend, had been physically intimate with someone who he had thought of as a friend; and secondly, upon turning into Bayview Road, Canada Bay, being reminded of the tragic and sudden death of a very close friend who had died in that street. The traumatic nature of that death and its effect on NR was well described in the evidence of Ms Saadeh, a former teacher, whose evidence I accept. 

72Dr Seidler described NR's emotional state at the time of the offence as NR ""... experiencing acute levels of emotional distress at the time "". I accept this description. 

73As I have already said, manslaughter is regarded as a most serious offence. But the circumstances in this matter are such that I am persuaded that the conduct of NR demonstrated emotional immaturity, such as the feelings of jealousy and anger over JC's and DA' romantic liaison, poor impulse control, exhibited by punching the wall at the McDonald's restaurant and his action to strike DA as soon as he entered the room, and a complete lack of mature reflection - a moment's thought ought to have resulted in a different course of conduct. 

74The offence had all of the features which suggest that full and proper allowance ought be made for NR's youth and lack of maturity in considering the seriousness of the offence. I will make such allowance. 

75It is clear when considering the offence in question that NR's approach to what occurred was most immature. The features of the relationship with JC, the regular breaking up and re-engagement of that relationship, the arguments which characterised it, and the inability of NR to adequately think through what was occurring and the ramifications of it, are all completely consistent in my view with juvenile immaturity. The very notion that having been hit with a piece of timber DA would stand up and present NR an opportunity to fight was itself an indication of his immaturity of thought. 

76I accept as the jury must have, that NR never thought that his actions would cause serious physical injury to DA. But what he did was dangerous and unlawful. He sought to express his emotions with violence. It resulted in the death of DA. 

Subjective Features 

77NR was born on 26 March 1992. He was 16 years 11 months at the time of the offence. He was raised in a family which consisted of his mother, his stepfather and a half sister. 

78Although his natural father had separated from his mother when NR was an infant, he maintained contact with his father and had a reasonable relationship with him. 

79His relationship with his mother and stepfather was at times strained during NR's adolescence and prior to this offence. Notwithstanding these conflicts, the family appears to have had a generally reasonable home life. They ate meals together. They took family holidays together. The sort of strain and conflict which occurred does not seem to me to be out of the usual in a home with parents who provide a good level of supervision and proper boundaries, and adolescents who strain at those boundaries. 

80NR was educated at both primary and secondary school until the end of year 10. Although he obtained a School Certificate at the end of year 10, NR's parents suggested that he find employment rather than continuing at school. 

81He found a variety of employment positions having left school. Ultimately, NR commenced an apprenticeship in horticulture. He had completed about six months of his training through Ryde Council as an apprentice greenkeeper at the time of his arrest. He had anticipated continuing with this trade had he not entered custody. 

82Since his arrest, and whilst detained as a juvenile offender, albeit prior to conviction, NR has undertaken studies with the aim of completing his Higher School Certificate through distance education. 

83At the time of the sentencing hearing, he was preparing to commence his year 12 Higher School Certificate subjects. His progress with his studies whilst being detained as a juvenile offender has been very good. He has a number of academic awards due to his high achievements and he is desirous of completing his education. 

84To the extent that he can contemplate entering a career after serving his sentence, he presently has a wish to join the fire brigade. 

85Prior to the offence, NR had some interaction with alcohol, cannabis and ecstasy. In the six months prior to his arrest he was accustomed to daily cannabis use and the use of ecstasy once or twice per week. Since his arrest, he has completed a series of courses aimed at reducing and managing addictions. 

86After his arrest, NR was initially not well behaved. However, his misbehaviour did not lead to any criminal charges being laid. In all of the circumstances here, I do not regard this misbehaviour as being of any consequence. 

87However, since having been transferred from the Kariong Correctional Centre to the Cobham Juvenile Justice Centre about a year ago, he has not displayed any misbehaviour and according to reports provided to the Court has displayed commendable behaviour. 

88He has received counselling including therapy based on the cognitive behavioural theory and has ensured that he has a positive engagement with those around him. 

89The evidence satisfies me that since his arrest, he has been well supported by his family with whom he seems to have a close and supportive relationship. 

Prospects of Rehabilitation 

90I am satisfied that the prospects of NR's rehabilitation are very good. He has a degree of insight into his present state. He has engaged in counselling. He has undertaken courses which will improve his personal understanding of how to manage difficult situations. He has improved his level of education and such ambitions as he does have for the future suggest that he has reasonable prospects of a proper rehabilitation. As well, he is now considerably more mature than he was at the time of his offence. 

91In particular, since going into custody he has improved relationships with his family and has re-established links with longstanding friends which will help him to rehabilitate when released from custody. 

92His approach to further education and study bodes well for his prospects of rehabilitation. These prospects will be enhanced if he continues his education with the availability of educational support at the optimum possible level. 

93I agree with the assessment of Ms Kennedy-Schultz, a psychologist with the Forensic & Mental Health Program of the Department of Juvenile Justice, who was responsible for the preparation of the background report which s 25 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act requires, when she expressed this view: 

""As a result of his engagement in programs whilst in custody, [NR] is on track to achieve his educational goals and as a result of his performance should be able to access opportunities should he wish as he would not have been able to such as university studies. [NR] has consistently maintained focus and determination regarding achieving the goals he sets for himself and provided this continues, suggests good prospects that he will achieve his desired outcomes. These protective factors, combined with ongoing participation in targeting interventions should minimise risk factors and increase the likelihood of [NR's] successfully achieving his goals."" 

94This opinion is consistent with the opinion of Dr Katie Seidler. In particular, I note and accept her opinion expressed in paragraph 35 of her report of 15 February 2011, that: 

""35. ... 
... 
Comment on [NR]'s prospects for rehabilitation - Acknowledging the serious nature of [NR]'s offending behaviour, he impresses as a reasonable and insightful young man, who has positive future goals and who seems to have coped with detention admirably by focussing on positive pursuits. In other words, he has demonstrated the capacity to utilise social supports and other significant resources to meet his criminogenic and other needs, whilst at the same time completing his education and improving his skills for independent and productive community living. As such, [NR] impresses with sound prospects for rehabilitation, although he will need support to transition back into the community after such a long period of incarceration at the vulnerable time of adolescence."" 

95However it is clear that NR's prospects of rehabilitation will be enhanced by having a suitably long period of supervision on parole after any custodial part of his sentence has expired. I accept the opinion of Dr Katie Seidler, expressed in her report of 15 February 2011, to this effect: 

""36. Recommendations: ... However, he is yet to address unresolved grief and loss and relationship concerns through individual psychological treatment and this remains an unmet need. However, it may be that this kind of treatment is best facilitated when [NR] is in the community where he can be better supported. Such intervention is available through community-based Juvenile Justice Services, through Adolescent Mental Health or through a youth specific counselling service like Head Space. Moreover, [NR] would be able to access psychological treatment with a fee-for-service clinician in his local area and such a person can be identified through the Australian Psychological Society's Referral Service... He is likely to be eligible to have any such treatment supported by the Government's Medicare initiative and to this end, [NR] will require a Mental Health Care Plan completed by his General Practitioner... 

37. In addition to mental health treatment, I recommended that [NR] will require support to transition back into the community. Participating in the Department's Works Release programme will certainly assist to this end, as will the various trade and other work-related programmes that [NR] has participated in so as to improve his skills and employability. However, [NR] will require an extended period of community-based supervision and in order to assist in his making a meaningful return to community living, it is recommended that facilitating this transition to supported and supervised community living will be in his best interests as soon as possible..."" 

96One contested issue that needs to be resolved is the extent to which facilities would continue to be available to NR to pursue further education, including his aim of completing his Higher School Certificate, should he serve a custodial sentence in an adult correctional centre. 

97The evidence of the Crown is that inmates in adult correctional centres may be offered the Higher School Certificate but then only through correspondence. Some centres provide the support of an education officer. At some facilities, more intensive education programs are provided. 

98A letter from Mr Anthony Becker of the Adult Education and Vocational Training Institute, which is part of Corrective Services NSW, tendered by the Crown, makes it plain that AEVTI does not deliver the Higher School Certificate to inmates in NSW correctional centres. He notes that it may be possible for inmates to study subjects in the Higher School Certificate but only through a distance education mode. He notes that not all centres offer distance education opportunities and that inmates often undertake distance education studies in cell hours after the centre's structural day is complete. 

99The Crown submitted that the Young Adult Offender Program at John Moroney Correctional Centre would be adequate for NR's further education. I disagree. The document tendered which describes that program in some detail makes no specific mention of the Higher School Certificate. This does not suggest to me that the study of the Higher School Certificate at that facility is a mainstream educational activity. It is demonstrably inferior to the program offered by the juvenile justice authorities. As well, there is no order which this Court can make which will ensure that NR serves his term at the John Moroney Correctional Centre. A recommendation of the Court does not have the force of an order. 

100I therefore find that the educational facilities currently available to NR in juvenile detention, which provide an important component to his future prospects of rehabilitation, are unlikely to be as readily available to him in an adult correctional centre. This factor is relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence for NR in that it impacts upon his prospects of successful rehabilitation. But it is principally relevant to the question of whether NR should serve that sentence as a juvenile offender or in an adult correctional facility, an issue which I will come to in due course. 

Plea of Guilty 

101On 8 February 2010, in advance of a listing of the proceedings before the Parramatta Children's Court, lawyers for NR wrote to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions indicating that he would plead not guilty to murder, but guilty to manslaughter on the basis that his offence did not involve the necessary intention to constitute the crime of murder. That is, he did not have the intention to kill DA or cause him grievous bodily harm. He accepted then, as he has at all times since, that he did commit an unlawful and/or dangerous act which caused DA' death. The Crown rejected NR's offer and accordingly he stood trial for murder before a jury. 

102Section 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that in passing sentence, a court must take into account a plea of guilty, and some associated circumstances. However, the legislation requires that any lesser penalty imposed must: "" ... not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence "". 

103Here, the Crown submits that there are two reasons why the Court would not allow any discount under this section or in accordance with the general law. They are: 

(a) When offering to plead guilty to the offence of manslaughter, NR did so on the basis of an inadequate outline of facts; and 

(b) The offence committed in this case is so serious that no discount should be given. 

104By a letter dated 8 February 2010, NR offered to plead guilty to manslaughter. In so doing, his solicitors articulated the basis of the plea in this way: 

""... he intends to plead ... guilty to manslaughter on the basis that he did not have the intent to kill DA or cause him grievous bodily harm, but that he did commit an unlawful and/or dangerous act which caused DA' death."" 

105The letter goes on to expand on that basis by making assertions as to NR's motivations and the conclusion which ought to be reached about his conduct. 

106The terms of the letter bear a striking resemblance to the arguments advanced at trial by senior counsel for NR. I am satisfied that these arguments were accepted by the jury in finding NR guilty of manslaughter. 

107The Crown's submission, that NR's offer of 8 February 2010 was made on an inadequate basis, must be rejected. I do not accept that there was any substantial difference between the terms of the letter and what ultimately emerged in Court. It is self-evident that the letter contains much less detail than what emerged. But I see no reason why a discount ought be denied to NR because the Crown declined his offer. This is particularly so in this case, as the Crown also did not seek to explore the offer by having further correspondence with NR's solicitor about it, nor were there any attempts to explore the basis of the offer in discussion between the respective lawyers. 

108To accept the first submission of the Crown would be, in effect, to punish NR for the conduct of the lawyers for the Crown. That would be wholly inappropriate. 

109The second submission advanced by the Crown is that the seriousness of the offence is such that no discount should be permitted. 

110In R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, Spigelman CJ, with whom Wood CJ at CL, Foster AJA, Grove and James JJ agreed, said, at 418 [157] and [158] this: 

""157. There are circumstances in which the protection of the public requires a long sentence to be imposed so that no discount for the plea is appropriate: see, eg, R v Stabler (1984) 6 Cr App R (S) 129 at 131; R v Costen (1989) 11 Cr App R (S) 182 at 184). 

158. There are crimes that so offend the public interest that the maximum sentence, without any discount for any purpose, is appropriate. This includes situations in which a life sentence can be and is imposed, notwithstanding the plea: see, eg, R v Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2, see especially per Sully J (at [38]-[42])."" 

111This is not a case where the protection of the public requires such a long sentence that a discount is inappropriate. Nor does the crime call for the maximum sentence so that any discount is inappropriate. This case is very far from the two exceptions dealt with by Spigelman CJ. I reject the Crown's submission that no discount ought to be permitted. 

112But I still need to be satisfied that the offer to plead guilty would, if accepted, have achieved a utilitarian benefit for the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system as a whole. I am so satisfied. The offer of the plea was made on 8 February 2010. The matter was then at a very early stage before the Children's Court, it was about three months before the date fixed for the committal hearing, it was at a time before NR had received all of the statements ultimately obtained by the investigating police. Had the plea been accepted, there would have been a substantial benefit to the administration of justice in NSW. 

113A much earlier offer of a plea is, having regard to the time of the year, and the need to obtain proper legal advice, for a juvenile, hard to imagine. 

114NR adhered to the plea on three subsequent occasions - when he was committed for trial in this Court by the Children's Court in May 2010, upon arraignment to this Court, and then when indicted before the jury. 

115Had the plea been accepted in those circumstances by the Crown, a discount of 25 per cent would have been appropriate. As Grove J, with whom Spigelman CJ and Sully J agreed, said in R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310 at [15], having regard to the then relevant legislation: 

""There has been a long practice, however, in this Court and in trial courts to take into account the offer of a plea of guilty which matches the crime for which a person is ultimately convicted."" 

See also: R v Johnson [2003] NSWCCA 129 at [37] to [43] per Bell J, Giles JA, and Corruthers AJ agreeing; R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32] per Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing). 

116Such an approach seems to me to accord with the incentive and the public interest benefit which underlie the provision of a discount for an early plea: See Thomson at [115] and [122] per Spigelman CJ. 

117Accordingly, I am satisfied that in this case it is appropriate to allow a 25 per cent discount for NR's offer to plead guilty to manslaughter and to his subsequent plea of guilty to that offence. 

Sentence 

118I have already said enough to indicate the crime which NR committed was a serious one. It involved the taking of the life of another. The effect which NR's conduct has had on the family of DA has been expressed by his mother and stepfather in their victim impact statements which were read aloud to the Court. I acknowledge the contents of these statements and I express my sympathy to the whole of DA's family for their tragic and senseless loss. I have regard to those statements in the way which the law allows me: s 28, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and R v Previtera (Supreme Court of NSW, 27 May 1997, unreported). 

119NR is a young man and proper weight needs to be given to his rehabilitation. I am satisfied that these prospects are very good. 

120The sentence which I impose must mark out the Court's obligation to protect life and mark its disapproval of any crime in which a life is lost. But it would not be right to crush all hope of rehabilitation, and indeed, rehabilitation is a matter to which I must give proper account, and is of more importance in this case than deterrence and retribution. 

121Ordinarily, but for the plea of guilty, I would have sentenced NR to a term of imprisonment of 10 years. In light of the allocation of the discount for his guilty plea, that term will be reduced by 25 per cent. 

122NR, for the offence of the manslaughter of DA, taking into account your plea of guilty, I sentence you to an overall term of imprisonment of 7 years and 6 months. 

123Section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires, as a statutory ratio, that you should serve three-quarters of that term as a non-parole period. 

124However, in your case I am satisfied that there are special circumstances which enable me to reduce that non-parole period, thereby increasing the period of time you are on parole, because that would be beneficial for the purposes of your rehabilitation. 

125The special circumstances which I find are the fact that you are still young, the fact that this is your first period of incarceration, and the fact that you have good prospects of rehabilitation. These facts all combine to mean that I should vary the ratio of 75 per cent fixed by the law so that your non-parole period is 60 per cent of the total sentence, which means that you should serve a period in custody of 4 years and 6 months. That term should commence on the day you were taken into custody for this offence. 

126I am satisfied that such a non-parole period properly reflects the criminality involved in this offence and all of the factors to which I am required to have regard. 

127I next turn to the question of where you will serve this sentence. 

128Under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act , the offence of manslaughter is a serious children's indictable offence, which means that, as you are now over 18 years old, you will serve any custodial sentence imposed on you in an adult correctional facility, unless a finding of special circumstances is made. 

129I am satisfied that I should make a finding of special circumstances. 

130The first reason is that, as I have previously discussed, educational programs and facilities suitable to your needs, having regard to the relationship between further education and your prospects of rehabilitation, are likely to be available only in a juvenile detention centre. 

131Secondly, I am satisfied that having regard to your present level of maturity and physical stature, you would be at an unacceptable risk of suffering harm, both physical and psychological, if committed to an adult correctional facility. Dr Seidler's psychological report of 15 February 2011 expressed views consistent with this, which I accept. 

132Accordingly, I am satisfied that, in accordance with s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act , special circumstances exist so that I should make an order that you serve the whole of the sentence as a juvenile offender, that is in a juvenile justice centre, and not in an adult correctional facility. 

133NR, I impose the following sentence upon you: 

(a) I sentence you to a term of imprisonment without parole of 4 years and 6 months to commence on 28 February 2009 and to conclude on 27 August 2013; 

(b) I sentence you to a balance term of 3 years, to conclude on 27 August 2016. 

(c) The first day upon which you will be eligible for release from custody is 27 August 2013. 

(d) In accordance with s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 , I make an order directing that the whole of the term of imprisonment is to be served as a juvenile offender.

2709839,Sinkovich v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 90,"JUDGMENT 

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Hoeben J. 

2HOEBEN J: 
Offences and sentence 
The applicant faced a trial at the District Court in Sydney commencing 15 June 2009 before Conlon DCJ and a jury of twelve on an indictment containing two counts as follows: 

Count 1 : Knowingly take part in supply of prohibited drug namely methylamphetamine, contrary to s25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 

Count 2: Supply prohibited drug being not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, contrary to s25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 

3The applicant pleaded not guilty to those charges. The trial proceeded over 15 days between 15 June 2009 and 6 July 2009. On 6 July 2009 the jury returned a verdict of guilty in relation to both counts. Count 1 had a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years. Count 2 had a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. In relation to count 2 there was a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

4The sentencing proceedings took place before his Honour on 11 September and 6 November 2009 with his Honour passing sentence on 6 November 2009. His Honour sentenced the applicant as follows: 

Count 1: Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 4 July 2008 and expiring 3 July 2010 with a balance of term of 2 years expiring 3 July 2012. 

Count 2: Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years commencing 4 July 2009 and expiring 3 July 2018 with a balance of term of 4 years expiring 3 July 2002. 

The total effective sentence was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years with a balance of term of 4 years. 

5The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed by his Honour on the following grounds. 

(i) The sentences imposed are excessive in the circumstances. 

(ii) The sentences imposed offend the principles of totality and proportionality. 

(iii) The sentences imposed are such as to cause the applicant a justifiable sense of grievance due to the disparity between his sentence and the sentences imposed upon the co-offender, David Sydney Lowe. 

Factual background 

6Since there were no agreed facts, it was necessary for his Honour to make findings by taking into account the implications of the jury verdict and by reference to the evidence at trial and in the sentencing proceedings. There was no challenge to the findings of his Honour but there was a challenge to the use which he made of them. 

7In May 2008 Operation Fiesta was formed to investigate the supply of methylamphetamine in the Minto and Claymore areas. As part of this, a controlled operation was authorised on 5 June 2008. This involved a Police Undercover Operative (UCO) known as ""Peter"" attending Swettenham Road, Minto on 12 June 2008 carrying $2,700 in cash. He wore a listening device. 

8The applicant drove a co-offender, Lowe, to this location and waited nearby. Lowe walked to the UCO's car. Lowe supplied the UCO with a quantity of methylamphetamine in exchange for $2,700. This was later analysed and weighed, which indicated a net total of 27.2 grams. During this meeting, there was a conversation about a further supply. Lowe then left the UCO's vehicle and returned to where the applicant was waiting and they drove from the area. 

9His Honour found that the applicant and Lowe were in the business of drug trafficking. This was based on telephone intercepts of conversations between the applicant and Lowe. 

10Lowe and another co-offender, Tutton, met with the UCO on 20 June 2008 and supplied him with more methylamphetamine. At that time, a discussion took place about the possible future purchase by the UCO of an ""elbow"" (i.e. one pound of methylamphetamine). A price of $30,000 was discussed. 

11In a telephone conversation between Lowe and the UCO on 30 June 2008, arrangements were made for the delivery of the ""elbow"" early the next week. Shortly after that conversation, Lowe called the applicant and asked if he could postpone the delivery for another week. The applicant responded that he would get it anyway as it did not matter. 

12On 2 July 2008 the UCO met with Lowe and Tutton when a further supply of methylamphetamine took place. The transcript of a conversation which took place on this occasion indicated that the ""elbow"" was being delivered to Lowe's home that day. Later in the conversation, the UCO asked Lowe if he would have the ""elbow"" by Friday, to which Lowe responded ""I got it now he's - the boss dropped it off at my house"". His Honour found that the reference to ""the boss"" by Lowe was a reference to the applicant and that the applicant was the person who organised the collection and on-supply to Lowe of methylamphetamine. As a result, his Honour found that in the joint criminal enterprise to supply the ""elbow"", the applicant was slightly above Lowe in the hierarchy. 

13On 4 July 2008 just before midday the UCO met with Lowe and Tutton, at Swettenham Road for the supply of the ""elbow"" of methylamphetamine for $32,000. They entered the UCO's car and Lowe removed three packages from his backpack. The gross total weight supplied to the UCO during this transaction was 512.8 grams, which was later analysed and weighed to show a net total of 443.8 grams. The UCO then handed over the money to Lowe and as he began to count it, other police officers moved in and made arrests. The drugs were seized, as was the $32,000 in cash. 

14At 12.20pm the same day, search warrants were executed at premises in Bernardo Street, Rosemeadow. Lowe was leasing those premises. When police entered, the applicant was sitting on a lounge. The applicant told police that the house was not his, but that he had stayed there overnight. The police noticed that the bonnet of his car was still hot. The police located at those premises 479.6 grams of methylamphetamine in various packages in freezers, 18 cannabis plants being hydroponically grown and 1,650.4 grams of packed and loose cannabis leaf. They also located various firearms and about $30,000 in cash. 

15Lowe pleaded guilty to charges in respect of all drugs and other items located in those premises. His Honour found that Lowe was substantially involved in drug trafficking and that the applicant had a similar involvement. 

Remarks on Sentence 

16In relation to count 1, his Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the offence as falling within the mid-range for offences of that type. He found the applicant to be an integral part of the supply allowing Lowe to conduct the actual transactions. 

17In relation to count 2, his Honour noted that a standard non-parole period of 10 years applied and that s54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , 1999 (the Act) required that a Court set the standard non-parole fixed for the offence unless the Court determined that there were reasons for setting a non-parole period which was either longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period. By reference to R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131, (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 his Honour noted that where a standard non-parole period applied to an offence, one had to ask whether reasons existed for not imposing it. As a first step, it was necessary to assess the objective seriousness of the offence to determine whether it fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness for offences of the relevant kind. Such a determination would include a consideration of the applicable circumstances of aggravation and mitigation provided for in s21A(2) and s21A(3) of the Act. 

18In relation to the objective seriousness of the offence in count 2, his Honour said: 

""... I am satisfied as I have already indicated that it involved a considerable degree of planning. First there were those negotiations between Lowe and the UCO in respect of the purchase price and the timeframe when the delivery could be made. The offender was the go to man for the supply of the commercial quantity. It involved this offender organising for the supply and collection of the commercial quantity and then organising its supply to Lowe so that he could on-supply it to the UCO. A driver had to be organised to take Lowe and Tutton to the Sweetenham Road location. A large sum of money changed hands. The amount supplied was almost twice the prescribed commercial quantity (250 grams). The offender Sinkovich waited at Lowe's premises while the transaction was going down. My assessment of the objective seriousness of this offence, so far as this offender is concerned, is that it falls slightly above the midrange."" (ROS 6.1) 

19In assessing the objective seriousness of the count 2 offence, his Honour also took into account under s21A(3) of the Act, that the applicant did not have any significant history of criminal offending and that he had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour did note, however, that no remorse had been exhibited and that despite an overwhelming prosecution case, he continued to deny his guilt. 

20His Honour had regard to the applicant's subjective circumstances. The applicant was 54 years of age at the time of sentencing. He had only a minor criminal record, comprising four convictions in 1974/75 for which he received small fines. 

21His Honour referred to the presentence report which showed that the applicant had been born in Croatia and emigrated to Australia with his mother when he was four, his father having relocated to Australia some three years before. He had been educated to school certificate level, before undertaking an apprenticeship as a heavy vehicle mechanic. He was employed in various companies before commencing his own business in 1989. He had ultimately closed down his business in order to pay costs associated with the property settlement following the dissolution of his marriage. Since the end of that marriage, he had been in receipt of a parenting payment and was the sole care giver of four children of that marriage. He had obtained full legal custody of the three youngest children. Their ages were 18, 14 and 10. The oldest child, Stacey, was aged 21. 

22Following the applicant's incarceration, the Family Court had granted responsibility in respect of the two youngest children to Stacey. At the time of the sentence hearing, the 14 year old was residing with her mother. 

23His Honour also had before him a report from Professor Stephen Woods, clinical and forensic psychologist. Professor Woods recorded a history that the 18 year old child had suffered extensive and severe facial injuries when aged about 3, following an attack by a dog. Due to her young age, facial surgery could not be carried out for some years. She was due to undergo further reconstructive facial surgery in early 2010. 

24Professor Woods recorded that the children's mother had been deeply traumatised by the dog attack and required antidepressant medication. Subsequently she was diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia. In 2003 the children were removed from their mother's care by DOCS and returned to the applicant. The applicant had sold his business in order to care for them. 

25The applicant told Professor Woods that he felt that he had failed his children and that he was suffering sleep disturbance and was unable to stop ruminating and worrying about them. His Honour accepted that the applicant's incarceration would most likely have a negative impact on the children. 

26In conclusion, Professor Woods said that the applicant was suffering from a range of symptoms of an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (severe). He said in relation to the applicant: 

""Whilst it is to be expected that any reasonable parent would suffer grief and loss with depressed mood as a result of being incarcerated an thus separated from their family, it is likely that Mr Sinkovitch's reaction has been particularly aggravated by his awareness of and concern for his children's special circumstances. The risk of Mr Sinkovich's condition deteriorating to the extent that he develops a major depressive disorder must be considered."" 

27The applicant told his probation officer that he had previously been the President of the Wollongong Chapter of the Rebels Motor Cycle Club. He had retired from the club some years before the sentencing proceedings, but continued to maintain his membership status as a result of having performed 20 years of service. 

28In formulating the sentences, his Honour had regard to the devastating impact of drugs on the lives of both young and not so young people. He noted that in respect of offences of this kind the element of deterrence, both specific and general, was a significant factor to be taken into account. 

29His Honour specifically referred to the principle of totality. Because at 54 years of age, this would be the first time that the applicant had served a custodial sentence, his Honour found special circumstances and varied the statutory ratio. Nevertheless, his Honour said that there had to be an appropriate relationship between the standard non-parole period fixed in respect of the offence and the objective criminality of the offence regardless of other matters that might be taken into account by way of mitigation. 

Appeal 
( i) The sentences imposed are excessive in the circumstances. 
(ii) The sentences imposed offend the principles of totality and proportionality. 

30Grounds of Appeal (i) and (ii) can be dealt with together since they raise the same issue. 

31The applicant submitted that the principle of proportionality required that a sentence imposed should bear a reasonable relationship to the facts of the crime itself, i.e. that the sentence should not exceed that which was appropriate to the objective seriousness of the crime. The applicant submitted that this principle was breached in that the sentences, particularly that in respect of count 2, were clearly outside the commonly accepted pattern of sentences imposed for the particular offences ( R v Visconti (1982) 2 NSWLR 104). He submitted that the sentences were simply not within the appropriate range. 

32To make out that proposition, the applicant relied upon sentencing statistics applicable to these two offences as showing a range of sentences which was well below that imposed by his Honour. In making that submission, the applicant conceded that in some cases statistics were of only limited use ( R v Bloomfield (1998) 101 A Crim R 404). In this case, however, the applicant submitted that the sentencing statistics were important and relevant in that they ensured consistency in sentencing and indicated general sentencing trends. As such, he submitted, they demonstrated a range of sentences which was considerably below those imposed by his Honour. 

33In relation to the sentence for count 1, the applicant submitted that of 353 sentences passed for that offence, 85 percent of offenders received total sentences of less than 36 months. The applicant submitted that this indicated that the sentence was outside the range for an offence in the midrange of objective criminality. The applicant submitted that this Court should infer latent error in accordance with R v House (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-5. 

34In relation to the sentence passed in respect of count 2, the applicant challenged his Honour's finding that the objective seriousness of this offence was ""slightly above the midrange"". The applicant submitted that his Honour's reasons did not demonstrate how his Honour arrived at such a conclusion. He submitted that the factors of organisation and planning specifically identified by his Honour were common to many drug offences and that there was nothing in the applicant's criminal history to justify such condign punishment. 

35The applicant also relied upon sentencing statistics to support that proposition. He identified a sample of 29 cases where the offence in count 2 had been found to have occurred and noted that in 83 percent of those cases, the non-parole periods or fixed terms had been 54 months of imprisonment or less. The applicant contrasted that with the 9 years non-parole period imposed on him. 

36The applicant relied upon the low level of purity in the methylamphetamine, which was the subject of the offence in count 2, i.e. 6 percent. By reference to a list of 9 cases decided between 2004 and 2009 in relation to this offence, the applicant noted that the level of purity of the drug concerned was much higher varying between 70 percent and 84.5 percent. The applicant submitted that in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, his Honour had failed to have regard to the extremely low purity of the drug supplied. 

37In further support of the argument concerning the sentence imposed in respect of count 2, the applicant referred the Court to sentencing statistics relating to the more serious offence of ""supplying a large commercial quantity of amphetamines"". By reference to a sample of 17 offenders sentenced in respect of that more serious offence, the applicant noted that 65 percent received sentences of 8 years or less. The applicant submitted that even allowing for a maximum 25 percent discount allowed for the pleas of guilty in those cases, the sentences were considerably lower than that imposed on him for a lesser offence. The applicant submitted that an examination of the sentencing statistics showed a similar disparity in relation to the non-parole period imposed for the more serious offence than that which was imposed on him. 

38There was no doubt, and the Crown properly conceded, that the sentence imposed by his Honour in respect of count 2 was towards the upper end of the range. The issue before the Court under these two grounds of appeal is whether the sentences in respect of both counts were outside the appropriate range so as to indicate error on the part of the sentencing judge. 

39Garling J identified the test in Fogg v R [2011] NSWCCA 1 at [59] - [60] as follows: 

""59 ... but for many offences culpability varies over so wide a range that the statistics are of limited utility for a particular case ... 

60 ... I accept that the statistics referred to demonstrate that the sentence in this case falls at the high end of the range of sentences imposed for the offence. But the question remains whether it falls within the range of the permissible exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion."" 

40As this Court has said on a number of occasions, undue weight should not be given to sentencing statistics. This is because of the ""vast range of factors relevant to sentencing for such an offence"" (RA Hulme J in Furia v R [2010] NSWCCA 326). The large number of variables is simply not reflected in mere statistical figures and percentages. 

41What is important when considering a particular sentence are the specific findings as to the objective seriousness of the offence and the culpability of the offender. These are the considerations which are determinative when assessing whether a particular sentence is manifestly excessive, rather than a comparison of the sentence with statistics ( Holloway v R [2011] NSWCCA 23 at [85]). The critical question is whether the sentence imposed was appropriate for the particular case ( R v F (2002) 132 A Crim R 308, adopted in Ayoub, Omran v R; El Masri, Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 196 at [58]). 

42The applicant appreciated the necessity of successfully challenging his Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence if he were to be successful in making out the first two grounds of appeal. It was for this reason that he challenged his Honour's ""absence of reasons"" for concluding that the objective seriousness of the offence was slightly above midrange for offences of this kind. 

43That criticism of his Honour's conclusion does not do justice to his Honour's reasoning. His Honour did not refer just to planning and organisation, but to the ""considerable degree"" of planning which the evidence clearly demonstrated. His Honour also stressed, albeit in somewhat colloquial terms, the position of the applicant in the supply hierarchy, i.e. he was in a superior position to Lowe and he was the ""go to"" man for the supply of commercial quantities of the drug. In his reasons, his Honour set out the detail of the planning and organisation required to commit the offences which was considerable (see [18]) hereof. 

44These were important matters and were properly taken into account by his Honour in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence and the applicant's culpability. The other matter to be kept in mind is that an assessment of this kind, i.e. the assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence, is not the sort of factual finding which is susceptible to detailed analysis. It inevitably involves a discretionary assessment by the sentencing judge. 

45This has been made clear in a number of decisions of this Court. In Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 35 the Court said at [33] - [34]: 

""33 This Court has emphasised that characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37], [46]. This Court is slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion, and the question must be whether the particular characterisation was open: Mulato v R at [37], [46]-[47]. 

34 The assessment of objective criminality when a standard non-parole period is provided should be approached intuitively based upon the general experience of the courts in sentencing for the particular offence at issue: R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; 150 A Crim R 575 at [13]; R v PGM [2008] NSWCCA 172 at [26]."" 

46I can find no error, patent or latent, in his Honour's approach or conclusions on the issue of the objective seriousness of the offence in count 2 and the applicant's culpability generally. 

47That being so, the applicant's success in making out these two grounds of appeal must depend upon the effect of the sentencing statistics being so great as to indicate error on the part of his Honour. In my opinion, the sentencing statistics do not have that effect. 

48The first problem with seeking to give sentencing statistics such weight is that the sentencing range in any case must extend to the maximum penalty ( Ma & Pham v R [2007] NSWCCA 240 at [91]). Sentencing statistics of their nature do not reflect the range which the legislature had intended by the maximum penalties ( Williams v R [2010] NSWCCA 15 at [23], Clinton v R [2009] NSWCCA 276 at [35]; England v R, Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [49]). In R (Cth) v Nguyen; R (Cth) v Nguyen [2010] NSWCCA 331 the statistics reflected a wide range of sentences (as occurred in this case) from 3 years to 12 years for 17 cases. This range, however, was significantly less than the maximum penalty of 25 years (the offence was conspiracy to traffic in a marketable quantity of drugs). As Simpson J noted at [71]: 

""Exposing those figures dramatically exposes one of the limitations on the use of statistics - they do not say anything about the vast range of relevant circumstances including the quantity of drug and the role of the offenders"". 

One could add to that observation that they say nothing about the vast range of subjective considerations which often affect the sentence ultimately passed. 

49In relation to the applicant's reliance upon sentencing statistics, the observations of this Court in R v George [2004] NSWCCA 247 at [48] remain valid: 

""48 ... It is necessary to restate that the practice, which appears to have developed in recent times, of approaching sentence appeals by a search for, and comparison with, sentences passed in other cases, is neither helpful nor justified by authority: see Regina v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368; Regina v Salameh NSWCCA 9 June 1994 and Regina v Trevenna [2004] NSWCCA 43 per Barr J at 98 - 101. At the most, other cases can do no more than become part of a range for sentencing ..."". 

50Moreover, the applicant's submissions are silent as to the effect of the standard non-parole period of 10 years applicable in respect of the offence in count 2 and the applicant's relatively modest subjective case. 

51Once it is accepted that his Honour was entitled to assess the objective seriousness of the offence, at or slightly above the mid-range for offences of this kind, s54B of the Act requires that the standard non-parole period be applied unless the Court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period which is either longer or shorter than that fixed for the offence. Howie J referred to this issue in Davis v R [2009] NSWCCA 279 at [21]: 

""One of the problems with statistics in cases where the standard non-parole period applies is that they tend to suggest that the standard non-parole period is being largely disregarded. If an offence is within midrange of seriousness and there is no reason to reduce the standard non-parole period, then the appropriate sentence is the standard non-parole period whatever the sentencing statistics might reveal."" 

52One of the considerations which may be taken into account by a sentencing judge in deciding whether or not to apply a standard non-parole period, is the strength of an offender's subjective case. Here the offender's subjective case was modest at best. The fact that he had no previous significant offences is of much less importance in a drug supply case ( R v Cheikh [2004] NSWCCA 448 at [50]). 

53His apparent good character is of even less weight here where the offence involved deliberate and planned criminality ( Van Can Ha v R [2008] NSWCCA 141 at [43)]. 

54In Ryan v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 267 the offender's good character was given little weight because the offences were not isolated incidents and the offender was living a double life - an appropriate description for the applicant here. Deterrence (in particular general deterrence) remains a significant consideration. 

55Not only was the applicant's apparent good character of little weight in this case but it was offset by the significant part which his Honour found that the applicant played in the supply process and his apparent absence of remorse. Even so his Honour took into account the absence of any significant criminal record and used it to conclude that there were reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. In the circumstances, this was a generous finding and was one which impacted on the total sentence imposed. 

56The strongest part of the applicant's subjective case related to the effect upon his children of his incarceration. That, of course, is a matter to which only limited weight could be given since it was never suggested that their disadvantage constituted ""highly exceptional circumstances"" as the authorities require: R v Edwards (1996) 60 A Crim R 510. 

57The applicant's submissions in respect of the sentencing statistics for the more serious offence of supplying a large commercial quantity do not take these two grounds of appeal any further. There is still the same lack of specificity in the statistics to which reference has already been made. The other difficulty is that most of the sentencing statistics referred to, relate to sentences imposed prior to the commencement of the standard non-parole period applicable to that offence (15 years). They therefore, have little utility in the present case. Moreover, the sample size is small. 

58Another problem with the submission is that the differentiating feature between an offence of supplying a large commercial quantity and supplying a commercial quantity, is the quantity of the drug involved. The individual circumstances of the latter offence may nevertheless cause it to be characterised as a more serious offence by comparison. The quantity of drug involved is not necessarily determinative of the level of criminality. The observation of the plurality in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25, (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [33] forcefully makes this point: 

""33 A serious fallacy in his Honour's reasoning is that it assumes that any case involving more than 250 grams of heroin is likely to be a worse case than any case involving only 250 grams or less. That cannot be so in the virtually absolute terms in which his Honour puts it. Little imagination is required to envisage a case involving a relatively small quantity of heroin, as being of very great seriousness, for example, supply to create an addiction in an infant. ..."" 

59Finally, the applicant in his submissions made no reference to the important consideration of deterrence, both specific and general, when sentencing for a drug supply offence. This Court has consistently given effect to the principle that ""those who involve themselves in trafficking of illicit drugs for profit can expect to receive substantial custodial sentences"" ( R v Mahmud [2010] NSWCCA 219 at [80]). That is a matter to which his Honour specifically referred and to which he was obliged to give effect. 

60In relation to the count 1 offence, an examination of the statistics does not support the applicant's argument that the sentence imposed was outside the range. Even ignoring the matters referred to above, and by reference only to sentencing statistics, the sentence imposed was within the range. A significant number of offenders were sentenced in total terms (and to non-parole periods) which were longer than the applicant's sentence. 

61In relation to the sentence for count 2, and also taking into account the element of accumulation with count 1, I am not satisfied that the sentence imposed was excessive or that the principles of totality and proportionality were offended. 

62It follows that the sentence passed, both in total and in relation to the individual offences, was well open to his Honour and albeit towards the top of the range of sentences for offences of this kind, was well within the range of the permissible exercise of his Honour's sentencing discretion. Error has not been demonstrated. Accordingly, grounds of appeal 1 and 2 have not been made out. 

(iii) The sentences imposed are such as to cause the applicant a justifiable sense of grievance due to the disparity between his sentence and the sentences imposed upon the co-offender, David Sydney Lowe. 

63The applicant submitted that he had a justifiable sense of grievance when he compared his sentence to that passed in respect of the offences committed by Lowe. Lowe pleaded guilty to the following offences. 

(i) Ongoing supply of methylamphetamine contrary to s25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act , maximum penalty imprisonment for 20 years. 

(ii) Supplying not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine contrary to s25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, maximum penalty imprisonment for 20 years with a non-parole period of 10 years. 

(iii) Supplying not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine contrary to s25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act , maximum penalty imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

(iv) Cultivating prohibited plant by enhanced indoor means for commercial purposes contrary to s23(1)A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act , maximum penalty imprisonment for 15 years. 

(v) Possess unauthorised firearm, contrary to s7(1) Firearms Act , maximum penalty imprisonment for 14 years with a standard non-parole period of 3 years. 

(vi) Possess unregistered firearm, contrary to s36 of the Firearms Act , maximum penalty imprisonment for 5 years. 

(vii) Possess prohibited weapon without permit, contrary to s7(1) Weapons Prohibition Act , maximum penalty imprisonment for 14 years with a standard non-parole period of 3 years. 

A further eight firearm/ammunition offences were taken into account on a Form 1 when sentencing for offence number (vii) and two further offences on a Form 1 were taken into account when he was sentenced in respect of offence number (i). 

64The complaint by the applicant is that Lowe was sentenced to the same effective sentence as he was but that the offences for which he was sentenced were significantly greater in number and seriousness. In making that submission the applicant accepted that because he had entered early pleas of guilty to those offences, Lowe received an across-the-board discount of 25 percent in respect of all of those offences. Nevertheless, the applicant submits that the disparity between his sentences and those imposed on Lowe was such as to engender in him a justified sense of grievance. 

65The applicant relied upon the well-known decisions of Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 194, 623-4 and Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295. The applicant submitted that the Court should intervene because the disparity here was such as to engender in him a justifiable sense of grievance and the appearance of injustice in the mind of an objective bystander. The applicant submitted that both he and Lowe were co-offenders but that Lowe had the burden of vastly more objective criminality reflected in the greater number of separate offences. 

66His Honour passed sentence in respect of Lowe on 23 October 2009. Accordingly, his Honour would have been well aware of those sentences when he came to sentence the applicant on 6 November 2009. As a start point, it is important to directly compare the sentence passed by his Honour in respect of the one offence which the applicant and Lowe had in common, i.e. supplying a prohibited drug being not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine contrary to s25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years with a balance of term of 4 years. Lowe was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years with a balance of term of 4 years. In sentencing Lowe, his Honour made similar findings about his criminality as he did about the applicant, although he did note that Lowe had a slightly lower position in the drug supply organisation. Lowe was 37 years old at the time when he was sentenced. 

67When one compares the two sentences for the only common offence, and when one takes into account that Lowe's sentence included a 25 percent discount, there is no basis for any complaint by the applicant. This is because the undiscounted sentence for Lowe was 16 years with a non-parole period of 10 years and 8 months. The real complaint by the applicant is that Lowe's total sentence for all of his offences was equal to the overall sentence imposed on him. 

68This is not a legitimate basis for any justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant. Such a complaint fails to have due regard to the effect of other sentencing principles, such as totality and proportionality which inevitably come into play in a sentencing exercise such as that with which his Honour was engaged when sentencing Lowe. Were his Honour to impose appropriate sentences for each offence on an accumulated basis without some level of concurrency, the end result would be crushing for an offender in Lowe's position. In such situations it is necessary that the total sentence passed include within it a balance between the need to pass sentences appropriate to the level of criminality involved and restraint to avoid the imposition of a crushing sentence. It is that balancing process which provides the rationale for the principles of totality and proportionality in sentencing. 

69Moreover, it is not inevitable that a co-offender facing sentence on fewer charges will have a legitimate sense of grievance merely because his co-offender is sentenced on additional charges to a lesser term (or to a term which is not significantly longer). Each offender must be sentenced in accordance with their own overall criminality ( Baleiovalau v R [2009] NSWCCA 153, Bell v R; Jelisovac v R [2009] NSWCCA 206). 

70It should be kept in mind that a ground of appeal asserting disparity is concerned with markedly and unjustifiably different sentences imposed on different offenders. In England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL and Fullerton J agreeing) said at [61] - [63]: 

""61 ... A ground asserting disparity is concerned with such markedly and unjustifiably different sentences imposed on co-offenders that they give rise to a genuine feeling on the part of an impartial observer that justice has not been achieved because one offender has been unfairly treated having regard to the sentence passed upon the co-offender. Yet frequently, as in this case, the Court is asked to trawl through the sentencing remarks and the facts and circumstances of the two offenders in detail in order to dissect and weigh every aspect of their competing objective and subjective facts to see whether some variation, however minor, should be made to the sentence of the person who, it is asserted, has a grievance. 

62 It should be borne in mind that the High Court's decisions on this area of appellate intervention speak of ""gross"", ""marked"", ""glaring"" or ""manifest"" disparity. These terms are used throughout the judgments in Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606. Another way of considering the issue is to ask whether the two sentences give rise to an appearance that justice has not been done: per Gibbs CJ at 610 and Dawson J at 623. It should be recalled that the sentences being compared in that case were, on the one hand, a sentence of 6 years imprisonment and, on the other, a non-custodial sentence. 

63 No different approach was taken in Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295. Dawson and Gaudron JJ in their joint judgment stated at 301: 

""However, the parity principle, as identified and expounded in Lowe v The Queen recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to ""a justifiable sense of grievance"". If there is, the sentence in issue should be reduced, notwithstanding that it is otherwise appropriate ""and within the permissible range of sentencing options."" 

Gummow J stated at 323: 

""The principle for which Lowe is authority appears to be that the Court of Criminal Appeal intervenes where the difference between the two sentences is manifestly excessive and such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance by giving the appearance, in the mind of an objective observer, that justice has not been done."" 

H is Honour then quoted with approval from a decision of Callaway JA in R v Taudevin [1996] 2 VR 402 in which it was pointed out that the important words in considering the issue of disparity were ""manifestly"" ""justifiable"" and ""objective"" and emphasising that the difference between the sentences must be ""clearly excessive""."" 

71Once one takes into account that all the sentences passed on Lowe included a 25 percent discount, the necessary level of disparity, i.e. one which is ""gross"", ""marked"", ""glaring"" or ""manifest"" does not exist. 

72The parity principle of its very nature only applies if all other things are equal: R v Martin [2005] NSWCCA 381 at [11]. That is not the case here. Lowe was charged with a significantly larger array of offences. This required an adjustment by way of accumulation and concurrency between those sentences so as to meet the principles of totality and proportionality. Lowe also had the advantage, which the applicant did not, of a 25 percent discount in respect of all the offences. 

73The test for whether the necessary disparity exists, so as to justify the intervention of this Court, is an objective one. In R v Wei Pan [2005] NSWCCA 114, Johnson J (with whom Giles JA and Hoeben J agreed) said: 

""34 The elimination of unjustifiable discrepancy in sentencing is a matter of abiding importance to the administration of justice and to the community - the issue is whether the particular sense of grievance or injustice is a legitimate one: Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 611 per Mason J. The test for determining the existence of a sense of grievance is objective not subjective. What has to be demonstrated by the person complaining on the grounds of parity is not that he feels aggrieved, but that a reasonable mind looking overall at what has happened would see that the offender's grievance is justified: R v Doggett (Court of Criminal Appeal, 24 March 1996, unreported) per Sully J; R v Ilbay [2000] NSWCCA 251 at paragraph 6."" 

That statement of the parity principle has been applied in a number of subsequent decisions: Lewins v R [2007] NSWCCA 189 at [7], Nguyen v R [2008] NSWCCA 308 at [37] and Gurney v R ; Willetts v R [2011] NSWCCA 48 at [83]. 

74Applying those principles I have concluded that no reasonable person looking at the circumstances under which each offender's overall sentences were determined would regard the applicant's grievance as justified. The applicant (who did not plead guilty) is now seeking a benefit for himself to which he was not entitled as a result of the benefit properly afforded to Lowe for his pleas of guilty. The applicant's submission not only ignores this fact but also ignores the inevitable adjustment which had to take place when Lowe was sentenced to have regard to the principles of totality and proportionality. It follows that ground of appeal (iii) has not been made out. 

75The orders which I propose are as follows: 

(1) Leave to appeal is granted. 
(2) The appeal is dismissed. 

76GARLING J: I agree with Hoeben J.

2709840,Nominal Defendant v Hawkins [2011] NSWCA 93,"HEADNOTE 
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment] 
Facts 
At about 1.00 am on 20 January 2006, the respondent (Mr Hawkins) was cycling on the footpath along the Pacific Highway at St Leonards, having moved from the road to avoid the intimidating driving and boisterous passenger conduct of an approaching vehicle. The vehicle followed closely behind him, its occupants continuing to yell, beep and play loud music. Mr Hawkins was then struck by an object, and the vehicle accelerated away. Before he could regain control of his bicycle, Mr Hawkins collided with a piece of metal lying half way across the footpath which blew out his front tyre, causing him to strike a telegraph pole and sustain injuries. 
The car and its driver could not be identified. Liability of the Nominal Defendant depends upon whether the injury to Mr Hawkins was caused by the fault of the driver of the motor vehicle in the use or operation of the vehicle, within the meaning of s.3(1) of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 ( MAC Act): 
Injury: 
(a) Means personal or bodily injury caused by the fault of the owner or driver of a motor vehicle in the use or operation of the vehicle, if and only if, the injury is a result of and is caused during: 
(i) The driving of the vehicle, 
... 
At first instance, the primary judge found on the balance of probabilities that the object was thrown from the vehicle, that the driver drove so as to facilitate the throwing, that this was foreseeably likely to injure Mr Hawkins, and that Mr Hawkins' injury was caused by the fault of the driver. 
As to costs, the primary judge held that despite an offer of compromise from Mr Hawkins served on the Nominal Defendant on 8 January 2010, which provided for judgment in Mr Hawkins favour for $310,000 and which was bettered by over $100,000 in the event, Mr Hawkins was not entitled to indemnity costs from that date. At the time the Nominal Defendant refused Mr Hawkins' offer, it did not know and could not have known of important evidence yet to emerge. The Nominal Defendant therefore acted reasonably in refusing the offer, and indemnity costs were not warranted. 
Issues 
(1) Were the findings of fact made by the primary judge open to him on the evidence? 
(2) Did the primary judge err in finding that the injury to the appellant fell within the relevant provisions of the MAC Act? 
(3) Did the primary judge err in not awarding indemnity costs to Mr Hawkins from 8 January 2010? 
Held (Dismissing the appeal with costs, dismissing the application for leave to cross-appeal with costs incremental to the costs of the appeal): 
In relation to (1) - Facts: 
(Per Hodgson JA, Beazley JA and Sackville AJA agreeing) 
It was an available inference that the driver drove in such a way in order to facilitate something being thrown at Mr Hawkins, being an act that the driver was aware was to be intentionally committed by a passenger. 
In relation to (2) - Statutory Interpretation: 
(Per Hodgson JA, Beazley JA and Sackville AJA agreeing) 
There was fault in the use or operation of the vehicle, specifically in the manner of driving so as to harass Mr Hawkins. The throwing of the object was part of and incidental to this harassing driving. The injury was therefore a result of the driving of the vehicle within the definition of injury in s.3(1) of the MAC Act. 
(Per Sackville AJA) 
In the alternative, the actions of the driver of the vehicle and the passengers may be considered concurrent causes of Mr Hawkins' being struck, which would also bring Mr Hawkins' injuries with definition of the MAC Act. 
As to (3) - Costs: 
(Per Hodgson JA, Beazley JA and Sackville AJA agreeing) 
The decision of the primary judge does not display such an error in principle, nor is it otherwise outside the range of reasonable discretionary decision making, to justify appellate intervention. 


			Judgment 

1BEAZLEY JA : I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgments of Hodgson JA and Sackville AJA. I agree with the reasons of Hodgson JA and the additional reasons for dismissing the appeal given by Sackville AJA. 

2I also agree with their Honours' respective reasons that the cross-appeal should also be dismissed. Like their Honours, I doubt that I would have exercised the discretion in the same manner as did the trial judge. Nonetheless, having reviewed the authorities, I am satisfied that there was no appealable error in the trial judge's decision in respect of costs. 

3HODGSON JA: The respondent Mr Hawkins brought proceedings in the District Court against the Nominal Defendant claiming damages for an injury he suffered as a result of a crash on his bicycle. 

4On 6 May 2010, Armitage DCJ gave judgment for Mr Hawkins in the sum of $412,460. 

5On 7 May 2010, the primary judge refused an application by Mr Hawkins that his costs be paid on an indemnity basis from 8 January 2010 and (it would seem) made an order for costs in Mr Hawkins' favour on the ordinary basis. 

6The Nominal Defendant appeals from the judgment against it. Mr Hawkins seeks leave to appeal against the refusal of indemnity costs. The application for leave to cross-appeal has been heard on the basis that, if leave is granted, the cross-appeal will be determined without further argument. 

Outline of facts 

7Mr Hawkins' injury was caused by an accident that occurred at about 1.00am on 20 January 2006, when Mr Hawkins was riding his bicycle northwards along Pacific Highway. 

8The primary judge found the following facts, which are not in dispute on appeal: 

(1) As Mr Hawkins approached the intersection of Pacific Highway and Oxley Street, he heard continual erratic beeping from a car horn. 

(2) He looked over his right shoulder and saw the headlights of a car, which was near the intersection of the highway with Willoughby Road. 

(3) He continued to ride downhill, and after he crossed the intersection at Oxley Street and was about half way to the Albany Street intersection, he noticed that the beeping continued and that he could hear loud music. 

(4) As he got to the Albany Street intersection, he could hear not only the beeping and loud music but also people yelling and carrying on, being a commotion coming from the car. 

(5) He looked back and saw the headlights of the car just before the intersection in the inside lane. 

(6) He decided to get off the road because he felt intimidated and he thought he should give them ""their space"" because of the way they were acting, and he cycled up onto the footpath. 

(7) He crossed the next intersection, that is Christie Street, but having just got back onto the footpath after crossing Christie Street, he noticed that the noise from the vehicle seemed to be right behind him. 

(8) He was then struck by an object on his right shoulder, causing him to veer to the left and then to the right. 

(9) He noticed the vehicle accelerating from beside where he was, and moving out from the kerb lane to straddle the kerb lane and the next lane, with the loud music, the beeping and the yelling from the people inside continuing. 

(10) Before he could regain control of the bicycle he saw a piece of metal lying across half of the footpath. 

(11) Had he been in control of his bicycle, he would have been able to avoid this piece of metal, but since he was not he collided with the piece of metal causing his front tyre to blow out. 

(12) He continued out of control on his bicycle and struck a telegraph pole thus sustaining his injuries. 

Statutory provisions 

9Liability of the Nominal Defendant depends on the application of Part 2.4 of Chapter 2 of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 ( MAC Act), as in force at 20 January 2006. 

10That Part applied ""to and in respect of a motor accident occurring before or after the commencement of this Act"" (s 31). Section 34 provided for claims against the Nominal Defendant where injury was caused by the fault of a driver of a motor vehicle in the use or operation of the vehicle on a road in New South Wales, if the identity of the vehicle could not after due enquiry be established. 

11There were relevant definitions in s 3 of ""injury"" and ""motor accident"": 

injury : 

(a) means personal or bodily injury caused by the fault of the owner or driver of a motor vehicle in the use or operation of the vehicle if, and only if, the injury is a result of and is caused during: 

(i) the driving of the vehicle, or 

(ii) a collision, or action taken to avoid a collision, with the vehicle, or 

(iii) the vehicle's running out of control, or 

(iv) such use or operation by a defect in the vehicle, and 

(b) includes: 

(i) pre-natal injury, and 

(ii) psychological or psychiatric injury, and 

(iii) damage to artificial members, eyes or teeth, crutches or other aids or spectacle glasses, 

and injured person means a person who suffers such an injury. 

 
motor accident means an accident or incident caused by the fault of the owner or driver of a motor vehicle in the use or operation of the vehicle which causes the death of or injury to a person. 

Decision of primary judge 

12The primary judge found that it was more probable than not that the object that hit Mr Hawkins was thrown from the motor vehicle, having regard to the circumstance that the vehicle was then beside him, and there were no other cars or persons in the vicinity. 

13The primary judge also found that the driver of the vehicle drove in such proximity to Mr Hawkins and/or at such a speed so as to permit or facilitate an occupier of the vehicle to throw an object, when in the circumstances it was likely (foreseeably likely to the driver) to injure Mr Hawkins. In so finding, the primary judge relied on the following circumstances: 

(1) It must have been the driver who was activating the horn. 

(2) This was to intimidate Mr Hawkins or to drive irresponsibly. 

(3) To have positioned the vehicle as he did, the driver must have driven well below the applicable speed limit. 

(4) The vehicle remained at approximately the same position relative to Mr Hawkins until the object was thrown. 

(5) The vehicle then accelerated away, straddling the two lanes. 

The primary judge accepted that Mr Hawkins' injury was caused by the fault of the driver, within the definition of ""injury"" in the MAC Act, and was a result of and caused during the driving of the vehicle, within that definition. 

Issues on appeal 

14The Nominal Defendant relies on the following grounds of appeal: 

1 The Primary Judge erred in inferring (although not expressly) that the occupant of the unidentified vehicle who threw an object at the Respondent, premeditated that act, rather than the act being spontaneous. 

2 The Primary Judge erred in failing to take into account when considering inferences to be drawn from the evidence, that there was nothing in the conduct of occupants of the unidentified vehicle prior to an object being thrown at the Respondent, to indicate that it was, or should have been, apparent to the driver, that the behaviour of one occupant would progress from creating noise or disturbance, to the criminal act of throwing an object at the Respondent. 

3 The Primary Judge erred in inferring that the driver of the unidentified vehicle was aware before the fact, that an occupant of the vehicle intended to throw an object at the Respondent (if there was any such premeditated intention). 

4 The Primary Judge erred in inferring that the driver of the unidentified vehicle deliberately drove the vehicle close to the Respondent, to facilitate the throwing of an object at the Respondent by an occupant of the vehicle. 

5 The Primary Judge erred in inferring that the most probable explanation for the manner in which the driver drove the unidentified vehicle, was to facilitate an occupant of the vehicle throwing an object at the Respondent, when there were other, at least equally probable, explanations. 

6 The Primary Judge failed to consider other, equally probable, inferences as to the state of mind of the driver of the unidentified vehicle, as to which there was no direct evidence whatsoever. 

7 The Primary Judge erred in finding that the circumstances of the Respondent's injury, satisfied the definition of the word "" injury "" in s.3 of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 [ MACA ], as at the date of the subject accident on 20 January 2006. 

8 The Primary Judge erred in finding that the Respondent's injury was "" caused by the fault "" of the driver of the unidentified vehicle. 

9 The Primary Judge erred in finding that the Respondent's injury occurred "" in the use or operation of the vehicle "". 

10 The Primary Judge erred in finding that the Respondent's injury was "" a result of and ... caused during ... the driving of "" the unidentified vehicle. 

11 The Primary Judge erred in finding that the conduct of the driver of the unidentified vehicle was the ""proximate"" or ""immediate"" cause of the Respondent's injury. 

12 The Primary Judge erred in finding that the conduct of the driver of the unidentified vehicle caused the Respondent's injury, having regard to the principles set out in s.5D of the Civil Liability Act 2002 . 

15Mr Hawkins seeks to rely on the following grounds of cross-appeal: 

(1) The primary judge erred in the principles applied, in particular in not requiring exceptional circumstances to deny indemnity costs. 

(2) The refusal to award indemnity costs was outside the range of reasonable discretionary judgment. 

16I will deal in turn with the following issues: 

(1) Findings of primary fact (appeal grounds 1 to 6). 

(2) Application of the MAC Act (appeal grounds 7 to 12). 

(3) Indemnity costs (cross-appeal). 

Findings of primary fact 

17Mr Rewell SC for the Nominal Defendant accepted that it was open to the primary judge to infer that the driver of the unidentified vehicle drove as he did (beeping the horn, moving alongside Mr Hawkins, and then accelerating away) so as to irritate Mr Hawkins and to facilitate the passengers irritating him. However, Mr Rewell submitted it was not open to the primary judge to infer, on the balance of probabilities, that throwing an object at Mr Hawkins was a premeditated act by the perpetrator; that the driver was aware of this intention; that the driver facilitated that premeditated act; and/or that it was foreseeable by the driver that a person would throw the object from the car. 

18Mr Rewell submitted that throwing an object at Mr Hawkins was a criminal act, of a very different nature from the rowdy behaviour of which the driver must have been aware; and it could not be said that, on the balance of probabilities, the driver was aware that a passenger would do this or even foresaw this as a risk caused by the way he drove the car. Mr Rewell pointed to evidence from Mr Hawkins that there was nothing about the car or its behaviour or anything else that made him think that something would be thrown at him, or that caused him to lose control of his bicycle. Mr Hawkins also said that having something thrown at him came as a surprise, and that it was only on being struck by the object that he sensed some loss of control. 

19I am not satisfied that the primary judge was in error in drawing the inference that the driver drove so as to permit or to facilitate the throwing of an object at Mr Hawkins. In my opinion, it was clearly open to infer that the driver drove as he did to harass and/or intimidate Mr Hawkins through the close proximity of the car, the beeping of the horn and the yelling of the occupants. In circumstances where the driver drove the car closely alongside Mr Hawkins, adjusted its speed so as to approximate his and, immediately after the object was thrown, accelerated away, moving out of the lane next to the kerb. In these circumstances, it was in my opinion an available inference that the driver drove in that way in order to facilitate something being thrown at Mr Hawkins, this being an act that the driver was aware was intentionally committed by a passenger. 

20Accordingly, I would not uphold grounds 1 to 6. 

Application of the MAC Act 

21Mr Rewell submitted that, even if the primary judge's findings of fact were not disturbed, so that there was some fault of the driver that in some sense was causative of Mr Hawkins' injuries, the case would not fall within the relevant provisions of the MAC Act so as to make the Nominal Defendant liable for the fault of the driver of this unidentified vehicle. 

22Mr Rewell referred to Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd v GSF Australia Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 26; (2005) 221 CLR 568, and submitted that the High Court held in that case that the definition of ""injury"" in the MAC Act required the Court to look to the immediate or proximate cause of the injury; and in this case, that was the (non-driving) conduct of an occupant of the vehicle throwing the object. 

23Mr Rewell also referred to cases from other states, namely Ross v Transport Accident Commission [2000] VSC 112, Mani v Nominal Defendant [2002] QSC 152 and Coley v Nominal Defendant [2003] QCA 181. 

24Mr Roberts SC for Mr Hawkins submitted that Allianz did not require that there be only one proximate cause, and that the driving in this case played such a role in the causation of the injury that it was an immediate or proximate cause, as those words were used in Allianz . He further submitted that the throwing of the object was so connected with the manner of driving in order to harass and intimidate Mr Hawkins that it would be unrealistic to treat the throwing as an independent act, distinct from the harassing and intimidating driving. 

25In my opinion Allianz does require a strict reading of expressions such as ""caused by"" and ""is a result of"" in the relevant definition of ""injury"". 

26At [102] in that case, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ say this: 

102 The use in the definition of the emphatic and intensive phrase ""if, and only if"" directs attention to notions of predominance and immediacy rather than to more removed circumstances. The definition of ""injury"" looks, for the CTP insurance system, to notions of proximate cause found in insurance law (82). That construction is consistent with the subject, scope and purpose of the 1995 Act. 

27Footnote (82) contains the following references: 

Australian Casualty Co Ltd v Federico (1986) 160 CLR 513 at 534-535; March v Stramare (E & M H) Pty Ltd (1991) 171 CLR 506 at 511. 

28At [131] Callinan J says this (omitting footnotes): 

131 It is significant that after the words ""is a result of"" no expression such as ""or is contributed to by"" is used. The indefinite article ""a"" does not imply in my opinion that one of multiple causes may suffice, even if ""cause"" and ""result"" were taken as synonyms in the definition. Each of the separate expressions ""is a result of"" and ""is caused during"" has to be given its full and presumably different meaning. They have a cumulative reinforcing effect. Each has its own separate and important work to do. The words ""if, and only if,"" refer both to result and the event or, to put it another way, what is happening in relation to the vehicle when the injury is caused. It follows that subpara (iv) of the definition should be read in this way: ""'injury': (a) means personal ... injury caused by the fault of the owner or driver of a motor vehicle in the use or operation of the vehicle if, and only if, the injury is caused during such use or operation of the vehicle of the kind referred, or by a defect in it"". ""Such"" is the key word. It means ""[o]f the character, degree, or extent described, referred to, or implied in what has been said."" Furthermore, the expression ""use or operation"" as used in the introductory words of the definition have separate and sufficient work to do. That work is to identify the event in the course of which there is fault, the ""fault"" earlier referred to. The use or operation of the vehicle earlier described and referred to in subpara (iv) is the use or operation of the vehicle in the manner most recently and proximately referred to in the definition, that is, in motion, as set out in subparas (i), (ii) and (iii). 

29And at [53] McHugh J says this: 

53 The above examination of the subject, scope and purpose of the Act suggests three matters that are relevant in the construction of Pt 6 of the Act. First, the Act does not provide a universal compensation scheme for all injuries sustained in connection with a motor vehicle. Second, cost-saving and the need to keep the scheme affordable are significant objects of the Act. Third, the Act has tightened the definition of injury by reference to its cause. These three matters indicate that, in the inquiry into the question of causality, an approach that limits the scope of the Act is preferable to one that would extend its application. This in turn suggests that a close causal connection is required for the injury to satisfy the requirement the injury be ""caused ... by a defect in the vehicle"". 

30In my opinion, it must follow that, for example, an injury caused by a drive-by shooting would not fall within the definition. If a driver drives past a house, with a passenger carrying a gun, and having the intention that the passenger shoot at the house, and if the passenger does so and injures a person in the house, this would not be an injury within the definition, for which the Nominal Defendant would be liable. 

31Clearly, although the shooting and consequent injury can be called an incident (within the definition of ""motor accident""), it would not be considered a motor accident within the ordinary meaning of that expression. That would not matter, if the incident and the injury fell within the statutory definitions of ""motor accident"" and ""injury"" respectively; but particularly having regard to the authority of Allianz , in my opinion they do not. Injury may be considered as having been contributed to by ""the fault"" of the driver, this fault consisting in driving the passenger to the location knowing that the passenger was to shoot at the house, and (with this knowledge) in driving the car in such a way (say, driving slowly and steadily past the house) that the passenger could fire effectively. However, the approach in Allianz would suggest that the injury was not relevantly ""caused"" by that fault, that the fault was not relevantly ""in the use or operation"" of the vehicle, and that the injury was not ""a result of the driving"" of the vehicle. 

32One way of putting this is that the fault of the driver would lie in his/her being an accessory to the shooting, rather than in any driving-related fault. The driving would not be in any way faulty as driving , but would merely be the means by which the passenger was put in a position to shoot. Accordingly, the driver's fault should not be considered as being ""in the use or operation of the vehicle"", or (if and to the extent that it was so considered) as causing the injury; and the driving of the vehicle (and any fault involved) would not play a sufficient role in causing the injury to justify a finding that the injury was a result of the driving of the vehicle. 

33Having regard to what was said in the passage of Federico , to which the joint judgment in Allianz referred, I do not understand their Honours in that case to be altogether ruling out the possibility that there may be more than one cause which is sufficiently predominant or immediate or proximate to satisfy the requirements of causation in the definition of ""injury"" in the MAC Act. However, clearly in my opinion they are saying that the fault in the use or operation of the vehicle, and the driving of the vehicle (in those cases where par (a) of the definition of ""injury"" is in question), must have a very substantial causative role; and that in the former case its character as fault must be related to the actual use and operation of the vehicle as such, rather than merely as fault (with the aid of the motor vehicle) in facilitating a dangerous or criminal act by a passenger unconnected with the actual driving or operation of the vehicle. 

34At the other extreme, to manoeuvre a motor vehicle, with the intention that the actual manoeuvring of the vehicle (say) by cutting in on a cyclist or unreasonably crowding a cyclist so as to harass and/or intimidate the cyclist and thereby to cause the cyclist to crash and be injured, would in my opinion clearly be fault in the use and operation of the vehicle causing the injury, and the injury would be a result of the driving of the vehicle, within the meaning of the definition of ""injury"" in the MAC Act. 

35Before considering the facts of this case, it may be convenient to consider this approach in relation to the facts of the interstate cases referred to by Mr Rewell. 

36In Ross , a car that had been travelling behind the plaintiff's car drew alongside it, and a person shot the plaintiff a number of times from that car. The plaintiff claimed he had been injured in a ""transport accident"" as defined in s 3 of the Transport Accident Act 1986 (Vic), that is (relevantly) ""an incident directly caused by the driving of the motorcar"". Beach J in the Supreme Court of Victoria found against the plaintiff, holding that the shooting of the plaintiff was not directly caused by the driving of a motorcar, but by the action of the person in the possession of the gun pointing the gun at the plaintiff and pulling the trigger. 

37In my opinion, a similar result would follow on those facts under the MAC Act. There was no relevant driving fault sufficiently connected with the injury to justify a finding that the injury was within the definition of ""injury"" in the MAC Act. 

38In Mani , the plaintiff was driving a van along a road when the driver of, or a passenger in, an unidentified motor vehicle travelling in the opposite direction threw a rock at the van, smashing the windscreen and injuring the plaintiff. It was not alleged that anything in the manner of the driving of the unidentified vehicle contributed to the injury. The plaintiff claimed pursuant to the Motor Accident Insurance Act 1994 (Qld) which relevantly applied ""to personal injury caused by, through or in connection with a motor vehicle if, and only if, the injury ... is a result of ... the driving of the motor vehicle ... and ... is caused, wholly or partly, by a wrongful act or omission in respect of the motor vehicle by a person other than the injured person"". Helman J in the Supreme Court of Queensland held that the throwing of the rock was not a result of the driving of the unidentified vehicle, which was merely the occasion for the throwing, and that the two activities were discrete, though contemporaneous, whether or not done by the same person. 

39In my opinion, a similar result would follow under the MAC Act, for the same reasons I have given in relation to Ross . 

40In Coley the plaintiff alleged he was driving along a road when the driver or a passenger in an unidentified vehicle threw a Molotov cocktail into his vehicle, setting it alight and thereby injuring him. The District Court judge ordered that relevant parts of the plaintiff's pleading be struck out, and the Queensland Court of Appeal, by a majority, allowed the plaintiff's appeal. The majority (McMurdo P and Jerrard JA) distinguished Mani on the basis that the pleading of the plaintiff in Coley alleged that the unsafe manner of driving of the unidentified vehicle (drawing alongside the plaintiff's vehicle when it was unsafe to do so, and veering towards the plaintiff's vehicle when it was unsafe to do so) enabled the Molotov cocktail to be thrown into the plaintiff's vehicle. The dissentient (Mackenzie J) considered that Mani was not distinguishable and that the injury was not relevantly a result of the driving of the motor vehicle. 

41The decision of the majority in Coley was on the basis that it was not impossible that the plaintiff could make out a claim; and in my opinion, it is significant that the plaintiff in that case alleged fault in the manner of the driving itself, not merely that there was driving so as to enable the Molotov cocktail to be thrown. However, although there was driving fault alleged in Coley , I am doubtful whether it would be sufficiently connected with what actually caused the injury, the throwing of the Molotov cocktail, to satisfy the definition of ""injury"" in the MAC Act. 

42Returning to the present case, there is driving fault, that is, intentionally driving in such a way as to harass Mr Hawkins, with the use of the horn and placing and slowing the vehicle so that Mr Hawkins could be harassed by the proximity of the vehicle and the yelling from the people inside. In my opinion, the question arises whether the throwing of the object can properly be considered as a part of or incidental to the harassing driving of the vehicle, or whether it is properly considered as an occurrence which is in a substantial way distinct from or independent of this harassing driving of the vehicle. If the former, I think the definition of ""injury"" in the MAC Act would be engaged; if the latter, I think it would not be. 

43With some hesitation, I think the former is the preferable view. It is true that the throwing of the object was a substantial escalation of the harassing conduct. It is also true that on Mr Hawkins' evidence, the harassment had not previously prejudiced his control of his bicycle, whereas being hit by the object did so. Nevertheless, given the finding as to the driver's knowledge, I think that the throwing of the object was not only contemporaneous with but part of and incidental to the harassing manner in which the vehicle was driven. 

44In the words of the definition, there was fault in the use or operation of the vehicle, which was not merely a fault in putting the thrower of the object in a position to do so: there was fault in the manner of driving so as to harass the plaintiff, and the throwing of the object was part of and incidental to this harassing driving. In those circumstances, I think it can be said that Mr Hawkins' injury was caused by the driver's fault in the use or operation of the vehicle, and was a result of the driving of the vehicle, within the definition of ""injury"" in the MAC Act. 

45No substantial submission was advanced in support of ground 12. In my opinion, it having been found that the definition of ""injury"" in the MAC Act was satisfied, there is no substantial question as to whether s 5D of the Civil Liability Act 2002 was also satisfied. 

46Accordingly, I would not uphold grounds 7 to 12, and I would dismiss the appeal. 

Indemnity costs 

47On 8 January 2010 Mr Hawkins served on the Nominal Defendant an offer of compromise, providing for judgment in his favour for $310,000 plus legal costs as agreed or assessed. Having bettered that sum by over $100,000, Mr Hawkins sought an order for indemnity costs as from 8 January 2010. 

48This required consideration of Uniform Civil Procedure Rules r 42.14(2): 

42.14 Where offer not accepted and judgment no less favourable to plaintiff 

... 

(2) Unless the court orders otherwise, the plaintiff is entitled to an order against the defendant for the plaintiff's costs in respect of the claim: 

(a) assessed on the ordinary basis up to the time from which those costs are to be assessed on an indemnity basis under paragraph (b), and 

(b) assessed on an indemnity basis: 

(i) if the offer was made before the first day of the trial, as from the beginning of the day following the day on which the offer was made, and 

(ii) if the offer was made on or after the first day of the trial, as from 11 am on the day following the day on which the offer was made. 

49The primary judge referred to the difference between that rule and a previous rule which was to the effect that indemnity costs should be ordered ""unless the court in an exceptional case and for the avoidance of substantial injustice otherwise orders"". 

50The primary judge referred to South Eastern Sydney Area Health Service v King [2006] NSWCA 2, in which Hunt AJA (with whom Mason P and McColl JA agreed), after referring to Maitland Hospital v Fisher [No 2] (1992) 27 NSWLR 721 and Hillier v Sheather (1995) 36 NSWLR 414, said this: 

[85] In the present case, the respondent has submitted that the judge had wrongly considered that a belief that the appellants had reasonable grounds for defending the claim constituted exceptional circumstances disentitling her from an order for indemnity costs. However, the fact that the plaintiff's case had changed significantly between the date of the plaintiff's offer and the trial in which the judgment obtained is higher than the amount of the offer does provide a sufficient basis for an order denying the plaintiff's entitlement to indemnity costs: Maitland Hospital v Fisher [No 2] (at 725). The very nature of the situation itself demonstrates that it would be unfair to a defendant to make an order for indemnity costs when the evidence at the trial is different from that known to the defendant at the time of the offer. Whether or not this is an ""exceptional"" situation does not matter. 

51The court did order otherwise in this case, so that the plaintiff did not get costs on an indemnity basis. 

52The primary judge accepted a submission from the Nominal Defendant that at the time it refused Mr Hawkins' offer, it did not know and could not have known of important evidence in this case. It thus could not reasonably have anticipated Mr Hawkins' success on this basis; and acted reasonably in refusing the offer. 

53Mr Roberts for Mr Hawkins submitted that the rule in its present form was relevantly in the same terms as the rule that existed prior to 1 January 1998: Morgan v Johnson (1998) 44 NSWLR 578 at 581 - 582. He referred to Caine v Lumley General Insurance Limited (No 2) [2008] NSWCA 109 at [35] where McColl JA (with whom Mason P and McClellan CJ at CL agreed) said this: 

[35] The onus is on the respondent to demonstrate why the Court should not order the respondent to pay the appellants' costs on an indemnity basis. In particular, the respondent must establish that it had given serious thought to the risks involved in not accepting the offers, had assessed the appellants' case properly and in the context of the relevant rules and the achievement of their purpose as outlined in Morgan . Generally, exceptional circumstances are required to justify such an order denying the appellants' entitlement: South Eastern Sydney Area Health Service v King [2006] NSWCA 2 (at [83]) per Hunt AJA (Mason P and McColl JA agreeing). 

54Mr Roberts submitted there were no exceptional circumstances in this case and no justification for ordering otherwise. 

55For the Nominal Defendant, it was submitted that the determination of the question of indemnity costs was a discretionary evaluative decision requiring consideration of facts and circumstances specific to the case: Baulderstone Hornibrook Engineering Pty Ltd v Gordian Runoff Ltd (No 2) [2009] NSWCA 12 at [19]. Having regard to the material that was available to the Nominal Defendant and to the material that was not available to it, the case on which Mr Hawkins succeeded at trial was very different from that which the Nominal Defendant could have appreciated. It was reasonable for the Nominal Defendant to have refused the offer, and there was no error in the exercise of discretion justifying appellate intervention. 

56I accept the submission for Mr Hawkins that, despite the change of wording in the rule, it is not enough to justify ordering otherwise for a person who refused an offer of compromise to show that he/she acted reasonably in doing so. Generally, exceptional circumstances are required. 

57I note that in the Uniting Church v Takacs (No 2) [2008] NSWCA 172, Basten JA (in dissent) suggested at [33] that the justification for making orders otherwise in relation to indemnity costs should properly be found in considerations that would be deemed relevant for the purpose of otherwise ordering in relation to the general rule that costs follow the event. I think that may set the standard too high; and it does seem a little at odds with what was said and done in South Eastern Sydney Area Health Service v King . 

58I think King does lend some support to the approach of the primary judge in this case, and I would not depart from the approach taken by the Court of Appeal in King . Although for my part I may not have considered the difficulties of Mr Hawkins' case as understood by the Nominal Defendant and/or the differences between the evidence that the Nominal Defendant could have been aware of, when it refused the offer, and that presented at the trial, sufficient to justify ordering otherwise, on the whole I do not think the decision of the primary judge displays such an error in principle as to justify appellate intervention, or is otherwise outside the range of reasonable discretionary decision-making. 

59For those reasons I would refuse leave to cross-appeal. 

Orders 

60I propose the following orders: 

(1) Appeal dismissed with costs. 

(2) Application for leave to cross-appeal dismissed with costs, such costs being limited to costs incremental to the costs of the appeal. 

61In relation to the last order, in my view the whole of the costs attributable to the hearing before the Court should be attributed to the appeal. 

62SACKVILLE AJA: I agree with the orders proposed by Hodgson JA in relation to the appeal and broadly with his Honour's reasons. However, I wish to add some observations of my own. 

The key finding 

63The Nominal Defendant's written submissions challenged the primary Judge's finding that the driver of the unidentified vehicle drove at a speed well below the speed limit solely for the purpose of remaining behind, or close to, Mr Hawkins' bicycle. In oral submissions, Mr Rewell SC, who appeared with Mr Fitzsimons for the Nominal Defendant, did not press the challenge to this finding. 

64There was also no challenge to the primary Judge's findings that the driver of the unidentified vehicle activated the horn in "" short staccato beeps "" and that the purpose of the driver's use of the horn in this way was to intimidate Mr Hawkins or to drive the vehicle irresponsibly. Similarly, there was no challenge to the finding that the driver deliberately deviated from a lane that would have taken the vehicle to the centre of the roadway and that the driver did so in order "" to get close to the gutter "". At this point, the vehicle was directly behind Mr Hawkins and very close to him. 

65In view of these findings, in my opinion it was well open to the primary Judge to infer that the driver's purpose was to facilitate the throwing of an object by a passenger in the vehicle so that the object could hit Mr Hawkins and thereby cause him distress. As his Honour found, Mr Hawkins lost control of his bicycle and sustained his injuries because he was struck by the object thrown from the vehicle. 

66On the findings of the primary Judge, the driver of the unidentified vehicle, by the manner in which he or she controlled the vehicle, engaged in a course of conduct designed to intimidate and harass Mr Hawkins as he was riding his bicycle. It was because of the harassment and intimidation that Mr Hawkins moved from the roadway to the footpath. He was riding on the footpath when he was struck by the object thrown at him. This was as the driver intended. 

Was this an ""injury""? 

67The throwing of the object from the vehicle was an integral part of the harassing and intimidatory course of conduct in which the driver of the vehicle engaged. The course of conduct continued for a period of time and was specifically directed at Mr Hawkins, another road user. This is not a case, for example, where the driver merely drove the vehicle to a point at which a passenger could throw an object (or discharge a firearm) with some degree of accuracy at another person. 

68Mr Rewell nonetheless submitted that the injury sustained by Mr Hawkins was not caused by the fault of the driver in the use or operation of the vehicle within the meaning of the definition of "" injury "" in the MAC Act . However, as Hodgson JA has pointed out, the plurality in Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd v GSF Australia Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 26; 221 CLR 568, did not say that the definition of ""injury"" assumes that there can only be one cause of an injury and that that cause must be the fault of the owner in the use or operation of the vehicle. The plurality's reasoning (at [102]) directs attention to "" notions of predominance and immediacy rather than to more removed circumstances "". This suggests that the Court must make a judgment as to whether fault in the use of operation of a vehicle is a sufficiently predominant and immediate cause of the injury to satisfy the statutory definition. 

69The plurality in Allianz also said (at [102])) that the definition of injury looks to "" notions of proximate cause "" found in insurance law (compare McHugh J's criticism of the use of "" proximate cause "" as a criterion (at [54])). It can be seen from the judgment of Allsop P in McCarthy v St Paul International Insurance Co Ltd [2007] FCAFC 28, that the authorities have accepted that there can be more than one proximate cause of an event for the purposes of insurance law. His Honour gave as examples cases in which there were two causes of a loss which were "" concurrent and interdependent in the sense that neither would have caused the loss without the other "" (at [97]). 

70One way of approaching the present case is to conclude, as Hodgson JA does, that the passenger's throwing of the object can properly be considered to be part of or incidental to the actions of the driver in harassing Mr Hawkins. For the reasons I have given, I think that the throwing of the object is correctly seen as an integral part of the driver's course of conduct in controlling the vehicle in a manner designed to intimidate and harass Mr Hawkins. On this analysis, it is impossible to separate the driving of the vehicle from the particular act of the passenger which, as the driver intended, caused Mr Hawkins to be struck by the object. 

71An alternative approach is to apply notions of "" proximate cause "" in insurance law, as the plurality suggests in Allianz . On this approach, the actions of the driver of the vehicle and the actions of the passenger were concurrent and interdependent causes of Mr Hawkins being struck by an object thrown from the vehicle. The passenger could not have managed "" successfully "" to throw an object at Mr Hawkins without the driver's participation in the course of harassment and intimidation. Nor could the driver have managed to strike Mr Hawkins with the object, as the driver intended, without the passenger's participation in the course of harassment and intimidation. 

72On either approach, in my opinion, the definition of "" injury "" in s 3(1) of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW) is satisfied. 

Costs 

73Hodgson JA has set out the terms of Uniform Civil Procedure Rules ( UCPR ), r 42.14(2). His Honour has also explained that Mr Hawkins' offer of compromise was to accept a sum more than $100,000 below than the verdict he ultimately obtained. 

74In Maitland Hospital v Fisher [No 2] (1992) 27 NSWLR 721, the plaintiff (the respondent to the appeal) offered to compromise her claim for $200,000, together with the costs of the trial and the appeal. The plaintiff had been awarded $206,090 at trial and the appeal by the defendant against the judgment was dismissed. The plaintiff sought an award of indemnity costs pursuant to Supreme Court Rules 1970, Pt 52 r 17(4), which was in substantially similar terms to UCPR , r 42.14(2). Although the difference between the judgment sum and the offer of compromise was small, the Court of Appeal considered that the plaintiff/respondent should be awarded indemnity costs in respect of the costs incurred by her after her offer was rejected by the appellant. 

75The Court elaborated (at 725-726) on the obligations Pt 52 r 17(4) imposed on legal advisers, emphasising that the rule does not demand perfection in forecasting the outcome of cases: 

""The rule does no more than to oblige litigants, and those advising them, to consider realistically, upon the best information available to them, the prospects of success and the likely outcome of the litigation. Where, in the particular circumstances, the litigant or its advisers mis-judge the prospects of success or mis-calculate the outcome, their mistake may be warranted on the material which they had available. Alternatively, it may be no more than a mis-calculation in a case with large imponderables where the course they took was nonetheless perfectly reasonable. Litigation is inescapably chancy. The purpose of the rule is to put a premium on realistic assessment of cases. It is not to demand perfect foresight which is denied even to the judges. That is why a discretion is retained, under the rule, for the Court to order otherwise than as the rule provides. But the ordinary provision is expected to apply in the ordinary case. It has added a new duty to the functions of legal practitioners advising litigants. It is a duty which is both protective of the interests of litigants and of the public interest in the prompt and economical disposal of litigation. It is the duty of courts, allowing for exceptions in particular cases, to give effect to the purpose of the rule."" 

76The Court identified (at 724) the objects of r 17(4) as follows: 

""1. To encourage the saving of private costs and the avoidance of the inherent risks, delays and uncertainties of litigation by promoting early offers of compromise by defendants which amount to a realistic assessment of the plaintiff's real claim which can be placed before its opponent without risk that its 'bottom line' will be revealed to the court; 

2. To save the public costs which are necessarily incurred in litigation which events demonstrate to have been unnecessary, having regard to an earlier (and, as found, reasonable) offer of compromise made by a plaintiff to a defendant; and 

3. To indemnify the plaintiff who has made the offer of compromise, later found to have been reasonable, against the costs thereafter incurred. This is deemed appropriate because, from the time of the rejection or deemed rejection of the compromise offer, notionally the real cause and occasion of the litigation is the attitude adopted by the defendant which has rejected the compromise. In such circumstances, that party should ordinarily bear the costs of litigation."" 

77In Hillier v Sheather (1995) 36 NSWLR 414, the Court of Appeal considered the District Court rule applicable to an offer of compromise by a defendant which the plaintiff refused to accept ( District Court Rules 1973, ("" DCR "") Pr 19A r 9). This rule entitled the defendant to a costs order if the plaintiff obtained a less favourable outcome, unless the Court ordered otherwise. The defendant in Hillier v Sheather had offered the plaintiff $45,000. The plaintiff refused the offer, but ultimately obtained judgment only for $26,288. The trial Judge's discretion on the question of costs miscarried for presently irrelevant reasons. The Court of Appeal, by majority, re-exercised the discretion under DCR , Pt 19A r 9, in the defendant's favour. (Mahoney JA dissented but on a question of construction.) 

78Kirby P rejected (at 422) a contention that "" compelling circumstances "" were required before a party should be relieved of the costs consequences of a failure to accept an offer of compromise (cf Wills v Bigmac Pty Ltd , Fed Ct Australia, Heerey J, 9 December 1994). However, he accepted that, in order for such relief to be granted: 

""the case needs in some way to be exceptional. It must be exceptional because the general rule is that provided for in the rule itself. To gain relief, an exceptional exempting order must be made."" 

79Kirby P did not think the uncertainties and vagaries of litigation, of themselves, warranted relief being granted. He said (at 423): 

""it might be thought that the rule operates rather unfairly upon plaintiffs. They may be subjected to risk by early offers which are judged to be unrealistic. Plaintiffs may not be able to afford the risks of litigation with the added risk as to costs. The transference of the risk of costs to them (even if they succeed generally) imposes upon ordinary plaintiffs a burden which few can afford to bear. It is important that the courts should not approach the exercise of the discretion to 'otherwise order' in a mechanical way: cf Maitland Hospital v Fisher [No 2] (1992) 27 NSWLR 721 at 725. Even skilled legal representatives do not have the gift of prophecy. Calculating damages verdicts is inescapably inexact because of the many imponderables which must be taken into account. The present is a case in point. So much depended upon the view which would be taken concerning the significance (if any) of pre-injury spinal and neck pain. In exercising the discretion, courts will not overlook the particular features of a case and the difficulty of putting an accurate estimate on its value in advance of the litigation. Yet the general considerations of chance and risk would have been known to the rule-maker when Pt 19A, r 9 of the District Court Rules was introduced into the District Court Rules . Without more, they could not provide a basis for ordering otherwise than as the rule will ordinarily provide. If this puts plaintiffs' legal representatives in an impossibly position and, in practice, forces the settlement of cases for sums less than they are worth because the costs of litigation cannot be wagered against their risks, the complaint must be against the terms of the rules and the apparently narrow provision for exempting orders. The complaint cannot be against a court which merely gives effect to the purpose of the rule as expressed in its plain language."" 

80Cole JA, the other member of the majority, said only (at 432) that the plaintiff was "" at risk as to costs "" from the date the defendant's offer of compromise was made. 

81In South Eastern Sydney Area Health Service v King [2006] NSWCA 2, the plaintiff in a medical negligence case had offered to accept $2.35 million some six years before the trial. The defendant refused to accept the offer and the plaintiff ultimately obtained judgment for $7 million. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial Judge's decision to relieve the defendant from the usual consequences of a refusal to accept an offer of compromise more favourable to the defendant than the result at trial. 

82In King , the Court appears to have recognised that there was a difference in emphasis between the approach taken in Maitland Hospital and that taken by Kirby P in Hillier v Sheather . The Court in King expressed the view (at [83]-[84]) that something more than a defendant's reasonable belief as to his or her prospects was required to justify granting relief under the relevant rule: 

""83 ... The onus is on the defendant to persuade the Court that indemnity costs should not be ordered. He must demonstrate the basis on which an order should be made denying the plaintiff's entitlement to indemnity costs. He must establish that he had given serious thought to the risk involved in non-acceptance of the offer, and that he had assessed the plaintiff's case properly and in the context of the rule and the achievement of its purpose -- to encourage the proper compromise of litigation, in the private interests of the litigants and in the public interest of the prompt and economical disposal of litigation. Generally, exceptional circumstances are required to justify such an order denying the plaintiff's entitlement. See generally, Fowdl v Fowdl , Court of Appeal, 4 November 1993 unreported, per Kirby P at 12, 16; Hillier v Sheather (1995) 36 NSWLR 414 at 422-423; Morgan v Johnson (1998) 44 NSWLR 578 at 581-582. 

84 Although the Court may take into account the particular features of a case and the difficulty of putting an accurate estimate on its value in advance of the litigation, those considerations do not provide a basis by themselves for denying the party making the offer an order for indemnity costs: Hillier v Sheather (at 423). In Maitland Hospital v Fisher [No 2] (1992) 27 NSWLR 721 at 725, it was said that a miscalculation in a case with large imponderables, where the course taken by the party to whom the offer was made may have been perfectly reasonable, would provide a basis for denying an order, but the subsequent decision in Hillier v Sheather suggests that, whilst 'large' imponderables may be a relevant factor in the particular case in denying an order for indemnity costs, in the general case a party's reasonable belief as to his own chances of success does not alone provide a basis for denying an order for indemnity costs."" 

83Nonetheless, the Court of Appeal considered that the significant changes in the plaintiff's case between the date of the offer and the trial provided a sufficient basis for denying the plaintiff an indemnity costs order: at [85], reproduced in the judgment of Hodgson JA at [48**]. 

84If this Court had the task of exercising the discretion conferred by UCPR , 42.14(2) afresh, I doubt that I would have reached the same conclusion as the primary Judge. Unlike King , Mr Hawkins' case did not change significantly between the date of his offer of compromise and the trial. The findings made by the primary Judge were in accordance with the case Mr Hawkins pleaded in his statement of claim filed on 24 November 2008. The plaintiff's offer of compromise of $310,000 plus costs was served on 8 January 2010. 

85It is true that the defendant, at the time the offer was served, was not aware of the corroborating evidence of Mr Wikeri, Mr Hawkins' supervisor in his pre-accident employment. But there was no evidence that the representatives of the Nominal Defendant had enquired as to whether Mr Hawkins' account would be corroborated at trial by other witnesses. In any event, there was nothing to prevent the Nominal Defendant from making enquiries of Mr Hawkins' employer or from issuing a subpoena to obtain any records in their possession pertaining to the circumstances in which Mr Hawkins said that he had been injured. 

86The primary Judge also relied on the fact that the Nominal Defendant did not have access to the photographs tendered on Mr Hawkins' behalf at the trial. However, the Nominal Defendant was aware of the location of Mr Hawkins' accident and it is not clear why its representatives could not have arranged for photographs to be taken of the roadway nearby. 

87Nonetheless, the primary Judge, after referring to the principles stated in King , noted that the mere difficulty faced by a defendant in assessing the imponderables in litigation does not provide a basis, of itself, for relieving the defendant against the consequences of refusing an offer of compromise. His Honour squarely rested his decision on the fact that the Nominal Defendant did not have available, at the time the offer was made, the corroborating evidence that made Mr Hawkins' apparently dubious account more likely to be accepted at trial. 

88In these circumstances I do not think it can be said that the primary Judge's exercise of discretion is vitiated by an error of law or any other basis on which an appellate court is justified in intervening. His Honour was entitled to take into account the considerations he did in the exercise of the discretion conferred by UCPR , r 42.14(2). A different evaluation of the competing considerations does not justify intervention by an appellate court. 

89For these reasons I agree that Mr Hawkins' cross-appeal should be dismissed.

		01 June 2011",2011-04-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2709841,Blackwell v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 93,"Judgment 

1BEAZLEY JA : On 18 December 2008, the appellant was found guilty by a jury of the offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent contrary to the provisions of the Crimes Act 1900, s 33(1)(b). The offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years. 

2The trial judge, Hock DCJ, sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for a total term of 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years dating from 8 December 2008. The non-parole period will expire on 7 December 2014. 

3At trial, the Crown relied upon an alternate count of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm contrary to the Crimes Act , s 35. Section 35 is a statutory alternative to a count under s 33 and accordingly it does not have to be stated on the indictment. 

Background facts 

4The offence was committed in the early hours of 13 October 2007 at Scruffy Murphy's Hotel, Sydney, when the victim, Daniel Ward, was struck in the face with a glass, which broke and caused severe injuries resulting in the loss of Mr Ward's left eye. Mr Ward was at the hotel with a number of fellow off-duty police officers, having arrived there at about midnight. Prior to that, Mr Ward had been at a bar in the city attending a farewell for a fellow police officer. By the time he arrived at Scruffy Murphy's Hotel, he had consumed about 8 glasses of beer and said he was "" moderately affected by alcohol "". The other police officers with him at Scruffy Murphy's had also consumed a quantity of alcohol. 

5The glassing incident occurred at about 3:20 to 3:30 am. There was no dispute that the appellant was at the hotel. The dispute at trial related to the identity of the assailant. The Crown case that the appellant was the assailant was based upon the following: 

(1) Direct identification evidence given by a police officer, Kylie Brooks, who was then off-duty and who said she witnessed the appellant slam a glass into Mr Ward's face. She said she immediately grabbed the appellant and detained him physically until on-duty police officers arrived and formally arrested the appellant. 

(2) Identification evidence of an independent witness, Paul Todd, who said he saw a person approach the female off-duty police officers on the dance floor, saw one of the female police officers push that person away and then saw the same person move his arm, holding a glass, into Mr Ward's face. He then saw this person immediately being restrained by one of the off-duty female police officers. 

(3) DNA evidence, which established that blood consistent with Mr Ward's blood was found on the side of the appellant's shoe. 

(4) An admission by the appellant who, after being asked by the proprietor of the hotel, Malcolm McGuiness, why he had done such a cowardly thing, responded, "" I just wanted to "". 

(5) CCTV evidence from Scruffy Murphy's surveillance system which showed the appellant, some time prior to the commission of the offence, approaching the female off-duty police officers, and also, shortly prior to the offence, purchasing a drink at the bar and obtaining two glasses. 

(6) Motive, in that Mr Ward had spoken to the appellant immediately before the incident as a result of the appellant having approached the female police officers on several occasions, causing annoyance to them. Mr Ward said to the appellant, "" Mate, we're all coppers, she's not interested, so how about you fuck off "". The prosecution case was that as Mr Ward turned to walk away, he was struck by the glass. 

6The appellant gave evidence. In his evidence in chief, he said he did not strike Mr Ward. In cross-examination, he said he had no memory of any such incident. 

Issues on the appeal 

7In his amended notice of appeal, the appellant contended that: 

(1) there had been a miscarriage of justice because the alternative count was expressed in terms that did not reflect the elements of the alternative offence at the time of its alleged commission (ground 1(a)); 

(2) the trial judge inadequately or erroneously directed the jury as to the order in which they should consider count 1 and the alternative count (ground 1(b)); 

(3) the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence (ground 2). 

8The appellant also sought leave to appeal against sentence. 

The evidence 

9Mr Ward gave evidence that during the time he was at the hotel, he and his friends had been standing at the edge of the dance floor. During this period, he noticed a Caucasian male, about 175-185 cm tall, of medium build, with scruffy hair with blond tips. He said the person was intoxicated and on several occasions approached the group of off-duty female officers. Each time he did so, the women moved in towards each other, to make it obvious to the person that he was not welcome. Mr Ward saw the person approach the group again and appear to put his hands around the waist of Mr Ward's colleague, Ms Brooks, who pushed the person away and said something to him. The person went away, but returned and again approached Ms Brooks. Again, Mr Ward saw Ms Brooks say something to the person. Mr Ward stepped forward, put his arm around Ms Brooks' back and tried to put himself between her and the person. Mr Ward said to him, "" Mate, we're all coppers, she's not interested, so how about you fuck off "". Mr Ward said the person stared at him for a second and that he, Mr Ward, started to lead Ms Brooks away, but before he could complete his first step, he felt a blow to the side of his face. 

10Mr Ward was taken by ambulance to Sydney Eye Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He had further surgery on 19 October 2007. He is now completely blind in his left eye and wears a prosthetic eye. He also required sutures to a laceration that started above his left eyebrow, went across the eyelid, down alongside his nose, and cut the artery along the side of his mouth and then travelled back up along the left hand side near his ear. Mr Ward gave evidence that at the time he was struck to the left side of his face, the only other person within 3 m of him, apart from his colleagues, was the person whom he had described. 

11For reasons I explain below, it is not necessary to examine the challenges made to the evidence of Mr Ward, or any of the other prosecution witnesses in their cross-examination. 

12Ms Brooks had also attended the farewell function at the city bar before travelling to Scruffy Murphy's Hotel. She had also consumed a number of drinks and described her level of intoxication as "" moderate "". At Scruffy Murphy's Hotel, Ms Brooks observed one of her colleagues, Ms Martens, having an argument with a male on the dance floor. About half an hour later, the same person started to harass Ms Brooks, coming up behind her, touching her on her waist and trying to dance with her. The first time he did so, Ms Brooks flicked his hand away and moved closer into her group of friends. The second time he approached her, she removed his hand off her waist and turned her head and said, "" No "". He approached her again some 5 to 10 minutes later and she told him that they were police officers and to leave her alone. He came up to her another time, when again, she told him to leave her alone. Others in the group, including Mr Ward, stopped dancing and stood with her, telling him to leave her alone. 

13Ms Brooks said that the man then slammed a glass into Mr Ward's face and started to walk around to her left, trying to get away. Ms Brooks grabbed him by his right leg and called out for other people to help her. Others grabbed his upper body and got him to the ground. Security officers then arrived and took over, removing the man to a stairwell. 

14Ms Brooks saw Mr Ward on the ground with blood pouring from his face. The police arrived shortly afterwards. She described the action of the assailant as being "" like a shot put kind of movement from his chest straight into [Mr Ward's] face "". She saw the glass shatter and beer and glass went over the left side of her face and neck. In cross-examination, Ms Brooks agreed the assailant appeared to be "" well intoxicated "", much more so than she was. 

15A statement of Melissa Martens, one of the off-duty police officers at Scruffy Murphy's Hotel, was read to the Court. In her statement, she recounted the circumstances in which the man had approached her group, including making a sexual approach to her. She said that Mr Ward "" took a step closer towards "" Ms Brooks and had a conversation with the person, but "" was not aggressive "" towards him. Ms Martens said that "" [a]ll of a sudden, a lot of liquid "" hit her in the face. She then saw Mr Ward stumbling, with his left hand holding his eye. 

16Natalie Barber was also a police officer who had attended the farewell in the city before going to Scruffy Murphy's Hotel. She had been on the dance floor and had seen the male person approach Ms Brooks on three occasions. Ms Barber said that she told this person to go away on two occasions. She said that she then turned around to get her drink, when she heard Ms Brooks yell, "" get him "". When she turned back, she saw Ms Brooks holding the person who had previously tried to dance with her. Ms Barber assisted Ms Brooks to restrain the person and they all fell to the dance floor. 

17Prudence Burgun was another police officer who was at Scruffy Murphy's that night, having previously been at the farewell party. She gave evidence of a person with short blonde scruffy hair, approximately 6 feet tall and of a stocky build, approaching the group on several occasions and harassing them. However, she left before the incident subject of the charge. 

18There were two non-police witnesses who gave evidence relating to the incident. Paul Todd arrived at Scruffy Murphy's Hotel after midnight. He said he saw a male person go up behind a group who were standing together. Mr Todd said he saw a male person approach one of the females in the group on two occasions. He saw other females in the group turn "" to support the blonde girl "". He then saw a man from the group walk towards the person. Mr Todd said he saw "" an outstretched arm come from the man that had approached the females. And that went straight into the face of the guy that walked over to support the girls "". 

19Mr Todd said he saw something that looked like a glass in the hand of the man with the outstretched arm. He saw the victim move backwards quickly, with his hand on his head. He saw the man with the outstretched arm remonstrating with the three females and he saw the blonde female grab the man. He saw the victim with blood on his hand and running down his arm. Mr Todd walked the victim out of the dance floor area and found a security guard who directed them to the toilet area. Mr Todd said that as the incident happened, he heard a "" crack "", not a thud, and that he had heard this noise before when someone was hit with a glass. 

20There was a significant challenge to Mr Todd's evidence in cross-examination, particularly in relation to his identification of the appellant. Having regard to the appellant's acceptance on the appeal that there was evidence sufficient to identify him as the assailant, it is not necessary to analyse the challenge to Mr Todd's evidence. 

21The other non-police witness to the incident was John Webster. He had arrived at Scruffy Murphy's Hotel at about 9 pm to 9:30 pm and left at 5 am. He consumed a large quantity of alcohol during that period (about 20 drinks of bourbon and coke) and described his level of intoxication at 3 am as about four out of 10 and at 5 am as about eight out of 10. His evidence essentially corroborated the evidence given by the off-duty police officers, of a male person approaching the group and their indicating to him that he was not welcome. In particular, he observed a male person approach the dance floor where the off-duty female police officers were dancing and he also saw the same person place his hand around the "" hip region "" of the "" blonde girl "" (a description which fitted Ms Brooks). 

22Mr Webster saw the male who was with the group of females take a couple of steps towards the females and attempt to move the male person on in "" a non-aggressive way "". Mr Webster said that he then heard a popping sound and looked in the direction of the group. He saw a male holding his face and moving backwards. When he took his hands away, Mr Webster observed a cut around and underneath the male person's eye. He also saw the other male person being wrestled to the ground by security staff and saw them take that person away through a side door. Mr Webster said that when this happened, the blonde girl moved backwards. Mr Webster put his hand up to stop her and observed that her shoulder felt wet. This was consistent with Ms Brooks' evidence that the beer from the glass spilled onto her. 

23One of the security guards, Liolasa Alaalatoa, took hold of the appellant until the police arrived. He gave evidence that the appellant "" wasn't that drunk "". In his police statement, Mr Alaalatoa had said that when the appellant sat down, he had "" passed out like he was asleep "". Mr Alaalatoa explained in cross-examination that he meant the appellant didn't want to talk, that he had just sat down and closed his eyes. 

24Security guards Aaitui Siofele and Nathan Thompson also gave evidence that the appellant was not intoxicated. Nathan Thompson said he thought the appellant had "" had a couple of drinks but wasn't 'wasted' "". 

25Other security guards on duty that night gave evidence, but not in respect of matters that are relevant to the issues raised on the appeal. 

26The licensee of the hotel, Malcolm McGuiness, was at the hotel when the incident occurred and was notified by one of the security guards. He first went to the toilets and saw Mr Ward, who was being assisted. He saw two of the security guards detaining the appellant. Mr McGuiness then asked the appellant "" why he had done such a cowardly thing "". The appellant's response is as recorded above. Mr McGuiness also expressed the opinion that the appellant was not intoxicated: he said that the appellant was not slurring his words, was not falling over, or in any way showing signs of intoxication. He said that the appellant did not lose his balance and he wasn't crying or mumbling. Mr McGuiness was cross-examined particularly with respect to whether the appellant had made the statement, "" I just wanted to "" to him. He adhered to his evidence that the comment had been made. 

27Detective Senior Constable Veitch attended at the hotel at about 3:30 am. He gave evidence that the entry in the policy custody records in relation to the appellant was, "" When arrived at charge room exhibited signs of moderate to serious intoxication evidenced by unsteady on feet, smell of alcohol, glassy eyes, slurred speech "". Detective Veitch spoke to the appellant at 7 am and determined that he was fit and proper to be interviewed. 

28Carla Bleathman gave evidence in the appellant's case. She said that in the week leading up to the incident, the appellant had been staying at her apartment at Waterloo and that during this time the appellant was drinking a lot. On the day before the incident, at about 5.00 pm, she observed the appellant to be quite drunk. The appellant continued to drink at Ms Bleathman's house until about 9.00 pm, when he and two friends went to the pub across the road. At the time the appellant left, Ms Bleathman observed him to be drunk. He was slurring his words, staggering and being quite loud. 

29At 11.00 pm, Ms Bleathman phoned the appellant but he was slurring his words and she could not understand him. He hung up on her. She tried to phone him at 2.00 am but he did not answer. At about 5.00 am one of the appellant's friends came to her apartment and told her that the appellant had been arrested. The appellant phoned Ms Bleathman at about 8.30 am. Ms Bleathman agreed in cross-examination that the appellant said he "" didn't do it "" because he did not remember doing it. 

The legislative scheme 

30As stated above, the appellant was charged on indictment with an offence under the Crimes Act , s 33. At trial, an alternate count, purportedly under the Crimes Act, s 35, was left to the jury to consider. The incident occurred on 13 October 2007. On 27 September 2007, assent was given to the Crimes Amendment Act 2007. A number of provisions of that Act were commenced on the date of assent, including a provision amending the Crimes Act 1900, s 35: see the Crimes Amendment Act , s 2(1). Those provisions not commenced on 27 September 2007 came into force on 15 February 2008, the date of proclamation: see the Crimes Amendment Act , s 2(2). 

31The Crimes Act , s 33 (in respect of which the appellant was charged in the correct terms) provided: 

""33 Wounding etc with intent to do bodily harm or resist arrest 

Whosoever: 

maliciously by any means wounds or inflicts grievous bodily harm upon any person, or 
maliciously shoots at, or in any manner attempts to discharge any kind of loaded arms at any person, 
with intent in any such case to do grievous bodily harm to any person, or with intent to resist, or prevent, the lawful apprehension or detainer either of himself or herself or any other person, 

shall be liable to imprisonment for 25 years."" 

32Prior to the commencement of the provisions of the Crimes Amendment Act , s 35 was in the following terms: 

""35 Malicious wounding or infliction of grievous bodily harm 

(1) Whosoever maliciously by any means: 

(a) wounds any person, or 
(b) inflicts grievous bodily harm upon any person, 

shall be liable to imprisonment for 7 years ..."" 

33"" Maliciously "" was defined in s 5 to mean: 

""... Every act done of malice, whether against an individual or any corporate body or number of individuals, or done without malice but with indifference to human life or suffering, or with intent to injure some person or persons, or corporate body, in property or otherwise, and in any such case without lawful cause or excuse, or done recklessly or wantonly, shall be taken to have been done maliciously, within the meaning of this Act, and of every indictment and charge where malice is by law an ingredient in the crime."" (emphasis added) 

34Section 33 was amended by the Crimes Amendment Act , Sch 1 [4], however, the new provision did not come into force until 15 February 2008. Also from 15 February 2008, the term "" malicious "", including the definition of "" maliciously "" in s 5, was omitted from the Crimes Act : see Crimes Amendment Act , Sch 1 [2]. 

35However, as and from 27 September 2007, pursuant to the Crimes Amendment Act , Sch 1 [7], s 35 was repealed and replaced with a new s 35 (hereinafter referred to as "" s 35 as amended "") which, so far as is presently relevant, was in the following terms: 

""35 Reckless grievous bodily harm or wounding 

... 

(2) Reckless grievous bodily harm 

A person who recklessly causes grievous bodily harm to any person is guilty of an offence. 

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years."" 

36This was the alternate offence which should have been left to the jury. 

The trial judge's directions to the jury 

37The trial judge directed the jury in respect of the count on the indictment, being the offence under s 33 and on the alternative s 35 charge in the following terms: 

""... firstly, [the appellant] inflicted grievous bodily harm to [Mr Ward] and, second, the act was done maliciously and, thirdly, that the act was done with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm to [Mr Ward]. You will see that that count or charge really follows the words in the indictment, the charge on the indictment. You will see there underneath that an alternative count or charge which is not on the indictment. And you will see straightaway that the alternative charge is a repetition of the first two ingredients or elements of the charge on the indictment but the third element is missing."" 

38Her Honour's reference to "" there underneath "" was a reference to MFI 27, which was a one page document provided to the jury setting out what were said to be the elements of the offences under s 33 and s 35. Up to this point in the summing up, her Honour had followed the wording in MFI 27, which was in the following terms: 

""The Crown must proved beyond reasonable doubt that on 13 October 2007 at Sydney: 

1. [the appellant] inflicted grievous bodily harm to [Mr Ward]; and 

2. the act was done maliciously; and 

3. the act was done with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm to [Mr Ward]. 

Alternative Count 

The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that on 13 October 2007 at Sydney: 

1. [the appellant] inflicted grievous bodily harm to [Mr Ward]; and 

2. the act was done maliciously. 

""Maliciously means intending to cause some physical injury. 

Grievous bodily harm means bodily injury of a really serious kind. 

Intoxication is not to be taken into account in (2) but is to be taken into account on (3)."" 

39The trial judge continued to direct the jury following the structure of MFI 27, as follows: 

""Now you will see I have defined maliciously at the bottom of the page for you. It means intending to cause some physical injury, that is, the Crown must satisfy you that at the time [the appellant] inflicted grievous bodily harm to [Mr Ward] he did so intending to cause some physical injury ... 

At law in the context of this particular charge maliciously means doing an act intending to cause some physical injury and without lawful cause or excuse."" 

40Her Honour explained further that as no question of lawful excuse was raised, the issue for the jury in respect of this second element of the s 33 offence was whether the appellant "" intended to cause some physical injury to Mr Ward at the time he thrust the glass into Mr Ward's face "". 

41Her Honour then directed the jury in respect of the third element in the following terms: 

""... the Crown must prove the intention is to cause grievous bodily harm. That is really serious bodily injury."" 

42Her Honour explained the difference between the third element and the second in terms that in respect of the second element, the Crown must prove that the intention is to cause some physical injury, whereas the additional aspect of the third element meant that the intention required to be proved is an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. 

43Her Honour then directed the jury in respect of the alternative charge as follows: 

""[Assuming you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the first and second element of the s 33 charge, but] you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the third element, your verdict is guilty of the alternative charge ... If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt ... of all three elements your verdict is guilty of the charge on the indictment."" 

44The jury retired to consider their verdict at 12.38 pm on 17 December 2008. At 3.57 pm they returned with a note which asked, "" What are the consequences of the jury not being unanimous on the third element, i.e. intent? "". Her Honour stated she was not able to answer that question at that stage, as it was early in their deliberations and asked them to continue. The jury returned to the Court again at 4.18 pm, having sent in a note that one of the members of the jury had to leave and asking to resume the following morning. The jury was excused for the night at 4:20 pm. It was indicated to the jury that they could agree to resume at a mutually acceptable time, such as 9 am or 9:30 am. The jury returned its verdict at 10:40 am on 18 December 2008. 

45The appellant contended that having regard to the terms of s 35 as amended, the direction on the alternative count should have been: 

""The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that on 13 October 2007 at Sydney: 

(i) [the appellant] caused grievous bodily harm to [Mr Ward]; and 

(ii) the act was done recklessly."" (emphasis added) 

The appellant submitted that the proper test as to recklessness was that the accused person had foresight that injury would probably result from the accused's action: see R v Campbell [1997] 2 VR 585. 

46The Crown conceded that her Honour's direction to the jury on the alternative count was wrong. A direction should have been given as to the reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm, not the malicious infliction of bodily harm. No objection was taken at trial to the directions given in respect of the alternative count and it would appear that all parties and the trial judge proceeded under a misapprehension that s 35 had not been amended. Accordingly, leave to raise this ground is required: the Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4. Given the admitted error, leave should be granted. 

Was there a miscarriage of justice in the jury being directed on the wrong alternative count? 

47The first question on the appeal is whether, given the Court's wrong direction on the alternative count, there was a miscarriage of justice in circumstances where the appellant was convicted on the principal charge. 

48Pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6(1) the Court is to set aside a conviction on the ground of a wrong decision of any question of law, or where on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice. The court may nonetheless dismiss the appeal, if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. This qualification to the requirement that the court set aside the conviction if there has been a miscarriage of justice is routinely referred to in the case law as "" the proviso "". 

49The overriding requirement of the criminal justice system is that an accused person have a fair trial according to law. If there has not been a fair trial there will have been a miscarriage of justice. A fair trial includes the entitlement of an accused person to have the jury directed in accordance with law: see Pemble v The Queen [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107 per Barwick CJ, at 117. As Barwick CJ explained, this involves directing the jury the jury as to the facts which might lead to an alternate available outcome other than the specific offence charged. Subject to the application of the proviso, an accused person who has not had a fair trial will be entitled to have a conviction set aside. 

50The question as to whether there has been a miscarriage of justice has been considered in circumstances where an alternative count should have been but was not left to the jury. Whether or not there has been a miscarriage of justice depends upon whether the appellate court is satisfied that a jury properly instructed, including on the alternative charge, would necessarily have returned a verdict on the principal charge: see Gilbert v R [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414 and Gillard v R [2003] HCA 64; 219 CLR 1. 

51In Gilbert the appellant was charged with murder. However, the jury was erroneously instructed that there was no possibility that the appellant could be found guilty of manslaughter. The jury convicted the appellant of murder. On appeal to the High Court, the Crown submitted that as the jury had been correctly directed in respect of the elements of murder, the verdict demonstrated that they were satisfied of all the elements of murder, including the higher state of knowledge required for murder, as opposed to manslaughter: see R v Evans and Lewis [1969] VR 858 at 871. This proposition was rejected. Gleeson CJ and Gummow J, at [19], adopted the following statement of principle by Lord Tucker in Bullard v The Queen [1957] AC 635 at 644: 

""Every man on trial for murder has the right to have the issue of manslaughter left to the jury if there is any evidence upon which such a verdict can be given. To deprive him of this right must of necessity constitute a grave miscarriage of justice and it is idle to speculate what verdict the jury would have reached."" 

See also R v Jackson [1993] 4 SCR 573 at 593. 

52In Jackson , the question whether the proviso should apply in such circumstances was said to be: 

""...whether it is clear that a jury, properly instructed, would necessarily have returned a verdict of murder."" ( Jackson per McLachlin J) 

53Callinan J, who agreed with Gleeson CJ and Gummow J that there had been a miscarriage of justice, stated, at [101]: 

...It is contrary to human experience that in situations in which a choice of decisions may be made, what is chosen will be unaffected by the variety of the choices offered, particularly when, as here, a particular choice was not the only or inevitable choice."" 

54The approach taken in Gilbert was confirmed in Gillard , where Gleeson CJ and Callinan J said, at [27]: 

"" Gilbert decides that it is not an answer to the appellant's argument to point out that, since the jury were properly (albeit conservatively) instructed on the elements of murder, and since they convicted the appellant of murder, there is, on that account alone, no miscarriage of justice."" 

55Their Honours confirmed, at [28], that the substantial question raised in relation to the proviso in a case where an alternative count should have been but was not left with the jury, was whether a jury, properly instructed, would necessarily have returned a verdict, that is, a verdict on the principal charge. See also R v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38 at [50] where the principle was again confirmed in relation to murder/manslaughter. 

56Gilbert and Gillard were both cases where the accused in each was convicted of murder in circumstances where the alternate count of manslaughter should have been, but was not, left to the jury. In Regina v King [2004] NSWCCA 20; 59 NSWLR 515 at 528 Smart AJ considered that the principle stated in Pemble , Gilbert and Gillard was not limited to cases of murder/manslaughter. His Honour considered that this was well established, noting, at [75], that in Evans and Lewis the principle in Pemble , Gilbert and Gillard was stated to apply "" where it is fairly open to a jury to convict of a lesser offence than that charged "". Grove J agreed with Smart AJ on this point. 

57In King , Grove J stated, at [5], that he considered Gilbert and Gillard clearly established that: 

""... where there is on the evidence a viable case of an available verdict of guilty of a lesser offence than that charged, failure to give an appropriate direction can amount to an error of law."" 

58Smart AJ's understanding of the relevant principle appears to have been cited with approval by Wood CJ at CL in R v Jacobs and Mehajer [2004] NSWCCA 462; 151 A Crim R 452 and expressly approved by this Court in Mifsud v R [2009] NSWCCA 313 at [44]-[46], as was the statement of Grove J to which I have referred above: see Mifsud at [47]. 

59A slightly different question arose in Quartermaine v R [1980] HCA 29; 143 CLR 595 where the question was whether there had been a miscarriage of justice where the case had been conducted and the jury directed in respect of counts which were different from those specified in the indictment. In that case, the jury convicted the appellant on the charge on the indictment. Gibbs J observed, at [7], that ordinarily where there had been a misdirection of law, the proviso would be applied if the Crown established that if there had been no misdirection the jury would (or must) have come to the same conclusion. This is the same principle which applies where, wrongly, an alternative count had not been put to the jury: see Gilbert and Gillard discussed above. Gibbs J accepted, however, that there might still be a substantial miscarriage of justice if the trial was so irregular that no proper trial had taken place, in that there had been a serious departure from the essential requirements of the law: see Andrews v The Queen [1968] HCA 84; 126 CLR 198, or where the error was so fundamental that the proviso ought not to be applied: Regina v Hildebrandt (1963) 81 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 143 at 148. 

60In Weiss v the Queen [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300, the High Court, at [41]-[47], explained an appellate court's task in the application of the proviso. At [41], the Court stated: 

""That task is to be undertaken in the same way an appellate court decides whether the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, making due allowance for the 'natural limitations' that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record, the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty."" (footnotes omitted) 

61The Court noted, at [42], that it was not useful to lay down absolute rules to be applied by an appellate court when examining the record other than the three fundamental propositions: the appellate court must itself decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred; the task is an objective one; and in undertaking the task, the court must apply the criminal standard of proof. 

62Importantly, the Court also said, at [44] and [45]: 

""No single universally applicable description of what constitutes 'no substantial miscarriage of justice' can be given. But one negative proposition may safely be offered. It cannot be said that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred unless the appellate court is persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused's guilt of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty. 

... there may be cases where it would be proper to allow the appeal and order a new trial, even though the appellate court was persuaded to the requisite degree of the appellant's guilt. Cases where there has been a significant denial of procedural fairness at trial may provide examples of cases of that kind ."" (emphasis added) 

Gilbert and Gillard are examples where an accused person was denied procedural fairness in a significant way. 

63At [46], the Court also referred to, but did not decide, the question of the application of the proviso to the related question whether: 

""... some errors or miscarriages of justice occurring in the course of a criminal trial may amount to such a serious breach of the presuppositions of the trial as to deny the application of the common form criminal appeal provision with its proviso."" 

Quartermaine appears to be a case in this category. 

64For the reasons I discuss below, I consider that the case under appeal is closer in its facts and identification of relevant error to those cases where there has been a breach of procedural fairness of a significant kind. 

65The appellant submitted that this was not a case for the operation of the proviso. He submitted that the effect of the alternative count being put to the jury in this way meant he had been deprived of his right to have the jury consider whether or not he had the requisite intent for the purposes of s 33, or whether the evidence established that he had been reckless within the meaning of s 35(2) as amended. 

Malice and recklessness 

66At this point, it is necessary to return to the directions which the trial judge gave as compared to the elements of the offence under s 35(2) as amended. Her Honour directed the jury that "" maliciously "" meant "" intending to cause some physical harm "", which was one of the mental states that fell within the meaning of "" maliciously "" in the Crimes Act, s 5. ""Recklessness"" was another mental state which fell within the statutory meaning of "" maliciously "". 

67The s 5 definition of "" maliciously "" with its collocation of different types of conduct that fell within it, was cumbersome, if not unmanageable, for trial judges in giving directions to juries and had been subject of adverse judicial comment by judges for a considerable period. The amendments effected by the Crimes Amendment Act were directed to rectifying the difficulties. In the Second Reading Speech, the Attorney General stated: 

""The bill removes the archaic fault element of 'maliciously' from the Crimes Act and replaces it with the more modern fault elements of 'recklessly' and 'intentionally' where appropriate."" 

68The Attorney General drew upon the meaning of "" recklessly "" as explained by Hunt J (as his Honour then was) in R v Coleman (1990) 47 A Crim R 306. In that case, his Honour, dealing with the reference to "" reckless "" in the s 5 definition of "" malicious "", said, at 312-313: 

""... in statutory offences other than murder, the degree of recklessness required in order to establish that an act was done maliciously was a realisation on the part of the accused that the particular kind of harm in fact done (that is, some physical harm - but not necessarily the degree of harm in fact so done) might be inflicted (that is, may possibly be inflicted) yet he went ahead and acted."" (emphasis added) 

69This meaning of "" recklessly "" accords with authority both here and in England where malice is an ingredient of the crime. In R v Stones (1955) 56 SR (NSW) 25 the Court (Street CJ, Roper CJ in Eq and Herron J) said at 471: 

""Generally speaking, malice aforethought means only intention ... If [a person] applied his mind to the consequences, and without concluding that they would probably happen (which is criminal intent) his state of mind was that he did not care whether they happened or not, that is recklessness. The task of a jury is to infer to what extent the accused appreciated the consequences of his act."" (emphasis added) 

70In R v Cunningham [1957] 2 QB 396 the English Court of Criminal Appeal approved the following as an accurate statement of the law: 

""In any statutory definition of a crime malice ... [requires] either: 

(1) an actual intention to do the particular kind of harm that in fact was done; or 
(2) recklessness as to whether such harm should occur or not (ie, the accused has foreseen that the particular kind of harm might be done and yet has gone on to take the risk of it)"" 

71In 1971, the UK introduced legislation creating a statutory offence of Criminal Damage where "" a person who without lawful excuse destroys or damages any property ... being reckless as to whether any such property would be destroyed or damaged "". In R v Caldwell [1982] AC 341 Lord Diplock stated that recklessness included a mental state where the accused person "" had not given any thought to the possibility of there being any such risk of damage "", as well as a mental state where the person "" had recognized that there was some risk involved and had nonetheless gone on to do it "" . This involved a departure from the law as stated in Cunningham. 

72The correctness of Cunningham was reaffirmed in R v G [2004] 1 AC 1034 at 1059. Lord Steyn stated, at 1059, that in Caldwell the Court should have accepted that foresight of consequences was an essential element in recklessness in the context of damage to property under the previous legislation. His Lordship further stated that the purpose of the 1971 Act was merely to replace the out of date language of "" maliciously "" with more modern language while not changing the substance of the mental element in any way. Accordingly, foresight of consequences was to remain an ingredient of recklessness in regard to damage to property. In R v Lavender [2005] HCA 37; 222 CLR 67, Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ at [40] referred with apparent approval to R v G . 

73In Banditt v R [2005] HCA 80; 224 CLR 262 the Court was concerned with the meaning of "" reckless "" in the Crimes Act , s 61R which provided that a person who had sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and who was reckless as to whether the other person consented was to be taken to have known that the other person did not consent. Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ, stated, at [33], that there was a need to accommodate the term "" reckless "" as it appeared in this provision to the requisite mental element, that is, knowledge of absence of consent. Their Honours considered that the following comments of Professor Sir John Smith with respect to the 1976 UK legislation, which was introduced following the decision of the House of Lords in R v Morgan [1976] AC 182 were on point in construing s 61R: 

""If D is aware that there is any possibility that P is not consenting and proceeds to have intercourse, he does so recklessly."" 

74At [37], their Honours pointed out, as the trial judge had emphasised in his direction to the jury in Banditt , that it is not the reaction of some notional reasonable person, but the state of mind of the appellant which the jury was obliged to consider and that this was to be undertaken with regard to the surrounding circumstances. Their Honours, at [38], expressly rejected the appellant's submission that proceeding with an awareness of a risk of non-consent could not suffice without the "" discrete mental state "" of, "" even if I know, I would continue. It does not matter to me "". 

75In R v Grant [2002] NSWCCA 243; (2002) 55 NSWLR 80, at [60] 94, Wood CJ at CL (with whom Spigelman CJ and Kirby J agreed) stated: 

""As was made clear in R v Stones and R v Cunningham ... and, as s 5 of the Crimes Act also makes clear, crimes of malice require either intention or recklessness, each of which calls for a foresight of the consequences, in addition to the mental element required for basic intent."" 

76The effect of this line of authority is that where the mental element of an offence is recklessness, the Crown must establish foresight of the possibility of the relevant consequence. Subject to the question of what is the relevant consequence for the purposes of s 35(2), the suggested jury direction in the Criminal Trial Court Bench Book reflects this approach. 

77However, the appellant submitted that this Court should apply the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in Campbell . In that case, the Court was concerned with the following provision: 

""A person who, without lawful excuse, recklessly causes serious injury to another person is guilty of an indictable offence. "" 

Hayne JA and Crockett AJA said, at 592: 

""In our view there is little doubt that the trial judge misdirected the jury. We have no doubt that the appropriate test to apply is that it is possession of foresight that injury probably will result that must be proved. As said by the High Court in its joint judgment in R. v Crabbe (1985) 156 C.L.R. 464 at 469-70: 

""It should now be regarded as settled law in Australia, if no statutory provision affects the position, that a person who, without lawful justification or excuse, does an act knowing that it is probable that death or grievous bodily harm will result, is guilty of murder ... It is not enough that he does the act knowing that it is possible but not likely that death or grievous bodily harm might result. 

""Whilst that citation is from a case specifically regarding murder, the same principles are relevant. Indeed the Court of Criminal Appeal in R. v Nuri [1990] V.R. 641 said at 643: 

Presumably conduct is relevantly reckless if there is foresight on the part of the accused of the probable consequences of his actions and he displays indifference as to whether or not those consequences occur. 

78In my opinion, this Court should not follow the Victorian decision of Campbell . That decision is inconsistent with authority in the High Court, New South Wales and in England. The Attorney General expressly referred to the test for recklessness stated by Hunt J in Coleman when commenting upon the proposed legislative changes to s 35. Accordingly, in this case, the jury should have been directed in terms that if the appellant was to be found guilty on the alternative count, they had to be satisfied that he realised that by thrusting the glass into Mr Ward's face, it was possible that grievous bodily harm, that is really serious injury, would be inflicted and yet went ahead and acted. 

79In my opinion, the leaving of the wrong alternative count to the jury amounted to a miscarriage of justice. I do not understand the Crown to submit otherwise, or at least so submit with any degree of conviction. Rather, the Crown contended that no substantial miscarriage of justice resulted from the erroneous alternative count being before the jury because the direction the trial judge gave to the jury would be little different from that which he gave. 

80This submission was concerned with the question to which I have referred at [76], that is, what is the 'relevant consequence' for the purposes of s 35(2) as amended. Is it foresight of the possibility of some physical harm? Or is it foresight of the possibility of grievous bodily harm? If it is the former, the direction her Honour should have given to the jury would have been little different from that which she gave. If the latter, the jury would have had to have been directed in quite different terms, that is, as to the foresight of grievous bodily harm. 

81It is convenient to refer again to the direction given by her Honour in this regard. The direction in MFI 27 in respect of the alternate charge was, relevantly: "" Maliciously means intending to cause some physical injury "". On the Crown's submission, had the correct alternate charge been left to the jury, the direction should have been to the effect that they had to be satisfied of reckless foresight of the possibility of some physical injury. The Crown submitted that the direction required for an offence against s 35(2) as amended involved a lower threshold than the direction that was given to the jury, which required that they be satisfied of intention to cause some physical harm, rather than recklessness as to the possibility of some physical harm. 

82This submission may have had some force if the suggested direction as to recklessness for the purposes of s 35(2) as amended was correct. However, I do not think that it is. The Crown's submission fails to disengage with the statutory jurisprudence prior to the amending legislation. Both the word 'maliciously' and its defined concepts have disappeared from the statute. Relevantly for present purposes, the statute provides for a offence of "" recklessly [causing] grievous bodily harm "". There is no definitional construct within the terms of the provision which governs its meaning. There is a requirement of recklessness, which I have addressed. That is, there must be a foresight of the possibility of something. The recklessness must cause something. That which it must cause is grievous bodily harm. In my opinion, there is no basis upon which that term can be read down to mean "" some physical injury "". Although the purpose of the amending legislation was to remove the 'archaic' fault element of offences done maliciously, there is a difference of substance between an intention to inflict some physical harm (the former s 35) and recklessness as to whether grievous bodily harm would be inflicted (s 35(2) as amended) as I have explained. 

83The evidence in relation to intoxication and the impulsivity of the appellant's behaviour raised an issue as to the nature of the appellant's intention. The jury's question to the judge reveals that it was actively concerned about that issue. In my opinion, it cannot be said that on the evidence, notwithstanding the error in respect of the alternative count, the appellant must have been convicted on the s 33 count. This was a matter where it was open to the jury to convict on an alternative count of reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm. It is an exemplar of Callinan J's observation in Gilbert , namely, that where there is choice of decisions to be made, the choice actually made will be affected by the choices offered. 

84The appellant was denied his right to have the correct alternate charge considered by the jury. For the reasons I have given, I consider that he was thereby denied procedural fairness of a significant kind. It follows, therefore, that the proviso does not apply and the conviction should be set aside. On the basis of my conclusion on this ground, the matter should be remitted for a new trial. 

85Strictly, this makes it unnecessary to determine ground 1(b): that the order in which the verdicts were considered was erroneous. However, in deference to the arguments advanced, I express brief views on the submissions advanced on this question. 

Did the trial judge err in the manner in which her Honour directed the jury as to the order that they should consider count 1 (the s 33 offence) and the alternative count (the s 35 offence)? 

86I have already referred to the directions that the trial judge gave to the jury which followed the structure of MFI 27. In summary, her Honour referred first to the elements of the principal charge and then to the elements of the alternative charge. The appellant submitted that a jury is entitled to consider the counts in whichever order they wish and they are not constrained to consider the principal charge first and only then to consider the alternative charge if not satisfied as to all the elements of the principal charge. The appellant submitted that the effect of her Honour's direction to the jury was to make the alternative charge a default position which only came into play if the jury was not satisfied of the appellant's guilt on the principal charge. 

87At the time of the commission of the offence, s 34 provided: 

""Where, on the trial of a person for an offence under section 33, the jury are satisfied that the accused is guilty of the wounding, or inflicting grievous bodily harm, mentioned in the indictment, but are not satisfied that the person is guilty of the intent charged therein, they may acquit the person of such intent and find the person guilty of an offence under section 35, and the person shall be liable to punishment accordingly."" 

88Both at common law and pursuant to statute, it is a condition of the validity of a verdict on an alternative charge that the jury first return a verdict of not guilty on the principal charge: Gammage v The Queen [1969] HCA 68; 122 CLR 444 at [23]. In R v McCready [1967] VR 325, the Court said, at [24], in respect of a provision which made a verdict of assault with intent to commit rape dependent upon the jury being not satisfied that the accused was guilty of the crime of rape and thus in terms to the same effect as the terms of s 34: 

""The question of his guilt of the alternative charge does not arise unless and until the jury is not satisfied of his guilt of rape, and whilst the jury is in a state of disagreement upon the latter, the accused's guilt of the alternative crime remains irrelevant"": 

89The Criminal Trial Court Bench Book at 2-200 provides the following suggested direction in the case where an alternative charge is left to the jury: 

""If you find each of the elements of the lesser offence proved beyond reasonable doubt, but are not satisfied that each element in the more serious offence has been proved beyond reasonable doubt, then you may find [ him/her ] 'not guilty' of the more serious offence and ' guilty' of the other. This option only arises where you all agree that the Crown has not proved the more serious offence beyond reasonable doubt. However, you should not regard this as an invitation to compromise - supposing, for example, that six of you were for a verdict of 'guilty' on the major count and six believed that [ he/she ] was not guilty of anything at all. It would be quite wrong in these circumstances to compromise by convicting [ him/her ] on the less serious charge."" (emphasis added) 

90This suggested direction was supported by the New South Wales Law Reform Commission, Consultation Paper 4, 'Jury Directions', December 2008. At para 4.71, the Consultation Paper states: 

""A jury should only return a verdict of guilty on a lesser alternative offence when the prosecution has not proved the more serious offence beyond reasonable doubt. Jurors are not expected to compromise any disagreement by resorting to an alternative verdict."" 

The Consultation Paper then sets out the direction in the Bench Book and continues: 

""The Court of Criminal Appeal has held that such a direction is sufficient to dispel any suggestion that the jury's verdict may have been the result of compromise. [ CTM v R (2007) 171 A Crim R 371, [48]] On one view, such a direction is probably the only way of avoiding the possibility of compromise."" 

91In Stanton v R [2003] HCA 29; (2003) 198 ALR 41 the appellant complained that the jury was directed to consider its verdict in a particular order whereas they should have been directed that they could consider the verdicts in any order they wished. The appellant had been convicted of the wilful murder. The only issue in dispute was intent. Four verdicts were technically available, wilful murder, murder, manslaughter and not guilty, although the only two realistically available verdicts were wilful murder and manslaughter. The trial judge directed the jury in terms that they should first consider wilful murder and that if they were unanimously of the view that the accused was guilty of wilful murder, that would be their verdict. The trial judge then said that if the jury was not unanimously of that view, the verdict would be not guilty of wilful murder. That direction was then given in respect of murder, followed by manslaughter in the same way. The trial judge suggested that the jury start their deliberations by a consideration of whether the killing was unlawful. His Honour then directed the jury in respect of the elements of each of the offences. 

92The majority, Gleeson CJ, McHugh and Hayne JJ rejected the appellant's argument that these directions dictated to the jury a sequence of deliberation and impermissibly restricted them in the manner in which they might properly exercise their function. However, their Honours accepted that if that was a fair appreciation of the effect of what the trial judge had told the jury, error would be demonstrated. Their Honours said, at [35]: 

""... jurors are free to organise the individual processes of reasoning, or the discussions as the group, in whatever appears to them to be convenient. The question is whether [the trial judge] might reasonably have been understood to convey anything to the contrary, or whether he was merely informing them of the sequence in which, at the point of final decision, they were to deal with possible verdicts available to them. What he said was: you can't come to consider the alternative verdicts of murder or manslaughter unless you are unanimously of the view that he is not guilty of wilful murder. So, whatever your verdict is on the first charge of wilful murder, it must be unanimous."" 

93In advancing this ground, senior counsel for the appellant accepted that if the jury had been correctly directed, this ground would not succeed on its own. However, if they were incorrectly directed, as was contended, then the order in which the jury conducted their deliberations might be of more significance. 

94In my opinion, there was nothing in the directions given by her Honour which dictated to the jury the sequence in which they were to organise their deliberations. Rather, her Honour's directions explained the elements of the principal offence and of the alternative offence (subject to the error which her Honour made in respect of the terms of the alternative offence). Her Honour also explained to the jury the consequences of not being unanimously satisfied of each of the elements. Had this ground been relevant to the ultimate disposition of the appeal, I would have rejected it. 

Ground 2: the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence 

95The appellant also contended that his conviction should be set aside on the ground that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence: the Criminal Appeal Act , s 6(1). 

96At trial, as is apparent from the trial judge's directions to the jury, the principal issue was whether it was the appellant who inflicted the injury. On the appeal, the appellant accepted there was evidence available for the jury to conclude that he was that person. The appellant contended, however, that viewed as a whole, the evidence could not support the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to inflict grievous bodily harm upon Mr Ward. This argument centred principally around the appellant's intoxication. 

97The evidence at trial was that the appellant was intoxicated at the time of the offence. There was an issue, however, as to the extent of his intoxication. The Crown's position was that the appellant's level of intoxication was not such as to deprive him of the ability of forming the necessary intention, that is, to inflict grievous bodily harm. Its case was that the appellant, some few minutes before the incident, was functioning reasonably, as evidenced by the fact that he was able to communicate with bar staff, had ordered drinks and paid for them with his credit card. The Crown's case in this regard was supported by the CCTV footage. 

98The appellant contended, however, that the evidence demonstrated he was in fact very intoxicated. This was the evidence of the off-duty police officers themselves, including Mr Ward; the other witnesses, such as Mr Todd; the arresting police officers, particularly police officer Madden; the police custody records; and both witnesses in the appellant's case. 

99The appellant also relied upon the fact that the Crown had not proved intention to cause grievous bodily harm by reference to the manner in which the incident in fact occurred. In this regard, the appellant relied upon the fact that the incident occurred quickly and reactively to a comment made by Mr Ward, giving the appellant little time to form an intention or to consider the consequences of his actions. The appellant's action, it was submitted, was sudden, described by Ms Brooks as a "" shot put "" like movement. The appellant also relied upon the fact that he had not broken the glass before thrusting it at Mr Ward. 

100The appellant also submitted that Mr McGuiness' evidence that he had asked the appellant why he had done such a cowardly thing, to which the appellant had replied "" I just wanted to "", did not differentiate between the act being done recklessly or with the required intent. 

101The test the court is required to apply in determining whether a verdict is unreasonable or not supported by the evidence was stated in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 in the following terms: 

""... the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty ... But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations."" (footnotes omitted) 

102In The Queen v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38, the High Court confirmed this approach, stressing at [33], that the question for the appellate court is a question of fact. 

103In Knight v R [1992] HCA 56; 175 CLR 495 the High Court considered whether a jury had acted reasonably in determining there was no reasonable possibility the appellant did not intend to commit attempted murder in circumstances where there was competing evidence about the appellant's state of mind. Mason CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ, when considering whether the jury, acting reasonably, must have entertained a reasonable doubt about the appellant's guilt, said, at [502]: 

""... the reasoning process which must be employed if the onus of proof beyond reasonable doubt is to remain upon the prosecution is well recognised. As Dixon J said in Martin v Osborne [(1936) 55 CLR 367 at 375] : 

'If an issue is to be proved by circumstantial evidence, facts subsidiary to or connected with the main fact must be established from which the conclusion follows as a rational inference. In the inculpation of an accused person the evidentiary circumstances must bear no other reasonable explanation.' "" 

104Knight was cited in Cutter v The Queen [1997] HCA 7; 143 ALR 498 where Brennan CJ, Dawson and Gummow JJ said, at 501-502: 

""... The test propounded by Mason CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ in [ Knight ] was whether the jury (the tribunal of fact), acting reasonably, could have rejected as a rational inference the possibility of the absence of an intent to kill. In the same case, Brennan and Gaudron JJ embraced the test which had been expressed by Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ in Barca v R [(1975) 133 CLR 82 at 104] following Plomp v R [(1963) 110 CLR 234 at 252] : 

'To enable a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused it is necessary not only that his guilt should be a rational inference but that it should be `the only rational inference that the circumstances would enable them to draw' "". 

105The question whether the appellant had the necessary intent can only be inferred from all of the surrounding circumstances. Whilst there was evidence that the appellant was intoxicated, it was very much a matter for the jury to determine whether his level of intoxication was such that he was not capable of forming the relevant intent. Likewise, the circumstances of the incident itself were matters that the jury were required to assess. 

106In my opinion, there is no basis to disturb the verdict of the jury. The evidence has been set out in some detail and it is not necessary to repeat it. There was evidence upon which the jury could properly conclude that the Crown had established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had the necessary intent for the purposes of the s 33 offence. The Court was not privy to the CCTV footage, although both parties accepted that its effect was as I have stated. That was undoubtedly powerful evidence available to the jury as to how the appellant was conducting himself in the minutes prior to the incident. 

107Although there was other evidence that the appellant's level of intoxication may have been high, that evidence needed to be assessed in the context of all the circumstances, which included, at the time that the police officers arrived at the scene, that the appellant had been manhandled both by the off-duty police officers and by the security guards. It was also open to the jury to accept Mr McGuiness' evidence. If they did so, that was also evidence which supported the verdict. 

108Having given consideration to the entirety of the evidence, I have concluded that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the charge under s 33. I should add that I do not consider this conclusion is inconsistent with the conclusion I have reached on the first issue on the appeal. If the correct alternative charge had been left to the jury, it is possible that the jury may have found the appellant guilty of the alternative charge, which itself is a very serious offence. The appellant was deprived of that possibility. However, that is a different question. As I have stated, there was evidence upon which the jury could convict the appellant of the principal offence. 

Appeal against sentence 

109The appellant seeks leave to appeal against sentence. Given the agreement of James and Hall JJ with my reasons, the conviction is to be set aside. Accordingly, it is not necessary to deal with the application to appeal against sentence. 

110The trial judge in her remarks on sentence briefly summarised the essential facts surrounding the incident, as well as the injury sustained by Mr Ward as a result of the attack. In determining the objective seriousness of the offence, her Honour took into account the level of injury to Mr Ward. In this regard, her Honour referred to Mr Ward's victim impact statement in which he described his ongoing reaction to his physical injuries as well as his loss of confidence, his hyper-vigilance in social settings and his low psychological state. Her Honour also referred to the other aggravating fact in terms of the objective seriousness of the offence, being the appellant's use of a weapon, namely, the glass that he thrust into Mr Ward's eye. Her Honour observed that the blow was completely unprovoked and unexpected, as at the time that the blow was delivered, Mr Ward was turning away and did not see it coming and therefore, he had no opportunity to protect himself. 

111Her Honour considered that the sentence she was to impose must reflect a significant element of general deterrence, as the offence had become so common that the term "" glassing "" had "" regrettably become part of everyday speech "". 

112Her Honour then considered the appellant's personal circumstances, noting that he was 25 years of age at the time of the offence. He had three relevant matters on his criminal record, although the first two, which involved engaging in disorderly conduct, were relatively minor. It appears that her Honour also considered a third matter, committing a public nuisance, also as minor. Her Honour noted that these three offences had occurred whilst the appellant was intoxicated. Her Honour did not treat the appellant's intoxication on this occasion as an aggravating factor, noting rather that his level of intoxication had caused him to act out of character. Her Honour accepted that the appellant's intoxication was due to his tendency to binge drink when he was not engaged in his work as a commercial diver, an occupation in which he had been successful. 

113Prior to the incident on 13 October 2007, the appellant had suffered a number of traumatic experiences, including a serious accident in which a friend, who was a pillion passenger on a motorcycle the appellant was riding, was killed, and in which he himself was badly injured. The appellant experienced chronic levels of anxiety and other symptoms consistent with a post-traumatic stress disorder response. Two months after the accident, another of the appellant's friends committed suicide, which compounded his grief and trauma. The appellant turned to alcohol and illegal drugs. He sought help from a psychologist in the Navy, which he had joined in about 2002. He was asked to show cause why he should remain in the Navy after returning a positive drug test for smoking cannabis and although by this stage he had apparently mostly ceased illegal drug use, he left the Navy and started working as a commercial diver. 

114Her Honour considered the appellant had good prospects of rehabilitation, given his insight and the support he had from family and others in the community. She considered he was unlikely to re-offend and referred to his isolation during incarceration, as his family was interstate. Her Honour found that this constituted special circumstances, as she considered he would benefit from a longer period on parole, this being his first and lengthy period in custody. 

115In considering whether to impose the standard non-parole period of 7 years, her Honour found that the offence fell at the midrange of objective seriousness. However, her Honour decided not to impose the standard non-parole period, because she considered that the appellant was unlikely to re-offend; had good prospects for rehabilitation; had expressed genuine remorse; and there were special circumstances. Accordingly, her Honour imposed the sentence to which I have referred, namely, a non-parole period of 6 years imprisonment and a total term of 9 years, both to date from 8 December 2008. 

116The appellant submitted that a comparison of the sentence imposed by her Honour with the statistics retained by the Judicial Commission suggested this sentence was towards the top of the range for offences of this type. This, of course, is not illustrative of error and Judicial Commission statistics are, at their highest, of limited guidance only: Bombardieri v R [2010] NSWCCA 161; R v AEM Snr; R v KEM; R v MM [2002] NSWCCA 58. 

117The appellant also relied upon the sentencing results in the decisions of Regina v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17; R v Henness [2004] NSWCCA 50; Heron v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 215; and Regina v Jenkins [2006] NSWCCA 412. The Crown submitted that reference to these decisions was not of much assistance. In the first place, this Court stated in R v George [2004] NSWCCA 247; 149 A Crim R 38 at 47 that a comparison with sentences passed in other cases is neither helpful nor justified by the authority to establish that a given sentence was excessive. At the most, "" other cases can do no more than become part of a range for sentencing "". In this case, as the appellant conceded, the sentence imposed by her Honour was within the range of sentencing of other offenders. 

118Secondly, the Crown submitted that the cases of Henness and Zamagias had been determined before the introduction of the standard non-parole period for this offence, so that it was difficult to use them as relevant comparators. In addition, Zamagias was a Crown appeal, as was Jenkins (prior to the introduction of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , s 67). 

119In my opinion, her Honour was entitled to consider that the s 33 offence was one in respect of which general deterrence played a role in the sentencing. The incident had also caused very serious injuries to Mr Ward. Notwithstanding that the appellant's personal circumstances indicated that this offence was out of character and he had good prospects of rehabilitation, that he had insight and was remorseful, these factors were the basis upon which her Honour reasoned that a non-parole period less than the standard non-parole period was warranted. This was so notwithstanding her Honour's finding that the objective seriousness of the offence itself fell within the midrange, findings with which I would agree. If the conviction in this matter was otherwise upheld, I would have concluded that no other sentence is warranted in law: Criminal Appeal Act , s 6(3). In that case, I would have dismissed the appeal against sentence. 

Proposed Orders 

The orders that I propose are as follows: 

1. Appeal allowed; 

2. Quash the conviction and order that there be a new trial. 

120JAMES J : I agree with Beazley JA. 

121HALL J : The appellant appeals against his conviction on a count of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm under s.33 of the Crimes Act 1900. 

122The count under s.33 was the only charge on the indictment, but an alternative statutory count, of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm purportedly under s.35 of the Crimes Act was left to the jury. 

123The jury returned a verdict of guilty to the primary charge under s.33 and, accordingly, no verdict was required on the alternative count. 

124At the commencement of the hearing of the appeal, Mr T A Game SC, who appeared with Mr D Barrow of counsel on behalf of the appellant, sought and was granted leave to amend the Notice of Appeal to add a further ground relating to the directions given as to the order of the jury's consideration of the alternative count. 

125In the appeal against his conviction, the appellant relied upon the following grounds of appeal:- 

"" Ground 1(a) : A miscarriage of justice occurred because the alternative count was expressed in terms that did not reflect the elements of the alternative offence at the relevant time (s.35, Crimes Act). 

Ground 1(b) : The trial inadequately or erroneously directed the jury as to the order in which they should consider Count 1 and the alternative count. 

Ground 2 : The verdict of the jury is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 

Ground 3 : The sentence is manifestly excessive."" 

126The appellant also sought leave to appeal in respect of the sentence imposed on him by Hock DCJ, namely, a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 6 years to commence on 8 December 2008 and to expire on 7 December 2014 and a parole period of 3 years, thereby constituting an overall term of imprisonment for 9 years. 

(1) The facts 

127The appellant in the early hours of 13 October 2007 at a hotel in Sydney named Scruffy Murphy's Hotel deliberately struck the victim, a Mr Ward, in the face, in particular, in the area of his left eye with a glass which the appellant held in his hand. 

128The actions of a person, including one well-affected by alcohol, in employing an object as a weapon against a person in close range in the fashion and the circumstances established in evidence, as discussed below, may, in my opinion, constitute evidence of an intent to injure in a significant and precise way. The prospect of serious injury to the victim's face/eye in those circumstances may be considered to be evident. 

129The defence issue raised at trial was one as to the identification of the appellant as the offender. There was, however, an abundance of evidence that established that the appellant was the assailant. No challenge is made in that respect. 

130The salient aspects of the evidence at trial on the events leading to and constituting the assault are recorded in the judgment of Beazley JA, the presiding judge. I, with respect, accept the facts as set out in those paragraphs and proceed on that basis in this judgment. 

(2) Conclusions in relation to Grounds 1(a) and 2 

131I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of her Honour, Beazley JA in draft. I respectfully agree with her Honour's reasons and conclusions in respect of Grounds 1(b) and (2). I also agree with her Honour's reasons and conclusions for dismissing the application for leave to appeal against sentence. 

132However, I have concluded that there was no miscarriage of justice as claimed in Ground 1(a). Accordingly, in the ultimate result, I am of the opinion that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. This judgment is, accordingly, directed solely to that ground of appeal. 

(3) Relevant legislative provisions 

133The directions to the jury related to both the principal offence under s.33 of the Crimes Act and an alternative statutory offence purportedly under s.35 of the Crimes Act . 

134Section 33 had not been amended as at the date of the appellant's assault upon the victim on 13 October 2007. It was subsequently amended in February 2008. 

135The alternative offence arising under s.35, however, had, as at the date of the incident, been amended from malicious wounding to reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm. The amendment concerning s.35 arose under the Crimes Amendment Act 2007, Schedule 1[4] (No 38 of 2007). This amending Act amended a number of statutory provisions. The amendment to s.35 took effect as and from 27 September 2007. The penalty for an offence under s.35, by virtue of the amendments, was increased from 7 years imprisonment to 10 years. 

136I set out below each of the relevant provisions with which this ground of appeal is directed. 

137The provisions of s.33, as at the date of the offence, were as follows:- 

""33. Wounding etc with intent to do bodily harm or resist arrest 

Whosoever: 

Maliciously by any means wounds or inflicts grievous bodily harm upon any person or maliciously shoots at, or in any manner attempts to discharge any kind of loaded arms at any person, with intent in any such case to do grievous bodily harm to any person, or with intent to resist, or prevent, the lawful apprehension or detainer either of himself or herself or any other person, 

Shall be liable to imprisonment for 25 years."" 

138The provisions of s.35 before the amending provisions came into operation on 27 September 2007 were in the following terms:- 

""35. Malicious wounding or infliction of grievous bodily harm. 

(1) Whosoever maliciously by any means:- 

(a) wounds any person, or 

(b) inflicts grievous bodily harm upon any person, 

shall be liable to imprisonment for 7 years ..."" 

139Prior to its repeal, s.5 of the Crimes Act defined ""maliciously"" as follows:- 

""... Every act done of malice, whether against an individual or any corporate body or number of individuals, or done without malice but with indifference to human life or suffering, or with intent to injure some person or persons, or corporate body, in property or otherwise, and in any such case without lawful cause or excuse, or done recklessly or wantonly, shall be taken to have been done maliciously, within the meaning of this Act, and of every indictment and charge where malice is by law an ingredient in the crime."" 

140As earlier noted, on 27 September 2007, the Crimes Amendment Act replaced the former s.35 with the following new provisions:- 

""35. Reckless grievous bodily harm or wounding 

... 

(2) Reckless grievous bodily harm 

A person who recklessly causes grievous bodily harm to any person is guilty of an offence. 

Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 10 years."" 

141In relation to Ground 1(a), the alternative statutory offence should have been left to the jury on the basis of the provisions of s.35 that came into operation as and from 27 September 2007 as set out in the previous paragraph and directions given on that basis. Instead, the jury were provided with directions on s.35 as it stood before 27 September 2007. 

(4) Ground 1(a): two matters for consideration 

142The consideration of Ground 1(a) requires attention to be given to two matters. The first is the evidence which provided the jury with the basis for determining, beyond reasonable doubt, the mental state of the appellant. In this respect, the nature and strength of the evidence on the specific intent required to prove an offence under s.33 was critical. 

143The second matter concerns the question as to whether the failure to direct the jury on the issue of recklessness in relation to the alternative count under s.35 in the terms of that section at the relevant time could have affected the jury's consideration of the offence under s.33. 

144In his oral submissions, Mr Game contended that an erroneous direction by a trial judge that ""belittles the alternative offence"" has the same effect as an erroneous direction that leaves out the alternative defence (transcript, 23 August 2010, p.4). The submissions for the appellant relied upon the approach adopted in Regina v Gillard [2003] HCA 54; 219 CLR 1 and Gilbert v Regina [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414. Both cases are examined below. It was contended that the reasoning applied in each case applied equally to offences other than offences of murder/ manslaughter. There is support for that contention in Regina v King (2004) 59 NSWLR 515, 528. 

(5) Evidence in the Crown case and trial directions in relation to the offence under s.33 

145In relation to Ground 1(a) and Ground 2, it was contended that by reason of the level of his intoxication at the time of the assault the Crown had not discharged the onus of proving to the applicable standard the specific intent required by s.33 - an intention to cause grievous bodily harm to the victim. 

146The evidence established that the appellant was intoxicated, indeed was well-intoxicated, at the time of the offence. However, it does not, of course, follow, and it was not contended that, a person who is well-intoxicated is unable to intentionally cause harm of a particular nature, including grievous bodily harm. What had to be assessed by the jury in the present case and which this Court also is required to assess, is the evidence as to the appellant's apparent cognitive capacity immediately before and at the time of the assault. Evidence of the objective circumstances concerning a person's conduct and performance including his or her actions and words may, of course, constitute a sound basis from which that person's intention at the relevant time may be inferred. 

147On the issue of the appellant's intoxication and its relevance to the issue of specific intent under s.33, the Crown relied both upon two matters. First, the evidence at trial which it contended established the appellant's cognitive capacity. Second, the directions given to the jury on the significance of intoxication in determining whether the Crown had established, to the requisite standard, the specific intent as an essential element of the offence. In this latter respect, the Crown noted that no criticism had been made of the trial judge's directions on the issue of intent/intoxication. In paragraph 42 of the Crown's written submissions, it was stated:- 

""42. Therefore, the appellant's intoxication and its interplay with his intent was clearly the crucial area in dispute. Her Honour had given clear directions to the Jury on the significance of intoxication in determining whether the Crown had proved that intent. No criticism is made of her Honour's directions to the jury in this appeal. Her Honour's directions were both in writing and oral and they appear at pp.25 to 29 of her Honour's summing up. An important part of that summing up of her Honour on this question was as follows: 

'On the other hand, a person may be considerably affected by alcohol and yet be able to act intentionally. The fact that he may have no recollection of it afterwards does not necessarily mean that he was not acting intentionally. The fact that his judgment was affected so that he acted in a different way from the way in which he would act if he was sober, again does not necessarily mean that he was not acting intentionally.'"" 

148In relation to the objective circumstances relevant to accused's cognitive capacity, the evidence established the following matters leading up to the assault and the assault itself:- 

(1) A short time prior to the assault, CCTV footage showed the appellant buying two drinks from the bar, conversing with bar staff and at least one other person, and using a credit card to make a purchase at the bar. 

(2) In the time leading up to the assault, the appellant made a number of advances to Ms Brooks as follows:- 

(a) shortly before the incident, the appellant approached Ms Brooks and placed his arm around her waist and tried to dance with her. Ms Brooks rebuffed him; 

(b) the appellant then went away for a few minutes and returned and approached Ms Brooks again placing his hand on her waist. She again rebuffed him; 

(c) the appellant approached Ms Brooks a third time when he was told by her that she and her companions were police and to leave her alone; 

(d) the appellant again approached her - others in her group, including the victim, Mr Ward, told the appellant to leave Ms Brooks alone and to ""Fuck off"" . 

(3) The appellant suddenly and with force struck Mr Ward in the face with a glass which shattered causing serious injury to his left eye. In addition to the loss of the eye itself, the victim also sustained a laceration starting above the left eyebrow across the eyelid, down alongside the nose and a cut to the artery along the side of the mouth and back up on the left hand side near the left ear. 

149Insofar as it might be said that the appellant struck on the spur of the moment that would not negative intention: Regina v Rehavi (1999) 2 Qd R 640, 642. I accept the Crown's submission that the fact that the appellant's actions may have been impulsive or showed poor judgment does not mean that at the time he assaulted the victim he did not intend to cause really serious bodily harm to him. 

150In particular circumstances, where a person assaults another with a glass, the likelihood of an intention having been formed may, depending upon the circumstances, be significantly less than where the glass was first broken and then used to assault the victim. But it could not, on that basis alone, be said that the jury's verdict was unsafe or unreasonable: Rehavi (supra). Cases of severe eye injury/loss of the eye through the forceful use of a glass have resulted in convictions under s.33. See, for example, Regina v Hennessy [2004] NSWCCA 50 and Heron v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 215. On the facts of the present case, the jury were entitled, in my opinion, to find that the blow directed by the appellant at the victim's eye would itself support a finding of the specific intent under s.33. 

151In the period not long before striking the victim, the evidence established that the appellant, though well-affected by alcohol, was able to, and did, function with cognitive ability illustrated by his ability to order drinks, to speak to bar staff, to correct the staff member in terms of the number of drinks ordered and in using his credit card to pay for the drinks supplied. As the presiding judge, Beazley JA, has observed at [102], the question as to whether the appellant was intoxicated and, in particular, the level of his intoxication in terms of the appellant's cognitive function was a matter of assessment for the jury and that the CCTV footage undoubtedly provided powerful evidence which was available to the jury as to how he was conducting himself in the minutes prior to the incident. 

152Particular matters, including, in particular, those concerning the manner by which serious injury is inflicted, the part of the body to which the assault is directed and the nature of the injury can be critical in determining the interconnection between intent and intoxication. So much was made clear in the approach expressed and applied by Hunt J in Regina v Coleman (1990) 19 NSWLR 467 at 470 wherein his Honour stated:- 

""The injuries which the victim received certainly amounted to actually bodily harm. The specific intent pleaded, to insert the bottle into the anus of the victim (thus amounting to sexual intercourse as defined), is objectively to be seen in the nature and position of the injuries themselves. The jury was fully entitled to disregard the evidence of intoxication as denying voluntariness, intention to do the physical act involved in the crime, malice (intention to injure or recklessness) and specific intent ..."" 

153Proof of the mental state accompanying the infliction of injury will very often be by proof of the objective circumstances surrounding its occurrence. In some circumstances injury may be inflicted through an act which is not specifically targeted at a particular person or to a particular part of a person's body. In other cases an assailant's action may be purposeful and specifically directed. Two examples may be given by way of illustration. 

154The first example is of a person who throws from a height a heavy object into a quiet suburban street not knowing if there is anyone present in the street below. The object strikes a passer-by causing grievous bodily harm. Such facts may satisfy the lower test of the possibility of grievous bodily harm resulting from such an act - a test which is relevant to an offence involving ""recklessness"" under s.35. 

155The second example, close to the facts of the present case, is of a person, A, who is standing in close proximity to another, B. B says something to A which the latter resents. In anger, A strikes B in the face forcibly with a heavy or sharp object. Depending upon circumstances, including the forcefulness of the assault, very serious bodily injury may be a likely consequence. 

156The act of throwing the object in the street in the first example is an untargeted act but nonetheless remains one capable of causing really serious bodily injury, though not specifically directed at any known or specific person. 

157In the present case, there were particular aspects associated with the appellant's action in assaulting the victim, Mr Ward, that were relevant to the specific intent - the existence of a motive to injure, the wielding of a potentially dangerous object (the glass) and the striking at the victim' face in the region of the left eye with such force as to cause it to shatter and penetrate the eye. Those matters in combination are clearly relevant in a jury deciding whether the appellant acted knowing or realising its probable consequences, and not merely appreciating possible consequences that may arise from the act. 

158Bearing in mind the natural limitations that arise in the case of an appellate court proceedings on the record of proceedings, it is, in my opinion, clear that the particular matters associated with the appellant's striking of the victim, as I have detailed it above, indicate that his action was in the nature of a purposeful or a targeted attack. The appellant's act of slamming the glass into the victim's left eye with such force as to cause it to shatter on the victim's face was evidence from which a jury could conclude that it was an act designed and intended to wound in a very significant way. 

159In Regina v Mowatt [1968] 1 QB 421, a case cited by Hunt J in Coleman (supra), the physical act of the accused in that case was described as a ""direct assault"" . In the course of his judgment, Diplock LJ at 427 observed:- 

""... In the absence of any evidence that the accused did not realise that it was a possible consequence of his act that some physical act might be caused to the victim, the prosecution satisfied the relevant onus by proving the commission by the accused of an act which any ordinary person would realise was likely to have that consequence ..."" (emphasis added) 

160Given the sensitive and vital visual functions of the human eye, any forceful or penetrating injury to the eye is, of course, liable to be classed as constituting ""grievous bodily injury"" . Equally, in terms of foresight of the consequences of such an act, it can, in my opinion, be taken as well within ordinary human experience that a forceful or penetrating injury to the eye will be likely to cause grievous injury to it. 

161In the present case, the evidence as to the nature and position of the injuries and the matters that established cognitive capacity in the accused would have, in my opinion, provided the jury with a sound evidentiary basis for discounting the evidence of intoxication as negativing an intention to inflict grievous harm. 

(6) The issue of the failure to direct the jury in terms of s.35 - the issue of miscarriage of justice 

162The Crown accepted that the correct alternative count left to the jury should have been one of reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm and not malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm. However, it contended that this error did not give rise to any miscarriage of justice. 

163The appellant, on the other hand, contended that, had the jury been properly directed as to the terms of the alternative count, there is a real possibility that the verdict would have been different. 

164I set out below a number of principles derived from relevant authorities on the question as to whether a trial judge should direct a jury in relation to an alternative or lesser charge:- 

(1) In general terms, it is necessary to determine whether any misdirection in failing to direct on an alternative charge can be said to involve or carry what has been referred to as ""practical significance"" in terms of the possibility of a jury convicting on an alternative verdict: Gilbert (supra) at 420 per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J. Similarly, in applying the proviso to s.6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act , see Regina v Gulliford (2004) 148 A Crim R 558; [2004] NSWCCA 338 per Wood CJ at CL, with whom Howie J agreed. 

(2) In a trial by a jury of a serious criminal charge, as a matter of reality, the fact finding by a jury in relation to such a charge can be influenced by the absence of an alternative or lesser charge. 

(3) Whatever course counsel may see fit to take, no doubt bona fide, but for tactical reasons in what he/she considers the best interests of his/her client, the trial judge must be astute to secure for the accused a fair trial according to law. This involves an adequate direction both as to the law and the possible use of the relevant facts upon any matter upon which the jury could, in the circumstances of the case upon the material before them, find or base a verdict in whole or in part: Pemble v The Queen (1971) 124 CLR 117 to 118. 

(4) A trial judge is obliged to leave a lesser alternative only if this is necessary in the interests of justice: Regina v Maxwell [1988] 1 WLR 1265 per Mustill LJ. 

(5) The interests of justice will, however, not be served where the lesser verdict simply does not arise on the way in which the case has been presented, that is, in the light of the issues which arise on the evidence: Maxwell (supra). In other words, there must exist a proper basis before an alternative or lesser offence merits serious consideration by the jury: Regina v King (2004) 59 NSWLR 515, 532 per Smart AJ. 

(6) It follows that conviction on a lesser offence must be a viable outcome. A trial judge is not always obliged to leave all the alternative verdicts theoretically comprised in the charge of the offence, but need not (and indeed should not) do so unless the alternatives really arise on the issues as presented at the trial: Regina v Fairbanks [1986] 2 WLR 1202 per Mustill LJ at 1205. 

(7) In deciding whether to leave the lesser offence, the state of the evidence is, accordingly, critical as emphasised in Gillard (supra) at 14 and as re-stated in King (supra) at 535. 

(8) It follows that a lesser offence should not be left to the jury if the evidence in support of it is slight or the prospect of a conviction on the lesser offence rather than the major offence is fanciful: King (supra) at 535. 

(7) The directions in this case 

165In the present case, the trial judge provided written and oral directions to the jury in the course of her summing up. The written provisions were contained within a document marked MFI 27 which, so far as the alternative statutory offence under s.35 was concerned was addressed in terms of s.35 in its pre-amended form. 

166The written directions in MFI 27 were as follows:- 

""""The Crown must proved beyond reasonable doubt that on 13 October 2007 at Sydney: 

1. [the appellant] inflicted grievous bodily harm to [Mr Ward]; and 

2. the act was done maliciously ; and 

3. the act was done with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm to [Mr Ward]. 

Alternative Count 

The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that on 13 October 2007 at Sydney: 

1. [the appellant] inflicted grievous bodily harm to [Mr Ward]; and 

2. the act was done maliciously . 

"" Maliciously means intending to cause some physical injury. 

Grievous bodily harm means bodily injury of a really serious kind. 

Intoxication is not to be taken into account in (2) but is to be taken into account on (3)."" 


167In her judgment, Beazley JA has set out relevant segments from the oral directions given by the trial judge. 

(8) Intention to cause grievous bodily harm versus foresight of possible consequences 

168In the consideration of the miscarriage of justice contended for in Ground 1(a), the mental element required for an offence under s.35 ( ""... recklessly causes grievous bodily harm"" ) must be considered in the context of the facts established in evidence including, in particular, the evidence as to the applicant's acts and his intoxication. 

169In the discussion on Ground 1(a) set out earlier, the significance of the evidence as to the matters constituting the attack upon the victim in relation to the specific intent required for an offence under s.33 has been considered. The significance of those facts, of course, would equally arise for consideration when assessing the mental element in an offence under s.35 which imports the notion of recklessness. I will seek to make clear why this is so in the discussion that follows. 

170Firstly, as to the mental element constituting an offence under s.35 of the Crimes Act . Beazley JA has examined the relevant line of authority in relation to offences where the mental element of the offence is recklessness, stating that the Crown must establish in relation to s.35 foresight of the possibility of the relevant consequence, namely, grievous bodily harm. I respectfully concur with that observation. For the appellant to have been found guilty of an offence under the amended s.35, the jury would have had to have been satisfied in terms of ""recklessness"" that he realised that by thrusting the glass into Mr Ward's face, it was possible that grievous bodily harm, that is really serious bodily injury, would be inflicted and that notwithstanding he went ahead and acted. 

171It is apparent, in my opinion, as I earlier indicated, that the evidence as to the forceful use of the glass in the manner of a weapon directed at the left eye region of the victim causing the glass to shatter on impact, the nature of the injuries resulting from that act and the extent of the injuries as well as the evidence as to the appellant's cognitive capacity provides, in my opinion, the basis for the conclusion that the appellant had the specific intent required by s.33 in that he realised that his act towards Mr Ward would, or would very likely cause him grievous bodily harm. 

172The Crown case that the appellant acted with intent to do grievous bodily harm to Mr Ward was a strong one. On the evidence, the case went, in my assessment, well beyond establishing recklessness in terms of a contemplation as to the possibility of grievous bodily harm resulting from his attack upon Mr Ward. In other words, this was a case, in my opinion, in which the very actions of the appellant and the nature, extent and location of the injuries he inflicted in combination constituted strong evidence of the necessary intention under s.33. 

173If any further evidence was required as to the appellant's capacity and intent (and I do not believe that any further evidence was necessary) it may be found in the appellant's own words when questioned by Mr McGuinness. The relevant exchange is set out in the judgment of Beazley JA. That account includes the evidence of Mr McGuinness that he asked the appellant ""why he had done such a cowardly thing"" to which the appellant, according to Mr McGuiness, replied ""I just wanted to"" . Mr McGuiness adhered to his evidence in that respect in cross-examination. As Beazley JA has noted, it was open to the jury to accept his evidence and if they did so it was additional evidence which supported the verdict. I respectfully agree. 

(9) Was there a viable alternative offence under the amended s.35? 

174As earlier indicated, the determination that a miscarriage of justice has occurred in a particular case through the failure of a trial judge to provide a jury with the opportunity to return a lesser verdict, even though the lesser offence is not charged, may be made where such lesser offence was a viable outcome on the evidence. As Smart AJ in King (supra) at observed 535:- 

""In deciding whether to leave the lesser offence the state of the evidence is critical as Gillard emphasises. The lesser offence is not left to the jury if the evidence in support of it is flimsy or the prospect of a conviction on the lesser offence rather than the major offence is fanciful."" 

175With this principle in mind, it is necessary, in relation to Ground 1(a), to consider the further question as to whether or not the state of the evidence was such that there was a viable alternative on the evidence, namely, a verdict in terms of an offence under s.35 ( ""A person who recklessly causes grievous bodily harm to any person is guilty of an offence"" ). For reasons detailed below, I am of the opinion that, on the evidence at trial, such an offence was not available as an alternative to the primary count. 

176Beazley JA has observed at [82]:- 

""... there is a difference of substance between an intention to inflict some physical harm (the former s.35) and recklessness as to whether grievous bodily harm would be inflicted (s.35(2) as amended) as I have explained."" 

177The substantive difference between the two offences and the question as to whether there was evidence capable of supporting the second of those two offences is examined below. Before doing so, however, it is necessary at this point to refer to the accepted principles that apply in determining the concept of recklessness in relation to statutory offences. 

178In Coleman (supra), Hunt J stated that in statutory offences other than murder, the degree of recklessness required in order to establish that an act was done maliciously was a realisation on the part of the accused that the particular kind of harm in fact done (that is, some physical harm - not necessarily the degree of harm in fact so done) might be inflicted (that is, may possibly be inflicted) yet he went ahead and acted (at 475). His Honour referred to the general acceptance of that test as flowing from the decision of the English Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Cunningham [1957] 2 QB 396 as explained in Mowatt (supra) at 426. I will refer again, for related purposes, to the decisions in these two cases below. 

179As Hunt J observed, recklessness involves a realisation in an accused of the possibility of physical harm arising from a particular act yet the person inflicting the harm went ahead and acted. However, as the principles earlier discussed indicate, in deciding whether recklessness was a possible basis of criminal liability (and thus a viable outcome) it is the state of the evidence at trial which is critical. 

180It is instructive to examine the two very different factual circumstances that occurred in Cunningham (supra) (a case involving recklessness) and Mowatt (supra) (a case involving a charge of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm). I refer here to those two cases as merely factual examples or illustrations as to the difference in criminal liability between the two types of cases. 

181In Cunningham (supra), the facts, as noted by Diplock LJ in Mowatt (supra) at 425 were ""very special"". The appellant went to the cellar of a house and wrenched the gas meter from a gas pipe and stole it together with its contents resulting in gas seeping through the wall. The cellar was under a divided house, one part of which an elderly couple occupied and one of them inhaled some gas and her life was endangered. 

182It was held that the offence in question postulated foresight of consequence and for the offence to be established it was necessary either that the accused person intended to do the particular type of harm in fact done or foreseeing that such harm might be done, he nevertheless recklessly took the risk. 

183In Mowatt (supra), the defendant was charged with wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm contrary to s.18 of the Offences Against the Persons Act 1861. The defendant's companion snatched money from the victim who, in a confrontation, grabbed hold of the defendant. The defendant knocked him down - a case of a direct assault. 

184The facts in Mowatt (supra) would not, in my opinion, on any interpretation, have constituted a basis for a finding of recklessness. Similarly, the evidence in the present case, in my opinion, does not admit of the possibility of recklessness having regard to the legal principles that determine the nature of the criminal liability inherent in offences of recklessness. 

185Cunningham (supra) exemplifies the concept of recklessness in the sense that the facts revealed a realisation in the offender of a risk that might arise from taking the action he did and his decision, nonetheless, to go ahead with his act. However, as Diplock LJ observed the facts in in Mowatt (supra) involved ""a direct assault"" (p.426) and that ""... any ordinary person would be bound to realise was likely to cause some physical harm to the other person ..."" (emphasis added). In other words, the facts in Mowatt (supra) unlike those in Cunningham (supra) did not involve a situation of the appellant realising the possibility of a risk and then notwithstanding a decision by him to take a risk and proceed with the act. 

186In seeking to apply the principles by which the mental element in the concept of recklessness is to be determined to the objective facts established in evidence, I do not consider that there was a basis for a viable alternative offence based on the concept of recklessness under s.35. The trial judge accurately conveyed in her summing up to the jury the nature of the accused's action (at pp.27 to 28):- 

""... the accused punched Mr Ward in the face with a glass, as described by Ms Brooks, with such force that the glass shattered on impact with the face of Mr Ward and made the sound that two witnesses described as a crunching or a popping sound. The Crown Prosecutor suggested that can only be done with the intention of causing really serious bodily injury to Mr Ward ..."" 

(10) The alternative count left to the jury 

187The alternative count that was, in fact, left to the jury, firstly, was a lesser offence than that under s.33 and, secondly, it required proof of only two elements, namely, that the accused in fact inflicted grievous bodily harm on Mr Ward and that he intended to cause some physical injury. 

188The circumstances of the present case do not, in my opinion, attract the reasoning in Gilbert (supra) and Gillard (supra), both of those cases involving charges of murder. It is unnecessary to record the factual circumstances in each of those cases in detail other than to state the following by way of summary. 

189In each case, the Court was concerned with the issue of knowledge of the appellants who assisted the primary offender who killed the victims in each case. The primary offender in Gilbert (supra) having inflicted injuries from which the victim died, the important factual issue of relevance in the appellant's case to a verdict of manslaughter as against murder was his state of knowledge as to what the primary offender (his brother) had intended to do to the victim when they arrived at their destination. The defence was that all that the appellant knew was that the brother intended to assault the victim. 

190In Gillard (supra), the level of the appellant's culpability depended upon whether he foresaw that the primary offender (P) might act to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. The defence for the appellant was that he did not know of P's intention to kill the victim and he thought that what was involved was a robbery ( ""the robbery hypothesis"" ). 

191In the present case, the issue of intent did not, of course, involve any question as to the extent of the appellant's knowledge as to an intended enterprise or of the existence of a factual matter that influenced the level of his knowledge about the type of action another person intended to undertake. The evidence having established that the appellant deliberately assaulted the victim, the issue that has been raised in this appeal is whether his intoxicated condition was such as to have impaired his capacity to form the specific intent (an intent to inflict grievous bodily harm). In other words, the question in the present case was not extent of knowledge of facts about the existence of a particular set of facts as was the case in Gilbert (supra) and Gillard (supra) but whether intoxication prevented him from foreseeing the probable consequences of his act in relation to the offence charged under s.33. 

192Additionally, both Gilbert (supra) and Gillard (supra) differed from the present case in that error was established in each in that no available alternative offence (namely, manslaughter) was put before the jury in either case. In the result, the jury were required to determine the proceedings on a murder or nothing basis. 

193As has been discussed, the jury in the present case had available the alternative offence as formulated in the terms set out in MFI 27. On that basis, they had a choice in the event that reasonable doubt arose on the issue of specific intent having regard to the issue of intoxication. The alternative count left to the jury could not be said to have involved a trivial offence. It involved serious criminal conduct punishable, not by a monetary or other non-custodial penalty, but in accordance with the provisions of former s.35, it was punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of 7 years. The maximum sentence of 7 years was 2 years less than the total sentence actually imposed by the trial judge. The objective seriousness of the offence under s.35 as put to the jury, if available and proved, would quite possibly have attracted a sentence at least close to the maximum penalty. 

194I should deal separately with a further matter concerning the question raised by the jury. At transcript, 17 December 2008, p.45 (of the summing up transcript) the jury asked: ""What are the consequences of the jury not being unanimous on the third element, ie, intent?"" . That question was not of the same character as the specific jury question about the availability of a verdict of manslaughter in Gilbert (supra) at 420. 

195Further, unlike Gilbert (supra), the question raised by the jury in this case was not answered. In Gilbert (supra), an incorrect answer was provided to the jury. In these proceedings, her Honour discussed with counsel whether or not the jury's question should be answered at that early stage and, after the discussion, the jury were told:- 

""I am not able to answer the question at this stage. It is early in your deliberations, as you know, and at this stage I am just simply going to ask you to continue with your deliberations."" (transcript, p.46) 

196Accordingly, in contrast to Gilbert (supra), this was not a situation of a question and erroneous answer as to an ultimate question concerning the availability of an alternative offence, in that case, the offence of manslaughter. The question was raised at an early stage and is consistent with the position of the jury perceiving and identifying the third element as the real issue in the case and displaying a degree of conscience by the jury on that important matter. I do not consider that the question itself carries any significance in the determination of the issues in this appeal. 

(11) Application of the proviso to s.6(1), Criminal Appeal Act 1912 

197The trial judge's directions in relation to the alternative counts were incorrect in that the directions were framed in terms of s.35 as enacted by the Crimes Amendment Act 2007. In circumstances earlier discussed, the directions should have been framed by reference to s.35 operative at the material time ( recklessly causing grievous bodily harm ). 

198In those circumstances, the decision of the trial judge to provide directions in relation to the alternative offence can be said to have involved a ""wrong decision"" on any question of law within s.6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

199Alternatively the incorrect directions in respect of the second charge can, in my opinion, be characterised as a ""miscarriage of justice"" within the meaning of s.6(1) of that Act. 

200The Court in those circumstances must allow the appeal against conviction unless, within the proviso to s.6(1), it concludes that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred in which case the Court may dismiss the appeal. 

201The High Court in Weiss v The Queen (2005) 224 CLR 300 (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ) made a number of observations on the statutory task arising in the application of the proviso to s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act . In particular the following propositions were enunciated by the Court:- 

(1) The statutory task to be undertaken in respect of the proviso is to be undertaken in the same way an appellate court decides whether the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the grounds that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 

(2) An appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, making due allowance for the ""natural limitations"" that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record, the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury has returned its verdict of guilty. 

(3) Accordingly, in examining the record of proceedings at trial, there are three fundamentals, namely:- 

(a) the appellate court must itself decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred; 

(b) the statutory task under s.6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act is an objective task not materially different from other appellate tasks; and 

(c) the standard of proof is the criminal standard. 

(4) The following matters are also to be taken into account:- 

(a) The appellate's task must be undertaken on the whole of the record of the trial including the fact that the jury returned a guilty verdict. The court is not ""to speculate upon probable reconviction and decide according to how the speculation comes out"" : Kotteakas v United States (1946) 328 US 750 at 763 (cited in Weiss (supra) at 317). 

(b) There are cases, however, in which it would be possible to conclude that the error made at trial would, or at least should, have had no significance in determining the verdict that was returned by the trial jury. The fact that the jury did return a guilty verdict ""cannot be discarded from the court's assessment of the whole record of trial..."" (at 317). 

(c) It is always necessary to keep two matters at the forefront of consideration: the accusatorial character of criminal trials and that the standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt (at 317). 

(d) There may be cases where it would be proper to allow the appeal and order a new trial, even though the appellate court was persuaded to the requisite degree of the appellant's guilt. Cases where there has been a significant denial of procedural fairness at trial may provide examples of cases of that kind (at 317). 

202I have referred to the evidence of various witnesses called in the Crown case that established the relevant circumstances surrounding and concerning the attack by the appellant upon the victim. 

203The jury, on that evidence, were required to determine the appellant's state of mind (his intention) on the basis of the objective circumstances established by their evidence together with the CCTV film. The appellant's evidence was (and presumably would still be in the event of any re-trial being ordered) that he had no memory at all of any relevant events including the assault itself (his case, notwithstanding, was, of course, that he was not the assailant). 

204The appellant said in evidence that he had no memory as to a number of matters before arriving at those premises and he said: ""... I sort of have a memory of being like in Scruffy Murphy's"" (AB 543 lines 30 to 35). His evidence was that he had no recollection of anything specific at all about the dance floor, no recollection of meeting or speaking to anyone inside the hotel, no recollection of any incidents involving Mr Wood, Ms Masters or Ms Brooks and no recollection of any of them speaking to him in the hotel. He said he did not have any recollection of speaking to a barman or a barmaid. He could not recall being dragged to the floor by anyone or being taken from the hotel. He did recall speaking to bouncers at the hotel or to Mr McGuinness and did not recall police being at the hotel or speaking to police. 

205The appellant was asked in chief whether, over the previous year, he had made any attempt to try and remember what had occurred on the night of the incident. He replied that he had ""A lot ...."" . 

206At the end of his examination in chief the following question and answer are recorded (at AB 547 lines 12-13):- 

""Q. Have you been able to resurrect any memory at all? 
A. No, I haven't. 

Q. Finally did you strike the man Daniel Ward with a glass to the face? 
A. No I didn't."" 

207In cross-examination, the appellant maintained that he had no recollection at all of any events at the Scruffy Murphy's Hotel (AB 547-560). 

208The evidence on the critical issue of the appellant's state of mind (his intention to commit the act and his intention to inflict harm) accordingly remained one for the jury to determine, in the main, on the basis of the evidence called in the Crown case. 

209The evidence given by the witnesses called in the Crown case, including the victim, provided a consistent account of events. Had this been a case where the appellant gave evidence that, for example, he only intended to strike out at the victim but had no intention of hitting him with the glass or that he only intended to assault him to a limited degree or that he intended an assault of the victim which would only cause harm of a low order then a failure by the trial judge in those circumstances to direct the jury on recklessness would carry significance in terms of there being, on the evidence, a viable alternative count. In such circumstances, there could then be said to have been a loss of an opportunity for the jury to consider the same. 

210In the present case, where the appellant said he had no memory at all of the events, the jury were left to determine his intention based on the only available evidence, most of which constituted the Crown case. 

211It has been accepted that sometimes it is possible for an appellate court to be satisfied that it can apply the proviso even though it has not seen or heard the witness: Weiss (supra) at 316, [41]; Regina v Rudd (2009) 23 VR 444, 462 per Redlich JA. In the latter case, the observation was made that the nature of the case made against an appellant may be such that the appellate court will be well placed to make its own evaluation of the evidence and a determination as to the guilt of the appellant (Redlich JA at [79]). 

212In my opinion the latter observation appropriately applies to the present case being one concerning a discrete physical event about which there was direct eye-witness evidence with the appellant's position at trial being that he had no relevant memory and therefore gave no evidence as to his state of mind. The cogency of the evidence in the Crown case in those circumstances remained unaltered by evidence given by and for the appellant. 

213The error relied upon in relation to the trial directions on the alternative offence is, accordingly, not the type of error that deprives this Court of the capacity to assess the strength of the case against the accused and conclude that there has been no substantial miscarriage. In other words the accuracy, the reliability and the cogency of the evidence led in the case against the appellant was unaffected by any error at trial. That evidence, accordingly, permits this Court to assess whether an alternative count under s.33 was a viable outcome. In my opinion, the failure by the trial judge to direct the jury in relation to the alternative count did not give rise to significant procedural fairness 

(12) Conclusion 

214I have concluded that the misdirection as to the terms in which the jury were instructed as to the offence purportedly arising under s.35 is one that did not have any practical significance. 

215The evidence at trial, in my opinion, established beyond any reasonable doubt that the appellant intentionally inflicted grievous bodily harm on the victim, Mr Ward, with the intent to inflict such harm on him. 

216Accordingly, on that basis and by reason of the fact that I otherwise agree with the reasons and orders proposed by Beazley JA in relation to the other grounds of appeal, I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. 

217I also concur with the reasons and order proposed by the presiding judge in relation to the application for leave to appeal against sentence.

2709849,R v MONIS; R v DROUDIS [2011] NSWDC 39,"Judgment 
NOTICES OF MOTION TO QUASH INDICTMENT ON GROUNDS OF INVALIDITY 

1These Notices of Motion dated 13 th April, 2011 for the accused Monis, and 8 th April, 2011 for the accused Droudis, Amended on 13 th April 2011, seek to have the indictment quashed on the basis of a finding that the charges are brought pursuant to a law which is invalid, because it infringes the implied Constitutional freedom of political communication. 

2The two accused in this trial have been charged, in a joint indictment, with 21 offences brought pursuant to S471.12 of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) . That section is found within Chapter 10 of the Code, which is entitled "" National Infrastructure"" , within Part 10.5 of that Chapter which is entitled "" Postal Services"" and further is found in Division 471, Subdivision A of that Chapter which is entitled "" Postal Offences - General Postal Offences"". 

Trial Charges 
3The substantive offences are brought pursuant to S471.12 of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) which provides the following: 

A person is guilty of an offence if: 
(a) the person uses a postal or similar service; and 
(b) the person does so in a way (whether by the method of use or the content of a communication, or both) that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, menacing, harassing or offensive. 

4The accused Monis, faces 13 counts contrary to S471.12, all but one alleging that on various dates he used a postal service in an offensive way by sending letters to persons who were in each case either relatives of members of the Australia Defence Force who had been killed in combat in Afghanistan, or in the case of one of the counts, Count 12, were relatives of an Austrade official who had been killed in the bombing of the Marriot Hotel in Jakarta on 17 July 2009. One of the 13 counts, namely count 3, alleges that he used a postal services in an harassing manner by sending a letter to the relatives of a member of the ADF killed in combat in the war in Afghanistan. 

5The other accused, Droudis is charged under the same section with the remaining 8 counts in the indictment, namely counts 14 to 21 inclusive, with aiding and abetting the co-accused's commission of 8 of the 13 counts against him. For all of those 8 charges, the substantive offence alleged against the co-accused Monis is that he used the postal service in an offensive way. Thus for the accused Droudis, she faces 8 counts of aiding and abetting the co-accused's using the mail to send offensive letters to those nominated persons. 

Trial History 
6The accused Monis was committed to stand trial in the District Court of NSW at Sydney for the 13 charges against him alone on 7 th July, 2010. He was due to stand trial commencing 1 st November 2010. An application to vacate the trial date was ultimately granted, and the trial was listed to commence in the District Court on 11 April, 2011. In the meantime, the accused Droudis was committed for trial on the 8 charges against her from the Local Court on 15 February, 2011. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (""CDPP"") then presented an indictment joining both accused and their joint trial was listed to commence in the District Court on 11 April, 2011. 

7Before the appointed trial date, the accused commenced proceedings seeking to remove the District Court proceedings into the High Court of Australia, to have the Constitutional issue tested. The accused filed Notices of Motion in the District Court seeking that the trial date of 11 th April, 2011 be vacated and that the trial be stayed pending the High Court's determination of their applications to remove the proceedings. Their Notices of Motion were heard on 22 nd March, 2011 and were dismissed. As I understand it, in the meantime, the applications to remove the District Court proceedings to the High Court of Australia were dismissed by that Court. 

8Thus the trial commenced in this Court on Monday 11 th April. The accused each filed Notices of Motion which, when ultimately amended by leave, seek the following substantive orders. 

(1)That the following question be determined separately, namely whether S471.12 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) is invalid (wholly or in part) on the ground that it infringes the implied constitutional freedom of political communication. 

(2)That the indictment be quashed. 

9I am satisfied, and there is no dispute, that appropriate Notices pursuant to S78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) have been served on the Attorneys General of the Commonwealth, Territories and the States. There have been no interventions by any of them on the hearing of the Notices of Motion before me. 

Nature of the Implied Constitutional Freedom 
10The reference in the Notices of Motion to ""the implied constitutional freedom of political communication"" refers to that constitutional principle, ultimately expressed by unanimous decision of the High Court of Australia in Lange -v- Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1997) 189 CLR 520 ( ""Lange"" ) providing for a constitutional principle defending freedom of communication concerning governmental or political subjects. 

11A similar situation to that before me was considered by the High Court in Coleman -v- Power (2004) 220 CLR 1 ( ""Coleman -v- Power""). That case was referred to extensively on the hearing of these Notices of Motion. In that case the High Court considered a Queensland law against this implied constitutional freedom, and in doing so restated and affirmed the principle expressed in Lange . As stated by Justice Kirby at paragraph 210 of Coleman -v- Power :- 

""Lange establishes that two questions must be answered when deciding the validity of a law alleged to infringe the implied constitutional freedom of communication: (1) Does the law effectively burden freedom of communication about governmental or political matters, either in its terms, operation or effect? (2) If so, is the law reasonably appropriate and adapted (or, as I prefer to express it, proportional) so as to serve a legitimate end, the fulfilment of which is compatible with the maintenance of the system of government prescribed by the Constitution?"" 

Subject Matter of the Charges against these Accused 
12The subject matter of the charges for trial against the two accused before me involves letters and CDs sent through the post. The content of this correspondence has been tendered. The accused argue that this correspondence is communication concerning political or governmental affairs, including Australia's foreign policy and engagement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many of the letters sent to family members were copied and sent to various political figures including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Defence Minister and similar. 

13The notion of political debate or communications is broad, but not unlimited. The CDPP refers to two decisions where challenges to the validity of legislation based on an alleged breach of this Constitutional freedom failed, in part because the communications could not properly be construed as political or governmental communications (see Holland -v- The Queen [2005] WASCA 140 and APLA Limited & Ors -v- Legal Services Commissioner of New South Wales & Anor (2005) 224 CLR 322). The CDPP argues in relation to the correspondence the subject matter of the 21 charges in this trial, that when properly analysed, they are not part of a political debate at all but amount to personal offence to the families of the deceased, which would fall outside the realms of political discourse. 

14For the purpose of deciding these Notices of Motion, I am not required to analyse each of the letters in detail to make a finding about whether all aspects of them amount to political debate. There is no doubt room for either or both, legal or factual debate and difference about how much, if any, of these pieces of correspondence truly fall into the category of communications concerning political or governmental affairs and whether or not some parts are outside that definition and amount simply to personal communications, not as part of political debate. I am however required to determine whether the correspondence, assessed broadly, is capable of being assessed as political or governmental communications. I accept that it is, even if there may be room for doubt about whether all of the content of all of the letters falls into that category. Every one of the letters makes reference either directly or by inference to what is alleged by the authors to be an unlawful war in Afghanistan and many of them are copied to political figures. They have the flavour of a political campaign in a broad sense. 

Construction of the Legislation 
15The first step I must take to determine these Notices of Motion is to construe the legislative provision under attack. For the accused Monis that attack relates to the terms ""harassing"" and ""offensive"" in S471.12(b) and for the accused Droudis the attack is limited to the term ""offensive"" within that provision because they are the only charges she faces. Neither is charged with sending ""menacing"" mail and I am not required to determine or construe any meaning of that word as it appears in S471.12(b). I accept that the terms must be construed within their statutory context. To this end, a brief outline of the legislative history is necessary. 

Legislative History 
16There has been a provision in Commonwealth law similar to S471.12 since 1901. The terms of past provisions are not identical but similar. Without reproducing the exact words of the past provisions, they include the following: 


S107 of the Post and Telegraph Act, 1901 , in force from 1 December 1901 to 30 June 1975, which prohibited sending by post an article which contained or displayed anything of a ""...grossly offensive character"" ; 
Regulations 53 and 53A , in force from 1 July 1975 to 1 July 1989, made pursuant to the Postal Services Act, 1975 which inter alia prohibited sending by post unsolicited articles which contained or displayed matter of ""..an offensive nature"" ; 
S85S of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), in force from 1 July 1989 to 30 July 1997 which prohibited intentionally using the post supplied by Australia Post ""..in such a way as would be regarded by reasonable persons as being, in all the circumstances, offensive"" ; 
S85S of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) was amended twice between 1997 and 2002 but in each case the amended provision prohibited the use of the postal service supplied by Australia Post ""..in such a way as would be regarded by reasonable persons as being, in all the circumstances, offensive"". 
The current S471.12 with one amendment, replaced S85S of the Crimes Act 1914 from 4 April, 2002 to the present, inserted originally by the Criminal Code Amendment (Anti-Hoax and Other Measures) Act 2002. 

Meaning of Offensive 
17The term is not defined within the legislation. There have been many decided cases defining the term generally. The term ""offensive"" is capable of many meanings, ranging from relatively minor to more serious. 

18Meanings within the Oxford English Dictionary include - ""hurtful, harmful, injurious"" and ""giving, or liable to give, offence; displeasing; annoying; insulting"" and, taken from the decision of French, J as he then was in Bropho -v- HREOC (2004) 135 FCR 105 at paragraph 67, ""...definitions in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary include....to vex, annoy, displease, anger... to excite personal annoyance, resentment, or disgust..."". 

19It is most often to be found in legislation seeking to control public behaviour, such as S4 of the NSW Summary Offences Act, 1988 . These provisions have been construed frequently by the Courts in NSW. (See Spence v Loguch NSWSC, Sully, J, 12 November, 1991, unreported, including His Honour's analysis of earlier cases construing the term). For offences within that Statute, which prohibit offensive behaviour, manner or words, I accept that the construction ultimately accepted by the courts is that ""offensive"" means something that is likely to wound the feelings, arouse anger or resentment or disgust or outrage in the mind of a reasonable person. 

20The term has been construed also as it appeared in one of the earlier versions of S471.12 of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) , albeit only by a court of intermediate jurisdiction. In Malvern -v- Bradbury (1971) 17 FLR 345 Henchman Ch Q.S., in the New South Wales Quarter Sessions, dealt with an appeal from conviction for an offence contrary to S107(c) of the Post and Telegraph Act 1901-1968 which prohibited sending any postal article either containing or depicting words inter alia of a ""grossly offensive character"" . The term in that case was defined as having a meaning similar to that for offensive behaviour and reference was made to some of those authorities that appear in the following paragraph of this judgment. At page 349 the Chairman held the meaning of ""grossly offensive character"" to be the same as for offensive behaviour, finding that ""the test is how a reasonable man would regard the actual words in the postal article. Would he regard them as calculated to wound the feelings, arouse anger, resentment , disgust or outrage in his mind?"" He was at pains to limit construction of the term so that something which was merely hurtful or even improper or blameworthy did not fall within a proper construction of the term in S107(c) of the Post and Telegraph Act 1901-1968. 

21This construction is in line with decisions in Australian courts generally, including those to which I have been referred by the parties on this Notice of Motion. (See Worcester v Smith [1951] VLR 316; Inglis v Fish [1961] VR 607 and Ball v McIntyre [1966] 9 FLR 237.) 

22A further basis for this somewhat more restricted construction is that in each of these authorities, just as for S471.12 of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) , the challenged provisions created criminal offences. The legislature cannot have intended to create a criminal offence for doing no more than sending through the post material which was merely hurtful, annoying or displeasing. Patrick -v- Cobain (1993) 1 VR 290 it seems to me is authority for this proposition. It was the lack of criminal connotation in the challenged Victorian Local Government Act, 1989 provision under review, which led Justice Gobbo in the Supreme Court of Victoria to construe the term ""offensive material"" in a very broad way whilst, with respect it seems to me, recognising that such a broad definition would not have been available if a criminal offence or outcome had been created by the provision. 

23It is also relevant in construing the term ""offensive"" in its statutory context, to take account of the fact that it appears as a group of three words , ""menacing, harassing or offensive"" and thus, in any statutory construction, it is appropriate to construe these words as being of similar nature, part of a class. To adopt the words of Kirby, J in Coleman -v- Power at paragraph 224, an examination of ""...the situation of the word "" (in this case ""offensive"") ""...in a concatenation of words that include"" (in this case ""menacing and harassing"" )""...also suggest(s) the narrow interpretation."" 

24It is thus appropriate it seems to me for all of these reasons to construe the term ""offensive"" in this somewhat more restricted way for the purposes of S471.12 of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) . In context it means something that would be likely to wound (as opposed to merely hurt) the feelings, arouse anger or resentment or disgust or outrage in the mind of a reasonable person in all of the circumstances. On this construction, it would not be sufficient for an offence to be committed under this section if all the postal article did was to vex, annoy or displease the recipient or to lead only to hurt feelings on the part of the recipient. It must be more than that. To the extent that the accused argue that a proper construction of the term ""offensive"" in S471.12 could mean merely creating hurt feelings on the part of the recipient of the postal article, I reject those submissions. I accept the CDPP's submission that the term ""offensive"" in this section must be construed as meaning ""seriously or grossly offensive"" but I reject the CDPP's submission that it could be construed to include a meaning, ""repugnant in a moral sense"". It seems to me that there is nothing in the authorities to support this construction, nor does such a construction arise otherwise. 

Meaning of Harassing 
25There is one charge against the accused Monis alone, Count 3, which alleges that he used a postal service in a harassing way, which is also subject to challenge as to its validity on the same basis, namely that it infringes the constitutional freedom of political and governmental discussion. 

26Similarly to a construction of the term ""offensive"" I must first construe the term ""harassing"" in its statutory context. Identical considerations apply, namely bearing in mind that the section creates a criminal offence and that the term ""harassing"" appears as part of a group of three words, ""menacing, harassing or offensive"" . 

27There is no definition of the term ""harassing"" either within the relevant Chapter or within the Criminal Code 1995, (Cth) at all. Neither the CDPP nor counsel for the accused Monis has referred me to any statutory definition of the term or any relevant authority in which the term has been construed. The term ""harassing"" appears in Australian legislation, both Commonwealth and State, including the Freedom of Information Act, 1982 (Cth) in provisions relating to vexatious litigants where it occurs as one of two words, ""harassing and intimidating"" , the Family Law Act, 1995 in provisions providing for enforcement of injunctive relief where it is used as one of three words, ""harassing, molesting or stalking"", the Evidence Act, 1995 in relation to limits on cross examination, preventing cross examination which is "" unduly annoying, harassing, intimidating, offensive, oppressive, humiliating or repetitive"" . It is frequently encountered in the Local Courts of NSW via the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 which provides that every apprehended violence order is deemed to prohibit a person from, inter alia, harassing the protected person. It is a term also appearing in the NSW Jury Act, 1977 at S68A, in S60C of the NSW Crimes Act, 1900 and the Summary Offences Act 1988 at S11H. However it appears that in none of these statutes is the term defined, nor has it been construed . 

28The Dictionary definition of the term ""harass"" is:- 
From the Macquarie Dictionary - ""to trouble by repeated attacks, incursions etc., as in war or hostilities; harry; raid or to disturb persistently; torment""; 

From the Oxford English Dictionary - ""to wear out, tire out, or exhaust with fatigue, care, trouble."" 

Other definitions include ""to irritate or torment persistently"", from the online source, freedictionary.com. 

29The common thread through all of these definitions appears to be the notion of repetition or persistence. The CDPP has argued that harassing should be construed as meaning something like ""troubling with repeated offensiveness"". It is argued on behalf of the accused that the significant feature of the term is the concept of repeated or persistent activity such as troubling or disturbing a person repeatedly, which could include with political views. I accept that these are both appropriate constructions of the term. 

30The essence of the term ""harassing"" however it seems to me is the repetition of the behaviour, be it acting in a troubling or offensive way, or in a menacing way. The concentration is on the persistence, in this case the persistent or repeated use of a postal service. 

Impact of Construction of ""Offensive"" and ""Harassing"" on Challenge to Validity 
31Construed as above, the term ""offensive"" can have a connection to political and governmental discourse and communications. In other words legitimate political or governmental discourse or communication might well be pursued through material which is offensive. The authorities have recognised that political debate can be insulting and thus, I accept, also offensive. In Coleman -v- Power, Justices Gummow and Lehane said at paragraph 197, 

""Insult and invective have been employed in political communication at least since the time of Demosthenes"". 

Later in Coleman -v- Power, at paragraph 239 Justice Kirby said: 

""One might wish for more rationality, less superficiality, diminished invective and increased logic and persuasion in political discourse. But those of that view must find another homeland. From its earliest history, Australian politics has regularly included insult and emotion, calumny and invective, in its armoury of persuasion. They are part and parcel of the struggle of ideas. Anyone in doubt should listen for an hour or two to the broadcasts that bring debates of the Federal Parliament to the living rooms of the nation. This is the way present and potential elected representatives have long campaigned in Australia for the votes of constituents and the support of their policies. It is unlikely to change. By protecting from legislative burdens governmental and political communications in Australia, the Constitution addresses the nation's representative government as it is practised. It does not protect only the whispered civilities of intellectual discourse."" 

32So, that being the case, it then becomes necessary on these Notices of Motion to consider whether S471.12 is invalid as claimed, at least so far as that section prohibits the use of a postal service in an offensive way. 

33However, for the term ""harassing"" as construed above, it seems to me that there can be no effective connection between the harassing use of a postal service and anything that could be seen as political or governmental discussion, even in its broadest sense. If any such conduct amounts to persistent or repeated offensiveness, or persistent or repeated menace, then other parts of S471.12 apply. Political debate, even robust political debate, may indeed as the authorities have suggested include invective, offence, ridicule, insult and similar. But there is no logical connection between political or governmental communications and mere ""harassment"", meaning something which is persistent or repeated. 

34For that reason I do not accept that consideration of the implied Constitutional freedom arises in relation to that part of S471.12 which prohibits use of a postal service in a harassing manner. 

Applying the Lange Test 
35As referred to earlier, the Lange test has two limbs. If the first limb is answered ""yes"" and the second limb is answered ""no"" then the law under review is invalid. 

Lange - The First Limb 
36The first question to be answered in relation to S471.12 as it applies to the concept of ""offensive"" is, ""Does the law effectively burden freedom of communication about governmental or political matters, either in its terms, operation or effect?"" 

37I have been referred to a number of decisions post Lange, of which Coleman -v- Power is the most pertinent to the facts before me. Similar issues were considered by the High Court in Hogan -v- Hinch [2011] HCA 4 and by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Evans -v- State of New South Wales [2008] FCAFC 130. In all of the cases, the argument proceeded on a concession by all parties that the first limb of Lange would be answered in the affirmative in that particular case and so as I understand the submissions, there is no authority post Lange dealing with this first limb question. Those cases however are not determinative of the issue whether or not a particular law, even those under review, burdens freedom of political communication because of the concessions made in each of them. 

38That is not the case here. There are no such concessions. The accused each argue that because political discourse can be broad and, as referred to above, can even include insulting and, on my finding, offensive material, then a law which prohibits use of the postal service to send offensive material also by definition is capable of catching within it offensive material as part of political and governmental communications. 

39The CDPP argues that the answer to the first limb question in this case should be ""no"", in other words S471.12 as now limited to the term ""offensive"" does not in effect burden freedom of communication about governmental or political matters, either in its terms, operation or effect. It is argued by the CDPP that this is so in part because, as a law enacted post Lange, namely in 2002, it should not be inferred that the Legislature would have intended the section to burden freedom of political communication. Further it is argued that if at all, the burden is light. 

40I do not accept the CDPP's argument in relation to the first limb. For the reasons expressed above when dealing with the broad nature of political debate and the way that has been construed by the authorities, I accept that on its face S471.12, by prohibiting the use of a postal service to send offensive material is capable of infringing the implied constitutional freedom of political communication. The issue it seems to me is the potentiality of the particular law under review to infringe the freedom, not whether or not in a particular case that has occurred. 

Lange - The Second Limb 
41After making an affirmative finding on the first limb question, then it is necessary to address the second limb of Lange, namely ""...is the law reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate end in a manner which is compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible government..."" 

42To deal with this question it is necessary to examine the purpose of the law, that is the purpose of S471.12 prohibiting the use of postal services to send offensive material. The legislative power is found in S51(v) of the Constitution which provides: 

""The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:.......Postal, telegraphic, telephonic, and other like services.."" 

43S471.12 is part of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) dealing with criminal offences arising in connection with the post. It is within a general subdivision which deals with general postal offences and includes offences prohibiting stealing or receiving postal articles, the dishonest use of postage stamps, damaging or tampering with the mail, all of these offences to be found in S471.1 to S471.9 inclusive. The subdivision then goes on to create other general postal offences including prohibiting sending postal articles which contain hoaxes about explosive or dangerous substances (S471.10), prohibiting use of postal services to threaten to kill or cause serious harm (S471.11), prohibiting the use of the post to send dangerous articles or to send explosives or dangerous substances (S471.13 and S471.15) and of course S471.12, the subject of these proceedings. 

44The CDPP argues that this provision has a dual purpose. Contrary to the initial view I raised during submissions I have come to the view that the CDPP's submissions in relation to this dual purpose are correct. 

45I accept that a clear purpose of the section is to protect the integrity of the post both physically and as a means of communication in which the public can have confidence. It seems to me that this is very clear from the terms of the section itself read within its statutory context. The Commonwealth's power to legislate for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to postal services clearly includes the purpose argued on behalf of the CDPP, including I accept a purpose in public policy to ensure that the public has confidence in the post. I accept that this includes, subject to the Constitution, enacting laws which ensure that publicly provided and funded postal services are not used as a tool to convey offensive material. 

46I also accept that the provision has a further legitimate end, consistent with the Commonwealth's powers to legislate for peace, order and good government in relation to postal services which concentrates on the impact a postal article may have on its recipient. I accept that this further legitimate end is twofold, namely to prevent breaches of the peace which might flow from receipt of an offensive postal article and also to protect the recipient of such an article from harm. I accept the argument of behalf of the accused, that the risk of breaches of the peace is less immediate when dealing with the receipt of a letter as opposed to being present and hearing insulting words, as was the factual position under consideration in Coleman -v- Power, but it is not remote on my finding. Further, seriously offensive letters can cause anger and resentment and harm in the recipient and an attempt to prevent the postal services from being used in that way I accept is part of the purpose of the section and a legitimate purpose. 

47Given that legislative purpose then, the question is whether or not this provision is appropriate and adapted to serve these legitimate aims, compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative government. 

48The accused submit that it is not and cite in support what is said to be a majority view of the High Court in Coleman -v- Power to set aside the relevant conviction in that case. In fact in that case only one Justice found that the relevant law was invalid, namely Justice McHugh from paragraphs 35 to 145 and Coleman -v- Power it seems to me is not really such clear support for a view that the second limb of the Lange test would lead to the response ""no"" in the case before me, as is argued on behalf of the accused. 

49In Coleman -v- Power, whilst the criminal conviction arising from the disputed section was set aside by a majority of 5:2, only Justice McHugh did so by finding the section was invalid on the basis of the Lange test. Chief Justice Gleeson held that the law was valid, apparently on a more restricted construction of the disputed provision and having found that the disputed provision did not have restriction of political communication as a direct purpose but that it only incidentally restricted that freedom. The balance of the majority, Justices Gummow and Hayne in a joint judgment from paragraphs 146 to 206 and Justice Kirby from paragraph 207 to 268, whilst setting aside the conviction, did not hold the disputed law invalid but rather, as I understand their judgments, opted for a construction of the disputed section which was more restricted than that originally applied by the magistrate and which in fact was a construction which complied with the Lange test. 

50In the case before me I have found that the term ""offensive"" as used in S471.12 means more than just hurt feelings. To be guilty of an offence under this section as it refers to using the post to send an offensive communication, the communication must be something that would be likely to wound (as opposed to merely hurt) the feelings, arouse anger or resentment or disgust or outrage in the mind of a reasonable person in all of the circumstances. The ends which this provision seeks to meet is both to ensure the integrity of the post and to encourage continued public confidence in and use of the post but also to protect breaches of the peace which might occur when such an offensive communication is received and further to prevent harm in the nature of wounding of feelings, arousal of anger, resentment, disgust or outrage occurring to a citizen following receipt of such an offensive communication. 

51The matters I take into account, raised by the both accused and also the CDPP, in determining whether this law is appropriate and adapted to achieve its legitimate end include: 

That the impact on political and governmental communications of S471.12 is only indirect and incidental. The intention of the provision, particularly viewed in the light of its legislative history, is broadly to prevent public postal services being used to disseminate more generally offensive material, not to regulate or limit dissemination of political and governmental communication through the post. 
That it is a provision giving rise to a criminal sanction. 
That this provision may have a chilling effect on political communication because its limits are uncertain and might amount to massive overreach to achieve its legitimate ends, leading to the risk of selective prosecution. 
That in terms there are no defences for an offence committed under the section, but this I accept is subject to the important qualifying words in the section ""..that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances.."". 
That this is a provision enacted post Lange so that it can be inferred that the legislature did not intend the section to catch postal communications which are genuinely political or governmental communications in their true context, but rather that it apply to communication that is offensive in a way that goes beyond its relevance to political debate or beyond its political purpose. 
That any impact on the implied freedom is limited by the fact that, if at all, it applies only to postal services, and that representative government and political discourse which underpins democratic and representative government is not broadly affected by the provision. 
Significantly in my view are the words appearing in the Section, ""..that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances.."" as a qualifier of the term ""offensive"". This is not just relevant to a construction of the term ""offensive"" but is important because it means that the law is not unqualified or unlimited in its operation, which was a matter Justice McHugh considered important in determining the validity of the disputed provision in Coleman -v- Power. These qualifying words would in my view allow the tribunal of fact to determine the context in which the postal service was used by an accused person, including the intended identity of the recipient of a postal communication, any circumstances surrounding that person and his or her receipt of such an article, the circumstances of the accused including it seems to me his state of mind and the extent to which that might be genuinely reflected in the content of the communication, contemporary debate about current political issues, contemporary values about political debate in a robust democracy and similar matters concerning the circumstances in which such a communication is made. 

52Having considered all of these factors I have concluded that the S471.12 of the Criminal Code, 1995 (Cth) to the extent that it prohibits use of a postal service in an offensive manner, even though it is in fact capable of burdening freedom of communication about governmental or political matters, is nonetheless reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve its legitimate legislative end, in a manner which is compatible with the maintenance of the system of government prescribed by the Constitution. 

53. For those reasons the Notices of Motion are dismissed.

		16 June 2011",2011-04-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709855,R v Valahulu [2011] NSWDC 64,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: Vailoe Valahulu stands for sentence as a consequence of pleading guilty to a charge at the earliest available opportunity in the Local Court. The offence to which the offender pleaded guilty was that on 24 August 2010 at Liverpool in this State he did recklessly, by punching, wound Daniel Rudd, a law enforcement officer, namely, a Liverpool Local Court sheriff's officer, while in the execution of the said officer's duty, namely, operating a handheld scanner at the entrance to Liverpool Local Court. There was no dispute that Mr Rudd was a sheriff's officer working at Liverpool Local Court on 24 August 2010. The assault upon him by the appellant is vividly displayed in Exhibit 2, closed circuit television footage, taken from the security system at the Liverpool Local Court. 

2About 9.30am on Tuesday 24 August 2010, the offender attended Liverpool Local Court in company with his then girlfriend, Julianne Lameley, in relation to an apprehended domestic violence order hearing in which the offender was the defendant and Ms Lameley was the person in need of protection. The offender and his girlfriend approached the scanners at the front entrance to the courthouse, which was being operated by sheriff's officers. The offender and his girlfriend entered and passed through the scanners without incident and entered the foyer of the courthouse and then attended the Legal Aid office. A short time later the offender walked out of the courthouse and stood in the courtyard area at the front of the courthouse in order to smoke a cigarette. He was joined a short time later by his girlfriend. 

3At about 9.46am the offender and his girlfriend again entered the courthouse and approached the scanners which were being operated by the sheriff's officers. At that time Mr Rudd was standing inside the courthouse on the interior side of the scanners operating a handheld metal detector. Mr Rudd was wearing the uniform of a sheriff's officer, he was on duty and performing his normal duties which had commenced at 8.30am on that day. The offender walked through the fixed scanners and was approached by Mr Rudd who, by demonstration, requested the offender to raise his arms in order to be scanned with the handheld scanner. The offender raised his arms out to the sides and Mr Rudd commenced scanning him with the handheld scanner 

4As Mr Rudd was doing that the offender drew back his right arm and formed a closed fist, then grabbed hold of Mr Rudd's right shoulder with his left hand and punched Mr Rudd in the face with a right closed fist. What is displayed on the CCTV could be described in vernacular terms as a ""king hit"". Mr Rudd was knocked unconscious and fell backwards onto the floor striking his head on the ground. As Mr Rudd was falling backwards the offender kept hold of his right shoulder and then punched Mr Rudd again with his right closed fist on the right side of his face and eye while he was unconscious on the ground. The offender then stood over Mr Rudd and looked at him as he lay supine on the ground, unconscious. Other sheriff's officers and nearby police reacted quickly and the police arrested the offender and cautioned him. He was then handcuffed and escorted from the Liverpool Courthouse to the Liverpool Police Station. 

5As a result of the assault the offender himself sustained an injury to the third knuckle of his right hand. Mr Rudd had injuries to his right eye, which was bleeding, his nose, which was bleeding, and the left side of his mouth, which was bleeding, and bruising and swelling developed in his face. As he lay on the ground shortly after the assault Mr Rudd commenced to convulse and was clearly having epileptic type fits. Mr Rudd received first aid at the scene. Ambulance officers were called and Mr Rudd was then conveyed to Liverpool Hospital, during which time he was lapsing in and out of consciousness. 

6The photographs of the damage to Mr Rudd's head are graphic and were clearly taken as he lay supine on the floor of the Liverpool Courthouse immediately after the assault upon him and one was taken after ambulance officers had applied a cervical collar to his neck. 

7A report from Dr Mark Flett, a medical practitioner at the Liverpool Hospital Emergency Department, tells me that the victim, Mr Rudd, had a large periorbital haematoma of the right eye which included both lids, that is the upper and lower lids of the eye. There were also four lacerations around his right eye. Doctor Flett found dried blood in both his nostrils suggesting a nosebleed had occurred prior to his assessment of Mr Rudd in the emergency department. The doctor also noted a swollen left upper lip and abrasion on the lip. There was a fracture of the rim of the right eye socket on the lower side of the eye and CT scan also revealed fluid in the right maxillary sinus. Doctor Flett also noted bruising and tenderness over Mr Rudd's right collarbone and chest but there was no abnormality in the right shoulder or chest on x-ray. I have been told by Ms Hocking, from the Bar table without objection, that Mr Rudd has returned to his normal duties at the Liverpool Courthouse and no one has placed before me any evidence to suggest that Mr Rudd has any ongoing problems as a result of the assault upon him by the present offender. That is fortunate both for Mr Rudd and for Mr Valahulu. 

8Leaving aside the mental element of the offence and the offender's personal circumstances, the assault upon Mr Rudd can be described as both brutal and vicious. It was also cowardly because Mr Rudd had no warning whatever of the assault that was perpetrated upon him. He had no opportunity to defend himself and the striking of an unconscious man on the ground with a fist to the head can only be described as cowardly in itself. This is a serious offence contrary to s 60A(3)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. It carries a maximum penalty of twelve years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period. Under s 60(3) of the same Act the reckless wounding of a police officer carries a maximum penalty of twelve years imprisonment and there is a standard non-parole period of five years. Had Mr Rudd been a civilian rather than a law enforcement officer, the reckless wounding of him would have carried a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment pursuant to s 35(4) of the same Act for which there is a standard non-parole period of three years. Whether Parliament's failure to specify a standard non-parole period for an offence contrary to s 60A(3) is due to a deliberate choice of Parliament or Parliamentary oversight is not for me to determine. I must approach the matter on the basis that there is no standard non-parole period. 

9There was some discussion last Friday with the representatives of the parties about the seriousness of this offence. I must bear in mind what the Chief Judge at Common Law, Justice McClellan said in Sivell v R [2009] NSWCCA 286 at [5]: 

""The ""objective seriousness"" of an offence is a different concept to the ""seriousness of the offence"", the latter expression being commonly used when determining the sentence, both total term and non-parole period (if appropriate) for that offence. Where a standard non-parole period is not provided for an offence, the objective seriousness of the offence does not, of itself, direct attention to any particular type of punishment or term of imprisonment which must both be determined after all the relevant matters, both objective and subjective, which inform the seriousness of the offence have been considered."" 

In the same case, Fullerton J said at [32]: 

""A sentencing judge is obliged to utilise the concept of mid-range offending, and customarily appoints positions within or outside that range as a standard or measure against which to assess objective seriousness, when sentencing for offences where a standard non-parole period applies under Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . This is in accordance with the approach mandated by this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168. However, it is neither necessary nor in most cases desirable for sentencing judges to make an assessment of the objective criminality in respect of offences not governed by a standard non-parole period with that same degree of nuance. I do not intend by that observation to suggest that there are not cases where particularity in the appointment of offending within a mid-range of offending will not be warranted in order to ensure that reasons for the imposition of a particular sentence achieve the objectives of clarity and transparency. When sentencing co-offenders it is often necessary to differentiate in this way in recognition of the need to ensure parity in the sentences imposed. In many cases, however, it is sufficient for a sentencing judge to make an assessment of objective criminality by reference to the maximum penalty, and to those other features of the particular offending that bear upon the gravity of the offence having regard to the circumstances of its commission, on a broad gradient of seriousness."" 

10This offence was committed whilst the offender was on bail for a charge of common assault. The common assault was upon his girlfriend and eventually the offender was sentenced in the Local Court for that common assault on 15 December 2010. However, the fact that the offender was at conditional liberty at the time he committed this offence is, objectively, an aggravating factor and a serious aggravating factor. 

11The present offender has a lengthy criminal history which contains many offences of personal violence. The offender first came to the notice of the law at the age of fifteen when he was charged with robbery in company. For that offence that Children's Court at Lidcombe imposed probation. I shall, after this point, only refer to crimes of violence against the person. On 19 November 2002, when he was sixteen years old, the offender was charged with assaulting an officer in the execution of the officer's duty. For that, Children's Court at Campbelltown placed the offender on probation. On 15 February 2003, when the offender was still sixteen, he was again charged with assaulting an officer in the execution of the officer's duty, and again probation was imposed by the Children's Court. On 6 April 2003, when the offender was seventeen, he was again charged with assaulting an officer in the execution of the officer's duty. Again the Children's Court at Campbelltown imposed probation. On 19 May 2003, when the offender was seventeen, he was again charged with assaulting an officer in the execution of the officer's duty. Again the Children's Court imposed probation. On 10 April 2006, when the offender was aged twenty, he committed the offence of assaulting a police officer in the execution of the officer's duty and caused the police officer actual bodily harm. At the same time, the offender committed assaults upon two other officers. The offender was sentenced to imprisonment for eight months with a six month non-parole period. On 12 August 2007, the offender was charged with using an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence as well as two charges of common assault. The offender was then twenty-one years old. He was sentenced to imprisonment for fourteen months with a non-parole period of five months. On 28 August 2007, the offender was again charged with common assault and a stalking offence for which imprisonment was imposed but that is reflected in the same period of imprisonment as the offences of 12 August 2007. On 20 October 2007, the offender was charged with assaulting an officer in the execution of his duty. There were two counts for that offence. The offender was sentenced to imprisonment for fourteen months with a non-parole period of five months but that sentence was served concurrently with the sentence for the offences of 12 August 2007 and 28 October 2007. The remaining offence of violence was that committed on 6 July 2010, a common assault upon his girlfriend, for which he was sentenced by the Local Court at Campbelltown on 15 December 2010 after he committed the present offence. 

12The offender's criminal record does not allow this Court to approach the matter with any leniency and it does indicate that the appellant is prone to commit crimes of violence, and it would appear that he is prone to commit crimes of violence against police officers and other law enforcement officers. Ms Hocking was able to tell me that one of the offences, to which I have referred in the offender's criminal history, related to a prison officer and it may well be that some of the assaults were against either Juvenile Justice officers or Corrective Services officers. 

13The question is why was this offence committed? That requires me to consider the personal circumstances of the offender. He was born on 23 March 1986 in Tonga. He is currently twenty-five years old. At the time that he wounded Mr Rudd he was twenty-four years old. The offender was raised in Tonga by his paternal grandparents but moved to Australia in 1999 following the death of his grandfather. His parents and other members of his family had earlier moved to Australia. According to the pre-sentence report the offender's relocation to Australia occurred at the age of thirteen. According to that report the offender has seven siblings. The offender's parent's relationship was marred by episodes of domestic violence. According to the pre-sentence report, the offender claimed to have experienced physical abuse from his father resulting in the offender being removed from the family home on one occasion by the Department of Community Services. However, the offender was unable to recall for how long he was in foster care. The offender's nuclear family has split up, his mother and three sisters relocated to New Zealand five years ago, but the offender's father and his brothers remain in Australia. However, the offender told the Probation and Parole officer who compiled the pre-sentence report that he was unable to reside with his father or brothers because of his own behaviour and mental health issues. 

14After the offender came to Australia he went to high school here, but had problems from the beginning because of his inability to speak English. He had behavioural problems at school and according to what the offender told Dr Jonathan Adams, a forensic psychiatrist, who examined him on 29 September 2010, used to see the principal on a daily basis as a result of smoking cannabis at school. According to Dr Adams' history the offender left school in 2004, when he would have been sixteen, with no qualifications. The offender was employed as a cleaner for approximately four months after leaving school but since that time has had a variety of jobs lasting less than six months and it would appear that all of them have been casual. According to Dr Adams' history the offender has not worked since 2006. 

15The offender has been diagnosed with a psychosis, most probably schizophrenia. That is a diagnosis which the offender told Dr Adams had been made in the past and which diagnosis is confirmed by Dr Adams. The evidence does not enable me to establish what is the source of the psychosis. One can postulate that it is a genetic condition and therefore inherited by the offender and is idiopathic. One might also speculate as to whether the psychosis has been induced by illicit drug use and one can also speculate as to whether it is a combination of an underlying genetic propensity, or organic propensity together with the use of illegal drugs that precipitates episodes of the offender's psychosis. 

16The offender has been using illicit drugs since the age of fifteen. At that age he commenced smoking cannabis, usually five cones per day. He began using heroin at the age of sixteen, up to four times per day. The offender denied to Dr Adams injecting heroin and said that he always smoked it. However, the offender commenced using crystal methylamphetamine, or 'ice', every two weeks following his discharge from a psychiatric hospital in March 2009 or it may well have been in 2010. The offender's use of ice was intravenous. At the time the offender started using ice he started using amphetamines and again was injecting those drugs. According to the history given by the offender to Dr Adams, leading up to the offender's arrest for the current crime, he was smoking five cones of cannabis each day, using amphetamines and ice every fortnight and injecting heroin approximately twice per week. 

17The last statement is one that I have correctly quoted from Dr Adams' report. One must note that initially the offender told Dr Adams that he only smoked heroin but he told Dr Adams that in the period up to his committing the current offence that he was injecting heroin twice weekly. Accordingly to the history obtained by Dr Adams, the offender was unclear as to the quantity of alcohol that he was drinking in the period up to the time that he committed this offence. 

18On the question of causation I note that Dr Adams obtained a history that there was no family history of mental illness or suicide. I was told by Ms Tawagi, from Bar table, for the offender, that one of the offender's brothers has a mental health problem, but then I note from the history obtained by Dr Adams that two of the offender's brothers are the users of illicit drugs. 

19The offender gave Dr Adams a history of a number of suicide attempts, one by slashing his left wrist and two by attempting to hang himself. As to the offender's mental health prior to committing this offence Dr Adams records this history: 

""As mentioned above, Mr Valahulu said he had previously been admitted to psychiatric hospitals. He told me that Liverpool Mental Health Team followed him up over the period leading up to his arrest. He said he was treated with oral Quetiapine (an anti psychotic) and also injectable medication every two weeks, but he was unclear as to the name. Mr Valahulu told me that he missed two injections prior to his incarceration. Mr Valahulu [has had] differing psychiatric treatment over the years. He said he was treated under the provisions of a Community Treatment Order following his most recent discharge from a psychiatric hospital."" 

I know from Exhibit 4, and a concession made by the Crown, that the offender's last admission to a mental health institution was between 24 October 2009 and 13 May 2010. 

20Under the heading ""Alleged Offence"" Dr Adams' report contains the following history: 

""Mr Valahulu said that around the time of the alleged offence he was living with his partner and was not employed. At this point in the interview Mr Valahulu altered his account with regards [to] his psychiatric history at this time, and informed me that he was non-compliant with oral psychiatric medication as well as missing his previous two psychiatric medication injections. He said that he was not in regular contact with his caseworker at this time. 

Mr Valahulu said that he only slept for approximately two hours the night before the alleged offence, and that he was 'feeling anger' prior to attending Court. He informed me that he was attending Court with his partner so that she could remove the Apprehended Violence Order that was in place. Mr Valahulu informed me that he was told that the AVO could not be removed, which resulted in him feeling 'more angry'. Mr Valahulu told me that he left the Court to smoke a cigarette and that on his return the security guard asked him to raise his arms. Mr Valahulu stated, 'That's when I punched him'. 

On direct questioning Mr Valahulu said that he heard the voice of the 'devil' instructing him to 'punch anybody' on the day of the alleged offence. He believed that it occurred within the internal space, but he appeared somewhat vague in his description. Mr Valahulu commented, 'the voice told me to punch the officer...I believe that God told me about this'. Mr Valahulu proceeded to describe a 'dream' which he had had prior to the alleged offence, such that he knew that there would be a 'problem' on that day. 

With regards [to] the alleged victim, Mr Valahulu denied any prior fear of him, or believed that the security guard meant him harm. He also denied concerns that the security guard was involved in the secret service - see below for the relevance of this."" 

21The offender chose not to give any evidence. He is not required to. However, it does mean that I must approach medical histories and histories obtained by the Probation Parole Service with caution. One must note the inconsistency pointed out to by Dr Adams in the histories given by the offender as to his being compliant or not with his medication and treatment immediately prior to the current offence. I also note what appears to me to be inconsistency as to whether the offender was told by ""the devil"" to commit this crime or whether it was ""God"" who told him to do it. 

22The offender has had delusional states for some time. One of his delusions is that uniformed officers of this State are part of a ""secret service"" which is spying upon him. Such delusions may explain why the offender has committed so many assaults upon police and law enforcement officers. However, it is clear that the offender was angry, more angry than he normally was, when he ascertained that the AVO could not be removed and it appears that he lashed out at the first authority figure that he saw when re-entering the courthouse, the sheriff's officer wielding the handheld metal detector. 

23The offender told Dr Adams that on being admitted to prison he was placed in the Mental Health Screening Unit (MHSU) at the MRRC for approximately six weeks. The offender told Mr Adams that he ""got worse"" after his transfer into the MHSU. Nevertheless, Dr Adams tells me that from a review of the available Justice Health medical records the offender's mental state has improved since August 2010. He believed the record shows that the level of intensity of the offender's symptomatology has lessened and the distress caused by his symptomatology has diminished and he appears to attribute that to regular input from the mental health staff and the provision of appropriate psychiatric medication. 

24Doctor Adams reviewed the offender again on 16 February 2011 and noted an overall improvement in the offender's condition since his last examination of him. The offender admitted to Dr Adams on 16 February 2011 that he seemed to be more calm and better than he was on the last occasions. He believed that the voices which he heard were less severe and less preoccupying and the offender told Dr Adams that he thought he could better control the voices that he heard from time to time. Doctor Adams observed that the offender had an improvement with his sense of humour. Significantly, the offender denied to Dr Adams using any illicit substance since he had been incarcerated. 

25There is much to be said for the fact that the offender is improving. For example, the pre-sentence report commences with a recitation of the offender's prior contact with the Department of Corrective Services. The offender's prior contact with the Department of Corrective Services has been completely unsatisfactory. It is recorded thus: 

""Service records indicate that Mr Valahulu first came into contact with this Service in December 2007, when he received a term of imprisonment of 14 months, with a non-parole period of five months for the offence of common assault. 

Throughout that period of custody Mr Valahulu continued to use illicit substances and consequently suffered a psychotic episode. The offender was transferred to Long Bay Correctional Centre Hospital and was placed in a safe cell during which time he caused several thousand dollars worth of damage. He was reinstituted on anti psychotic medication and the Parole Order was revoked prior to release due to the offender's inability to secure suitable housing, his unwillingness to undertake appropriate intervention to address his alcohol and other drug related issues, his consistent non-compliance with mental health intervention and prescribed medication when in the community and he is assessed a high risk of re-offence. Overall it appears that Mr Valahulu consistently demonstrated an unwillingness to work with this Service in order to address his needs. 

Mr Valahulu was released to parole on 9 April 2008, following the attainment [sic] of suitable accommodation and the development of a community case management plan, including community mental health support and six additional parole conditions. The offender was considered to be in breach of this parole order one day after his release by virtue of a failure to follow the directions of this Service, failure to reside at the approved address, with his whereabouts considered to be unknown, and failure to engage with the community mental health team. Consequently the offender's Parole Order was revoked and he completed the remainder of his parole period in custody."" 

26However, the offender's response to supervision by Corrective Services since his incarceration for the current offence has been much more promising. The same pre-sentence report tells me this: 

""The offender's behaviour throughout custody has since improved. Currently housed within the MRRC the Mental Health ""Step Down Unit"" records note that the offender has made recent attempts to comply with Correctional Centre routine."" 

It would appear that with appropriate psychiatric treatment and compliance with psychiatric treatment and abstaining from illicit substances the offender's mental health has improved and also has his behaviour in custody and response to custody. On this occasion, unlike his earlier period of imprisonment, the offender has not been using illicit drugs whilst in custody. That ought augur well for the future, but I note that the offender told the lady who prepared the pre-sentence report that the offender himself believed that the improvement in his condition was the result of his praying. I am not one to deride the power of prayer but it must be accepted that a psychosis is an organic condition, that it is due to chemical abnormalities in the brain, and is controlled by appropriate psychiatric medication. The offender's behaviour and attitude may change with prayer but he must remain compliant with his treatment regime. 

27I note that in the past the offender has completed a six month residential rehabilitation program for his drug abuse in 2003 but returned to illicit substances immediately after he completed that program. Ms Connolly from the Probation and Parole Service believed that the offender had no insight into the negative impacts of his illicit substance abuse on his psychiatric condition. Throughout her interview with him he told her that he enjoyed using drugs because they ""felt nice"". 

28Clearly, at the time that the offender committed this assault upon Mr Rudd he was suffering from a mental illness. That attenuates his moral culpability for this vicious and brutal attack upon Mr Rudd. However the offender does bear some personal responsibility, evidenced by the fact that he has pleaded guilty to this charge rather than pleading insanity, and he admitted to Dr Adams being particularly angry on this day when he was told that the AVO could not be revoked. 

29The offender's mental health, his psychiatric illness and his reduced moral culpability for this crime make the sentence to be passed upon the offender not an appropriate vehicle for general deterrence. Fortunately there do not appear to have been many assaults upon sheriff's officers and neither the Crown nor the offender's solicitor nor I could find any case in which a sentence has earlier been imposed for an offence contrary to s 60A(3)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. It would appear that Mr Valahulu is the first person to stand for sentence for this offence. However, the authorities make it clear that sometimes for a violent offender, even with reduced moral culpability, the question becomes not only subjective deterrence but the protection of the community. That would seem to indicate that the offender should be kept out of the community for a lengthier period of time to ensure that others are not the potential victims of some assault that the offender might perpetrate. However, since the offender is prone to assaulting uniformed law enforcement officers, if he is locked up for a lengthy period of time he is exposed to uniformed law enforcement officers, namely Corrective Services officers. 

30The sentence I pass must deter the offender, must draw to his attention the fact that society cannot tolerate its law enforcement officers being assaulted as they try to carry out their work, for which they often receive little or no thanks or recognition, and the sentence I pass must do something to ensure the safety of our society, to ensure the offender's compliance with his psychiatric treatment, that he continues to take his psychotropic medication, to stay under the care of a mental health team and to ensure that he does not relapse to illicit drug use. I must consider the question of rehabilitation, which is one side of the coin, the other side of which is called the prospects of re-offending. It is hard to make any positive assessment of the prospects of rehabilitation. All I can say is that if the offender stays under the current treatment regime and abstains from illicit drug use, the prospects of rehabilitation are good. The question really is, how will the offender fare in the community once released to parole? What occurred in April 2008 does not augur well but the offender's response to his current incarceration was much better than his response to incarceration which commenced in December 2007. Things can only seen to be hopeful. 

31Bearing in mind the seriousness of this offence, the maximum penalty prescribed by Parliament, the offender's unfortunate criminal history, and the aggravating factor that this offence was committed whilst the offender was on bail, but bearing in mind the offender's reduced moral culpability for the crime, and on this occasion his positive response to incarceration, I believe the appropriate starting point for the current sentencing exercise is a head sentence of six years imprisonment. I reduce that by twenty-five per cent on account of the utilitarian value of the offender's plea of guilty at the earliest available opportunity. That fixes a head sentence of four years and six months. I believe the appropriate non-parole period to be three years imprisonment which will allow the offender to be released, at the discretion of the Parole Board, to parole at the expiration of three years and have the potential to have the offender under the direction of the Probation and Parole Service for eighteen months to ensure that any improvement which continues, and I trust it will, due to the offender's incarceration, in his mental health, will be continued on his release from custody and that the offender will abstain from illegal drug use. The offender must realise that the illegal drug use is likely to precipitate an episode of his psychosis, that is to make his condition worse, and lead to his committing crimes whilst acting out his delusions. 

32The remaining issue is when should I commence the sentence? The offender was taken into custody on the day that he committed this offence, 24 August 2010. However, part of the period since his going into custody can be attributed to the offence of the 6 July 2010 for which the Local Court at Campbelltown imposed a sentence of four months imprisonment commencing on 20 October 2010 which still seems to me, despite the explanation given to me by Ms Tawagi, an odd date on which to commence a period of imprisonment when the sentence was passed on 15 December 2010. However, I accede to the submission put to me on behalf of the offender that because the offender was in custody the Local Court did not consider any alternative to full-time imprisonment for the offence of common assault and full-time imprisonment for a common assault is not generally appropriate. I am, therefore, prepared to backdate the sentence to 24 August 2010. Clearly, in fixing the non-parole period which I have, is implicit a finding of special circumstances. The special circumstances are clearly the need for the offender to be closely supervised for a lengthy period on his release to parole to ensure that he remains compliant with his psychiatric treatment and that he abstains from illicit substances. 

33Vailoe Valahulu, on the charge that on 24 August 2010 at Liverpool you did recklessly, by punching, wound Daniel Rudd, a law enforcement officer, namely, a sheriff's officer, while in the execution of the said officer's duty, you are convicted. I sentence you to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of three years commencing on 24 August 2010 and expiring on 23 August 2013. I impose a further period of imprisonment of one and a half years to commence upon the expiration of the non-parole period and expiring on 23 February 2015. The total sentence therefore is four and a half years, comprising the non-parole period and the balance of the sentence. I have found special circumstances. You are eligible to be considered for release to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.

		21 November 2012",2011-04-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709863,Moss v R [2011] NSWCCA 86,"Judgment 

1SIMPSON J : The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court on 19 February 2010 following his conviction after trial on a charge of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm. Pursuant to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (under which the charge was brought) the offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years, and, pursuant to Pt 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act""), a standard non-parole period of 4 years. 

2Murrell DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months, made up of a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing on 28 October 2008, and a balance of term of 1 year and 9 months, which will expire on 27 July 2012. The non-parole period expired on 27 October 2010, and the applicant has been released to parole. Nevertheless, he remains subject to the sentence and liable, if he breaches the conditions of his parole, to be re-incarcerated. In sentencing the applicant, her Honour purported to impose certain specified conditions of parole, including not entering the street where the offence was committed (where the applicant had previously, and the victim did live), not to approach or contact the victim, and, on release from custody, to report to the Probation and Parole Service and accept the supervision of that Service for the whole of the parole period. Her Honour stated that this condition included accepting any direction of the Probation and Parole Service ""to undertake any drug and alcohol rehabilitation program"", specifically ""a fulltime live-in"" drug and alcohol program. 

3The applicant was, in fact, charged with a more serious offence, brought under s 33 of the Crimes Act , of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to do so (a charge which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years) and with the s 35(2) offence as an alternative. He entered a plea of guilty to the s 35(2) offence, but the Crown declined to accept that in satisfaction of the indictment, and the matter went to trial. The jury acquitted the applicant of the principal charge and convicted him of the s 35(2) offence. 

The facts 

4The offence was committed on 28 October 2008. The applicant and the victim both lived in a Housing Department development in Lilyfield. The victim, a 53 or 54 year old woman, suffers from bipolar disorder and a number of other conditions. There was a history of altercations between the applicant and the victim and, in November 2007, the victim obtained an interim Apprehended Violence Order against the applicant. That was confirmed in December 2007 by the issue of an Apprehended Violence Order for a period of 2 years. In February 2008, the applicant contravened that order, by shouting to the victim from his balcony and threatening her with violence. He was charged with the contravention, and was, on 13 February 2008, subjected to a good behaviour bond for a period of 12 months. He appealed against the severity of the sentence, but the appeal was dismissed and the bond confirmed. He was therefore, on 28 October 2008, subject to the conditions of the bond and on conditional liberty. As a result of her fears of the applicant, the victim wrote a number of letters to the Department of Housing expressing her concern. 

5Just before 28 October 2008 the applicant formed the belief that the victim was taking photographs of him and harassing him. On the morning of 28 October the victim went shopping and returned to her residence in her motor vehicle. She began to unpack her shopping. The applicant was nearby and believed that the victim had looked at him in a hostile manner. He approached her quickly, and, in a very short time (10 to 15 seconds) punched her several times. She fell to the ground, bleeding. The applicant ran off. The victim suffered some injuries, although at the lower end of the spectrum of injuries that constitute grievous bodily harm. They included multiple fractures of the bridge of the nose and a fracture to the right orbital bone. 

6The applicant was arrested later on the same day. He admitted that he had attacked the victim and asserted that the victim had been harassing and provoking him by, inter alia , taking photographs of him. He said that he had ""exploded"", ""lost control"", or ""just lost it"" and had fallen upon the victim ""like a lion falls upon its prey"". 

The personal circumstances of the applicant 

7The applicant was born in January 1959 and, was, at the time of the offence, 48 years of age. He is unemployed and in receipt of a disability pension. There was psychiatric evidence before Murrell DCJ that established that he suffered from a paranoid delusional disorder concerning the victim. 

8The applicant is single and has never married. He has had six de facto relationships, lasting various periods of time, from about two months to nine years. A child was born of the first of these. The applicant has been in receipt of a disability pension since 1994 but was unable to state the basis for that pension. 

9He has consumed alcohol to excess since the age of 20 years and has been an occasional user of drugs. 

10He has a criminal record which dates back to 1969, and includes entries for stealing, illegal use of motor vehicles, offences of dishonesty, driving offences, what are commonly called ""street offences"" and, most significantly, two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (in 1976). On each of these the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 2 years. However, his record ceased in 1997 and did not resume until 2008, when he was dealt with for contravention of the Apprehended Violence Order. 

11Psychological testing revealed anti-social characteristics in his personality adjustment and anger pathology. 

The Remarks on Sentence 

12Murrell DCJ comprehensively and clearly reviewed all of the evidence and arguments that had been put before her. It is unnecessary to review the whole of the Remarks on Sentence. Her Honour correctly assessed the objective seriousness of the offence, noting that the injuries were at the lower end of the spectrum of injuries constituting grievous bodily harm. She considered the applicant's mental illness to be a very important factor in the sentencing decision. She concluded that, by reason of his psychiatric disability, he was not an appropriate vehicle for the principles of general deterrence; that was because his mental illness contributed directly and critically to the commission of the offence. She considered that his mental illness did not elevate the danger which the applicant presents to the community. She declined to treat the need for specific deterrence as having any particular materiality. 

13She accepted a Victim Impact Statement from which she recognised that, from the victim's point of view, the offence had far reaching consequences, including her suffering post-traumatic stress disorder which deflected her from attending to her pre-existing psychological problems. Her Honour therefore accepted that the emotional harm caused by the offence was substantial. This was a reference to s 21A(2)(g) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. 

14She noted that the applicant was, by reason of the bond imposed following his earlier breach of the Apprehended Violence Order, as being at conditional liberty at the time of the offence, and that this was an aggravating feature for the purpose of s 21A(2)(j) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. 

15Pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, she found special circumstances that justified departure from the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence. Those circumstances were the applicant's complex psychological problems and the need for rehabilitation in relation to mental health and alcohol dependence. 

16In recognition of the applicant's plea of guilty to the charge of which he was ultimately convicted, she allowed a reduction in the sentence she otherwise would have imposed of 25 per cent. 

17Her Honour proceeded to impose the sentence I have set out above. 

18It is here worth mentioning, at the conclusion of the sentencing remarks, the applicant told Murrell DCJ that he was going to hang himself as soon as he arrived at the gaol. He then uttered some obscenities before being taken from the court. 

The application for leave to appeal 

19The applicant appears unrepresented on this application. He provided several pages of handwritten submissions. Most of these were references to matters found in his favour by Murrell DCJ: for example, he quoted that part of the judgment where her Honour referred to the relatively low level of grievous bodily harm suffered by the victim. He also referred to a part of the remarks in which her Honour noted that the crime was not planned and that no other person was involved. 

20I do not propose to re-state each of the matters raised by the applicant, since they cannot establish any error on the part of the sentencing judge. 

21The applicant did assert a factual error on the part of the judge. In one part of the Remarks on Sentence, in referring to the psychological evidence, Murrell DCJ said that the applicant had been under the impression that the victim was selling photographs of him to the gay community. She then said: 

""It was in these circumstances and in the context of an encounter between the offender and the victim on the previous night when the victim was minding her own business and walking her dog, that the offender lost control and, under the influence of his delusions, attacked the victim."" 

22As the Crown points out in her written submissions, this is explained by reference to a psychiatric report, which referred to an occasion when the applicant formed the belief that the victim was photographing him and harassing him. The ""attack"" to which she referred was the attack of 28 October. Although it is understandable that the applicant has misconstrued the remark, I am satisfied that her Honour did not take an erroneous view of the facts. 

23The applicant made extensive, comprehensive and articulate submissions to this Court. He sought to tender additional material to the Court, but accepted the ruling of the Court that the circumstances did not bring the material within the ""fresh evidence"" rules, and appeared to understand that this was so. 

24He expressly accepted that the sentence imposed was ""a fair one"", but wished to reiterate many of the matters found in his favour by Murrell DCJ. His acceptance of the fairness of the sentence, which in my opinion was properly and realistically made, is conclusive of his application. 

25The sentence is not manifestly excessive, and is not attended by any error. 

26Finally, however, the applicant complained of the parole conditions purportedly imposed by her Honour. He wrote: 

""11 To do with alcohol I haven't had a major problem with alcohol as far as hospitals, rehab, or other . So could you take that order away your Honour?"" (emphasis in original) 

27The Crown accepts that the order for parole and the conditions purportedly imposed exceeded the power of the court. Pursuant to s 50(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, where a sentence of imprisonment with a total term of 3 years or less is imposed, a court is required to direct release of the offender at the expiration of the non-parole period. No such power exists where the sentence exceeds 3 years, as does this sentence. 

28In my opinion the parole order purportedly made by her Honour has no effect, but it is appropriate that this Court set it aside. 

29In other respects, there is no merit in the various points made by the applicant. Her Honour properly took into account all relevant circumstances, most particularly the impact of the applicant's psychiatric condition. The sentence imposed was, as the applicant himself recognised, well within the range available to her. 

30I propose the following orders: 

(i) Leave to appeal granted; 

(ii) The appeal allowed to the extent that the order purportedly made with respect to the imposition of parole conditions is set aside; 

(iii) The appeal is otherwise dismissed. 

31DAVIES J : I agree with Simpson J. 

32GROVE AJ : I agree with Simpson J.

		11 April 2011",2011-04-10 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2709879,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Strang [2011] NSWSC 259,"Judgment 

1JOHNSON J : By Summons filed on 24 September 2010, the Plaintiff, the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), appeals from a decision of a Magistrate dismissing a charge of entering inclosed lands, without lawful excuse, under s.4 Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901 ( ""ILP Act"" ) against the Defendant, Graeme Edwin Strang. 

2The Plaintiff contends that the Magistrate erred in law in dismissing the charge and that an order should be made under s.59(2) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 setting aside the order of dismissal and remitting the matter to the Burwood Local Court to be dealt with according to law. 

3As will be seen, the appeal turns upon the meaning of the term ""inclosed lands"" in the ILP Act in the context of the facts of this case. 

4Ms Webster of counsel appeared for the Plaintiff at the hearing of the appeal. The Defendant appeared for himself in this Court and resisted the claim for relief. The Defendant had been furnished with the Summons and supporting affidavit, the Local Court transcripts and the Plaintiff's written submissions well before the hearing in this Court. 

The Charge Under the ILP Act 

5The Defendant was charged by Court Attendance Notice with the following offence under s.4(1)(b) ILP Act: 

""... On 21 December 2009, at Burwood [he] did without lawful excuse enter into the inclosed lands of Best & Less situate at Burwood Plaza Burwood without the consent of Best & Less Pty Limited the owner of the said inclosed lands."" 

The Local Court Hearing 

6The hearing of the charge commenced before the Local Court on 19 March 2010, and continued to its conclusion on 10 June 2010. A police prosecutor appeared to prosecute the matter and the Defendant was unrepresented. It appears that on a prior occasion (14 January 2010) the Defendant failed or refused to enter a plea so that the Court directed that it should proceed to hear and determine the matter as if a plea of not guilty had been entered: s.194(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 . 

7The prosecutor called three witnesses - Constable Benjamin Collings, Genevieve Hamoir and Houda Omran. Ms Hamoir and Ms Omran were both employees of Best & Less Pty Limited. In addition, a document and photographs were tendered in the prosecution case. 

8The evidence adduced in the Local Court revealed what follows. 

9On 31 October 2009, there was served on the Defendant, addressed to ""Graeme Strange"" , a ""notice of prohibited entry"" (Exhibit 3). This notice had the effect of indefinitely prohibiting the recipient from entering or being on any retail premises owned or operated by Best & Less Pty Limited. 

10The notice, dated 31 October 2009, referred to the ILP Act. There is no provision in the ILP Act for the service of such a notice. It may be taken that the form of notice is used by Best & Less Pty Limited to indicate to the recipient that the person is prohibited from entering or being on retail premises owned or operated by that company, and that the ILP Act will be relied upon for that purpose. The issue in this Court is whether the ILP Act can apply to these premises. 

11The notice was issued by Ms Hamoir, an assistant manager for Best & Less Pty Limited. It was her evidence that she had seen the Defendant before, in numerous stores where she had worked. She completed the notice at the Best & Less Roselands store on 31 October 2009. The notice specified ""indecent conduct"" as the reason for its issue . Her evidence was that the Defendant refused to accept service or to sign the notice on 31 October 2009, but that she had explained its effect to him. Although the notice misspelt the Defendant's name ( ""Strange"" rather than ""Strang"" ), it contained his correct date of birth and address. 

12Under cross-examination by the Defendant, Ms Hamoir explained why she had issued the notice to the Defendant. She said (T43.11, 19 March 2010): 

""I was instructed due to the fact that an incident happened in another store that some inappropriate behaviour had occurred, some things were said to a staff member and we cannot take that chance to have that possibly occur again in one of our stores hence why we issued the banning notice."" 

13On 21 December 2009, Ms Omran, then an assistant manager at the Burwood Best & Less store, saw a male aged about 50 years, dressed in women's clothing, inside the store. She recognised the male as a person she knew to be banned from Best & Less stores. Ms Omran identified the male as the Defendant. It was her evidence that she called police, kept the Defendant under observation and followed him out of the store. 

14Constable Collings gave evidence that he attended the Burwood Best & Less store on 21 December 2009 and viewed security footage, showing a male approximately 50 years of age, wearing female attire, inside that store. Constable Collings said that he recognised the male as the Defendant, with whom he had had past dealings. A copy of the photographic images of the Defendant and the video recording, were admitted into evidence (Exhibits 1 and 2). 

15The prosecution closed its case at the conclusion of evidence on 10 June 2010. The Magistrate then raised with the prosecution the question of whether the Best & Less store could fall within the definition of ""inclosed lands"" in s.3(1) ILP Act. The prosecutor made submissions on this issue. The Magistrate did not call upon the Defendant to make submissions on this issue. This was an understandable approach given the legal nature of the question, the Defendant's unrepresented status and the fact that, if his Honour remained of that view, it would see the prosecution determined in the Defendant's favour. 

16After submissions from the prosecutor, his Honour gave judgment on the question of a prima facie case. His Honour was satisfied that a prima facie case existed on the other elements of the offence. He said (T29.34, 10 June 2010): 

""The prosecution evidence is capable of establishing, at this point, that Mr Strang was given a notice and informed verbally that he was no longer permitted to enter premises anywhere that were occupied by Best and Less. He said that despite that express prohibition, nevertheless, he entered Best and Less premises on 21 December. There is evidence before me capable of establishing that on 21 December he did, indeed, enter premises occupied by Best and Less. 

The notice given to him in writing and verbally, if I accept that it occurred, would have made it clear to Mr Strang that he had no authority to enter those premises and, therefore, [it] might be argued that his entry on to them was without lawful excuse. The evidence adduced in the prosecution case, therefore, is capable of satisfying each of the elements of the offence. 

The question which I have raised is a legal one, and that is whether the lands in question are enclosed [sic] lands, as that term is defined in [s.3(1)] of the Act."" 

17After reciting the definition of ""inclosed lands"" in s.3(1) ILP Act, his Honour continued (T30.9, 10 June 2010): 

""Now, clearly just by recitation of the definition, and by examination of section 4 in its entirety, it is clear, or it becomes clear as the real origins and objective of the provision. 

The building in question here is a one of multiple occupancy, a large shopping complex. In order to get to Best and Less, the defendant had to first enter through the entrance into the shopping centre proper, move someway through the shopping centre until he came to that part of the building, or the interior of the building, occupied by Best and Less, Best and Less being a commercial organisation and the building being occupied by many other commercial organisations, each of which has, I think, I can properly take judicial notice of, the control and management of the spaces assigned to them. 

Now, the definition that I have just quoted refers to enclosed lands, which might be enclosed by, for example any wall or other erection, and I think that portion that [the] prosecution would rely on as describing the area occupied by Best and Less and satisfying, for the purpose of section 4, the concept of enclosed lands. 

Now, on its face that appears to be so, but it is a space apparently enclosed by walls but with a significant public entrance. It is a commercial organisation and the public are invited to attend it during its open hours through a door or space, which remains open throughout its trading hours, and it is closed otherwise. Upon being closed, of course, it prevents any entry, except for those who have got some way of opening the door, but it would have the effect of excluding the general public. It is a barrier once closed. 

This is, as I said, a retail store It is open to the public. The general public are invited to attend for the purpose of inspecting and purchasing the goods for sale therein. Now, the issue that arises is whether this large enclosed space, to which the general public are invited, does it fall within the notion of enclosed lands as appears in section 3?"" 

18Although his Honour's reasons did not expand upon the proposition expressed in the first paragraph contained in the above quotation concerning ""the real origins and objective of the provision"" , some light is shed upon his Honour's approach from a discussion between the Magistrate and the prosecutor a little earlier in the course of submissions. The following discussion took place (T17.6, 10 June 2010): 

""HIS HONOUR: Putting aside the matters of fact that have been traversed in the evidence of the witnesses from whom I've heard, it seems to me that there is an issue as to whether a store of this kind qualifies as enclosed lands. 

PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Now the definition of enclosed lands is contained in section 3 of the Enclosed [sic] Lands Protection Act. 

PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: And it's an old Act, and I think its original application was intended to be more to rural or property enclosed by fences. 

PROSECUTOR: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: But its [sic] been, sort of, pressed into modern service without any real attempt to modernise it, and the Act derives from 1901. 

PROSECUTOR: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: And the definition of enclosed lands, or paragraph 8, it is clear, and there's been no submission that these are prescribed premises. 

PROSECUTOR: No, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: So, therefore, in order to succeed, you have to bring these premises within paragraph (b) of the definition, which is contained in subsection (1) of section (3), which is in these terms: 

[His Honour quoted the definition] 

Of course, that definition, sort of, betrays the real origins and the intent of the original Act or this part of it."" 

19It will be observed that the final paragraph in this extract uses similar language to the first paragraph contained in the quotation at [17] above. This aspect assumed some significance given the arguments advanced to this Court on appeal. 

20The Magistrate identified the question as being a legal one, namely whether the lands in question are ""inclosed lands"" as defined in s.3(1) ILP Act. His Honour observed (correctly) that there was little authority available on the question. He referred to a number of decisions, none of which was directly on point. Reference was made by his Honour to Webb v Epstein (1955) VLR 462, Director of Public Prosecutions v Butterworth (NSW Supreme Court, McInerney J, 6 November 1996) and Giddings v Director of Public Prosecutions [2008] NSWSC 169; 181 A Crim R 536. His Honour had particular regard to the decision in Giddings v Director of Public Prosecutions , which related to a hotel. 

21The critical part of the Magistrate's reasons for finding no prima facie case is contained in the following extract (the word ""enclosed"" where it appears should be read as ""inclosed"" ) (T32-33, 10 June 2010): 

""What can be taken from those decisions? Now, the decision of Mclnerney J in Butterworth clearly conveys the notion that the protection of privacy perhaps, or the right to possession and peaceful enjoyment of lands appears to be, in his opinion, the purpose of a scheme. That notion builds on the same concept that emerges from the Victorian decision of Webb v Epstein. 

In the case of Giddings v DPP, therefore, James J, in the paragraph that I have just cited, was clearly of the opinion that the Enclosed Lands Protection Act did not extend to a hotel. 

Now, regrettably, for my purposes, at least, he did not go on to explain exactly why, but the word that he used was, incapable of extending to the hotel, which clearly implies that there was something in the nature of a hotel which, in his opinion, disqualified a structure of that kind from inclusion within the notion of enclosed lands. 

Now, the decision does not reveal exactly where in the hotel the person in question was situated but from paragraph 8, it seems, that the person was in an ordinary part of the hotel, where one might expect to be served drink or food. Hotels are frequently called, public house. It is a place to which members of the public are invited, and there to purchase and consume food, drink, and more often than not as well, to seek accommodation. It is a building with walls and doors in the usual way. Some hotels are free standing, others are part of other structures. The important thing, I think, ensues, or the important features ensures, for example, Best and Less, the matter before me, is a structure consisting of walls with doors through which member of the public may enter and to which members of the public are invited for commercial reasons, invited there for the purpose of sale to them of things which might be particular to hotels, but similar to the extent that Best and Less things are also sold to the public, although of a different kind. Now, I am left with this outcome, after surveying those authorities. For the purpose - James J, as I have said has decided that it is not possible for the Enclosed Lands Protection Act to extend to a hotel. As much as I can discern for the reasons for that, that conclusion is followed immediately by the words, 'Where there were members of the public who were drinking'. 

The common threa [d] that runs through the Victorian case, the case of Butterworth before Mclnerney J and James J appears to be the notion that where the public are invited, in some general way, the Enclosed Lands Act has no application or, at least, this portion of it. As for the reasons for that conclusion perhaps the explanation lies in the notion as I have already mentioned, that arises from [Webb v Epstein] , that the intention is to be protective of people's right to privacy, the ability to exclude the public generally to protect the right of occupancy of land to protect the right to enjoy land to the exclusion of any others that the occupant desires to exclude and in that explanation possibly lies the reason why James J was of the opinion the Act has no application to a hotel. 

Whatever be his reason, his decision is a fact, and one which I must take cognisance of. It seems to me that although there are very different commercial activities in a hotel compared to Best and Less, that the essential characteristics of each building for the purposes of this matter are the same. That is, commercial premises selling things to the public. The public are invited, en masse, to attend, and I cannot see any reason to distinguish Best and Less from a hotel that James J said was incapable of being included within the Act. 

FOR THOSE REASONS, THEREFORE, I CONCLUDE THAT THE DEFINITION OF ENCLOSED LANDS PROTECTION ACT DOES NOT EXTEND TO BEST AND LESS IN THE CONTEXT IN WHICH IT HAS BEEN RAISED WITH ME. FOR THAT REASON THE COURT ATTENDANCE NOTICE IS DISMISSED."" 

Relevant Provisions in ILP Act 

22The terms ""inclosed lands"" and ""prescribed premises"" are defined in s.3(1) ILP Act in the following terms: 

""Inclosed lands means: 

(a) prescribed premises, or 

(b) any land, either public or private, inclosed or surrounded by any fence, wall or other erection, or partly by a fence, wall or other erection and partly by a canal or by some natural feature such as a river or cliff by which its boundaries may be known or recognised, including the whole or part of any building or structure and any land occupied or used in connection with the whole or part of any building or structure. 

prescribed premises means land occupied or used in connection with any of the following: 

(a) a government school or a registered non-government school within the meaning of the Education Reform Act 1990, 

(b) a child care service, 

(c) a hospital, 

(d) a nursing home within the meaning of the Public Health Act 1991, 

and any building or structure erected on that land, but does not include all or part of any building or structure that is for the time being occupied or used for a purpose unconnected with the conduct of such a school, child care service, hospital or nursing home."" 

23Section 4 ILP Act provides as follows: 

""4 Unlawful entry on inclosed lands 

(1) Any person who, without lawful excuse (proof of which lies on the person), enters into inclosed lands without the consent of the owner, occupier or person apparently in charge of those lands, or who remains on those lands after being requested by the owner, occupier or person apparently in charge of those lands to leave those lands, is liable to a penalty not exceeding: 

(a) 10 penalty units in the case of prescribed premises, or 

(b) 5 penalty units in any other case. 

(1A) A drover or person in charge of stock being driven on a road lawfully inclosed within the lands of any person has a lawful excuse for entering those lands for the purpose of preventing the stock from straying, or regaining control of stock that have strayed, from that road. 

(2) Where a road is lawfully inclosed with the lands of any person, and such road is not clearly defined but there is a reasonably defined track commonly used by persons passing through such lands, the centre of such track shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be the centre of the road. 

(3) Where a road is lawfully inclosed with the lands of any person and such road is not clearly defined and there is no reasonably defined track through such lands a person passing through such inclosed lands shall not be guilty of an offence unless it is shown that the route taken by such person in so passing was, having regard to the circumstances, unreasonable. 

(4) In this section, stock includes horses, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and camels."" 

Appeal to this Court 

24The Plaintiff's Summons contended that his Honour erred in law in: 

(a) ruling that premises to which the general public are invited could not in law be inclosed lands within the meaning of s.3 of the ILP Act; 

(b) dismissing the matter. 

25Ms Webster submitted that the Best & Less premises at Burwood were capable of falling within the definition of ""inclosed lands"" in s.3(1) ILP Act. Counsel submitted that an examination of the legislative history of the ILP Act indicated a broadening of the definition of ""inclosed lands"" with particular reference to amendments effected in 1939, 1979 and 1987. 

26Ms Webster referred to a number of decisions which bear upon the meaning of the term ""inclosed lands"" in the ILP Act. Particular reference was made to Webb v Epstein , Director of Public Prosecutions v Butterworth and Giddings v Director of Public Prosecutions , it being submitted that these decisions did not support the construction adopted by the Magistrate. 

27Counsel submitted that the conclusion reached by the Magistrate involved an unduly restrictive interpretation of the ILP Act. She submitted that the correct approach was to construe the definition of ""inclosed lands"" and that, having done so, the subject premises in this case fell within that definition. 

28Ms Webster submitted that it was clear on the authorities that there is no need (in order for the ILP Act to apply) for there to be a continuous barrier, or perhaps any barrier, surrounding the subject lands. It was submitted for the Plaintiff that all that is required is some feature, whether natural or man made, which marks out the boundaries with sufficient clarity: Webb v Epstein ; Director of Public Prosecutions v Butterworth . 

29It was submitted that, in the present case, the boundaries were clear. The entry to the Best & Less store was clearly marked by a change in colour of the floor tiling, by the presence of clothing goods on racks just inside the door, and by other visible signs. She submitted that, whilst the premises were a retail store, which might be seen as extending an ""invitation"" to members of the public to enter for proper purposes, they nonetheless remained private property. There could be no doubt, she submitted, that the Defendant was aware that the interior of any Best & Less store was a place to which he was not invited and, in fact, was specifically prohibited from entering. 

30To put the argument another way, Ms Webster submitted that the authorisation of a limited number or class of persons to enter a piece of land is not necessarily inconsistent with the land being ""inclosed lands"". She provided examples of a family home to which immediate family members are permitted access, or a part of a worksite to which authorised employees are permitted entry. There may be no barrier of any substance on lands such as these, but this will not necessarily deny their status as ""inclosed lands"" under the ILP Act, provided the boundaries are sufficiently clear. 

31Ms Webster submitted that it is both artificial and contrary to the terms of the ILP Act to deny its application in the circumstances of this case. She submitted that, in effect, the Magistrate had elided two issues - the question of whether the premises were ""inclosed lands"" (a question to be answered by reference to the physical description of the premises) and the question whether there was a ""lawful excuse"" for persons to enter the premises (a question to be considered by reference to the giving of access to the public at large and the restriction of access to identified members of the public). Ms Webster submitted that the determination whether the premises were capable of being ""inclosed lands"" did not involve any consideration as to whether the premises were open to the general public. 

32Ms Webster submitted that the order dismissing the proceedings against the Defendant should be set aside and the matter remitted to the Local Court to be dealt with according to law. 

33The Defendant, who impressed as an articulate and intelligent person, advanced a number of submissions on the appeal. He took the Court to the history of the ILP Act and submitted that its origins lay in a rural and agricultural context and that, despite amendments since 1901, those aspects still control effectively the application of the statute. 

34The Defendant observed that he had not been called on in the Local Court to make submissions on this point and that, if he had been, he would have advanced further arguments to the Local Court. He developed those arguments on appeal to this Court. 

35He pointed to the terms of s.4, and the references in s.4(1A) to a ""drover"" and ""stock"" , as providing a flavour to the legislation which demonstrated its true application. He submitted that the Act does not apply to commercial or retail premises, in particular in an interior space within a shopping centre complex. Rather, the Defendant submitted that the ILP Act is concerned with application in an agricultural or rural context. 

36The Defendant submitted that, if the legislature wished to extend the definition of ""inclosed lands"" to premises such as retail premises contained within a commercial shopping complex, then that object could be achieved by an amendment to the definition of ""prescribed premises"" in s.3(1) ILP Act. However, he submitted that the words contained in paragraph (b) of the definition of ""inclosed lands"" were not capable of extending to premises such as those of Best & Less at Burwood. 

Determination 

37The question for determination on appeal is whether the Magistrate has erred in law in finding that the Best & Less store at Burwood is not capable of falling within the terms of paragraph (b) of the definition of ""inclosed lands"" in s.3 ILP Act. 

38It will be apparent that his Honour did not have the benefit of the detailed analysis of the legislative history and case law which is available to this Court, and which follows. 

39The starting point involves construction of the ILP Act and, in particular, ss.3 and 4 of that Act. An understanding of the legislative history of these provisions will assist in construing the sections in their present form: Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Dick [2007] NSWCA 190; 226 FLR 388 at 393 [26]. 

40The first ILP Act was passed in 1854. The 1901 Act was described, in 1913, as a consolidation of the 1854 Act and an intervening statute which amended that Act: Maybury v Plowman [1913] HCA 43; 16 CLR 468 at 473. 

41Despite its original rural and agricultural flavour, it has been said in a number of decisions that the ILP Act applies to both rural and urban lands: In the Appeal of Thompson (1950) WN(NSW) 183; Press v Tuckwell (1968) 69 SR(NSW) 17 at 19. 

42In Treweeke v Benson (1936) 53 WN(NSW) 151, Owen AJ, at 152, described the ILP Act in the following way: 

""The Act makes trespass on inclosed lands a penal offence. It is clear from the definition of 'inclosed land' in the Act that the legislature intended that a criminal charge of trespass to land should lie only where the limits of the land upon which the trespass occurs are clearly defined so as to be known and recognised."" 

43An important amendment was made to the ILP Act in 1979. At that time, an offence of trespass was contained in s.50(1) Summary Offences Act 1970 , which provided as follows: 

""A person who enters or remains in or upon any part of a building or structure, or any land occupied or used in connection therewith, and has no reasonable cause for so doing is guilty of an offence. 

Penalty: $200.00 or imprisonment for three months."" 

44Aspects of this provision were considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Bacon (1977) 2 NSWLR 507, a decision dealing essentially with the concept of ""reasonable cause"" . 

45In 1979, the Summary Offences Act 1970 was repealed. Amongst the legislation enacted as part of that repeal process was the Inclosed Lands Protection (Summary Offences) Amendment Act 1979 . Section 3 of the 1979 Act amended the ILP Act in the following way: 

""3. The Inclosed Lands Protection Act, 1901, is amended - 

(1) by inserting in the definition of 'Inclosed lands' in section 3 after the word 'recognised' the words ', and includes any building or structure or any part thereof, and any land occupied or used in connection with a building or structure or any part thereof'; 

(2) by omitting from section 4(1) the words 'in charge of the same.' and by inserting instead the words 'apparently in charge of the same or remains upon the inclosed lands of another person after being requested by the owner or occupier or person apparently in charge of those lands to leave those lands,'; 

(3) by inserting after section 4 the following section:- 

4A. Any person, who remains upon the inclosed lands of another person after being requested by the owner or occupier or the person apparently in charge of those lands to leave those lands and while remaining upon those lands behaves, without reasonable excuse, in such a manner as would be likely to cause reasonable persons justifiably in all the circumstances to be seriously alarmed or seriously affronted, shall be liable to a penalty of $200."" 

46In the second reading speech with respect to the Summary Offences (Repeal) Bill and cognate Bills, including the Inclosed Lands Protection (Summary Offences) Amendment Bill , the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mr Walker, said (Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 23 April 1979, page 4917 at page 4925): 

""The Inclosed Lands Protection (Summary Offences) Amendment Bill reformulates the law currently contained in sections 49 and 50 of the Summary Offences Act. These sections relate to the entering or remaining in or upon buildings, or land used in connection therewith, without lawful excuse. Clause 3 (a) of the bill extends the definition of inclosed lands in section 3 of the Act to include any building or structure or any part thereof, and any land occupied or used in connection with a building or structure or any part thereof. Subclause (b) extends the offence of unlawfully entering upon enclosed land to include remaining upon such land after having been requested to leave by the owner, occupier or person apparently in charge of the land. Clause 3 (c) inserts a new section in the Act making it an offence for a person remaining upon the inclosed lands of another person after being requested by the owner, or occupier, or the person apparently in charge of these lands to leave, to behave in such a manner as would be likely to cause reasonable persons justifiably in all the circumstances to be seriously alarmed or seriously affronted. Thus the offence is in terms similar to the offence under clause 5 of the offences in public places bill. A similar penalty of $200 will apply."" 

47The effect of the 1979 amendments was to abolish the trespass offence previously contained in s.50 Summary Offences Act 1970 and to utilise the ILP Act to cover trespass offences of that type. That this was the intention of the amendment is confirmed in an article by John Andrews (as his Honour then was) entitled ""'Repeal' of the New South Wales Summary Offences Act"" [1979] 3 Crim LJ 295 at 300-301. 

48It is necessary to keep in mind the nature and purpose of the 1979 amendment to the ILP Act in considering earlier decisions concerning the meaning of ""inclosed lands"" in the ILP Act. The critical part of the 1979 amendment was to include in the definition of ""inclosed lands"" the words ""and includes any building or structure or any part thereof, and any land occupied or used in connection with a building or structure or any part thereof"" . In my view, these are words of considerable breadth and the effect of the amendment was to alter in a significant respect the meaning of ""inclosed lands"" in s.3 ILP Act. 

49In 1987, the definition of ""inclosed lands"" was amended again by the Miscellaneous Acts (Education and Public Instruction) Repeal and Amendment Act 1987 . Following that amendment, the definition of ""inclosed lands"" was in the following terms: 

""'Inclosed lands"" means - 

(a) a school; or 

(b) any land, either public or private, inclosed or surrounded by any fence, wall or other erection, or partly by a fence, wall or other erection and partly by a canal or by some natural feature such as a river or cliff by which its boundaries may be known or recognized, including the whole or part of any building or structure and any land occupied or used in connection with the whole or part of any building or structure."" 

50It will be apparent that there was some alteration to the wording of the definition in paragraph (b) from that which had been inserted as part of the 1979 amendments. However, the alterations do not appear to affect the substance of that part of the definition and its meaning. 

51It has been said that s.4(1) ILP Act creates two offences, one being an offence of entering into inclosed lands without lawful excuse, and the other an offence of remaining upon such lands (without lawful excuse) when asked to leave: Black v Carrabs (NSW Supreme Court, Finlay J, 11 March 1988) 9 Petty Sessions Review 4045 at 4047; Director of Public Prosecutions v Wille [1999] NSWSC 661; 47 NSWLR 255 at 257-258 [14]. 

52That the terms of ss.3 and 4 ILP Act are capable of extending to a variety of lands is apparent from the range of locations to which prosecutions under the section have applied since 1979. These include a private clinic ( Darcey v Pre-Term Foundation Clinic (1983) 2 NSWLR 497), part of a police station ( Alla v Gleeson (NSW Supreme Court, Roden J, 25 October 1985, page 10, BC8500455)); part of an airport complex ( Minkley v Munro (NSW Supreme Court, Grove J, 22 August 1986; 8 Petty Sessions Review 3975), the Sydney Cricket Ground ( Black v Carrabs ), rented suburban residential premises ( McDermott v Bogg (NSW Supreme Court, Carruthers J, 12 March 1991, BC9102240)), community housing in Casino ( Barns v Edwards (1993) 31 NSWLR 714), the carpark of the Cronulla Sutherland Leagues Club ( Dearing v Passi (NSW Supreme Court, Levine J, 4 November 1994, B9403632)), the M2 construction site ( Director of Public Prosecutions v Butterworth ), the eastern distributor site near Sydney airport ( Director of Public Prosecutions v Wille ) and rural tracks in the Macksville area ( Simpson v Bagnall [2000] NSWSC 930). 

53In Alla v Gleeson , Roden J noted the width of the definition of ""inclosed lands"" (at page 10): 

""It may well be that his refusal to leave that private part of the police station constituted an offence under the Inclosed Lands Protection Act, 1901 as amended. Indeed the definition of 'inclosed lands' in that Act is so wide that a refusal to leave the foyer of the police station, which is a 'public place', may also be an offence. If that be so, then under the provisions of s 5(5) of the Intoxicated Persons Act, the plaintiff could not be lawfully detained under that Act by reason of that conduct."" 

54I do not think that the Victorian decision in Webb v Epstein provides great assistance in resolving the question of construction and application to the New South Wales Act. The decision involves a different factual context to this case. To the extent that the decision states that a continuous barrier is not required to delineate the relevant boundaries, it provides assistance to the Plaintiff. 

55Likewise, the decision of McInerney J in Director of Public Prosecutions v Butterworth assists the Plaintiff and not the Defendant on the present appeal. In that case, the Magistrate had concluded that, for lands to be ""inclosed lands"" within the meaning of the ILP Act, it was necessary that the fence or erection by which the lands were inclosed at the M2 construction site be of some enduring nature, and that it was insufficient if it took the form of a temporary structure which was moveable on a daily basis. 

56McInerney J held that the Magistrate had erred. His Honour held that a permanent or enduring structure was not required. In the factual context of that case, his Honour said that: 

""... the importance of the definition is that an area is clearly defined so as to be known and recognised as a particular area to which members of the public have no right of entry."" 

57I do not take his Honour's statement as requiring in every case that ""inclosed lands"" might involve an area to which members of the public have no right of entry. It was apparent that a boundary with that attribute was required in that case so that there would be a clearly defined boundary for members of the public to see in the area of a construction site. 

58There is no doubt here that the boundaries to Best & Less at Burwood were clearly identified. 

59Similarly, I do not think that the decision in Giddings v Director of Public Prosecutions provides any real assistance for the conclusion reached by the Magistrate in this case. As his Honour acknowledged in his reasons (see [21] above), that case involved a hotel, and only part of the judgment touched upon the ILP Act. What the Magistrate has done in the present case is to infer or assume that James J was building in to the definition of ""inclosed lands"" in the ILP Act, a requirement that the relevant premises or area be reserved for the use of the occupier and persons authorised by him to enter and not be open to members of the public. With respect, I think this is reading too much into the relatively short passage in James J's judgment where the ILP Act was mentioned. 

60In any event, it is necessary to apply the definition of ""inclosed lands"" in s.3 ILP Act by reference to the factual circumstances of the present case. I accept that James J's conclusion involved a determination based upon the particular facts of that case. However, it did not constitute a type of general statement concerning the proper construction of s.3 ILP Act and the requirements for premises to fall within the meaning of ""inclosed lands"" . As James J observed, that particular part of the decision was made with reluctance as the issue had not been raised in the Local Court, and was expressed relatively briefly in his Honour's judgment. 

61I think that the decision in Giddings v Director of Public Prosecutions is distinguishable and does not constitute a foundation for the conclusion reached by the Magistrate in this case, based upon a type of extrapolation of the reasons of James J. 

62I accept the Plaintiff's submission that the approach taken by the Magistrate in this case elided the question whether the premises are capable of falling within the definition of ""inclosed lands"" and the separate question whether persons who may have access to the premises have a lawful excuse for doing so. 

63To the extent that the present appeal raises a question of construction of ss.3(1) and 4 ILP Act including the term ""inclosed lands"" , the objective of statutory construction is to give to the words of the statute the meaning which the legislature is taken to have intended them to have: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; 194 CLR 355 at 384 [78]. 

64The definition of ""inclosed lands"" does not purport to exclude commercial or retail premises. Nor does it purport to exclude premises which are contained within a larger building such as a commercial shopping centre or complex. Nor does it require that the boundaries exclude members of the public. 

65It is common ground in this case that the Best & Less premises at Burwood are not ""prescribed premises"" for the purpose of paragraph (a) of the definition of ""inclosed lands"" . 

66However, there is the second leg of the definition contained in paragraph (b). That definition is expressed in wide terms, as Roden J observed in Alla v Gleeson . The statutory device utilised in the 1979 and 1987 amendments was to add words to the definition upon the basis that ""inclosed lands"" in paragraph (b) ""includes"" certain places or, as the definition now stands, ""including"" those places. 

67In my view, the use of this terminology has an expansive operation upon the meaning and extent of the term ""inclosed lands"" in s.3(1) ILP Act: YZ Finance Company Pty Limited v Cummings [1964] HCA 12; 109 CLR 395 at 398-399, 401-403; Pearce and Geddes , ""Statutory Interpretation in Australia"" , 6 th edn, LexisNexis, 2006, [6.56]-[6.60]. The word ""includes"" has been said to have an exhaustive meaning where the context in which it appears indicates an intention to confine a general word by providing a limited list of words: Victims Compensation Fund v Brown [2002] NSWCA 155; 54 NSWLR 668 at 674 [30]. However, the words ""includes"" or ""including"" do not indicate an intention to confine the general earlier words in paragraph (b) of the definition but, rather, to expand those words by the use of very general terms, and thus to point to a broad definition of ""inclosed lands"" . This construction is confirmed by the legislative history, whereby those words were added to the definition in 1979. 

68I am satisfied that the Best & Less premises at Burwood, as revealed by the evidence, fall within the terms of the definition of ""inclosed lands"" , which extends to the ""whole or part of any building or structure and any land occupied or used in connection with the whole or part of any building or structure"" . 

69The fact that the Best & Less store lies within a larger multi-storeyed commercial shopping complex does not prevent it from falling within this definition. The Best & Less premises constitute part of the building or structure. They are open during certain parts of the day and closed at other parts of the day. They are private commercial premises. The boundaries of the Best & Less premises at Burwood are clearly delineated by the doorway to the premises and the internal walls which surround the premises. The fact that members of the public may enter the premises for the purposes of perusing merchandise and shopping does not prevent the premises being ""inclosed lands"" for the purposes of s.3(1) ILP Act. 

70Whether members of the public are allowed access to premises does not, in my view, bear upon the question of the status of the premises as ""inclosed lands"". As a matter of law, the subject premises are capable of falling within the statutory definition. 

71Of course, it may be that the application of s.4 ILP Act to ""inclosed lands"" such as this is confined, in a practical way, to two scenarios. 

72Firstly, the offence of entering into inclosed lands may be confined, in practice, to persons who have been expressly prohibited from entering the premises, because otherwise a member of the public will be able to demonstrate a lawful excuse for entering the premises as a shopper. 

73Secondly, a member of the public who has entered the inclosed lands as a shopper may commit the second type of offence under s.4(1) by remaining on those lands, after being requested to leave. Such a scenario may arise if the person is requested to leave the retail premises for any reason and remains on those lands, refusing to leave. The second scenario would arise where there is an event giving rise to an ad hoc request to leave, with the person refusing to leave. 

74In my view, both of these scenarios are open and available within the terms of the ILP Act. Whether an offence is committed will, of course, depend upon the facts of the particular case. However, for the purpose of assessing whether a prima facie case exists, either of these scenarios would involve a prima facie case by reference to all elements including the status of the premises as ""inclosed lands"" . 

75I am satisfied that the Magistrate erred in law in this case in his construction and application of the definition of ""inclosed lands"" in the ILP Act. 

Remittal of Proceedings 

76In the event that the Court determined that the Magistrate had erred in law, the Plaintiff submitted that the order of dismissal should be set aside and the matter remitted to the Local Court to be determined according to law. 

77The Defendant submitted that the Court should, in the exercise of discretion, decline to remit the matter having regard to the availability only of a monetary penalty and what he submitted was the likelihood of an order under s.10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 if the offence was found proved, and also his impecunious state. 

78I have found that the Magistrate erred in law in his conclusion that there was no prima facie case and that the proceedings ought be dismissed. I consider that the appropriate course is to remit the matter to the Local Court to enable that Court, as the trial Court, to hear and determine the matter according to law. Such an approach is consistent with the proper relationship between the Supreme Court and the Local Court in statutory appeals with respect to criminal matters: Director of Public Prosecutions v Belani [2005] NSWSC 1013; 64 NSWLR 319 at 333 [68]. 

79It will be a matter for the Local Court, at the remitted hearing, to determine the matters and to conclude whether the Defendant is guilty of the offence charged. In the event that the offence is found proved, the question of penalty will be a matter for the Local Court. In the circumstances of the case, it could not be assumed that the matter would be dealt with by way of an order under s.10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 although that, of course, remains a matter for the Magistrate if the offence is proved. 

Costs 

80Ms Webster submitted that, in the event that the appeal succeeded, the Defendant ought be ordered to pay the Plaintiff's costs of the proceedings, but that it would be appropriate, in the circumstances of the case, to grant a certificate under the Suitors' Fund Act 1951 . 

81The Defendant submitted that he is impecunious and that no order for costs should be made. 

82The ordinary rule is that costs should follow the event. The Defendant has appeared in this Court to unsuccessfully oppose the claim for relief by the Plaintiff. Although the Defendant did not advance the submission to the Magistrate which has led to the erroneous conclusion, he has submitted in this Court that the decision of the Magistrate was correct. I have not accepted the Defendant's submissions on the appeal. 

83In all the circumstances, I consider that it is appropriate that costs follow the event and that the Defendant be ordered to pay the Plaintiff's costs of the proceedings, but that he be granted a certificate under the Suitors' Fund Act 1951 . 

Orders 

84I make the following orders: 

(a) pursuant to s.59(2) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 , I set aside the order made at the Burwood Local Court on 10 June 2010 dismissing proceedings against the Defendant under s.4(1)(b) Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901 ; 

(b) the proceedings are remitted to the Burwood Local Court to be dealt with according to law; 

(c) the Defendant is to pay the Plaintiff's costs of and incidental to the Summons; 

(d) I grant to the Defendant a certificate under s.6 Suitors' Fund Act 1951 .

Proceedings before sentencing judge 

5The following statement of agreed facts was tendered before the sentencing judge: 

As at the date of the offence, the victim Kara Monro and the offender Darren Mumberson were involved in a domestic relationship, although did not cohabit. 

At about 11pm on Sunday 28th of June 2009, the victim was at her home when she received a telephone call from the offender who was at PJ Gallagher's hotel in Parramatta. The offender was sounded heavily intoxicated and the victim offered to and pick him up [sic]. 

The victim arrived at the hotel at about 11:40pm and picked up both the offender and Andrew Bryan, a friend of the offender. 

The victim was driving a maroon coloured Holden Commodore registered DM 1059. 

The victim drove Mr Bryan to his home in Winston Hills before then heading towards Oakhurst, the home of the offender. Darkness had been sitting in the front passenger seat, and after he alighted in Winston Hills, the offender moved from the rear of the car to the front passenger seat. 

The victim drove to the M4 motorway and then headed west towards Oakhurst. While travelling on the M4, the offender used the victim's mobile telephone and telephoned Kaylene Jones, a friend of the victim. The offender was aggressive and argumentative and became involved in a heated argument with Ms Jones. After the call was terminated, and while they were still travelling on the M4, the offender reached over to the steering wheel and pulled it downwards causing the car to swerve to the left hand side of the road. There was limited traffic about and the victim was able to regain control of the vehicle without incident. 

The victim exited the M4 via the Reservoir Road exit and stopped at a red traffic light at the intersection of Reservoir road and the Great Western Highway. 

While waiting at the lights, the offender told the victim to go through the red light. He started to talk about death and screamed at the victim, "" Kill us now. Go through the red lights "". 

The victim waited for the traffic lights to turn green and then proceeded through the intersection and travelled north along Reservoir Road, She turned left at the roundabout at Holbeche Road, Arndell Park. 

While she was turning left, the offender undid his seatbelt. The victim, believing that the offender was going to jump from the car, locked the car doors. 

The offender was acting erratically and his behaviour was causing the victim to worry. As the car approached a second roundabout, at the intersection of Holbeche Road and Walters Road, the offender said, "" When we get through this roundabout I'm going to drive us into that truck that is parked on the left ."" This caused the victim to panic and she began to drive slightly faster in order to get the offender home. 

As the vehicle approached a truck parked on the left side of the road, the offender reached across the centre console again and took hold of the steering wheel with his hand. He pulled it down and to the left, causing the car to swerve violently to the left. 

The victim attempted to correct the vehicle but it was already spinning to the left. The car impacted with a telegraph pole and then spun into the parked semi trailer. 

The victim observed the offender to hit the windscreen as he was not wearing a seat belt. 

Police and ambulance attended the crash scene and both the victim and the offender were treated by paramedics. They were both taken by ambulance to Westmead Hospital. 

Police took photographs of the vehicle and the scene. 

As a result of the collision, the victim suffered two fractures to her spine: - a C2-3 fracture and a sacral fracture. She underwent surgery involving anterior cervical discectomy and fusion of C2-C3 and a posterior C1-C4 fusion for the C2-C3 fracture/sublaxation. 

On Monday, 10th August 2009, the offender attended Blacktown Police Station and was charged with the matter before the Court. 

The offender was cautioned and agreed to answer certain questions of the investigating police. The interview was recorded on DVD and during the interview the offender stated that he had no recollection of the incident. He said that his last memory was consuming alcohol with his friend. 

6Also tendered before the sentencing judge by the Crown were the respondent's criminal history, his traffic record, a victim impact statement and a pre-sentence report by James Potts. For the respondent, there were tendered a report of C Probets, a psychologist, and five written references. No oral evidence was given. 

7The respondent's criminal history showed one conviction for a high range PCA on 15 October 1998, for which he was fined $1,000 and disqualified from driving for 12 months. His traffic record showed eleven further fines for speeding and other offences between 1993 and 2008, and also a number of fine defaults, suspensions of licence and one demerits point suspension of licence (all apparently quickly lifted or not implemented). 

8There was no medical evidence as to the victim's medical situation, but her victim impact statement was not challenged, and the sentencing judge accepted it as showing the following: 

She is unable to turn her neck and head, in full rotation. She has scars to her hip and surgical scars on the back and front of her neck. She will never be able to do high impact sports or activities. She has restrictions on weight lifting, she has to turn her whole body to check left and right while driving and she may have difficulty in lifting children. She gets pain for which she needs pain killers and she still has medical check ups. She has given a list of the features of emotional impact and the impact on her well being. She has self doubt, sleepless nights, intense nightmares, loss of confidence, loss of trust in relationships, fear of driving in the rain, nervousness generally in a number of fashions, in motor cars and she had emotional break downs leading up to the court case. 

... 

She still needs treatment by a clinical psychologist for the features which I have mentioned. She finds that she cries uncontrollably at times. Her social life has changed and she lacks confidence in going out and meeting new people. Her physiotherapy has to be met from her own pocket as have other elements of medical treatment and generally there has been an impact on her financial situation which is set out in detail in the victim impact report and which I repeat, is accepted. 

9It was not suggested that the respondent himself received any significant injury; although on impact he struck his head on the windscreen, and the psychologist who examined him thought this, together with his intoxication, may have contributed to his inability to recollect what happened. 

10The pre-sentence report was summarised as follows by the sentencing judge: 

The pre-sentence report is a favourable one. The author comes to conclusions based of course on what the author has been told, similar to those which I have already mentioned. It does say that relationship and anger issues may have been a factor in the offending behaviour although says the author ""the offender denies that this was the case"". 

The author of the pre-sentence report believes that the offender does not have any memory of the offence, saying only that the actions were totally uncharacteristic, and says that 

""In view of this it would be difficult to say that the offender has any insight into his offending behaviour or an ability to 'own' such behaviour. Alcohol abuse and anger/relationship issues would appear to be issues relating to his offending behaviour."" 

The author assesses the offender as unlikely to benefit from supervision because, says the author ""Mr Mumberson was during discussions of the offence, unable to identify any issues that he can see needed to be addressed or of which he was aware."" 

11The psychologist's report was summarised as follows by the sentencing judge: 

... There is a report from Mr Chris Probets, forensic and counselling psychologist which I find acceptable. It is careful and comprehensive. In its seven pages, Mr Probets recounts comprehensively the details of his findings which he has used to come to his conclusion. He believes that the offender functions well although not perfectly on the psychological assessment. He has previous problems with alcohol abuse to which he admitted but there are no indications of difficulties with social interactions, and close personal relationships. None of those, says Mr Probets, would suggest that the offender is in danger of reoffending. I quote: 

""The overall picture utilising the psychometric assessments was of a fairly well adjusted person who has suffered somewhat due to alcohol use which has damaged his interpersonal relationships. There was no indication of any type of significant psychological or psychiatric disorder and his usual level of psychological functioning appears to be quite effective and in line with the majority of the non-offending population."" 

In my opinion Darren Mumberson does not require any psychological treatment as there is no significant psychological or psychiatric disorder that requires treatment. As he is a well functioning person, psychological treatment would not have any purpose or even any behaviour to target. It would be useful however if he was to learn to reduce his alcohol intake which he tells me he has done. In particular it appears that it would be useful if he could stop binge drinking. 

The assessment interview and a psychometric assessments [sic] indicated that Darren Mumberson's personality is quite unlike the type of personality one would expect in a person committing this type of offence. According to his statement the offence does not relate to his thoughts, feelings and behaviour prior to or following the offence."" 

Mr Probets goes on to give reasons why he finds that the offender's statement of lack of memory of what happened in the motor car after the telephone call I have mentioned, is quite acceptable for medical reasons. 

... 

Mr Probets says and I quote: 

""In my opinion Darren Mumberson does not present a danger to the community and a custodial sentence may set back his progress. In particular a custodial sentence may result in a set back to his current level of functioning. It would also prevent him from undertaking the changes that he needs to make that will lead to progress in his life and psychological functioning."" 

12The sentencing judge summarised the references as follows: 

The five references which have been provided come from persons who have known the offender for years. For example, seventeen years in one case and twenty years in another. They come from his employer and persons who have known him in the sporting activities of his youth and who are familiar with his family life. Not only do they say that the offence for which he has been sentenced is one which is totally out of character, but they go on to speak 
about his being a wonderful father, loyal to his family and friends and one who helps anyone in need. He has been incredibly loving, honest and respectful. His having an exceptional work ethic, working extremely long hours and always accepting extra work when required by his employer. He is working closely with his ex partner regarding their children's welfare and discipline and as to his being a very conservative person who is normally guarded in committing his emotional welfare to any other person whilst remaining a dedicated father, son and friend. 

A significant feature is that referees have noted that he is in one case, ""very emotional and worried sick about what has happened"" and particularly remorseful about the effect of his actions on Ms Monro. That summarises what is set out in much more detail in the references. 

13The sentencing judge summarised the submissions as follows: 

In a very careful address with which the crown prosecutor expressly did not quarrel except for one feature, Mr Gallagher has set out carefully but succinctly the features which I have mentioned but has also gone to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . There are no aggravating features under subs (2) of the section. There are mitigating features in subs (3) which he examined carefully. I shall not repeat that examination other than indicating that he quite properly and favourably on behalf of his client dealt with the paragraphs (b), (e) (f), (g), (h) and (i). He also argued paragraph (j) in his client's favour although in my view, although properly put, that was not as strong a submission as the earlier ones. 

14The sentencing judge found that the case was unique, and that in his twenty-seven years of judicial experience he had not experienced a case from which any real assistance could be gained by way of comparison or analogy. He noted the most severe injury to the victim. He found that the respondent was a man not just of good character but of exceptionally good character, being thirty-seven years of age with only one entry on his record. He noted that although the respondent had no recollection of what happened, he could have made a realistic defence on the basis that he was unlikely - close to the point of impossibility - to have committed the acts involved in the crime. The sentencing judge found that the respondent's guilty plea indicated remorse and was a genuine indication of his acceptance of his responsibility for what happened. 

15The sentencing judge said that he preferred the view of Mr Probets as to the respondent's need for future treatment to that expressed in the pre-sentence report. 

16The sentencing judge noted that, because of the guilty plea, this was not a matter in which the mandatory non-parole period applied. He said that the matter fell in the range of objective seriousness somewhat below the mid range, but approaching the mid range from below and close to it. 

17The sentencing judge expressed his conclusions as follows: 

I came to the view that the sentence should be one of two years. I have reduced it by fifteen per cent for its utilitarian value. Although it came at quite a late stage, it still had a very strong effect in so far as it caused Ms Monro not to have to give evidence, granted that she had the earlier stress of anticipating a trial. It saved the calling of a number of witnesses and the trial itself would have been relatively lengthy. 

Although the plea of guilty does carry other features, in particular, it is recognition of responsibility by the offender, it is a support for my finding that he is remorseful and those other features would go to a finding of special circumstances if this were to be a time when a non-parole period would be specified. It is not specified of course in relation to a suspended sentence. 

18He said that the bond to be signed by the respondent should include a condition that the respondent enter into all forms of treatment as may be prescribed by his treating psychologist or psychiatrist. 

Issues on appeal 

19The Crown relies on the following grounds of appeal: 

Ground 1: 
His Honour should have found the aggravating feature pursuant to s.21A(2)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 - use of a weapon; 

Ground 2: 
His Honour should have not given the respondent a 15% discount for his plea; 

Ground 3: 
His Honour failed to have adequate regard to the standard non parole period; 

Ground 4: 
The sentencing Judge placed too much weight upon the respondent's subjective features and insufficient regard to deterrence and the other purposes of punishment; 

Ground 5: 
The sentence is manifestly inadequate (previously contained in the Notice of Appeal). 

Crown submissions 

20It was submitted for the Crown that the sentencing judge should have found the aggravating feature pursuant to s 21A(2)(c) of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act , because the motor vehicle was used as a weapon: R v Chisari [2006] NSWCCA 19, Hamilton v R (1993) 66 A Crim R 575. The Crown did not contend that the sentencing judge should have found the aggravating features in pars (i) or (ib) of s 21A(2). 

21The Crown submitted that, since it was only a few days prior to the commencement of the trial that the respondent's counsel conveyed to the DPP that the respondent would plead guilty, there should not have been a discount of 15 per cent: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 52 MVR 528. 

22The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge did not give reasons justifying his finding that the matter fell below the middle range of objective seriousness, or justifying such a dramatic deviation from the standard non parole period: R v Tory [2006] NSWCCA 18 at [42]; R v McEvoy [2010] NSWCCA 110 at [92] - [94]. 

23The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge misinterpreted the criminality involved in the offence, namely very serious domestic violence against the victim, something which is by no means unusual or unique: cf R v Cheh [2009] NSWCCA 134 at [30]. The Crown submitted that the subjective circumstances were not as strong as the sentencing judge assessed them: the respondent was not of exceptionally good character, and had an unaddressed binge drinking problem. 

24The Crown submitted that no reason was given for the leniency of suspending the sentence, and that the subjective circumstances were not sufficiently compelling to justify this: R v Foster [2001] NSWCCA 215; (2001) 33 MVR 565 at [36], R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17. 

Respondent's submissions 

25Mr Roser SC for the respondent submitted that the principles in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 apply; that even if this Court found error, it has a discretion whether or not to intervene: Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; and that the Crown should not be permitted to attempt to rely on matters that were not part of the Crown case below: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49. 

26Mr Roser submitted that the assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] and [45] - [46]. 

27Mr Roser submitted that there was no error in the discount given for the plea of guilty; and that there was overwhelming evidence of the remorse of the respondent, and this was not disputed by the Crown below. He submitted that there was no error in finding that the respondent was unlikely to re-offend, or in accepting that he had good prospects of rehabilitation and was of good character. 

28Mr Roser noted that the Crown submitted below that a penalty of periodic detention was within the range available (albeit that such a penalty no longer existed), yet a suspended sentence was a more severe penalty than periodic detention: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321, R v JCE [2000] NSWCCA 498; (2000) 120 A Crim R 18, R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17. 

29Mr Roser referred to a number of authorities in which suspended sentences were imposed or not overturned, including R v Farrawell-Smith [2010] NSWCCA 144. He submitted that the sentencing judge had not erred in using the standard non-parole period as a guidepost: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168; and that the reasons given were adequate. 

30Mr Roser also relied on a letter from the NSW Department of Corrective Services advising that, in accordance with the provisions of the respondent's bond, his obligation to report to the Service had been terminated as from 23 January 2011. 

Decision 

31I accept Mr Roser's submission that determination of the objective seriousness of an offence is very much a matter for the sentencing judge; and in circumstances where the Crown conceded below there were no aggravating factors, I do not think the sentencing judge's assessment (which I take to be that the matter here fell just below the mid range of objective seriousness) should be overturned by this Court. 

32However, on that assessment, and even if one does not treat what was done as using a motor vehicle as a weapon, this was a very serious offence. It involved a deliberate act (grabbing and twisting the steering wheel of a moving car) knowing that this carried a risk of causing grievous bodily harm to the victim, and nevertheless doing it without caring that this could happen. The risk that grievous bodily harm could thereby be caused was very high, and the extent of the injury that could be caused was very great. In fact, very serious injury was caused to the victim, and the victim impact statement was accepted by the respondent (and is still accepted by the respondent) as showing her serious ongoing problems. This was an unexplained act of violence committed in the knowledge of a high risk of serious injury to the victim as well as to himself. The lack of recollection is not a mitigating factor. Nor was the applicant's act entirely impulsive: it was planned, albeit only for a short time. 

33Given the standard non-parole period of four years, and taking account of the plea of guilty and the assessment that the objective seriousness was just below the mid range, it would be very difficult to justify a non-parole period of much less than three years in the absence of significant subjective circumstances. That the injuries were caused in an unusual way is not material to the seriousness of the criminality that was involved: certainly it is not a mitigating circumstance. The applicant's offence was a recklessly violent act with very serious consequences; and regrettably such conduct is far from rare, especially where intoxication is involved. 

34It is of course necessary to consider the significance of the respondent's subjective circumstances. 

35The sentencing judge's acceptance of the mitigating factors in pars (b), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) of s 21A(3) was not challenged by the Crown below, and is not challenged by the Crown on appeal; nor is the sentencing judge's preference for the view of Mr Probet as to the respondent's need for future treatment to that expressed in the preceptor's report. 

36However, the Crown does challenge the finding that the respondent was of exceptionally good character; and while a finding of good character was available and indeed conceded, I see no justification for the view expressed by the sentencing judge of exceptional good character, having regard to his record set out above. Further, in my opinion, it is to be taken into account that the appellant denied there were any emotional issues that could have contributed to what he did: on his account, he had ended the relationship with the victim shortly before the offence, and he could not identify any emotional problems he had at the time. The only explanation that could be suggested, on the respondent's account, for what he did was that he was heavily affected by alcohol; and although the material before the sentencing judge indicated that the respondent sometimes engaged in binge drinking, it did not show that this was something that the respondent accepted he needed seriously to address. 

37The finding that the respondent was not likely to re-offend was not challenged below and is not challenged here; but on the other hand, the evidence does not suggest that the respondent has carefully considered why he did what he did, or seriously undertaken to address whatever it was that led him to do such an extremely dangerous and harmful act. 

38Again, the finding of remorse is not under challenge; but in my opinion the weight to be given to the respondent's acceptance of responsibility and acknowledgement of the injury he caused to the victim is affected by his failure to give any oral evidence about this; and certainly there is no suggestion that he has ever even considered making reparation for the injury caused to the victim. 

39It was put to the sentencing judge that the respondent did not give evidence because he could not remember what happened; but that does not explain his not giving evidence on such matters as his concern about why he acted in the way he did, his resolve to address any issues that may have contributed to this, his acceptance of responsibility, and/or his concern for the victim. 

40The respondent did have substantial subjective factors operating in his favour; but in my opinion, having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence, they could not be considered so favourable as to justify a starting point, before any discount for the plea of guilty, of two years for the total sentence to be imposed. In my opinion, this starting point was outside the range that could reasonably be adopted, and error is shown. In my opinion, the error was compounded by the suspending of the sentence, which again was outside the range of sentencing options that could reasonably be adopted. 

41As regards the discount of 15 per cent for the guilty plea, in my opinion this was over-generous; but I do not consider that this on its own would justify appellate intervention. 

42The question then is whether this Court should, in the exercise of discretion, intervene. In my opinion, it should, in particular to reverse the suspension of the sentence. However, in the exercise of discretion, it is in my opinion appropriate to impose a penalty substantially less than would have been appropriate at first instance. 

43In my opinion, the mitigating factors identified by the sentencing judge, taken together, justify a finding of special circumstances permitting a departure from the statutory ratio for the non-parole period. After allowing a ten per cent discount for the plea of guilty, I would impose a non-parole period of fifteen months, with the balance of sentence of one year. 

44A question arises as to the commencement date for the sentence. Under s 47 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , a court may direct that a sentence be taken to have commenced on a day occurring before the day when the sentence is imposed, but not on a day occurring after that day (except in the case where the offender is serving another term of imprisonment). In my opinion, it is appropriate in this case to order to the effect that the respondent's sentence commence on 8 October 2010, so that the time he has been subject to a good behaviour bond counts towards satisfaction of his sentence. Thus the effective non-parole period will be nine months. 

45I note that s 14A(4)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides for the giving of notice to a respondent of the date on which appeal proceedings are to be disposed of or a sentence imposed. In this case, the Court requested that the Registrar give the respondent adequate notice to that effect. 

Orders 

46For those reasons, I propose the following orders: 

(1) Appeal allowed. 

(2) Sentence below quashed. 

(3) In lieu thereof, the respondent is sentenced to a non-parole period of fifteen months imprisonment commencing on 8 October 2010 and expiring on 7 January 2012, and a balance of term of one year, expiring on 7 January 2013. 

(4) The respondent is to be released on parole on 7 January 2012. 

47ADAMS J: I agree with Hodgson JA. 

48HALL J: I agree with Hodgson JA.

2709894,Aouad and El-Zeyat v R [2011] NSWCCA 61,"JUDGMENT 

1McCLELLAN CJ AT CL: I agree with James J. 

2JAMES J: Ramzi Aouad and Nasaem El-Zeyat appealed against their convictions on a charge that on 30 October 2003 at Punchbowl they murdered Ahmed Fahda. A trial in which they were found guilty was conducted before Bell J (as her Honour then was) and a jury between 31 March 2006 and 16 May 2006. A third accused Adnan Darwiche, who was charged with being both an accessory before the fact and an accessory after the fact to the murder of Adam Fahda, was acquitted on both of those charges. There was no application by either appellant for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him. 

3At the trial the Crown case, very broadly stated, was that shortly after two o'clock in the afternoon of 30 October 2003 the deceased had been a passenger in a Pajero 4-wheel drive vehicle (""the Pajero"") driven by a man named Bassam Said, which was travelling in Punchbowl Road, Punchbowl. The Pajero ran out of petrol and Ahmed Fahda and Bassam Said pushed the Pajero into a service station on Punchbowl Road near the intersection with Dudley Street. Both men got out of the Pajero. 

4Another vehicle, a Commodore, stopped near the service station. Two men armed with pistols (""the shooters"" or ""the gunmen"") got out of the Commodore. They walked past the deceased, who was looking into the bonnet of the Pajero and, from close range, fired a large number of shots into the deceased's body, killing him. The gunmen then ran from the service station and boarded the Commodore which had been driven into Dudley Street. The Commodore then drove off. 

5The issue at the trial, so far as the appellants were concerned, was whether the Crown could prove that the two appellants were the gunmen. The Crown case at the trial depended heavily on the evidence of the witnesses Bassam Said, Wahib Hannouf, Haissam Hannouf and Tony Haddad. Apart from the evidence of these witnesses, there was evidence from a number of witnesses who had witnessed the shooting but who could not identify either of the gunmen, some limited formal admissions by the appellants and some pieces of circumstantial evidence. 

6Having regard to some of the grounds of appeal against conviction, it is necessary to examine in some detail the evidence of many of the witnesses in the Crown case. 

EVIDENCE OF THE CROWN WITNESSES 
BASSAM SAID'S EVIDENCE 

7As at 30 October 2003 Bassam Said had known Tony Haddad and the appellant El-Zeyat for about five years. He had known of the deceased Ahmed Fahda but had not known him personally. 

8On the morning of 30 October 2003 Bassam Said received a telephone call from Tony Haddad, who asked Bassam Said to come to his house and pick him up. Bassam Said drove to Tony Haddad's place in the Pajero, which was half owned by Bassam Said and half owned by Tony Haddad. Bassam Said picked up Tony Haddad and they drove to Wiley Park. 

9At Wiley Park they had a meeting with Adnan Darwiche and the appellant El-Zeyat. At Wiley Park Bassam Said merely said hello to Darwiche and El-Zeyat and had no further conversation with either of them. 

10Bassam Said drove off in the Pajero with El-Zeyat as a passenger. In Punchbowl Bassam Said saw Ahmed Fahda and his brother Douse Fahda in a vehicle. 

11Bassam Said stopped the Pajero. El-Zeyat got out of the Pajero and Ahmed Fahda got into the Pajero and asked Bassam Said to take him to Tony Haddad's house. 

12Bassam Said drove Ahmed Fahda to Tony Haddad's mother-in-law's house. He sounded the horn of the Pajero but no one came out of the house. Ahmed Fahda then asked Bassam Said to give him a lift to where his car was parked in Punchbowl. 

13The Pajero ""started conking out"" of petrol. The engine stopped. Ahmed Fahda got out of the Pajero and pushed it all the way to a service station, while Bassam Said steered the vehicle, also pushing (apparently with his foot). 

14The service station proprietor came out and helped push the Pajero into the service station. Bassam Said started getting petrol for the Pajero from a bowser, while Ahmed Fahda was looking under the bonnet of the Pajero, which Bassam Said had raised. 

15Bassam Said gave further evidence as follows: 

Q. What happened next? 
A. I finished filling up the petrol. By the time I was looking up to where Mr Fahda was I heard gun shots and I could see his body shaking and -- 

Q. Did you recognise either or one of those people doing the shooting? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Who did you see? 
A. Nasaem El-Zeyat and Ramzi Aouad. 

Q. Were you able to see where the gun shots were coming from? 
A. I seen two people firing guns. 

16As at 30 October 2003 Bassam Said did not know the appellant Aouad. He subsequently found out that the shooter other than El-Zeyat was Aouad, when Aouad introduced himself to Bassam Said ""days after the event"". 

17When the shooting started, Bassam Said ""hit the floor"" and ran to the back of the Pajero. The shooting stopped. Bassam Said saw that Ahmed Fahda was lying on the ground and he asked a person at the service station to call an ambulance. The two shooters ""walked off or ran off, I don't know"". 

18Bassam Said was ""shocked"" at what had happened. After some indecision, he got back into the Pajero and drove off to his house in Bettina Court. Bassam Said was ""going off my head"". Tony Haddad was at Bassam Said's house, when Bassam Said arrived home. 

19About two minutes later the Commodore motor vehicle arrived. Bassam Said saw the two appellants in the front yard of his house. El-Zeyat wanted to park the Commodore in the garage at Bassam Said's house and El-Zeyat drove the Commodore into the garage. Aouad and El-Zeyat were holding guns, which they ""unclogged' and they then disappeared. 

20Bassam Said then drove the Pajero to a friend's place. Bassam Said was asked by the Crown Prosecutor whether he remembered going to Menai on 30 October 2003. He answered, ""Probably, I can't remember"". After some further questions and answers, the Crown Prosecutor made a successful application under s 38 of the Evidence Act for leave to cross-examine Bassam Said. 

21In cross-examination by the Crown Bassam Said agreed that there had been a meeting at which he was present at Menai on the evening of 30 October 2003. At the meeting he had been told by El-Zeyat to go to the police and make a statement ""saying it was not them"". 

22On 5 November 2003 Bassam Said was arrested. He was told that he was under arrest for the murder of Ahmed Fahda. He was taken to a police station and questioned. He also made a statement, which he described in his evidence at the trial as a ""bullshit statement"" (Bassam Said's first statement). 

23In the first statement Bassam Said said that he did not recognise either of the shooters. He made the ""bullshit"" statement, because ""that is what they (the accused) wanted"". 

24As Bassam Said was leaving the police station on 5 November 2003, he was served with a summons to attend the New South Wales Crime Commission. He attended the Crime Commission and was questioned. He swore to give truthful evidence but told a number of lies. He told the Crime Commission that the vehicle he had been driving was not his. 

25Bassam Said made a second statement on 3 June 2004. At the time of making this statement he was in custody, bail refused, on a charge of having been an accessory after the fact to the murder of Ahmed Fahda. 

26While in custody he had been moved to the Special Purposes Centre at Long Bay and while there he had communicated regularly with the Hannouf brothers. He had learnt from police that the Hannouf brothers were providing assistance to the police and both Wahib Hannouf and Haissam Hannouf confirmed this. Bassam Said denied in his evidence that he and the Hannouf brothers had spoken to each other about the evidence they would give. 

27Bassam Said was told by police that, if he made a statement, the charge against him would be dropped or the police would not oppose bail or he would receive an indemnity against prosecution on the charge of having been an accessory. 

28In the second statement of 3 June 2004 Bassam Said for the first time identified Aouad as having been one of the shooters. He said in the statement that he had not been able to properly see the second shooter. 

29On 12 July 2004 Bassam Said made a third statement. He was then still in custody. In the third statement he, for the first time, identified El-Zeyat as having been one of the shooters. He said that he had not been prepared to identify El-Zeyat earlier, because of threats made to him and also because El-Zeyat was a friend. 

30In August 2004 Bassam Said was released on bail and in September 2004 the charge of having been an accessory was discontinued. 

31Bassam Said made a final statement on 16 December 2004. He was further interviewed by police on 5 April 2006 and 2 May 2006.He gave evidence in the committal proceedings on 13 May 2006. 

32Bassam Said received or sought a number of benefits for cooperating with the police. Before he made the second statement he was promised that the information which would be contained in the statement would not be used in any criminal proceedings against him. He asked for protection for himself and his family and a weekly wage of $500 for a period of a year and it would seem that these benefits were granted. Bassam Said also demanded that criminal charges against one of his brothers, whose whereabouts were unknown, be discontinued but this did not happen. 

33At the time Bassam Said gave evidence at the trial the Crime Commission was paying the rent on his family home. After he had completed giving evidence, he was to be provided with an overseas holiday, as part of a witness protection programme. 

34Although he received the benefits I have referred to, Bassam Said did not receive any indemnity against prosecution for any alleged offence. 

35Bassam Said was aware that the Pajero was a ""rebirth"" vehicle. A criminal charge against him in relation to the Pajero was discontinued. Bassam Said admitted in his evidence at the trial that he and Tony Haddad had been buying damaged vehicles and fitting them with stolen parts. 

36In December 2005 Bassam Said had been involved with Tony Haddad and another man, in what was described at the trial as a ""rip"" (that is a drug rip-off). Said drove Haddad to a place where an unknown man gave Haddad a parcel. Said did not know what was in the parcel and did not ask any questions, apart from asking Haddad what was in the parcel, to which Haddad answered that he did not know. Bassam Said thought it was likely that the transaction was illegal. Bassam Said received $20,000 for his involvement. 

37Bassam Said refused to come to court to give evidence at the trial. Warrants for his arrest for him to be brought to court to give evidence were issued, including a warrant of 13 April 2006. Bassam Said agreed in cross-examination at the trial that he was prepared to take steps to avoid execution of the warrant ""for the safety of my family"". Bassam Said said that he had been at his home but police had not come to his home to execute the warrant. 

38Bassam Said gave evidence that he had intended to attend court voluntarily on 2 May 2006. However, he said that in the early hours of the morning of that day, while he was travelling from Kings Cross to his home, a male person wearing a balaclava had opened the door of his vehicle while it was stationary and had shot him in the leg. Bassam Said telephoned an emergency number and drove himself to Sutherland Hospital. While he was at Sutherland Hospital he was arrested pursuant to the warrant and he remained in police custody until after he had completed giving evidence. 

TONY HADDAD'S EVIDENCE 

39As at 30 October 2003 Tony Haddad had known all of Ahmed Fahda, Ramzi Aouad known as ""Fidel"", Nasaem El-Zeyat known as ""Erdt"", Adnan Darwiche, Mohammed Touma and Bassam Said for a number of years. 

40As at 30 October 2003 Tony Haddad was living at an address in Condell Park. On the morning of that day he received a telephone call from a man named Jalal Alameddine, who told him that Ahmed Fahda was at his house and wanted to speak to Tony Haddad. Tony Haddad had a conversation on the telephone with Ahmed Fahda in which Ahmed Fahda said, ""I have to see you"". Tony Haddad said that he was ""a bit busy"" and that Ahmed Fahda should call back later in the day. 

41Tony Haddad then had a telephone conversation with El-Zeyat. In the conversation Tony Haddad said that he was going to see Ahmed Fahda. El-Zeyat said that Tony Haddad should wait until El-Zeyat came over. El- Zeyat said ""Don't meet up with him. He is a dirty cunt"". 

42Bassam Said arrived at Tony Haddad's home, driving the Pajero. Tony Haddad got in the Pajero and they drove off. While in the Pajero Tony Haddad received a telephone call from El-Zeyat, who said, ""I am on my way. Meet me at Wiley Park park"". 

43Bassam Said and Tony Haddad stopped at the park, where they saw El-Zeyat. El-Zeyat was carrying a gun on his hip. 

44Tony Haddad also saw Adnan Darwiche in the park. El-Zeyat and Darwiche had a conversation with each other, which Tony Haddad was unable to hear. 

45Darwiche said to Tony Haddad, ""What does Ahmed (Fahda) want from you?"" and Tony Haddad replied, ""I don't know"". Darwiche said, ""Fidel's been looking for him"". 

46El-Zeyat and Darwiche had a further conversation, which Tony Haddad was unable to hear. 

47Ahmed Fahda telephoned Tony Haddad and said that he would meet Tony Haddad at his parents' place in Punchbowl. When the conversation ended one of El-Zeyat and Darwiche asked, ""Was that him?"" and Tony Haddad replied, ""Yeah, he is at my parents' house"". 

48El-Zeyat asked Bassam Said if he could give El-Zeyat a lift and the two left together in the Pajero. Darwiche and Tony Haddad travelled to Bassam Said's house at Bettina Court, Greenacre. 

49Tony Haddad tried to telephone El-Zeyat but could not establish contact. Eventually he spoke to El-Zeyat. Tony Haddad's evidence continued:- 

""I said, ""Where are you? I am at Bass' house"". He said, ""I am doing something, I am doing something. I will ring you back. I won't be long"""". 

50Tony Haddad heard the sound of gunshots. Bassam Said's house was about two kilometres from the service station in Punchbowl Road. Darwiche said, ""Ring up the boys"". Tony Haddad tried without success to ring El-Zeyat. He telephoned Bassam Said and ""he was screaming off his head"". 

51The Pajero arrived at the house. Bassam Said parked the Pajero outside the house. Bassam Said ""was jumping out, banging his head with his hands"". His face was white. Darwiche told Bassam Said to park the Pajero properly and Bassam Said parked the Pajero on the driveway in front of the garage. 

52A Commodore vehicle then arrived at the house. Tony Haddad's evidence continued:- 

""Erdt and Fidel jumped out and started running towards the house and Mohammed Touma came out and he was running too"". 

53El-Zeyat and Aouad ""clocked"" guns by ""pulling the top back"". When they did this, one bullet fell on the floor. The guns were then wrapped in a jumper. About 10 to 15 minutes had passed from the time that Tony Haddad had heard the sound of gunshots. 

54Darwiche said, ""Move the car"". The Pajero was moved and the Commodore was parked in the garage. El-Zeyat said, ""I'll get rid of it later"". 

55El-Zeyat, Aouad and Darwiche got into Darwiche's car and left. Bassam Said and Tony Haddad walked to Bassam Said's parents' house nearby. Tony Haddad made a telephone call and arranged with his father to drive him to his home. 

56At Tony Haddad's house Bassam Said was still pale and white. He sat on the floor with his hands over his face. 

57El-Zeyat arrived at Tony Haddad's house. He said to Bassam Said, ""What's the matter?"" 

58Later Tony Haddad travelled by car to Menai. On the way El-Zeyat, who was in the car, received a telephone call from Darwiche. 

59The car travelled to McDonalds at Menai, where there was a meeting with Darwiche. Darwiche said to El-Zeyat ""We got to talk"". However, Darwiche said that certain other persons at McDonalds looked like police and that they should go elsewhere to talk. 

60Darwiche, El-Zeyat, Tony Haddad, Bassam Said and another man all travelled in the same car to a small park. They walked into the park. Tony Haddad's evidence continued:- 

Q. What conversation then occurred? 
A. Erdt was jumping around like a monkey. He was screaming like saying that he dropped him, he dropped him. 

Q. Can as best you can I said, he said? 
A. He said, ""I dropped him. I dropped him."" I said, ""Who?"" He said, ""Ahmed, I know it's Ahmed, Ahmed Fahda."" I said, ""Did you kill him?"" He said, ""Yeah."" 

... 

Q. What more was said, again, I said, he said? 
A. I said to him, I said to him, ""Did you shoot him?"" He said, ""Yeah."" ""Who was with you?"" He said, ""Me, Eddie, Fidel."" 

61Darwiche said to Bassam Said:- 

""Mate, I don't know, just make sure you don't say nothing about the boys. If you say anything about them, you know, going to be problems."" 

62Darwiche also said to Bassam Said :- 

""If the police ask you who done it, tell them it wasn't the Darwiche family"". 

63Darwiche also said to Bassam Said:- 

""Make sure you don't go to the cops, and, you know, if you do, we'll get you. We'll get your family, if you know, I wouldn't."" He said, ""I have to say this to you so you know where I stand."" 

64Bassam Said said:- 

""I am not going to the police. Don't worry about it"". 

65The group then drove back to McDonalds at Menai. Darwiche got out. The other four El-Zeyat, Tony Haddad, Bassam Said and the other man drove to Tony Haddad's house at Condell Park. 

66Tony Haddad went to a hotel where he spent the night of 30 October 2003. 

67The following day at Tony Haddad's home there was a conversation. Darwiche, El-Zeyat, Aouad, Mohammed Touma and Tony Haddad were present. In this conversation Aouad said, ""I am worried if the camera got my tattoo"". 

68Tony Haddad's evidence continued:- 

Fidel said, ""Anyway we got the cunt"" and then Erdt said, ""We got him, we fucked his mum, I emptied the clip into him: and Fidel said ""Yeah, me too"". 

69On 31 October 2003 Ahmed Fahda's brother Hussain Fahda and some other men assaulted Tony Haddad and attempted to kidnap him. Tony Haddad did not reveal who had killed Ahmed Fahda. He did not report the assault to the police. 

70In 2004 Tony Haddad was arrested on a charge of perjury and refused bail. For a period of two to three months Haddad, when questioned by police, denied any knowledge of the shooting of Ahmed Fahda. He was told by police that he would be charged with having been an accessory after the fact to the murder of Ahmed Fahda. 

71While he was still in custody Tony Haddad learnt that Hussain Fahda was in the same gaol. He became concerned for his own safety and decided that he would assist the authorities. 

72Haddad had a first meeting with representatives of the Crime Commission. There was discussion about his providing assistance and his being granted an indemnity. Haddad made statements to the police between July 2004 and December 2004. He was promised an indemnity against ""everything"", including the perjury charge. However, he pleaded guilty to the perjury charge because he got tired of waiting for the indemnity to be actually granted. 

73In November 2004 Haddad was sentenced for the offence of perjury to which he had pleaded guilty. The sentencing judge said in her remarks that she was allowing a discount of 60 per cent for the plea of guilty and the assistance provided and to be provided by Haddad in this matter and other unrelated matters. 

74In May 2005 Haddad refused to give evidence in the committal proceedings, because the indemnity had not yet been granted. 

75An indemnity against prosecution was finally granted on 13 March 2006. Haddad was indemnified against alleged firearms offences, offences of stealing and receiving stolen motor vehicles and stolen motor vehicle parts and offences of concealing a number of serious indictable offences, including several murders. He had been charged only with the firearms offences. 

76An affidavit by an officer of the Crime Commission disclosed the financial benefits Haddad had received for his assistance being payments of $50,000 and $11,086, payments of $300 per week since December 2005 and rental payments. Haddad admitted in cross-examination at the trial that his house had been partly purchased with funds from criminal activities. The Crime Commission had not brought any proceeds of crime proceedings against him. 

77In November 2005 Haddad had been involved in a ""rip"" (a drug rip off), in which he deceived a drug dealer into handing over $300,000 (although Haddad did not know the amount at the time), in exchange for a suitcase. Haddad did not know what was in the suitcase but did not believe that it contained the drugs it was supposed to contain. Haddad performed the ""rip"" at the request of a friend. He said that he was asked to do it, because he was practised at ""conning"" people. 

78Haddad was told by the authorities that he would not be charged with any offence arising out of the ""rip"". At the time of the trial the indemnity had not been extended to any offence in relation to the ""rip"". 

79Warrants were issued for the arrest of Tony Haddad to ensure that he gave evidence at the trial. 

80On 23 March 2006 Haddad made a document, which became a defence exhibit at the trial (Exhibit 3), in which he said, ""Since I made my statement (to the police) I can no longer confirm if my statement is true and correct. This has been written of my own free will"". 

81In his evidence at the trial Tony Haddad said that the contents of Exhibit 3 were completely untruthful. He referred to pressure to which he had been subjected by a number of persons. 

WAHIB HANNOUF'S EVIDENCE 

82As at 30 October 2003 Wahib Hannouf knew the appellant Aouad. He had first met Aouad about two years before and had seen him seven to ten times during those two years, for periods of up to an hour. 

83As at 30 October 2003 Wahib Hannouf knew El-Zeyat. He had first met El-Zeyat about 6 years before and had seen him many times, perhaps 40 to 50 times. 

84As at 30 October 2003 Wahib Hannouf knew Ahmed Fahda, having first met him in the year 2000. Ahmed Fahda had had a dispute with relatives of Wahib Hannouf and had ""shot"" at the family home. 

85On 30 October 2003 Wahib Hannouf was driving a vehicle in a generally north easterly direction in Punchbowl Road. His brother Haissam Hannouf was a passenger in the vehicle. Wahib Hannouf was driving on the opposite side of Punchbowl Road from the service station, near the intersection of Punchbowl Road and Dudley Street. He was travelling ""really slow"". 

86Wahib Hannouf looked into the service station and ""I've seen Ahmed (Fahda) at the back of a 4-wheel drive"". Wahib Hannouf's evidence continued:- 

""When I seen him I slowed down even more because he was in gaol because, you know, because my Dad put a statement against him and I heard he has been out of gaol so I wanted to see if it was really him. So I slowed down and Ahmed was actually walking towards the front at that stage"". 

87The bonnet of the 4-wheel drive vehicle was opened. 

88Wahib Hannouf saw a blue Commodore vehicle and he saw Aouad and El-Zeyat, who he referred to as ""Fidel"" and ""Erdt"", walking towards the service station and Ahmed Fahda. Both men were wearing hooded jumpers. Wahib Hannouf's evidence continued:- 

""I seen two Glocks, they pulled out two Glocks from their pants and they just kept walking towards Ahmed, they sort of went behind Ahmed"". 

89The two men were walking on the footpath outside the service station. They walked past where Ahmed Fahda was standing. They were walking in the opposite direction to that in which Wahib Hannouf's vehicle was travelling. 

90Wahib Hannouf's evidence continued:- 

""Ahmed was in front of the 4-wheel drive and they were actually behind him, that is when I wanted to park and that is when I heard the shots"". 

91Wahib Hannouf was not still looking at the service station when he heard the shots, because he was driving and had to steer his vehicle. 

92The Commodore started moving, either just before the shots or when the shots were happening. There was only one person in the Commodore. 

93Haissam Hannouf told Wahib Hannouf to ""take off"". Wahib Hannouf turned into a side street and stopped. He said to his brother, ""I want to go back and see what happened"". Haissam Hannouf said that he did not want to go back. Haissam Hannouf got out of the vehicle. 

94Wahib Hannouf drove the vehicle back to the vicinity of the service station and parked it in Dudley Street. He remained in the area for about 40 minutes. 

95Wahib Hannouf gave evidence of a number of incidents between the Hannouf family and the Fahda family. 

96In about 2000 Ahmed Fahda had demanded $50,000 from Wahib Hannouf's brothers in relation to a vehicle. Ahmed Fahda threatened to shoot at the Hannouf family home. The Hannouf family was in fear of Ahmed Fahda and obtained guns to protect themselves. The issue was resolved, when it was explained to Ahmed Fahda that the Hannoufs had had nothing to do with the vehicle in question. 

97In 2001 Ahmed Fahda had a dispute with cousins of Wahib Hannouf. Ahmed Fahda demanded that Wahib Hannouf present his cousins to Ahmed Fahda, so that Ahmed Fahda could shoot them. Wahib Hannouf refused. Ahmed Fahda sent his father to speak to Wahib Hannouf's father. Ahmed Fahda arrived with his brother and started shooting. Wahib Hannouf was not injured. 

98At the trial there was evidence from a police officer that enquiries into this incident were still proceeding but the police had difficulty in accepting the Hannouf brothers' version of what had happened. 

99Wahib Hannouf was aware that Ahmed Fahda had been in prison from 2002 to sometime in 2003. Although it was his understanding that all issues between the two families had been resolved, some members of his family had gone overseas to avoid any reprisals which might take place after Ahmed Fahda was released from gaol. 

100Wahib Hannouf was granted an indemnity against prosecution for offences of armed robbery, kidnapping, aggravated breaking, entering and stealing, demanding property with menaces and drug offences. Wahib Hannouf denied that he had committed any of the alleged offences referred to in the indemnity. He did, however, admit that he had bought and on-sold Sudafed tablets so that others could manufacture amphetamine. 

101Wahib Hannouf made a statement to police in February 2004, before receiving the indemnity, although he made the statement on the understanding that he would be receiving an indemnity. 

102Wahib Hannouf had made an earlier statement to police on 13 November 2003. In this statement he told police that he had been travelling on Punchbowl Road on 30 October 2003 and had parked his vehicle in Dudley Street. However, he did not tell police that he had seen the two appellants and did not describe the events which he had witnessed, because he was concerned about the repercussions, if he did so. He also omitted disclosing the presence of his brother Haissam Hannouf, because his brother did not want to be involved. Wahib Hannouf said in this statement that he had never previously met Ahmed Fahda. He also omitted to tell police that he had had problems with the Fahda family. 

103Subsequently, the Hannouf brothers Wahib Hannouf, Haissam Hannouf and another brother (all of whom were in gaol) agreed that they would speak to the Crime Commission. 

104Wahib Hannouf revealed to a police officer that one of the gunmen had been El-Zeyat. He told the police officer that he would only give a brief version of events, until he knew what benefits he would receive. He declined to sign a statement until he knew that he would get an indemnity. He was told that it was up to the Attorney-General whether an indemnity would be granted. 

105Wahib Hannouf subsequently made a comprehensive statement to police. 

106Wahib Hannouf gave evidence that the New South Wales Crime Commission had seized property and money belonging to his family, worth approximately $1.5 million. Wahib Hannouf admitted that some of the money and property had been obtained through criminal activities. He had begun negotiating for the return of the property and money from the time of his arrest and the Crime Commission had agreed that the money and property would be returned, once Wahib Hannouf had given evidence. 

107Wahib Hannouf agreed that he and his brothers had been in custody at the same time as Tony Haddad. He denied that he and his brothers had discussed with Haddad the information they would provide to police. By the time of his custody Wahib Hannouf had already made his comprehensive statement. Wahib Hannouf denied disc u ssing the events of 30 October 2003 with Bassam Said. 

HAISSAM HANNOUF'S EVIDENCE 

108Haissam Hannouf was a qualified mechanic who had worked at service stations. 

109As at 30 October 2003 he had known El-Zeyat for about 4-5 years during which he had seen him somewhere between five to ten times, the longest period being about five minutes. He also knew Ahmed Fadha and Mohammed Touma, who he referred to as ""Mitch"". As at 30 October 2003 he did not know the appellant Aouad. 

110There had been trouble between Ahmed Fahda and members of Haissam Hannouf's family before 30 October 2003. ""He shot our place ... him and his brother"". 

111On another occasion in about 2000 Haissam Hannouf had refused to give Ahmed Fahda a certificate for the registration of a vehicle, without first inspecting the vehicle. 

112On 30 October 2003 Haissam Hannouf was travelling as a passenger in a vehicle being driven by his brother Wahib Hannouf in a north-easterly direction in Punchbowl Road. He was travelling with his brother for the purpose of assisting his brother in renovating a house. 

113Haissam Hannouf's evidence continued:- 

Q. What happened when you were driving on Punchbowl Road? 
A. My brother saw Ahmed Fahda. 

Q. What did your brother said to you? 
A. He said, ""Look, there is Ahmed Fahda, in the service station"". 

Q. What did you say to him? 
A. I looked and I said, ""Yeah, it is him. It is true what people are saying. Like, he got out of gaol"". 

114Ahmed Fahda was in the service station on Punchbowl Road near Dudley Street. He was standing close to a Pajero 4-wheel drive vehicle. Another man was standing about two metres away from Ahmed Fahda and close to the Pajero. The bonnet of the Pajero was opened. 

115Haissam Hannouf's evidence continued:- 

""Then I seen - we seen Erdt and Fidel were walking on the footpath and walking towards the service station"". 

116Haissam Hannouf recognised the person he named as Erdt as being Nasaem El-Zeyat. He did not know who the other person was. He asked his brother, ""Who is the other person?"" and Wahib Hannouf said ""That's Fidel"". 

117Haissam Hannouf's evidence continued:- 

""I seen them putting hoods on and they got their guns out and walking quickly towards the service station"". 

118The guns the two men were carrying were black in colour and looked like police guns. 

119The two gunmen approached Ahmed Fahda who was in front of the Pajero looking inside the bonnet ""and shot him from the back"" at a range of about two to 3 metres. ""I could see Erdt and Fidel shooting Ahmed Fahda"". Ahmed Fahda fell to the ground. The two men continued shooting after Ahmed Fahda fell. 

120Haissam Hannouf's evidence continued:- 

""I told my brother to take off ... before we get ...shot by any bullets ... My brother took off and I was looking back and there was a blue Commodore and I heard it ... taking off quickly"". 

121The Commodore moved in the opposite direction to that in which the Hannouf brothers were travelling. Haissam Hannouf had first seen the Commodore when it was stationary near the service station. He recognised the driver of the Commodore as being Mohammed Touma (""Mitch""). 

122Wahib Hannouf turned off Punchbowl Road into a side street. Wahib Hannouf said that he wanted to go back to the scene of the shooting. Haissam Hannouf did not want to go with him. Haissam Hannouf got out of the car and returned to his home. 

123Haissam Hannouf received an indemnity against prosecution for a number of offences, including armed robbery, kidnapping, aggravated breaking entering and stealing, demanding property with menaces and knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. 

124Haissam Hannouf agreed in cross-examination that he would not have assisted the authorities, if the indemnity had not been granted and if the property of his family which the Crime Commission had seized under proceeds of crime legislation had not been returned. He said that the indemnity was required, because it was dangerous for him and his brother to remain in gaol. 

125Haissam Hannouf and his brothers had been in the same gaol. Wahib Hannouf told his brothers that he was going to assist the authorities and all the brothers decided that they should provide assistance, because, if they did not do so, they would remain in gaol and be at risk of reprisals. Haissam Hannouf acted as spokesman for the brothers in discussing with representatives of the Crime Commission the granting of indemnities. 

126Soon after the shooting Haissam Hannouf and Wahib Hannouf discussed what Wahib Hannouf would say, if questioned by Police about his car being in Dudley Street after the shooting. Haissam Hannouf encouraged Wahib Hannouf not to tell police that they had been together in the car driving along Punchbowl Road and to tell police that he had not seen anything. Haissam Hannouf said these things because he did not want the lives of himself and his brother threatened by a member of the Fahda family. 

127Haissam Hannouf agreed in cross-examination that he had discussed with Wahib Hannouf the version of events which they would give to the Crime Commission. 

KHALED TALEB'S EVIDENCE 

128A man named Khaled Taleb gave evidence that in 2003 he knew both the appellants and Adnan Darwiche. 

129On an occasion after 20 August 2003 but before the shooting the appellant Aouad visited Khaled Taleb at his home. Aouad told Khaled Taleb that he had split up with his wife Donna Fahda, who was a sister of Ahmed Fahda, and it ""looks like this time it's for good"" and ""Donna's brothers are going to come after me, going to fucking pop me"". Khaled Taleb gave evidence that ""pop"" meant to ""shoot"". 

130Khaled Taleb received an indemnity against prosecution for a large number of alleged offences, including alleged offences of wounding, assaulting and firearms offences and being involved in murders. 

EVIDENCE OF OTHER CROWN WITNESSES ABOUT THE SHOOTING 
MICHAEL RAHMAN'S EVIDENCE 

131A witness using the pseudonym Michael Rahman gave evidence. At some time after two o'clock on 30 October 2003 Mr Rahman was driving home. He pulled into the service station on Punchbowl Road, intending to buy petrol. A 4-wheel drive Pajero was already stationary at a pump in the service station. Michael Rahman drove his vehicle past the 4-wheel drive and stopped in front of it, at the same line of petrol pumps. Mr Rahman's evidence continued:- 

""When I was just reversing my car to adjust my car to the pump, and then I heard very loud shooting, it is like a shooting, you know, so I look in my rear mirror, in my rear mirror and the side one and I saw two guys shooting, they was standing between my car and the other car and they was shooting to someone in that time"". 

132Mr Rahman saw one man (""the first man"") more than the other man. He described the first man as being:- 

""He's tall built, middle east appearance, about 170 something centimetres tall. He had hood on the head so I can't see his hair or anything like that"". 

133The first man had a goatee beard and he was carrying a black pistol that looked like a Glock. Although the first man had a hood, most of his face was exposed. 

134Mr Rahman described the second man as follows:- 

""The second person was a bit taller than the other one, he is 175 centimetres tall, he is thinner than the other one, and he had a hood on his head too, but I didn't see his face that much"". 

135Mr Rahman did not really see the face of the second man. 

136Mr Rahman's evidence continued:- 

""After that I drive forward to the side of the petrol station where the exit for Dudley Street is, and I saw the car was stop in the middle of the street with the doors open, and the engine running so I stopped in the exit of the station and I look again in the mirror. There was still shooting and when they finish they coming running beside me, all right, the two offenders, and I went to the exit in Dudley Street and the first guy, I described him, he come and get to the passenger's seat and the other guy he went to the driver's seat and they drove off"". 

137The vehicle in Dudley Street was a Commodore. Mr Rahman could not see if there was any one else in the Commodore. 

138Mr Rahman reversed his vehicle. A man was lying on the ground dying. The Pajero was then still there. A man said, ""I have to move the car"" and that man drove off in the Pajero. 

139Mr Rahman participated in the preparation of a Comfit image of the first gunman (the first man). I will discuss his evidence on this subject in more detail, when I deal with one of Aouad's grounds of appeal against conviction. 

140Mr Rahman also looked at two series of photographs for the purpose of attempting to make a photographic identification of the first man. I will describe his evidence on this subject in more detail, when I deal with the same ground of appeal by Aouad. 

SAFA MILANI'S EVIDENCE 

141Safa Milani gave evidence that on 30 October 2003 he was working at the service station in Punchbowl Road. While he was helping the driver of a truck unload stock for the shop at the service station, he heard a call for assistance and he helped others push a 4-wheel drive vehicle into the service station. He then went back to help the driver of the truck unload his stock. 

142Mr Milani heard the sounds of gunshots. He did not see the persons who did the shooting. 

143Mr Milani saw one of the men who had been pushing the 4-wheel drive lying on the ground. He saw a car on Punchbowl Road. The driver of this car appeared to be looking at the service station. The driver slowed the vehicle down. 

KERRY NOUNIS'S EVIDENCE 

144Kerry Nounis was a lawn-mowing contractor who was mowing a lawn directly opposite the service station. 

145Mr Nounis heard a number of bangs coming from the service station. At first he thought it was the sound of a car backfiring or of firecrackers. Mr Nounis saw two persons walking away to a car, a Commodore, which was in Dudley Street. He thought one of the men had a pistol in his hand. 

146Mr Nounis could only give a very general description of the two men. He thought that one of them had an olive complexion. 

147Mr Nounis took the registration number of the Commodore and later supplied it to the police. 

MOHAMMED HALWANI'S EVIDENCE 

148Mr Halwani gave evidence that in October 2003 he was an apprentice mechanic at the service station. 

149On 30 October 2003 he was working in the workshop of the service station. He heard noises like firecrackers. His evidence in chief continued:- 

""I poked my head out to see what was going on and I saw two people shooting and then I went back in"". 

150Mr Halwani said in his evidence in chief that he was not able to see any guns in the hands of the men. ""That's why I thought it was firecrackers because all I saw was smoke"". 

151The Crown was granted leave to cross-examine Mr Halwani. In cross-examination Mr Halwani agreed that in a statement he had given to police he had said, ""When I looked at the males with the guns I saw they both didn't have anything covering their faces"". He had said in the statement that the man closer to him was Lebanese, about 170 centimetres tall, medium build, with black shoulder length hair with blonde streaks in it. In his statement he said that he did not get a good look at the second man but the second man was Lebanese. 

MELE MALUPO'S EVIDENCE 

152Ms Malupo gave evidence that at around 1.00 or 2.00 pm on 30 October 2003, she was a passenger, with other family members, in a vehicle being driven by her mother along Punchbowl Road towards King Georges Road. She heard two loud noises that sounded like fireworks coming from her right hand side where the A P Service Station was located. She saw two men running from the A P Service Station towards a light green/aqua coloured car parked in the side street which ran alongside the service station. The first man got into the front passenger seat, but she did not see where the second man went. The vehicle drove away as soon as the men entered it and for this reason Ms Malupo believed that there was a driver waiting in the car. 

153Ms Malupo's mother then drove into the A P Service Station and she and her family attempted to render assistance to the deceased. 

154Ms Malupo stated that she only got a 'quick glance' at the two men. She described the first one as being of average/tall height and because of the man's nose and eyes, she believed him to be Lebanese. The first man was wearing a light brown coloured hooded jumper. She could only see the eyes and nose of the man, because the hood covered the rest of his head. Ms Malupo described the second man as being about the same height as the first man and he too was wearing a hooded jumper. 

OTHER EVIDENCE IN THE CROWN CASE 

155Apart from the evidence of the witnesses I have referred to, there were some further pieces of evidence, including:- 

1. Evidence of an association between Aouad and the Commodore vehicle, being formal admissions that he was driving the Commodore 11 days before 30 October 2003 and was in the Commodore later that month. 

2. Evidence of an association between El-Zeyat and the Commodore, being formal admissions that on 17 October 2003 Adnan Darwiche drove the Commodore to El-Zeyat's home, left it parked outside El-Zeyat's home and then drove it away from El-Zeyat's home. 

3. Evidence of the meeting at McDonalds Menai, only a few hours after the killing, between El-Zeyat, Darwiche, Jalal Alameddine, Bassam Said and Tony Haddad, including a photograph of the group taken while they were at McDonalds. 

4. Call charge records and evidence of telephone numbers, showing telephone contact between El-Zeyat and Bassam Said just before the time of the shooting and two to three minutes after the time of the shooting. 

5. Evidence of possession by Aouad of a hooded jacket. 

6. Evidence by Donna Fahda, the former wife of Aouad, that Aouad had possession of Glock pistols of the type which, according to the ballistics evidence, had been used to shoot Ahmed Fahda. 

THE DEFENCE CASES 

156A number of the Crown witnesses, and particularly Bassam Said, Tony Haddad, Wahib Hannouf and Haissam Hannouf, were cross-examined at length so as to bring out before the jury the extent of their criminal activities, the benefits they had received from co-operating with the authorities, the conflicts and omissions in the various accounts they had given and the opportunities they had had to jointly concoct untrue versions of events. 

157Neither of the appellants gave evidence and Adnan Darwiche did not give evidence. No witness was called to give evidence in the defence case of El-Zeyat. 

158Two witnesses were called in the defence case of Aouad. A private investigator gave evidence of certain time trials, that is of the times it had taken the investigator to travel by car or on foot along some of the routes which, according to the Crown witnesses, they had taken on 30 October 2003. A ballistics expert gave evidence about Glock pistols. It was not suggested at the hearing of these appeals that the evidence of either of these witnesses had any significance. 

GROUNDS OF APPEAL 

159Ultimately, after leave had been granted by the court to amend certain grounds of appeal or raise further grounds of appeal, the appellant Aouad relied on six grounds of appeal against conviction and the appellant El-Zeyat relied on four grounds of appeal against conviction. 

160Aouad's first ground of appeal and El-Zeyat's first ground of appeal raised substantially similar issues and can conveniently be dealt with together. 

161Aouad's second ground of appeal was by its very nature specific to Aouad's appeal and there was no corresponding ground of appeal by El-Zeyat. Aouad's third ground of appeal, which related to the admission into evidence at the trial of informal admissions made by El-Zeyat, being evidence which was clearly admissible against El-Zeyat, was abandoned by Aouad. Aouad's fourth ground of appeal related to certain conduct by his former wife Donna Fahda in giving evidence at the trial and there was no corresponding ground of appeal by El-Zeyat. 

162Aouad's fifth ground of appeal and El-Zeyat's second ground of appeal raised substantially similar issues and can conveniently be dealt with together, as is the case with Aouad's sixth ground of appeal and El-Zeyat's fifth and sixth grounds of appeal. 

AOUAD - GROUND OF APPEAL 1 

1. The trial judge erred in directing the jury as to the approach they were entitled to take in considering the evidence of the witnesses who might reasonably be regarded as criminally concerned in the crimes alleged against the appellant and, in particular, by directing the jury that the evidence of any one 'indemnified witness' may be considered as providing support for the evidence of another. 

1(b) The trial judge erred in directing the jury that it was open to the jury 'to have regard to the evidence of one or more indemnified witnesses as providing some support for an acceptance of the evidence of another of the indemnified witnesses'. 

EL-ZEYAT - GROUND OF APPEAL 1 

1 The trial judge erred in directing the jury that the evidence of any one ""indemnified witness"" may be considered as providing support for the acceptance of the evidence of another of the ""indemnified witnesses"". 

163Counsel for Aouad informed the Court that ground 1(b) did not raise any ground independent of ground 1. Ground 1(b) had been added to the grounds of appeal, merely for the purpose of basing the first ground of appeal on the precise words the trial judge had used in her summing-up. 

164Ground 1 in Aouad's appeal refers both to witnesses who might reasonably be regarding as criminally concerned in the crime alleged against the appellant and to indemnified witnesses. Ground 1 in El-Zeyat's appeal refers only to indemnified witnesses. 

165The witnesses at the trial who had been indemnified were Tony Haddad, Wahib Hannouf, Haissam Hannouf and Khaled Taleb. Bassam Said was not an indemnified witness. 

166Suggestions were made at the trial that the two Hannouf brothers might have been criminally concerned in the murder of Ahmed Fahda. However, there would not appear to have been any evidence (apart from evidence of possible motive), and on the appeal this Court was not directed to any actual evidence, as distinct from suggestions made in cross-examination, that the Hannouf brothers were or might have been criminally concerned in the murder. No suggestion was made at the trial that Bassam Said, Tony Haddad or Khaled Taleb might have been criminally concerned in the murder. 

167The appellants' grounds of appeal were based on a passage in the trial judge's summing-up. The trial judge had been referring to the evidence of the Hannouf brothers, Khaled Taleb, Tony Haddad and Bassam Said. Her Honour noted that they were all persons of bad character with a history of serious criminality. Her Honour continued: 

""Plainly members of the jury, there is a need for you to exercise great care in assessing the evidence of each of these witnesses. You look at whether the evidence impressed you as credible. Whether it is consistent in the case of each witness with accounts that he has previously given, plainly you would look for independent support in considering whether you accepted the evidence of one or more of these witnesses. 

It is open to you to have regard to the evidence of one or more of the indemnified witnesses as providing some support for an acceptance of the evidence of another of the indemnified witnesses. As your own commonsense would suggest, you need to approach that exercise with a degree of care. Tony Haddad and Bassam Said are persons with a close association that includes their willingness to engage in serious criminal activities together. Each was suspected by the police of having been an accessory after the fact to the murder of Ahmed Fahda. To the extent that their accounts may seem to coincide, you would assess whether they have had the opportunity to collude and agree upon an account to put forward to the police that serves to exculpate them."" 

168At the trial there was no complaint from trial counsel for either appellant (or from counsel for the other accused Darwiche) about this part of the trial judge's summing up. Accordingly, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. Nor was there any request pursuant to s 165 of the Evidence Act for any further direction. 

169The history of the written submissions of the appellants in support of this ground is somewhat involved. Written submissions dated 6 December 2007 were lodged on behalf of El-Zeyat. These submissions had been prepared by the late Mr Paul Byrne of senior counsel. 

170Written submissions were subsequently lodged on behalf of Aouad. In these submissions it was stated Aouad adopted and relied upon the submissions made on behalf of El-Zeyat. This was apparently a reference to the submissions which had been prepared by Mr Byrne. However, in submissions subsequently lodged on behalf of El-Zeyat it was stated that the submissions of 6 December 2007 were withdrawn and that new submissions were being made. 

171In the course of the hearing it became clear that the appellants did wish to rely on Mr Byrne's submissions, as well as further submissions. 

172The written submissions prepared by Mr Byrne were not really submissions but a survey by Mr Byrne of English and Australian cases on the subject of ""mutual corroboration of accomplices"". A number of cases surveyed by Mr Byrne were referred to frequently in further written and oral submissions on the appeal. These cases included Pollitt v The Queen (1991-1992) 174 CLR 558; R v Chen & Ors (2002) 130 A Crim R 300; R v Ngo [2003] NSWCCA 82 (reported in part at (2003) 57 NSWLR 55); Conway v The Queen (2001) 209 CLR 203; Kanaan & Ors v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 109. 

173In Pollitt the Crown case was that Pollitt and an accomplice named Jones had been recruited to kill one man but had mistakenly killed another man. At the trial Jones gave evidence in the Crown case and a prisoner informer named Denning gave evidence of a confession he said Pollitt had made to him while both Pollitt and Denning were in prison. 

174The trial judge gave a direction that Denning's evidence, if accepted, was capable of corroborating the evidence of the accomplice Jones. It was submitted on the appeal that the witnesses Jones and Denning could not corroborate each other. 

175At pp 599-600 Dawson J and Gaudron J said in their joint judgment: 

""It is convenient first to consider the argument that Denning and Jones could not corroborate each other. Leaving aside the special problems associated with the unsworn evidence of children (which, of course, are not involved in this case) and the position with respect to the evidence of accomplices, there is no rule of law or practice that evidence which attracts a corroboration warning cannot corroborate or be corroborated by other evidence attracting the same warning. 

The rule that one accomplice cannot corroborate another is based in large part on the common interest of accomplices in minimizing their involvement in the offence charged. That common interest raises the possibility that they may have conspired to give an identical but false account. It is for this reason that a direction is given that accomplices cannot corroborate each other. Thus, if there is no possibility of joint fabrication, as, for example, where the witness was an accomplice in other offences and is called to give similar fact evidence, a direction to this effect is not required. Equally, there may be cases not involving accomplices where, because of the possibility of joint fabrication, it is necessary to direct a jury to look elsewhere for corroboration. But there was no basis for any suggestion of joint fabrication in this case and, thus, there was no need for a direction that Denning and Jones could not corroborate each other."" 

176In R v Chen the appellants had been charged with importing a commercial quantity of heroin in contravention of the Customs Act . A man named Chan who had been a member of the criminal enterprise gave evidence for the Crown. At para 58 of its judgment the Court of Criminal Appeal said: 

""In our opinion, Chan was plainly an accomplice. Though s 164(3) of the Evidence Act abolished the universal common law duty to give an accomplice warning, the power and the duty to do so in appropriate circumstances survives: see also s 165(5). It became, therefore, incumbent upon the learned presiding judge to give the jury a clear direction to the effect that it would be dangerous to convict the appellant, and his other co-accused, upon the uncorroborated evidence of that accomplice. This, as it seems to us, his Honour plainly and correctly did. ..."" 

177In R v Ngo the Court at para 179 of its judgment quoted part of the joint judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Pollitt at p 600 and at paras 187 and 188 referred with approval to what had been said at para 58 of the judgment in Chen . 

178In Conway v The Queen , Conway was charged with the murder of his wife. It was alleged by the Crown that he had instigated two men to inject his wife with a fatal dose of heroin. The two men gave evidence for the Crown at Conway's trial. The Commonwealth Evidence Act , which was in similar terms to the New South Wales Evidence Act , applied to the trial. 

179The trial judge gave the jury a direction that it would be dangerous to convict Conway of the evidence of the two men, who were accomplices, unless the evidence was corroborated. The trial judge directed the jury that a large number of matters were capable of amounting to corroboration. On the appeal it was conceded by the Crown or found by the Court, that some of these matters were not capable of amounting to corroboration. 

180The High Court held that ss 164 and 165 of the Evidence Act did not prohibit a judge from warning a jury that it would be dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice. The High Court further held that, although the jury had been misdirected about what evidence was capable of constituting corroboration, no substantial miscarriage of justice had resulted, because the evidence against the accused was overwhelming. 

181Kanaan & Ors v Regina featured prominently in the submissions of the parties on the hearing of the present appeal. 

182In Kanaan the head of a criminal organisation had been murdered. The Crown alleged that the persons who became appellants in the Court of Criminal Appeal had been parties to a joint criminal enterprise to kill the deceased. 

183The Crown case depended principally on the evidence of a witness who had been a member of the same criminal organisation and who might reasonably have been supposed to have been criminally concerned in the joint criminal enterprise. This witness was given the pseudonym of Rossini. The witness was given an undertaking by the Attorney General that, provided that the evidence he gave was true, his evidence would not be used against him. 

184The Crown case also depended, to a lesser extent, on the evidence of two brothers who might reasonably have been supposed to have been accessories after the fact to the murder. The two brothers were given the pseudonym ""Laycock"". 

185In Kanaan the trial judge did not direct the jury that it would be dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice. The trial judge did direct the jury that they could find ""support"" for the evidence of Rossini in the evidence of the Laycock brothers. The Court of Criminal Appeal held that the trial judge had not erred in either respect. 

186The High Court refused special leave to appeal from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Kanaan ((2007) HCA transcript 402 (3 August 2007)). In refusing special leave the Chief Justice said that the Court was of the view that there were insufficient prospects of the appeals succeeding to grant special leave. 

187Parts of the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Kanaan which were particularly referred to on the present appeal were parts of the judgment between paras [202] and [224]. 

188In para [205] the Court noted a submission by the appellants as follows: 

""The appellants' next submission supporting Ground 3 is that it was incumbent on the judge in this case to direct the jury that, as Rossini was an accomplice, it was dangerous to convict the accused on his uncorroborated evidence, to give the jury assistance as to the nature of corroborative evidence and to identify what evidence there was which, if accepted, could constitute corroborative evidence in this case. Reliance was placed on the decisions of this Court in Regina v Chen and Regina v Ngo."" 

189In para 206 of the Judgment the Court referred to para [58] in the judgment of the Court in Chen . In para 207 the Court set out the provisions of the Evidence Act . The Court commenced para 208 by referring to paras [187]-[188] of the judgment of the Court in Ngo . The Court then proceeded to point out that in neither Chen nor Ngo had any reference been made to the decision of the High Court in Conway , which had been handed down before the decisons in Chen and Ngo were given. 

190In paras [216]-[217] of its Judgment in Kanaan the Court said: 

""216 In the circumstances that - 

(i) Conway v The Queen explicitly states that a common law accomplice warning that it is dangerous to convict is not necessary, although it is permissible, 

(ii) the need for corroboration for any evidence (except in relation to trials of perjury or a similar or related offence) has been abolished by s 164, unless some other provision of the Evidence Act required it, and 

the terminology of the common law accomplice direction is not imported into the accomplice warning to be given pursuant to s 165(2) (as we have asserted in par [214] supra - 

it is, with due respect, not possible to agree with this Court's decisions in Chen and Ngo , and to some extent with the decision in Livingstone , that the necessity for such a direction (or the duty to give such a direction) has survived 'in appropriate circumstances'. 

217 In our view, the effect of ss 164-165 (as now interpreted by the High Court) is as follows: 

(1) It is not necessary for the evidence of a witness who may reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the trial to be corroborated. 

The judge, if requested to do so and unless of opinion that there are good reasons not to do so, is: 

(a)to give a warning that the evidence of that witness may be unreliable, 

(b)to inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and 

(c)to warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. 

(3) The matters to which reference was generally made in directions which accompanied the common law accomplice warning should, when appropriate, generally be used when informing the jury of the matters which may cause the evidence of that witness to be unreliable. 

(4) The Judge may, if satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of justice to do so in the particular case, give a warning that it would be dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of such a witness, but the judge is never under a duty to do so."" 

191In paras [219], [220] and [221] the Court said: 

""219 The appellants' final submission in support of Ground 3 is that the judge wrongly directed the jury that they could find 'support' for the evidence of Rossini in the evidence of the Laycock brothers. Reliance is placed on Pollitt v The Queen (1992) 174 CLR 588 at 600, where the rule that one accomplice cannot corroborate another was said to have been based in large part on the common interests of accomplices in minimising their involvement in the offence charged. That common interest raises the possibility that they may have conspired to give an identical but false account. For the reasons already given (in par [202] supra ), the Laycocks as accessories after the fact were not accomplices. Nor was there any requirement that Rossini's evidence be corroborated. 

220. The High Court in Pollitt also said (at 600) that corroboration could not be given of the evidence of an accomplice where there was the possibility of joint fabrication by the accomplice with the other witness. There was such a possibility of joint fabrication between Rossini and the Laycock brothers. It would therefore have been an error if the judge had directed the jury that the evidence of the Laycock brothers could corroborate that of Rossini. He did not do so. His instruction to the jury was that they should look 'to see to what extent there is any independent support' for the evidence Rossini had given. That direction did not invite the jury to equate independent support with corroboration. 

221 The words 'independent support' have a far wider meaning than 'corroboration', and therefore 'support' need not be of such a nature that it confirms in some material particular not only that the crime has been committed but also that the accused committed it: cf Rex v Baskerville (1916) 2 KB 658 at 665, 668. Provided that the jury is adequately warned that the evidence of a witness who may have fabricated a story jointly with the 'accomplice' may be unreliable for that reason when looking for support in that witness's evidence of the evidence given by the 'accomplice', there is no reason why the jury may not look for support in such evidence.' 

192The decision in Kanaan was handed down on 13 April 2006 during the trial of the appellants. The decision was drawn to the trial judge's attention and her Honour's directions in her summing up were clearly based on Kanaan . 

193On the present appeal counsel for Aouad submitted that the trial judge had erred in directing the jury that it was open to them to have regard to the evidence of one or more of the indemnified witnesses for support for the evidence of another indemnified witness. 

194It was submitted that all of the witnesses Bassam Said, Tony Haddad, Wahib Hannouf and Haissam Hannouf were ""unreliable"" witnesses and that the jury could look for support for the evidence of one of those witnesses in the evidence of another of those witnesses, only if the evidence of the other witness was truly independent of the evidence of the first witness and the evidence of the other witness would not be truly independent, unless the possibility of the two witnesses having jointly concocted their evidence was excluded. Counsel referred to Pollitt at p 600. 

195A further submission was made that in the part of the trial judge's summing up which I have quoted the trial judge directed the jury that they should assess whether the witnesses Bassam Said and Tony Haddad had had the opportunity to collude and agree upon their accounts but did not give a similar direction about whether other pairs of the unreliable witnesses had had the opportunity to jointly fabricate their evidence. 

196Counsel for Aouad accepted that the judgment of this Court in Kanaan appeared to present some difficulties for his submissions. Counsel did not submit that Kanaan had been wrongly decided but did suggest that Kanaan had been ""misunderstood"". 

197Counsel submitted that the passage in the joint judgment in Pollitt at p 600 had continuing significance, notwithstanding the subsequent introduction of the Evidence Act and the judgment of this Court in Kanaan . 

198Counsel acknowledged that leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules was required to rely on this ground, because there had been no objection to her Honour's direction at the trial, but submitted that leave should be granted. 

199Counsel for El-Zeyat made the same principal submission as counsel for Aouad, that is that the jury could look for support for the evidence of one of the unreliable witnesses in the evidence of another of those witnesses but only if the evidence of the other witness was truly independent and the evidence of the other witness would not be truly independent if there was a possibility that the evidence of the two witnesses had been jointly concocted. 

200A submission was made by counsel for El-Zeyat that ""corroboration evidence"" is a species of the genus ""supporting evidence"" and, if evidence cannot amount to corroboration because of a possibility of joint concoction, it cannot amount to independent support, if there is a possibility of joint concoction. 

201It was submitted that the unreliable witnesses in the present case had in fact had an opportunity to jointly concoct their evidence, while they were in prison together. 

202Counsel for El-Zeyat's submissions about the judgment of this Court in Kanaan varied. No submission that Kanaan had been wrongly decided had been made in counsel's written submissions. In oral submissions it was submitted that Kanaan had been ""misconceived"" and ""misapplied"". Later in counsel's oral submissions it was submitted that the distinction drawn in Kanaan between evidence which is corroboration and evidence which is independent support is fallacious. At one stage in oral submissions an outright submission was made that Kanaan had been wrongly decided. 

DECISION 

203The direction by the trial judge which is challenged was a direction which literally applied only to the indemnified witnesses. Bassam Said was not an indemnified witness. However, he was referred to in this part of the summing up and the jury could well have understood that Bassam Said was included among the witnesses whose evidence might receive or provide support. 

204In my opinion, the submissions of counsel for the appellants sought to confer on the passage in the joint judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Pollitt at p 600 a significance for the present appeals, which the passage cannot properly bear. 

205Pollitt was a case decided at common law before the introduction of the Evidence Act , in the special context of the common law rules about the corroboration of evidence of accomplices. The Evidence Act and particularly ss 164 and 165 made radical changes to the common law rules about the corroboration of evidence of accomplices. 

206In any event, none of the allegedly unreliable witnesses was an ""accomplice"" or a person who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the murder (s 165(1)(d) of the Evidence Act ). Although Bassam Said at one stage was charged by police with having been an accessory after the fact to the murder, it was not suggested at the trial that he had been criminally concerned in the murder. Nor was it suggested at the trial that Tony Haddad had been criminally concerned in the murder. Some questions were put in cross-examination to the Hannouf brothers with a view to showing that they might have been criminally concerned in the murder but they denied the suggestions put to them. No application was made at the trial that a direction pursuant to s 165 of the Evidence Act should be given on the basis that a witness might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the murder. 

207The passage in the joint judgment at p 600 of Pollitt makes clear that, apart from the two special cases mentioned, there was no general rule of law or practice at common law that evidence which required a corroboration warning could not be corroborated by other evidence requiring the same warning. 

208The only part of the joint judgment which lends any support to counsel for the appellants' submissions is the dictum that there ""may"" be cases not involving accomplices where, because of the possibility of joint fabrication, it is necessary to direct the jury to look elsewhere for corroboration. This dictum does not provide an adequate foundation for this Court to create a rule of law that, if two witnesses are ""unreliable"" (seemingly for whatever reason) the jury cannot look for support for the evidence of one witness in the evidence of the other witness, unless the possibility of joint concoction is excluded (seemingly beyond reasonable doubt). 

209As was acknowledged by counsel for both appellants, the decision of this Court in Kanaan presents serious difficulties for their submissions. As I have already noted, counsel for El-Zeyat made a submission at one stage that Kanaan had been wrongly decided. 

210In my opinion, this Court should accept Kanaan as having been correctly decided. It is a recent unanimous decision of this Court and the High Court refused special leave to appeal on the ground that the proposed appeal had insufficient prospects of succeeding. As pointed out in Kanaan , what was said in the earlier decisions of this Court in Chen and Ngo was said in apparent ignorance of the decision of the High Court in Conway . No notice was given in the written submissions for either appellant that it would be submitted that Kanaan had been wrongly decided and, accordingly, the present Bench consists of only three judges. 

211In Kanaan this Court held that there is a distinction between ""corroboration"" and ""independent support"", that independent support is wider than corroboration, that in order for evidence to be independent support it need not comply with the stringent requirements for evidence to be corroboration at common law and that a jury may look for support for the evidence of one witness in the evidence of another witness, notwithstanding the possibility that witnesses might have fabricated their evidence jointly, provided that the jury receives adequate warnings. In my opinion, these holdings undermine the submission made by counsel for each appellant that the trial judge erred in directing the jury that it was open to them to have regard to the evidence of one or more of the indemnified witnesses for support for the evidence of another indemnified witness. Contrary to the submission made by counsel for El-Zeyat, there is no logical difficulty in holding that evidence which does not satisfy a requirement for corroboration at common law may nevertheless be available as support for the evidence of another witness. 

212There was, indeed, little factual basis for a submission that the Hannouf brothers on the one hand and Bassam Said on the other hand had jointly concocted their evidence. The Hannouf brothers had made comprehensive statements to the police months before they and Bassam Said came to be imprisoned in the same correctional centre. 

213In Kanaan the court qualified its statement about the availability of the evidence of one witness as support for the evidence of another witness, notwithstanding the possibility that the evidence of the two witnesses might have been jointly fabricated, by saying that adequate warnings should be given to the jury by the trial judge. 

214It is true that the trial judge in the summing up warned about the possibility of joint concoction only as between Bassam Said and Tony Haddad and not as between other pairs of the witnesses the reliability of whose evidence was challenged. However, her Honour gave extensive general warnings about the evidence of these witnesses and the need to ""pay special attention"" and ""to exercise great care"" in assessing their evidence. Her Honour explicitly raised the possibility of joint concoction between Bassam Said and Tony Haddad. The subject having been raised, it could hardly have escaped the jury's attention that there was a possibility of joint concoction between other pairs of the witnesses, for example, between the two Hannouf brothers. 

215No application was made at the trial for any further direction and r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules is applicable. I do not consider that the fact that the trial judge did not give any more extensive directions than she did gave rise to any miscarriage of justice. 

216I would refuse leave under r 4 in respect of Aouad's first ground of appeal (including ground 1(b)) and El-Zeyat's first ground of appeal. 

AOUAD - GROUND OF APPEAL 2 

The trial judge erred in admitting into evidence a comfit identification of the appellant by the witness referred to at trial as Michael Rahman. 

217Earlier in this judgment I summarised the evidence of the witness referred to at the trial as Michael Rahman about what he observed at the service station on the afternoon of 30 October 2003. I mentioned that Mr Rahman had participated in the preparation of a comfit image of the man described in his evidence as ""the first man"" and had looked at two series of photographs for the purpose of making a photographic identification of the first man. On the Crown case ""the first man"" was Aouad. 

218On 30 October 2003 Mr Rahman made a statement to police in which he gave a description of the first man. In the statement he described the first man as having a goatee beard, as being about 170cm tall, as being of Middle Eastern appearance, as looking to be in his mid-twenties and as wearing a hooded top. This description was generally consistent with the appearance of Aouad. 

219On 30 October 2003 Mr Rahman completed what is known as a comfit request form relating to the first man. However, no comfit image of that man was generated on 30 October 2003. 

220On 7 January 2004 Mr Rahman was shown a display of photographs of young men, which did not include a photograph of Aouad. Mr Rahman selected three photographs which he said bore some similarity to the first man. 

221On 9 March 2004 Mr Rahman completed another comfit request form for the first man. There were some changes and additions in this request form. 

222A forensic imaging technician named Fleming, using the information supplied by Mr Rahman in both comfit request forms, then prepared a comfit image of the first man. 

223On 1 April 2004 Mr Rahman was interviewed by police. He was shown two computer presentations of photographs of young men of Middle Eastern appearance. The first presentation included a photograph of Aouad (No 8). Mr Rahman selected photographs 1, 3, 8 and 17 as being photographs of persons similar to the first man. The photograph of Aouad which was included in the first computer presentation had been taken on 7 December 2003. 

224The Crown gave notice before the trial that it would seek to tender at the trial evidence relating to the comfit image and its preparation and evidence relating to the showing or presentation of the photographs to Mr Rahman. Aouad's legal representatives informed the Crown that the admission into evidence of these two bodies of evidence (or parts of them) would be opposed. A voir dire enquiry was held before the commencement of the trial to determine the admissibility of these two bodies of evidence. After the conclusion of the voir dire enquiry the trial judge made rulings that both bodies of evidence were admissible. 

225Subsequently, on 19 April 2006, after the trial itself had commenced, her Honour delivered written reasons for her rulings. Her Honour's judgment has been reported R v Darwiche & Ors (2006) 166 A Crim R 28. 

226Consequentially upon her Honour's rulings, evidence relating to the comfit image and to the photographs was given at the trial. 

227No appeal was brought from her Honour's ruling that the photographic evidence was admissible. 

228It is convenient now to refer to parts of the trial Judge's judgment of 19 April 2006. In her judgment the trial judge referred to Mr Rahman as ""Mr Delaney"". 

229In para 4 of her judgment her Honour summarised the evidence which had been given in the voir dire enquiry by Mr Fleming about comfit procedure as follows: 

""Evidence was give by Mr Fleming, an imaging technician with the New South Wales Police, about com-fit request forms and the production of com-fit images. A com-fit booklet contains computer images depicting different types of human faces and facial features, including eyes, mouths, noses and hair types. Each component in the com-fit booklet is identified by a letter and a number. An identifying witness is asked to select the features that most closely resemble the suspect from the booklet and to record the component numbers for each feature on a com-fit request form. Provision is made on the form for the witness to describe hair colour, complexion, ethnic appearance and other distinguishing features. The com-fit request form is then given to an imaging technician who produces a computer generated com-fit image, a process that involves merging the selected component features to produce a composite image of a human face."" 

230In paras 40-48 of the judgment her Honour said: 

""40. I turn now to a consideration of the basis of the challenge to the evidence relating to the production of the com-fit computer image. 

41. Mr Segal objected to the admission of the com-fit image as hearsay submitting that it did not come within any of the exclusions to the hearsay rule. 

42. At common law evidence of an identikit picture has been received in evidence on an analysis that, unlike an out of court statement in writing, the pictorial representation is not hearsay: R v Cook [1987] 1 QB 417 at 425 per Watkins LJ (delivering the judgment of the court): 

'We regard the production of the sketch or photo fit by a police officer making a graphic representation of a witness's memory as another form of camera at work, albeit imperfectly and not produced contemporaneously with the material incident but soon or fairly soon afterwards. As we perceive it the photo fit is not a statement in writing made in the absence of a defendant or anything resembling it in the sense that this very old rule against hearsay has ever been expressed to embrace. It is we think sui generis, that is to say, the only one of its kind. It is a thing apart, the admissibility to evidence of which would not be in breach of the hearsay rule.' 

43. In R v Sparkes (1996) 6 Tas R 178; 88 A Crim R 194 Underwood J reviewed the authorities at common law on the admission of identikit pictures. His Honour noted the cautionary commentary in Cross on Evidence (5 th Aust ed, 1996) p 876 - that the reasoning in Cook is not so strong in principle that it will inevitably be applied in Australia and that there are hearsay dangers in relation to photo fit pictures that do not apply to photographs - but determined to admit the photo fit following the reasoning in Cook . 

44. Mr Delaney's evidence that the com-fit image resembles shooter No 1 is evidence of identification for the purposes of the Act. Mr Segal did not submit that it is inadmissible by reason of the provisions of s 114. For the reasons earlier given, I was not of the opinion that Mr Delaney's identification evidence is excluded by s 114, since I am satisfied that the accused had refused to take part in an identification parade prior to 9 March 2004. 

45. Mr Segal did not challenge the evidence of the representations made by Mr Delaney on 9 March 2004 to Detective Hamilton and to Mr Fleming of the selection of the component features from the comfit booklet or of his identification of the com-fit image as resembling shooter No 1. The matter was argued on the basis that Mr Delaney's representations were first hand hearsay (T 670). The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the representations were admissible under s 66(2). There was no issue taken about whether the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in Mr Delaney's memory at the time the representations were made for the purposes of s 66(2). In the Crown's submission the interval of four months and nine days between the shooting and the date on which the com-fit image was made did not exclude Mr Delaney's representations made on that day being fresh in the memory. I considered that Mr Delaney's identification, comprising the selection of the component features from the com-fit booklet and assertion that the com-fit image resembled shooter no 1, to be admissible as original evidence of his state of mind and analogous to the out of court identification of a photograph: R v Barbaro [2000] NSWCCA 192; (2000) 112 A Crim R 551 per Grove J (with whose judgment Spigelman CJ and Wood CJ at CL agreed) at [43]. In the event that I was wrong in so concluding, I record that although the interval of over four months was lengthy (having regard to the observations in Graham v R (1998) 195 CLR 606) I considered that the assertions contained in the com-fit request form that appears to have been completed by Mr Delaney on the day of the shooting in combination with the assertions made by him on 9 March 2004 supported the conclusion that the image of shooter no. 1 was still fresh in his memory on 9 March. 

46. Mr Segal's objection was to the admission into evidence of the com-fit image, which he contended was ""one step away"" from the representations made by Mr Delaney to Detective Hamilton and Mr Fleming. In his submission the com-fit image is an artefact produced by a skilled operator using technology and is excluded by the hearsay rule (T 670). That rule excludes evidence of a previous representation made by a person to prove the existence of a fact that the person intended to assert by the representation: s 59. The com-fit image is not tendered to prove any fact intended to be asserted by Mr Fleming. The com-fit image is a graphic representation of Mr Delaney's mental image of shooter No. 1. Accepting that Mr Delaney's identification of the com-fit image (that it closely resembles shooter No 1) is admissible, I considered that the com-fit image is admissible; much in the way that a photograph identified by a witness on an earlier occasion is admissible. 

47. Mr Segal submitted that the com-fit image should be excluded under s 137 of the Act. He laid stress on its near photographic quality, which he submitted was likely to have persuasive power that a sketch may not possess. In his submission there existed a danger that the jury would place too much emphasis on an image, which at best is a computer generated likeness based on the instructions of a witness who had a fleeting opportunity to observe shooter no. 1 and whose observations were made under circumstances of some exigency. Shooter No. 1 was not known to Mr Delaney. Mr Segal submitted that the jury may be tempted to compare the accused with the image and to conclude that he resembles the man depicted. 

48. I did not consider the quality of the com-fit image to occasion unfair prejudice to the accused. It is plainly a computer-generated image. I accepted that jurors would compare the com-fit image with the accused and assess whether the accused resembles the image that was created at Mr Delaney's direction. There is nothing about the com-fit image that occasions prejudice to the accused beyond the circumstance that his facial features may be considered to be broadly consistent with it. The matters that Mr Segal addressed by way of criticism of Mr Delaney's ability to accurately recall the appearance of shooter no 1 are matters that will require directions concerning the special need for caution in assessing evidence of this character. I was not of the opinion that the probative value of the evidence of the com-fit image was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused."" 

231It is also necessary to refer to another part of her Honour's judgment, in which her Honour referred to s 115(5) of the Evidence Act in considering the admissibility of the photographic evidence. In para 34 of her Judgment her Honour said in part: 

""...I consider that the accused had refused to take part in an identification parade on 1 March and 29 March 2004, when on each occasion he was offered the opportunity to participate in one. The verb ""refuse"" is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary , 2nd ed, as ""to decline to take or accept (something offered or presented); to reject the offer (a thing)"". I consider that the accused declined to accept the offer to participate in an identification parade and that this constituted a refusal for the purposes of subs (5)(a). The fact that he indicated that if certain conditions were met he might take a different stance does not mean that the stance taken at the time the offer was made did not constitute a refusal."" 

232It is apparent from these parts of the trial Judge's judgment that counsel for Aouad at the trial objected to the admission into evidence of only the comfit image itself. Counsel did not object to the admission into evidence of representations made by Mr Rahman to Detective Hamilton or to Mr Fleming and did not object to Mr Rahman giving evidence that the comfit image which had been produced resembled the first shooter. 

233The ground on which counsel at the trial objected to the admission into evidence of the comfit image itself (apart from the objection based on s 137 of the Evidence Act ) was that it was ""one step away"" from the representations made by Mr Rahman and was an artefact produced by a skilled operator and should be excluded under the hearsay rule. 

234The trial judge held that Mr Rahman's evidence, comprising the selection of the component features from the comfit booklet and the assertion that the comfit image resembled the first shooter, was original, and not hearsay, evidence and, if this evidence was admissible (and its admissibility had not been disputed), then the comfit image itself was admissible. The comfit image was not being tendered to prove any fact intended to be asserted by Mr Fleming. 

235The trial judge did not need to decide whether, if any part of Mr Rahman's evidence was hearsay, it was nevertheless admissible under s 66(2) of the Evidence Act but did proceed to hold that, if the evidence was hearsay, it was admissible under s 66(2). Her Honour noted that no issue had been taken about whether the occurrence of any asserted fact was ""fresh"" in Mr Rahman's memory at the time he had made a representation asserting the fact. 

236In the ground of appeal the evidence which it is alleged that the trial judge erred in admitting is described as evidence of a ""comfit identification"". 

237On the hearing of the appeal the evidence which it was submitted that the trial judge had erred in admitting went far beyond the comfit image itself, which had been the only piece of evidence objected to by trial counsel, and extended to the representations Mr Rahman had made in completing the second comfit request form and the grounds on which it was submitted that the ""comfit identification"" evidence was inadmissible went beyond the grounds which had been taken before the trial judge. It was submitted that the ""comfit identification"" evidence was hearsay evidence and that it did not come within the exception to the hearsay rule in s 66(2) of the Evidence Act , because, when Mr Rahman had made representations about the appearance of the first man on 9 March 2004, the occurrence of the facts he was asserting was no longer ""fresh"" in his memory within the meaning given to the word ""fresh"" by the High Court in Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 666. It was submitted that the trial judge had wrongly ""conflated"" the representations made by Mr Rahman on 30 October 2003, when it was conceded that his memory of the occurrence of the asserted facts was fresh, and the representations made by him on 9 March 2004, more than four months later. 

238Although no ground of objection based on s 114 of the Evidence Act had been taken at the trial, it was submitted that the comfit identification evidence was ""visual identification evidence"" and was not admissible under s 114(2)(c) of the Evidence Act , because it was not the case that the appellant had refused to take part in an identification parade, as was held by her Honour in relation to both s 115(5)(a) and s 114(2)(c) of the Evidence Act . 

239It was submitted by the Crown that the comfit identification evidence was original evidence or, alternatively, if any part of the evidence, for example, evidence of representations made by Mr Rahman on 9 March 2004, was hearsay, it had been open to her Honour to find, after taking into account all the circumstances, that the evidence was ""fresh"". It was submitted that there was in fact little difference between the representations made by Mr Rahman on 30 October 2003 and on 9 March 2004. 

240It was submitted by the Crown that this Court should not entertain the ground of objection to the evidence based on s 114 of the Evidence Act and that, in any event, no part of the evidence was ""visual identification evidence"" within s 114. 

DECISION 

241It is useful, in my opinion, to examine the actual evidence given at the trial by the relevant witnesses. 

242Mr Fleming gave evidence that he was a forensic imaging technician. He gave general evidence about the process undertaken in the creation of a comfit image, which was similar to the evidence given in the voir dire enquiry which was summarised in the trial judge's judgment. 

243Mr Fleming identified the comfit booklet, which was tendered and admitted. He identified one comfit request form which he had received from Mr Rahman. He was not sure about another comfit request form which was shown to him but other evidence established that the document shown to him was the other comfit request form he had received from Mr Rahman. 

244Mr Fleming then identified an image as being ""the image I created from the description by the witness"". 

245Mr Fleming could not recall whether Mr Rahman wanted any modifications to the image Mr Fleming had produced on the basis of the information in the request forms but agreed that ""the image ... is one that the witness was satisfied with"". 

246The relevant evidence given by Mr Rahman at the trial was quite brief. He said that on two occasions he had given instructions to police about the facial features that should be included in an image to be created. He did not give any evidence about any particular representations he had made about what the facial features were. 

247The following question and answer occurred: 

Q. When you saw the final image how good a likeness was it to the first gunman that you saw? 
A. Well, I was happy with the image he created and it's like maybe 80 percent like the one I really saw in that incident."" 

248Mr Rahman then identified the image which had been created and the image was tendered and admitted into evidence. 

249The police officer Detective Hamilton gave evidence that he had gone with Mr Rahman to the Sydney Police Centre on 9 March 2004 for the purpose of preparing a comfit image. Detective Hamilton identified the comfit request form filled in on 9 March 2004. 

250The two comfit request forms of 30 October 2003 and 9 March 2004 were admitted into evidence. 

251The key part of Mr Rahman's evidence at the trial was his evidence that, when he saw the final image, ""I was happy with the image he created and it's like maybe 80 percent like the one I really saw in that incident."" 

252It seems to me that in that answer Mr Rahman was asserting that at the time he first saw the final image he had been ""happy"" with it and that at the time of giving evidence he considered that it was about 80 percent like the person he had seen. 

253Insofar as Mr Rahman was giving evidence of his state of mind at the time of giving evidence, I consider that the evidence was clearly original evidence and not hearsay evidence. Insofar as he was giving evidence of what had been his state of mind at the time of first seeing the final image, I consider that his evidence was also original evidence. 

254The latter conclusion is supported by part of the decision of this Court in R v Barbaro (2000) 112 A Crim R 55. It is true that in that case it was held that evidence by an observer of a previous out of court act of identification by a witness, although admissible at common law, is evidence of a ""previous representation"" by the witness within the meaning of that expression in the Evidence Act and is excluded by s 59 of the Evidence Act , unless it comes within one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule of exclusion. However, it was further held in Barbaro that the witness himself was not precluded from giving evidence of the previous act of identification. Such evidence would be original evidence of the witness's state of mind at the time of the act of identification (see especially at para 43 per Grove J). 

255If Mr Rahman's evidence that the image was similar to the person he had seen was admissible, the image itself and evidence about how the image had been produced became admissible. It would, however, seem to follow from Barbaro's case that the relatively unimportant evidence given by Mr Fleming, that Mr Rahman had been satisfied with the image, might have been hearsay. 

256The reasoning of Watkins LJ giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the English case of Cook , which is set out in the trial judge's judgment, is, as was recognised by Underwood J of the Supreme Court of Tasmania in Sparkes , open to doubt but, if accepted, would lend some support to the admissibility in the present case of the comfit image and the evidence relating to the comfit image. 

257As I have already indicated, no oral evidence of previous representations by Mr Rahman was given at the trial, apart from Mr Fleming's evidence that Mr Rahman was ""satisfied"" with the final image. 

258However, the two comfit request forms completed by Mr Rahman were admitted into evidence. These did contain representations by Mr Rahman that certain features of the person he had seen were like those depicted and identified by a letter and a number in the comfit booklet. These representations were previous representations made by Mr Rahman otherwise than in the course of giving evidence in the proceedings and came within s 59 of the Evidence Act . 

259It was conceded by counsel for Aouad on this appeal that the representations made in the comfit request form of 30 October 2003 were first hand hearsay and were made at a time when the asserted facts were fresh in the memory of Mr Rahman and therefore came within the exception to the hearsay rule in s 66(2) of the Evidence Act . 

260The representations made in the comfit request form of 9 March 2004 were not made until more than four months had elapsed since 30 October 2003. However, there was a great deal of similarity between the information provided in the two request forms. The information about the first man's eyes, nose and facial hair was identical in the two forms. The further information provided in the form of 9 March 2004 that the person had a goatee beard and was wearing a hooded jacket had been provided in the statement Mr Rahman made to police on 30 October 2003. In the form of 9 March 2004 Mr Rahman said that, apart from the goatee beard, the person had short hair but this would appear to be implicit in the information provided in the first form. 

261The respects in which the two request forms differed were that in the first form Mr Rahman described the first man as having a face like F25 in the comfit booklet, whereas in the second form Mr Rahman described the man as having a face ""between F14 and F25"" in the booklet (there are 43 different types of face shown in the booklet) and in the first form Mr Rahman described the first shooter as having a mouth like M21 in the booklet, whereas in the second form he initially wrote M21 again, then ruled it out and wrote M11 (there are 61 different types of mouth shown in the booklet). 

262In the circumstances, I consider that it was open to the trial judge to conclude, as she did, that the image of the first shooter was still ""fresh"" in the memory of Mr Rahman on 9 March 2004. 

263As I have already noted, no objection based on s 114 of the Evidence Act was made to the comfit evidence at the trial. In my opinion and notwithstanding an assertion made by the trial judge in para 44 of her judgment, the evidence was not identification evidence and therefore not ""visual identification evidence"". Mr Rahman was not asserting that Aouad was or resembled one of the shooters. He was merely asserting that some of the shooter's features were like certain features shown in the comfit booklet and that the comfit image resembled the shooter. 

264Alternatively, I do not consider that there was any error by her Honour in holding, for the reasons she gave, that Aouad had refused to take part in an identification parade within s 114(2)(c) of the Evidence Act . 

265In my opinion, this ground of appeal should be rejected. 

AOUAD - GROUND OF APPEAL 3 

266This ground of appeal was abandoned. 

AOUAD - GROUND OF APPEAL 4 

The trial judge erred in not discharging the jury after an outburst from the witness Donna Fahda (the sister of the deceased and ex-wife of the appellant). 

267There was no corresponding ground of appeal by El-Zeyat. 

268Donna Fahda, a sister of the deceased and the ex-wife of Aouad, gave evidence for the Crown at the trial on 1 May 2006. She gave evidence that she had become engaged to Aouad in June 2002 and had married him on 27 October 2002. She left him on a number of occasions and left him permanently in August 2003. 

269Donna Fahda gave evidence that, while she was engaged to Aouad and after their marriage, she had seen Aouad in possession of Glock pistols. A ballistics expert gave evidence at the trial that marks on fired cartridge cases collected from the garage indicated that the cartridges might have been discharged from a Glock or a Smith & Wesson pistol. A Smith & Wesson is basically a copy of a Glock. 

270After Donna Fahda had given this evidence, the trial judge directed the jury that the evidence was led for the limited purpose of showing that Aouad had access to firearms consistent with the firearm used to shoot Ahmed Fahda. 

271Donna Fahda was cross-examined by counsel for Aouad. The transcript records the following questions and answers. 

""Q. What I wanted to put to you is that on no occasion did the man Ramzi Aouad have possession of any pistols at all? 
A. Pardon? Okay, it must be that you are married to him, not me. You must share the house, not me. 

HER HONOUR: Q. One moment. Counsel is putting to you he did have a gun-- 
A. I saw it with my own eyes, I know my own eyes don't lie. He had a gun, he had two of them. He was shot with one of them. He shot the bloody bedroom, ask him, he knows that. 

(In response to a comment from the dock) You shut up."" 

272The trial judge directed Donna Fahda to confine herself to answering the questions she was asked. She was not in fact asked any further questions by any counsel. 

273On 4 May 2006, that is three days after Donna Fahda had given her evidence, counsel for Aouad made an application for a discharge of the jury on the grounds that the latter parts of the answer Donna Fahda had given on 1 May 2006 (""he was shot with one of them. He shot the bloody bedroom, ask him. He knows that"") were unresponsive to the question asked and prejudicial. The trial judge said that she would deal with the application later that day. 

274The trial judge decided not to discharge the jury and delivered a judgment giving her reasons. In her judgment she said of the unresponsive parts of the witness's answer: 

""... it seems to me that this evidence is capable of suggesting some misadventure that occurred in the bedroom of the premises involving the discharge of a Glock pistol and in which the accused suffered a bullet injury. It may be that there are other interpretations that can be put on it but it does not seem to me to be evidence tending to disclose that the accused has, on a previous occasion, used a pistol to shoot at another person or to threaten another person."" 

275In her judgment the trial judge noted that the evidence had been given on the fourteenth day of the trial and that the application for a discharge of the jury had been made on the seventeenth day of the trial. She referred to her power to give any further directions sought by counsel. No application was subsequently made that her Honour give any further directions. 

276On this appeal counsel for Aouad, while conceding that the trial judge was exercising a discretionary power in deciding whether or not to discharge the jury, submitted that the exercise of the discretion had miscarried. It was submitted that a more sinister interpretation of the unresponsive parts of Donna Fahda's answer was possible, that is that the witness was asserting that Aouad had shot the deceased with one of the two guns, that the witness's suggestion, ""ask him"", reversed the onus of proof and that the time in the trial at which the evidence was given and the delay in making the application for a discharge were irrelevant and should not have been taken into account in the exercise of the discretion. 

277The Crown submitted that a ground of appeal of this kind can be upheld, only if the Court of Criminal Appeal is of the view that the only course which had been open to the trial judge was to discharge the jury or where, with the benefit of hindsight, it can clearly be established that a miscarriage of justice arose because the jury was not discharged. The Crown cited R v El-Hayek [2004] NSWCCA 25 at [62] per Howie J. 

278It was submitted by the Crown that the interpretation of the unresponsive parts of the answer which was suggested by the trial judge in her judgment was clearly open, whereas the interpretation suggested by counsel for Aouad was strained. The trial judge accepted that there might be other interpretations open. In her summing up the trial judge gave strong directions about the criminal onus and standard of proof and an accused's right to silence. 

279It was submitted by the Crown that the fact that the trial had run for a number of days (and was likely to continue to run for a number of days) and the delay on the part of counsel in making the application for a discharge were factors which were relevant to the exercise of the discretion. 

280In my opinion, for the reasons given by her Honour in her judgment and by the Crown in its submissions, this Court should find that there was no error in the exercise of the trial judge's discretionary power and that the decision not to discharge the jury did not lead to any miscarriage of justice. 

281I would reject this ground of appeal. 

AOUAD - GROUND OF APPEAL 5 

EL-ZEYAT - GROUND OF APPEAL 2 

5(a) A miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence at trial of fresh evidence concerning a listening device recording the witness, Haissam Hannouf, speaking to another man on 31 December 2003. 

5(b) In the alternative, the trial miscarried as a result of the failure of police and prosecuting authorities to fully disclose material relevant to the credibility and tendency to violence of Haissam Hannouf. 

5(c) In the alternative, the trial miscarried as a result of the failure of the appellant's legal advisors to exercise due diligence by obtaining material relevant to the credibility and tendency to violence of Haissam Hannouf. 

282The evidence which it was submitted was fresh and the material which it was submitted was relevant to the credibility and tendency to violence of Haissam Hannouf was evidence of a conversation on 31 December 2003 between Haissam Hannouf and one of his other brothers Ahmed Hannouf. 

283In late 2003 Haissam Hannouf and others were suspected by police of taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. A listening device was installed in an apartment pursuant to a warrant granted under the Listening Devices Act and a conversation on 31 December 2003 was recorded by means of this listening device. 

284A charge of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug was brought against Haissam Hannouf and a Crown brief of evidence was served. The Crown brief included listening device warrants which had been granted but did not include a recording of the conversation of 31 December 2003 or any transcript of the conversation. 

285The charge of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug was included in the indemnity granted to Haissam Hannouf and no trial of the charge ever took place. 

286The brief of evidence on the drug charge against Haissam Hannouf was served (together, of course, with many other documents) on the present appellants before their trial commenced. As I have already noted, the brief of evidence contained the listening device warrants but did not include any recording or any transcript of any conversation recorded by means of the listening devices. 

287In 2008 the criminal trial of a man named El-Jamal commenced in the Supreme Court before R S Hulme J and a jury. Haissam Hannouf gave evidence at this trial. During the trial the recording and a transcript of the conversation on 31 December 2003 were produced, in response to a call by Counsel for El-Jamal, and Haissam Hannouf was cross-examined about the conversation. 

288It would appear that the transcript of the conversation had only recently been prepared for the purpose of complying with the call made by El-Jamal's counsel. 

289In October 2008 Hulme J permitted access by Aouad's legal representatives to the transcript of Haissam Hannouf's evidence at the trial of El-Jamal. By perusing this transcript Aouad's legal representatives became aware of the recorded conversation of 31 December 2003. 

290In the conversation of 31 December 2003 Haissam Hannouf discussed with his brother Ahmed the obtaining of illicit drugs from a man who is referred to as being ""brother"". 

291In one part of the conversation Haissam Hannouf said: 

""(indistinct) in secret, because I don't want to end up doing my brother for the sake of money (indistinct) I'll shoot him straight out, I will shoot him, you know, I don't want it to reach to that because if I shoot him (indistinct)."" 

292In another part of the conversation Haissam Hannouf said: 

""(indistinct) don't tell me (indistinct) doesn't open his mouth (indistinct) we shoot him. 

... 

(indistinct) open his mouth (indistinct) I will shoot him (indistinct) we will reach that stage."" 

293At the trial of El-Jamal the audiovisual recording made on 31 December 2003 was played to Haissam Hannouf and he was asked questions about it. 

294In his evidence Haissam Hannouf said that he and his brother Ahmed had been obtaining tablets for the purpose of extracting pseudoephedrine from the tablets and sending the pseudoephedrine in powder form to a man named Mark. 

295In cross-examination on the first part of the conversation in which he referred to shooting, Haissam Hannouf said that in using the word ""shooting"" he was referring to guns and that the person he was talking about shooting was the man Mark. He said that he talked about shooting Mark ""not for the sake of money. If he didn't get his money, he is going to come after me, so I will shoot him too, back, like, in self defence, yes"". 

296In cross-examination about the second part of the conversation in which he referred to shooting, Haissam Hannouf said that the person he was talking about shooting was still Mark, ""If he opened his mouth to come after his money. He is a bikie, if he opens his mouth to the bikies, to someone to kill us"". 

297Further questions and answers in the cross-examination of Haissam Hannouf at El-Jamal's trial were: 

""Q, As at the thirty-first of December 2003 you were quite comfortable talking about a plan to shoot someone if you thought it was necessary, that's right? 
A. Self-defence for my life, yes. 

Q. And what you are talking about is shooting someone with a gun: 
A. Yes."" 

298It was submitted on behalf of the appellants that the recorded conversation showed that, at a time proximate to the murder of Ahmed Fahda (2 months afterwards), Haissam Hannouf was prepared to kill someone by shooting him with a gun. It was submitted that the conversation was of significant probative value and was relevant both to the credibility of Haissam Hannouf as a witness and to whether Haissam Hannouf might have been criminally concerned in the murder of Ahmed Fahda. Counsel submitted that the evidence of the conversation could be combined with evidence given at the trial, including evidence of a history of animosity between the Fahda family and the Hannouf family. 

299It was accepted by counsel for the appellants that at the trial there had been evidence of criminal conduct by Haissam Hannouf, including acts of violence and of possession of firearms and a readiness to use firearms, but at times remote from the time of the murder. Moreover, a number of suggestions of criminal conduct which were put to Haissam Hannouf in cross-examination at the trial had been denied by him and could not otherwise be established. 

300It was submitted that evidence of the conversation of 31 December 2003, had it been available at the trial, would have had a special value for the appellants, because the conversation had taken place within about 2 months of the shooting and, the conversation having been recorded, Haissam Hannouf, if the conversation had been put to him, would not have been able to deny it. 

301It was submitted by the Crown that the evidence of the conversation was not ""fresh"" evidence, because the service on the appellants' legal representatives of the Crown brief on the drug charge against Haissam Hannouf, by its inclusion of the listening device warrants, should have put the appellants on notice that there might have been conversations which had been recorded by means of the listening devices. 

302A submission more strongly relied on by the Crown was that the fresh evidence added little to the evidence which had been given at the trial and it was not the case that, if the fresh evidence had been before the jury, the jury would have been likely to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellants. 

DECISION 

303It was common ground on the appeal that the principles to be applied by a Court of Criminal Appeal in considering a ground of appeal based on what is alleged to be fresh evidence were accurately stated by Kirby J in his judgment in R v Abou-Chabake (2004) 149 A Crim R 417 at 427-428(63). The sixth principle stated by Kirby J was as follows, applying where the evidence is not such as would entitle the appellant to an acquittal: 

""Sixth, where the evidence does not have that quality, or where a new trial is sought, a number of issues arise. The verdict will be quashed and a new trial ordered only where the following questions are answered affirmatively: 

Is the evidence fresh? 

If it is, is it ""credible"" or at least capable of belief ( Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 395; 20 A Crim R 244 at 246 per Gibbs CJ), or ""plausible"" ( Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259 at 301; 43 A Crim R 182 at 210 per Toohey and Gaudron JJ)? 

If it is, would that evidence, in the context of the evidence given at the trial, have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused ( Gallagher v The Queen (at 410; 257) per Brennan J) or, if there is a practical difference, is there a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the accused ( Gallagher v The Queen (at 402; 251) per Mason and Deane JJ)? See Mickelberg v The Queen (at 301-302; 210-211) per Toohey and Gaudron JJ."" 

304I would reject the Crown's submission that the evidence should not be regarded as ""fresh"" evidence because the listening device warrants, but not the recordings or the transcript of any conversation, were included in the Crown brief on the drug trafficking charge against Haissam Hannouf, which was served on the appellants. There is no doubt that the evidence consisting of the recording of the conversation is credible. The determination of Part (a) of the ground of appeal therefore turns on the third question identified by Kirby J in Abou-Chabake , that is, if evidence of the conversation had been before the jury at the trial would it have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellants or whether there is a significant possibility that the jury acting reasonably would have acquitted the appellants. 

305I do not consider that, if the fresh evidence had been before the jury, the fresh evidence, in the context of the evidence that was given at the trial, would have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellants or that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellants. 

306There was much evidence at the trial of the bad character of Haissam Hannouf, of his having access to guns and of his being prepared to use guns to shoot people including Ahmed Fahda. This evidence included the following evidence given in cross-examination: 

""Q. Didn't your family purchase guns, hand guns in the middle of 2001? 
A. Yes. 

Q. So that they could defend themselves against such an attack by Fahda or his associates, correct? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And or perhaps to strike at him and his associates before they had a chance to strike at you, correct? 
A. Inside the house, yes. 

Q. You weren't going to take the guns outside the house and shoot? 
A. No, if he is going to come and shoot us inside the house, then we have to defend ourselves. 

Q. These were legitimately obtained firearms were they? 
A. No. 

Q. What sort of guns were bought? 
A. My brothers got all the guns."" 

307After Haissam Hannouf said that he knew that his brothers were acquiring guns, the evidence continued: 

""Q. And you were prepared to use them if necessary? 
A. Yes. 

Q. The guns were to be used to strike at Mr Fahda and his associates before he got the chance to shoot at you or to injure your family? 
A. Yes. 

Q. In 2003 October of 2003 when you claimed to have seen him shot dead at the petrol station, he is still an enemy of your family, isn't he? 
A. Yes. 

Q. He is still someone that you harboured fear might do something of a serious nature to you or any member of your family? 
A. Yes."" 

308It is true that in this evidence Haissam Hannouf said that guns had been acquired in 2001, that is two years before the murder. However, he said that Ahmed Fahda had remained an enemy of the Hannouf family down to the time of the murder. 

309In my opinion, the fresh evidence that Haissam Hannouf was prepared to use guns to shoot some person other than the deceased, in self defence in the context of a drug deal, would have added little to the evidence before the jury, either as affecting the credibility as a witness of Haissam Hannouf or as showing that it was reasonably possible that he might have been criminally concerned in the murder. Accordingly, Part (a) of this ground of appeal should be rejected. 

310I would also reject Part (b) and Part (c) of this ground on the basis of what I consider to be the lack of significance of the evidence. The evidence in this case lacks the significance of the new evidence in Grey v The Queen (2000) 201 CLR 414, a case to which we were referred by counsel and to which I will refer in more detail later in this judgment. 

311Part (c) of this ground was not really pressed. It had been foreshadowed that affidavits might be obtained from Aouad's legal representatives at the time of the trial but no affidavits were ever filed. 

312In my opinion, all parts of Aouad's ground of appeal 5 and El-Zeyat's ground of appeal 2 should be rejected. 

AOUAD - GROUND OF APPEAL 6 

6. A miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence at trial of evidence concerning a conversation between Sheikh Taj Eldeen Alhilali and Bassam Said on 8 July 2004. 

6(b) In the alternative, the trial miscarried as a result of the failure of police and prosecuting authorities to disclose material concerning a conversation between Sheikh Taj Eldeen Alhilali and Bassam Said on 8 July 2004. 

EL-ZEYAT - GROUNDS OF APPEAL 5 AND 6 

5. A miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence at trial of fresh evidence concerning the conversation between Sheikh Taj Eldeen Alhilali and Bassam Said on 8 July 2004. 

6. A miscarriage of justice resulted from the failure of the police and prosecuting authorities to disclose material concerning the conversation between Sheikh Taj Eldeen Alhilali and Bassam Said on 8 July 2004. 

313It is apparent that grounds 6 and 6(b) of Aouad's appeal and grounds 5 and 6 of El-Zeyat's appeal are identical. 

314None of these grounds were originally grounds of appeal for either appellant. At the beginning of the hearing of the appeal on 29 June 2010 counsel for El-Zeyat gave notice that he might wish to raise a further ground of appeal based on a conversation between ""the Mufti"" (Sheikh Alhilali) and Bassam Said but needed to check some matters of fact before seeking to raise any further ground of appeal. 

315The principal hearing of the appeals took place on 29 June and 30 June. On 2 July counsel for El-Zeyat gave notice of an application for leave to add a further ground or grounds of appeal and on 9 July the Court made a grant of leave both to El-Zeyat and to Aouad. 

316It is clear from the transcript of the hearing on 9 July that the leave which the Court granted was limited to the grounds which I have set out above. On 13 July 2010 an amended notice of grounds of appeal was filed on behalf of El-Zeyat, which was in accordance with the leave which had been granted. On 9 July 2010 the Court directed that the parties file written submissions on the further grounds of appeal. The submissions which were filed on behalf of the appellant Aouad were properly limited to the grounds for which leave had been given. However, in the written submissions which were filed on behalf of the appellant El-Zeyat ground 6 was stated as being ""a miscarriage of justice resulted from the failure of the police and prosecuting authorities to disclose material concerning the events leading up to and including the obtaining of witness statements from Bassam Said (including his conversation with Sheikh Taj Eldeen Alhilali on 8 July 2004)"" and some of the submissions in the written submissions went beyond material concerning the conversation between Sheikh Taj Eldeen Alhilali and Bassam Said on 8 July 2004. 

317In my opinion, further leave should not be granted so as to permit the appellant El-Zeyat to rely on a ground of appeal in the terms of ground 6 in the written submissions filed on his behalf and the Court should not entertain such of the submissions as are not germane to the grounds of appeal for which leave was granted. 

318A number of affidavits were filed which are relevant to these grounds of appeal. There was no cross-examination of any of the deponents of these affidavits and no application to cross-examine any of the deponents. In these circumstances the Court should proceed on the basis that what is deposed to in the affidavits should be accepted as being true. 

319Sheikh Alhilali's affidavit of 1 July 2010, omitting formal parts and omitting paragraphs which were objected to and rejected by the Court or not pressed, was in the following terms: 

""1. As at October 2003 I was the Mufti of Australia (i.e. the most senior Islamic Jurist). 

2. I am currently the senior Imam at the Lakemba Mosque employed by the Lebanese Moslems Association. 

3. I am aware that a conversation I had with Bassam Said regarding the shooting of Ahmed Fahda is now relevant to criminal proceedings involving Naseam El-Zeyat. For that reason, I make this statement. 

4. Each of Bassam Said, Ahmed Fadha and Naseam El-Zeyat, and various members of their respective families, were known to me as at October 2003. 

5. I recall that at some time following the shooting of Ahmed Fahda, I was contacted by police officer Detective Tamer Kilani. That officer gave me his mobile telephone number, which I recorded in my notebook as (xxx). Detective Kilani is of Egyptian background I have known him and his family from when he was a young child. Detective Kilani asked to see me and indicated that he needed my assistance. 

6. Detective Kilani later came to my office and said to me that he and other officers were trying to gather information with respect to the Ahmed Fahda murder. At one stage in that conversation he said: ' the most importance witness in this case was Mr Bassam Said '. Detective Kilani also said that ' we need you because Mr Said is refusing to cooperate with the police '. 

9. I was contacted again by Detective Kilani. He told me that Bassam Said was being held in custody and asked me if I would go with him to speak with Bassam Said. He came to my office and took me with him in his car to where Bassam Said was being held. 

10. I am now advised that records show that this visit occurred on or about 8 July 2004. This accords with my recollection. I understand that this took place at the Long Bay gaol. My recollection as to precisely where I saw Bassam Said is not exactly clear, but accept that it occurred at the Long Bay gaol. I know that I have only met with Bassam Said once while he was in custody. 

11. When we arrived, I recall that both Detective Kilani and I entered a small room. Bassam Said then came into the room. I sat with him. I do not recall whether Detective Kilani remained in the room the whole time or not. 

12. I spoke in Arabic to Bassam Said and told him to the best of my recollection in words to the effect: ' First and foremost, the truth is the way to salvation. We do not want you to take sides with either group, we only want you to speak the truth and say what you actually saw with your own eyes '. 

13. I asked Bassam about the different groupings. He explained to me who he believed to be with the Darwiches and who were with the Fahdas and he mentioned a number of names, some of which I no longer recall. However, I do recall the name of Naseam El-Zeyat as being mentioned. 

14. He then explained to me: ' The police are saying that there was evidence that implicates Naseam El-Zeyat, however, I did not see Naseam '. 

15. I then said to him: ' It is absolutely crucial for you to say what you saw in order to clear your conscience and your slate before Allah '. 

16. He said to me: ' I swear father Sheikh, what I saw with my own eyes, I did say in my first statement. I assure you and I swear by Allah to you that I did not recognise the killers, I did not recognise anyone. However, the police do not believe me and they continue to insist and put pressure on me and ask me to confess that I recognise the killers. I did not see Naseam or anyone who is known to me. Had I seen Naseam, I would have said. They seem to think that I recognised the killers and that I am refusing to talk. My family and I are under pressure from everyone '. 

17. I then told Detective Kilani: "" Bassam has told the police the truth, he made a solemn oath to me that he did not recognise those who killed him '. 

19. Until now, I have never been asked about this conversation with Bassam Said and I have never told anyone about this conversation with Bassam Said. 

20. This affidavit has been interpreted to me at my office in the Lakemba Mosque."" 

320An investigation note created by Detective Kilani was in the following terms: 

""On 8 July 2004, the Mufti, Sheik Taj El-Hillaly and Detective Kilani attended the SPC and spoke with Bassam SAID. The mufti spoke with SAID and encouraged him to be truthful and continue to assist police. Said was spoken to by Detective Kilani and SAID stated that he was still adamant that he did not see Naseam El-Zeyat on the day of Ahmed Fahda's murder. He did, however, acknowledge that he may have mistaken El-Zeyat for Touma. This was due to him believing that Elzeyat had a shaved head and facial hair. Said also indicated that he still has intentions for applying for bail. He further stated that he will sign the last unsigned statement once he can be given a guarantee that he will be granted bail."" 

321Detective Kilani made an affidavit dated 21 July 2010 which is in the following terms: 

""1. I am a Detective Senior Constable of Police. I was involved in Strike Force Adder operating with Task Force Gain from 2004 to 2006. Strike Force Adder was established to investigate into the murder of Ahmed Fahda. 

2. Following a request by Mr Eddie Nedim, Solicitor for the Appellant El-Zeyat, who made an inquiry about a date, I produced to the Office of the Director of Public prosecutions (ODPP) an Investigator's Note made by me. This note is annexed hereto and marked ""A"". 

3. This note was made following a meeting between Sheikh Taj Eldeen Alhilali and Bassam Said on 8 July 2004, at which I was present. 

4. Neither the note nor the fact of the meeting had previously been disclosed to the ODPP or the Appellants' legal advisers. 

5. At the time of the meeting Bassam Said was in custody having been charged on 1 June 2004 with being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Ahmed Fahda. The investigations into that murder were continuing and included speaking to Bassam Said who had provided a statement on 5 November 2003 and an induced statement on 3 June 2004. Apart from operational and public interest immunity considerations for non-disclosure of such a meeting, Said's assistance was ongoing and was not complete. 

6. My Investigator's Note refers to 'the last unsigned statement'. I have not located any such statement but believe this may relate to the information the basis of the induced statement dated 12 July 2004, which was not signed until 3 August 2004, and which I understand was later served as part of the brief of evidence together with the further induced statement of 16 December 2004."" 

322In paragraph 2 of his affidavit Detective Kilani did not say on what date he produced the investigator's note. However, I would infer that the note was produced to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, for the first time, only shortly before Detective Kilani made his affidavit. 

323A solicitor in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions made an affidavit on 21 July 2010. The solicitor had searched in the Director of Public Prosecutions files for the trials of the appellants and Darwiche. The solicitor had not located in those files any copy of the investigator's note or any copy of an unsigned statement by Bassam Said. However, in a file relating to Bassam Said the solicitor had found a document made on or about 15 July 2004 referring to an unsigned statement by Bassam Said, which had been received from police on 14 July 2004. In the document there were what purported to be extracts from the unsigned statement. These extracts suggest that the unsigned statement was, or was similar to, the signed statement by Bassam Said (""the third statement""), which, although dated 12 July 2004, was not signed until 3 August 2004. In that signed statement Bassam Said said that he recognised the second shooter as being El-Zeyat. 

324The solicitor found in the same file three pages of photocopied handwritten notes. The solicitor stated in her affidavit ""Neither the author nor the origin of these notes is known"". It would seem quite possible, from the contents of the notes, that the author of the notes was Bassam Said himself but this is not certain. 

325Affidavits were made by the appellants stating that they had had no knowledge of Bassam Said's conversation with Sheikh Alhilali until very recently. 

SUBMISSIONS FOR THE APPELLANTS 

326Some of the principal submissions made on behalf of the appellants in support of the grounds of appeal can be briefly summarised as follows. 

327The investigator's note should have been disclosed to the appellants before the trial, in performance of the Crown's obligation of disclosure. If the investigator's note had been disclosed, inquiries would have been made of Sheikh Alhilali and the evidence the Sheikh has now given about his conversation with Bassam Said would have been obtained. That material could then have been used in cross-examination of Bassam Said, with a devastating effect on Bassam Said's credibility. 

328In the conversation with Sheikh Alhilali Bassam Said swore to the Sheikh that he did not recognise either of the killers. This conversation occurred on 8 July, in between the making by Bassam Said of his second statement and the making of his third statement. In his second statement made on 3 June 2004 he had asserted that Aouad was one of the shooters but that he could not identify the other shooter. In his third statement dated 12 July 2004 and signed 3 August 2004, he asserted that Aouad and El-Zeyat were the shooters. What Bassam Said said to Sheikh Alhilali on 8 July 2004 was consistent with his first statement made on 5 November 2003, in which he had said that he did not recognise either of the shooters. 

329What Bassam Said said on 8 July 2004 was said by him to a senior religious figure, who, it could be inferred, Bassam Said respected and was said after that religious figure had solemnly enjoined him to tell the truth. 

330The investigator's note confirmed that Sheikh Alhilali had had a meeting with Bassam Said on 8 July 2004, that he had encouraged Bassam Said to tell the truth and that Bassam Said had been adamant on 8 July 2004 that he did not see El-Zeyat on the day of the murder. 

331Counsel referred to an apparent inconsistency in the investigator's note. The investigator's note recorded Bassam Said as being adamant that he did not see El-Zeyat on the day of the murder. However, the investigator's note also recorded a willingness on the part of Bassam Said, even if only a conditional willingness, to sign ""the last unsigned statement""; yet, if the unsigned statement was similar to the statement dated 12 July, Bassam Said was saying in the unsigned statement that he recognised El-Zeyat as being one of the killers. 

332It was submitted that the final sentence in the investigator's note emphasised that Bassam Said's willingness to assist in the investigation was conditional upon him receiving benefits. 

333It was submitted that evidence of the investigator's note and the conversation showed that some of the evidence given by Bassam Said at the trial was false, including an assertion by him that he was not asked by police, between the making of his second statement and the making of his third statement, to say who the second shooter was. 

334It was submitted that Bassam Said was a crucial witness in the Crown case. There could be no dispute that he had been at the service station at the time of the shooting. He was not an indemnified witness and, although he had at one stage been charged with being an accessory after the fact, there was no suggestion at the trial that he had been criminally concerned in the murder. 

CROWN SUBMISSIONS 

335The principal submissions made by the Crown on these grounds can be briefly summarised as follows. 

336It was submitted that evidence of the conversation on 8 July 2004 between Bassam Said and Sheikh Alhilali should not be considered as having led to any miscarriage of justice, when regard was had to the evidence which had been given at the trial adversely affecting Bassam Said's credibility, including that he had told lies, that he had made a number of inconsistent statements, that he had deliberately withheld information from the police, that he had only gradually revealed what he knew and that he had been willing to provide information, only if he received some benefit from the authorities in return. 

337The absence of evidence of the conversation of 8 July at the trial had not prevented defence counsel at the trial submitting to the jury that Bassam Said's evidence identifying the two appellants as being the killers was not true and was the result of pressure which had been applied to him, including pressure by law enforcement authorities. 

338In her summing up the trial judge had given the jury strong warnings about the need to exercise care in accepting evidence from Bassam Said. 

339The only use which could have been made at the trial, of evidence about the conversation of 8 July 2004, would have been to further discredit a witness whose potential unreliability was, on the evidence which was before the jury, perfectly obvious and frankly acknowledged by the Crown. 

340If Bassam Said had been confronted at the trial with his conversation with Sheikh Alhilali, it is likely that he would have described what he said to the Sheikh as ""bullshit"", just as he had described his similar assertions in his first statement of 5 November 2003. 

341There was evidence at the trial that Bassam Said was not averse to disregarding a religious obligation to tell the truth. He had made an oath on the Koran to tell the truth before giving evidence before the Crime Commission but had then told what he later admitted to be lies in his evidence before the Crime Commission. 

342What Bassam Said was recorded as saying in part of the investigator's note, that he did not see El-Zeyat on the day of the murder, was clearly false, because there was uncontroverted evidence that he had seen El-Zeyat in the morning and also in the evening of 30 October 2003, including surveillance photographs showing him at Menai in the same group as El-Zeyat. 

343What Bassam Said was recorded as saying in a part of the investigator's note that ""He did, however, acknowledge that he may have mistaken El-Zeyat for Touma"" should be interpreted as indicating that Bassam Said had, prior to 8 July 2004, identified El-Zeyat as one of the shooters. 

344It was submitted that the Crown case against the appellants was strong and that the part of the defence case, that it was the Hannouf brothers who were the killers, was weak. 

DECISION - AOUAD GROUND 6(A), EL-ZEYAT GROUND 5 

345In considering Aouad's fifth ground of appeal and El-Zeyat's second ground of appeal I referred to the principles to be applied by a Court of Criminal Appeal in considering a ground of appeal against conviction based on fresh evidence. 

346It was not disputed that the evidence of the conversation of 8 July 2004 was fresh evidence, that is evidence which was not known to the appellants at the time of the trial and could not by the exercise of reasonable diligence have become known to them at the time of the trial. Sheikh Alhilali said in his affidavit that ""until now"" he had never been asked about the conversation and had never told anyone about the conversation. 

347Nor was there any dispute about the credibility of the evidence, that is as evidence of what was said in the conversation (as distinct from evidence of the truth of the assertions made by Bassam Said in the conversation). As already noted, there was no application by the Crown to cross-examine Sheikh Alhilali on his affidavit and parts of Sheikh Alhilali's affidavit are confirmed by the investigator's note. 

348The issue for this Court is whether the evidence of the conversation, in the context of the evidence given at the trial, would have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellants or whether there is a significant possibility that the jury acting reasonably would have acquitted the appellants. 

349As was submitted by the Crown on this appeal, there was much evidence at the trial adversely affecting the credibility of Bassam Said. There was evidence at the trial that Bassam Said was generally a person of bad character and that in the police investigation he had told lies, had made inconsistent statements, had deliberately concealed information and had provided information only conditionally upon receiving some benefit and that warrants for his arrest had had to be issued to compel him to give evidence at the trial. 

350There was also, as submitted by the Crown on this appeal, much evidence in the Crown case at the trial, apart from the evidence given by Bassam Said, which would not be affected by the fresh evidence. 

351I have nevertheless concluded that, if evidence about the conversation on 8 July 2004 had been before the jury, the jury would have been likely to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellants or, alternatively, there is a significant possibility that the jury might have acquitted the appellants. 

352Bassam Said is a Moslem and Sheikh Alhilali was the most senior Islamic jurist in Australia. Bassam Said and Sheikh Alhilali knew each other. Sheikh Alhilali went with an investigating police officer to the gaol where Bassam Said was being held. At the gaol he stressed to Bassam Said the importance of his religious duty to tell the truth and to clear his conscience. Bassam Said addressed the Sheikh respectfully and swore by Allah that he did not recognise the killers. Although the conversation focussed on El-Zeyat, Bassam Said asserted in the conversation that he did not recognise either of the killers. 

353In the conversation Bassam Said spoke of the pressures which had been put on him to say that he recognised the killers. 

354In my opinion, if the fresh evidence had been available at the trial and had been used in the cross-examination of Bassam Said, a further serious blow would have been dealt to Bassam Said's credibility. 

355Earlier in this judgment I summarised the evidence in the Crown case. As was submitted by the Crown on this appeal, there was much evidence in the Crown case other than Bassam Said's evidence. 

356However, the only witnesses who actually identified the shooters were Bassam Said and the Hannouf brothers, Wahib Hannouf and Haissam Hannouf. 

357An advantage to the Crown in Bassam Said's evidence was that Bassam Said was indisputably at the service station at the time of the shooting, within a few metres of the victim and the shooters, and would have had a good opportunity of observing the shooters. 

358On the other hand, the evidence of the Hannouf brothers was open to the criticism that it could seem a remarkable coincidence that they happened to be travelling past the service station at the very time the shooting occurred. In accordance with the trial judge's directions in her summing up that the jury could look for independent support for the evidence of one witness in the evidence of another witness, the jury could have looked at Bassam Said's evidence for independent support for the evidence of the Hannouf brothers. 

359Bassam Said also had the advantages as a witness for the Crown that he was not an indemnified witness and there was no suggestion at the trial that he had been criminally concerned in the murder. 

360In my opinion, ground 6(a) of Aouad's appeal and ground 5 of El-Zeyat's appeal should be upheld. 

DECISION - AOUAD GROUND 6(B), EL-ZEYAT GROUND 6 

361It is clear that the investigator's note should have been disclosed to the appellants' legal representatives before the appellants' trial and counsel for the Crown on this appeal did not really make any submission to the contrary. As to the Crown's duty of disclosure see R v Reardon (2004) 60 NSWLR 454 at 468-469 (46-55) and Cornwell v R (2010) NSWCCA 59 at (210). The reasons given in paragraph 5 of Detective Kilani's affidavit, while they might have been legitimate reasons for temporarily not disclosing the note, were not legitimate reasons for not disclosing the note at some time before the trial was held. 

362In Grey v The Queen (2000) 201 CLR 414 the prosecution had failed to disclose to the appellant's legal advisers a document capable of affecting the credibility of an important witness for the Crown at the trial. 

363In their joint judgment, Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Callinan JJ held at paras 8 and 9 that the Court of Criminal Appeal had erred in dealing with this issue by reference to the principles applying to fresh evidence on an appeal, rather than as a case of lack of disclosure by the Crown, and failing to determine whether the failure of the Crown to disclose information in its possession had caused the trial to miscarry. Their Honours said that in a case where there had been a lack of disclosure by the Crown, the only question is whether the appeal should be dismissed because no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred (that is, whether the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act should be applied in favour of the Crown). In determining whether no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred what Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said in their joint judgment in Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 371-2 should be applied, namely: 

""Those authorities establish that where there has been a departure from the requirements of a properly conducted trial, it cannot be said that there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice if the applicant has thereby lost 'a chance which was fairly open to him of being acquitted' to use the phrase of Fullagar J in Mraz v The Queen (1955) 93 CLR 493 at 514 or 'a real chance of acquittal' to use the phrase of Barwick CJ in Reg v Storey (1978) 140 CLR 364 at 376. Unless it can be said that, had there been no blemish in the trial, an appropriately instructed jury, acting reasonably on the evidence properly before them and applying the correct onus and standard of proof, would inevitably have convicted the accused, the conviction must be set aside: see Driscoll v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 517 at 524; Reg v Storey; Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 412-413. Unless that can be said, the accused may have lost a fair chance of acquittal by the failure to afford him the trial to which he was entitled, that is to say, a trial in which the relevant law was correctly explained to the jury and the rules of procedure and evidence were strictly followed: see Mraz V The Queen . The loss of such a chance of acquittal cannot be anything but a substantial miscarriage of justice. The question whether the jury would inevitably have convicted falls to be determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal. It is a question which the Court of Criminal Appeal must answer according to its assessment of the facts of the case."" 

364Since Grey was decided there have, of course, been other High Court decisions on the proviso and in particular Weiss v The Queen (2005) 224 CLR 300. It was not suggested on this appeal that what was said by the High Court in Grey and Wilde was affected by what the High Court said in the later case of Weiss . The present case would seem to me to fall within the class of case identified by the High Court in Weiss at 317(45), where it would be proper for an appellate court to allow an appeal and order a new trial, even if the appellate court were satisfied to the requisite degree of the appellant's guilt, for the reason that there was at the trial a significant denial of procedural fairness. 

365It is true that there are factual differences between the present case and Grey . In Grey the witness in question whose credibility was affected by the document which had not been disclosed, had been presented by the Crown at the trial as a reliable witness, whereas in the present case there was much evidence, and the Crown had frankly acknowledged at the trial, that Bassam Said's credibility could be attacked on a number of grounds. 

366In the present case, if the investigator's note had been disclosed, it is likely that enquiries would have been made of Sheikh Alhilali by the appellants' legal representatives and the appellants' legal representatives would have obtained the information in Sheikh Alhilali's affidavit. That information could then have been used in the cross-examination of Bassam Said. If Bassam Said had denied or had not admitted the conversation, evidence of the conversation could have been given, if necessary after leave had been obtained ( Evidence Act s 106). 

367Although Bassam Said's credibility was challenged on a number of grounds at the trial, the further evidence, if it had been available at the trial, would have dealt a serious blow to his credibility. Bassam Said's evidence was important for the reasons given by counsel for the appellants. In my opinion, it cannot be said, if the test in Wilde and Grey is applied, that the appellants did not lose a chance of acquittal as a result of the investigator's note not having been disclosed. Alternatively I consider that the failure to disclose the note involved a significant denial of procedural fairness. 

368In my opinion Aouad's ground of appeal 6(b) and El-Zeyat's ground of appeal 6 should be upheld. In upholding these grounds of appeal I have already considered the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act . 

APPLICATION BY EL-ZEYAT TO RELY ON ADDITIONAL GROUNDS OF APPEAL 

369As noted earlier in this judgment, the principal hearing of these appeals took place on 29 and 30 June 2010. At the conclusion of the hearing the Court reserved its decision on the appeals. 

370As also noted earlier in this judgment, in July 2010 an application was made by each appellant for leave to rely on an additional ground or grounds of appeal. Leave was granted to Aouad to raise an additional ground of appeal which became ground 6 and 6(b) and to El-Zeyat to raise additional grounds of appeal which became grounds 5 and 6. The Court received submissions on these grounds from the appellants and the Crown. The Court then again reserved its decision on the appeals. 

371Immediately following the principal hearing of the present appeals the Court, constituted by the same judges, heard appeals by Aouad, El-Zeyat, Adnan Darwiche and Abbas Osman against their convictions on various charges. It will be convenient to refer to these appeals as ""the related appeals"". At the conclusion of the hearing of the related appeals in July 2010 the Court reserved its decision on those appeals. 

372In November 2010, while the Court was still reserved on both the present appeals and the related appeals, an application was made by Adnan Darwiche in his related appeal for leave to rely on additional grounds of appeal. This application and a subsequent further application by Darwiche for leave to rely on another additional ground of appeal are dealt with in Johnson J's judgment in the related appeals. 

373After Darwiche had made his first application in his related appeal, the solicitors for each of Aouad and El-Zeyat sent letters to the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal requesting that the Court not deliver its judgments in either the present appeals or the related appeals, until Aouad and El-Zeyat and their legal advisers had had an opportunity to consider whether they also should apply for leave to rely on additional grounds of appeal. The Court acceded to these requests. At the time the requests were made a full draft of the present judgment dealing with the existing grounds of appeal had been prepared. 

374In February 2011 an application was made by El-Zeyat for leave to rely on two additional grounds of appeal in both his present appeal and his related appeal. No application has been made by Aouad to rely on any further ground of appeal in either of his appeals. 

375The additional grounds of appeal which El-Zeyat sought leave to rely on were:- 

Ground 7 

A miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence at trial of fresh evidence, namely the affidavit of Joe Osman affirmed on 12 October 2010. 

Ground 8 

A miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence of trial of fresh evidence, namely the affidavit of Houssam El-Jamal affirmed on 31 January 2011. 

376Insofar as El- Zeyat's application was for leave to rely on the additional grounds of appeal in his related appeal, his application is dealt with by Johnson J in his judgment in the related appeals. In my present judgment I will confine my consideration of El-Zeyat's application to the question of whether leave should be granted to him to rely on the additional grounds of appeal in his present appeal. 

377Both of the proposed additional grounds of appeal are based on alleged fresh evidence. The principles to be applied by this Court in considering a ground of appeal based on alleged fresh evidence, as stated by Kirby J in R v Abou-Chabake, have been set out earlier in this judgment and I will not now repeat them. 

ADDITIONAL GROUND 7 

378In his affidavit of 12 October 2010 Joe Osman, also known as Fadi El-Jamal, stated that in November 2003 he was kidnapped by Wahib and Haissam Hannouf but managed to escape. For his own protection he was kept in a room in a hotel with police for a number of days. While in the room at the hotel he was asked by police officers what he knew about Darwiche. 

379According to Osman's affidavit, he was presented by detectives with a statement using the name ""Samear Havda"" and, after initially refusing to sign the statement, he ultimately did sign the statement due to his feelings of vulnerability and ""intense intimidation"" by the police. 

380Osman said in his affidavit that at a later court hearing in 2006 he was called as a witness and shown the statement. He told the court that the statement was not ""my words and that I did not know what the statement contained"". 

381No copy of the statement made in the name of Samear Havda was annexed to Osman's affidavit. 

382Part of a transcript of a hearing on 14 March 2006 in which Osman gave evidence and was asked about the statement was annexed to an affidavit by El-Zeyat's solicitor. 

383A number of affidavits were filed on behalf of the Crown in which allegations made by Osman in his affidavit were denied. Copies of a statement dated 18 November 2003 and a statement dated 24 May 2004, each made in the name of Samear Havda and signed by Osman, were annexed to an affidavit by a police officer. 

384I do not consider that it is necessary in this judgment to refer in detail to all of the evidence which was filed. I am satisfied that it is quite clear that, for a number of reasons, leave should be refused to rely on this ground. 

385Even extending to the appellant El-Zeyat the latitude required in determining whether alleged fresh evidence was available or could by reasonable diligence have been available to him at his trial, the alleged fresh evidence was so available. The two statements by Osman were referred to in the brief of evidence served on El-Zeyat before the trial. The court hearing on 14 March 2006 was a voir dire enquiry conducted before the trial, at which El Zeyat was represented and in which Osman was called as a witness and asked questions about the two statements and police officers were then called who in turn gave evidence about the statements. 

386Osman's evidence is not ""credible or at least capable of belief"". Among other things, it is clear that he signed, not just a single statement, but two statements, the second of which was made almost six months after the first statement. In the second statement Osman referred to the earlier statement and said that he wanted to make ""some minor amendments"" to it. The amendments made by the second statement can truly be described as ""only minor"". 

387Other matters adversely affecting the credibility of Osman's affidavit are developed by Johnson J in his judgment in the related appeals. 

388Even if the evidence was fresh and capable of belief, it would not, in the context of the evidence given at the trial, have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of El-Zeyat or to give rise to a significant possibility that a jury acting reasonably would have acquitted him. 

389The statement of 18 November 2003 is almost entirely about Adnan Darwiche. There appear to be only four paragraphs in the statement referring to the killing of Ahmed Fahda. The assertions made in these paragraphs are first-hand, second-hand or even third-hand hearsay or mere speculation and, in any event, are concerned with the role that Adnan Darwiche might have played in the killing and not with any role played by El-Zeyat in the killing. 

390I would regard as mere speculation a submission by counsel for El-Zeyat that Osman's evidence was evidence of improper conduct on the part of certain police officers in obtaining a statement from him, from which it might be inferred that the same police officers had engaged in similar improper conduct in obtaining statements from other Crown witnesses. 

391I note that Osman did not give evidence in the trial from which the present appeals have been brought. 

ADDITIONAL GROUND 8 

392Houssam El-Jamal is a brother of Joe Osman. 

393In the affidavit of 31 January 2010 Houssam El-Jamal said that he also had been kidnapped in November 2003 by Wahib Hannouf and Haissam Hannouf. He had been held for three days and had then been released, after his family had paid a ransom. 

394In his affidavit Houssam El-Jamal said that in 2004 he had been charged with an offence and had been refused bail. While in custody, bail refused, he was held in B wing within the SPC section of the Long Bay Correctional Centre. Subsequently Bassam Said was moved to this wing. 

395Paragraphs 14 and 16 and 17 of the affidavit were in the following terms: 

""14. Immediately, I developed a friendship with Bassam Said, and he confided in me the reason why he was moved to 'B' wing. Bassam informed me that the reason why he was moved from 'C' Wing was due to consistent communication over the walls in 'C' Wing to the Hannouf brothers. 

... 

16. A few days after Bassam's arrival he stated to me words to the effect; 

'A police officer by the name of Tamer Kilani told me to make a statement, stating that the shooters of Ahmed Fahda were Ramzy Awad and Naseam El-Zeyat, even though I did not see who the shooters were.' 

17. Further he informed me that police had forced him to make statements. He stated to me words to the effect of; 

'The police said to me, if you do not make a statement stating that they were the shooters, you won't be getting out of jail, you will be getting life.' "" 

396In subsequent parts of his affidavit Houssam El-Jamal said that on a number of occasions, when he and Bassam Said were in the recreation yard of the wing, he witnessed Bassam Said communicating with the Hannouf brothers, including Wahib Hannouf and Haissam Hannouf, who were in the recreation yard of C wing, the two recreation yards being adjacent to each other. Houssam El-Jamal said in his affidavit that he had heard Bassam Said and the Hannouf brothers communicating with each other about the statements they had made to police about the murder of Ahmed Fahda and some of the offences in the related appeals and about ""getting their stories straight"". To the extent to which the affidavit gives any particulars of the communications between Bassam Said and the Hannouf brothers, the particulars are about the offences in the related appeals and not the murder of Ahmed Fahda. 

397The Court received quite extensive evidence and written submissions about the proposed additional ground 8. There are serious issues about the alleged fresh evidence at least as to whether it should be regarded as fresh or capable of belief. However, in my opinion, it is not necessary for the Court to attempt to resolve these issues in order to determine whether leave to rely on the additional ground of appeal should be granted. 

398Insofar as the alleged fresh evidence is that Bassam Said said to Houssam El-Jamal that he did not see who the shooters of Ahmed Fahda were but was subjected to pressure to say that he did recognise the shooters, the alleged evidence is similar in effect to the evidence of Sheikh Alhilali about what the Sheikh said he was told by Bassam Said on 8 July 2004. As I noted earlier in the judgment, there was no dispute that the Sheikh's evidence was fresh and credible. Substantially on the basis of the evidence from the Sheikh, confirmed in part by Detective Kilani's investigation note, I have already held that ground of appeal 5 should be upheld. 

399Insofar as the alleged fresh evidence is evidence of communications between Bassam Said and the Hannouf brothers about the statements they would give to police, the evidence, if it were to be accepted as fresh and capable of belief, might have some significance. 

400However, even if all parts of Houssam El-Jamal's affidavit were to be regarded as satisfying all the conditions for evidence being regarded as fresh evidence, the fresh evidence would not be such as to entitle El-Zeyat to an outright acquittal but only to a quashing of the verdict of guilty, with an order being made for a new trial. Those are the orders I consider should be made in consequence of my upholding the existing grounds of appeal 5 and 6. In these circumstances, I would refuse leave to rely on the additional ground of appeal. 

CONCLUSION 

401Having allowed grounds of appeal against conviction of each appellant, I would allow each appellant's appeal against conviction, quash the conviction of each appellant and order a new trial of each appellant.

2709902,David L'Estrange v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 89,"Judgment 

1McClellan CJ at CL: I agree with McCallum J. 

2McCallum J: On 26 November 2008, Mr David L'Estrange was called for trial in the District Court when he pleaded not guilty to the following offences: 

Between about 26 March 2006 and 27 March 2006 at Canley Vale and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales did conspire with Robin Martin, Michael Bell, Justin Quarta and Michael Jelisavac to commit a serious indictable offence, namely aggravated break enter and commit serious indictable offence. 

On 27 th March 2006 at Guildford in the said Sate, being in company with Robin Martin and others, did break and enter the dwelling house of Perry Koelmeyer situated at 229A Fowler Road Guildford and did commit a serious indictable offence therein, namely, robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. 

3The alleged co-conspirators referred to in the indictment pleaded guilty to various offences arising from the same allegations. The critical issue at Mr L'Estrange's trial was whether the group of people that committed the offences included him. On 23 December 2008, the jury found Mr L'Estrange guilty on both charges. By Notice of Appeal filed 30 July 2010, Mr L'Estrange appeals against his conviction of those offences. 

4Mr L'Estrange's trial was initially listed to commence on 26 August 2008 but did not proceed on that date for a number of practical reasons. The trial judge took the opportunity to determine a pre-trial issue as to the admissibility of certain evidence sought to be relied upon by the Crown. The evidence was described by the Crown as ""background evidence"" going to explain a prior association between the appellant and the other members of the group alleged to have participated in the commission of the offences charged in the indictment. 

5The two counts on the indictment related to two offences committed on the same night involving a conspiracy to break into a house in Canley Vale and an actual break-in at a house in Guildford. Each house was thought by other members of the group to be the home of a drug dealer. 

6The so-called background evidence related to a separate arrangement or attempt by members of the same group (allegedly including Mr L'Estrange) to rob a different drug dealer in the area of the Crossroads Hotel at Ingleburn more than 10 days earlier. The offence they had allegedly planned was not carried out. No charges appear to have been laid in respect of that incident. 

7The trial judge ruled that most of the evidence objected to was admissible and ought not to be excluded on any discretionary ground. The trial was then adjourned to 26 November 2008. 

Evidence in the trial 

8The Crown case as to the two counts on the indictment was that Mr L'Estrange along with four others, Mr Robin Martin, Mr Michael Bell, Mr Justin Quarta and Mr Michael Jelisavac, had on the evening of 26 March 2006 first agreed to rob a drug dealer whom they understood lived in the house at Canley Vale. The agreement to commit that offence was the subject of count 1 on the indictment. 

9For various reasons, it was decided at the last minute not to proceed with that offence but instead to rob another person (also understood to be a drug dealer) who lived in Guildford. The events that occurred at the house at Guildford were the subject of count 2 on the indictment. 

10The main evidence against Mr L'Estrange came from Mr Martin, who had pleaded guilty to offences relating to those events. Although other members of the group accused of committing the offences had also pleaded guilty, none of them gave evidence at Mr L'Estrange's trial. 

11Mr Martin was a friend of Mr Bell's. He and Mr Bell had been in discussion, apparently over a period of some weeks, planning to rob drug dealers. They were unaware that their telephone conversations were being lawfully intercepted by police during that time. 

12It was the Crown case that some of Mr Martin and Mr Bell's intercepted telephone conversations implicated Mr L'Estrange, both in respect of the two counts on the indictment and in respect of the earlier attempted robbery near the Crossroads Hotel. The judge's pre-trial ruling concerning that incident related both to the evidence of the intercepted telephone conversations and to the evidence anticipated to be given at the trial by Mr Martin in relation to that incident. 

13Insofar as the two counts on the indictment are concerned, the impact of the evidence of the intercepted conversations was very limited. Few were conversations to which Mr L'Estrange was a party. Those which were established little more than that, on the relevant evening (the evening of 26 March 2006), Mr L'Estrange was waiting in a street in the area in which he lived to meet some people including Mr Jelisavac. In a number of telephone conversations that evening, Mr Jelisavac said to Mr L'Estrange ""we're on our way"", ""we'll be there in about 10 minutes"" and words to similar effect. In one conversation Mr L'Estrange evidently made a joke about having been kept waiting, saying ""I booked a taxi 20 minutes ago"". 

14Without the evidence of Mr Martin, that evidence would not have sustained any case against Mr L'Estrange. The Crown case rested heavily on his explanation of those conversations. 

15Mr Martin said that he had known Mr L'Estrange since about 1999. After not having seen him for a while, he saw him at Mr Quarta's house in 2006. The Crown led the following evidence from Mr Martin as to that occasion (the record of the trial does not disclose whether the leading form of the questions was by prior agreement with counsel for the accused): 

Q. When you saw him at Justin Quarta's place, did the accused say to you something like this: ""Are we going to go off?"" 
A. Yeah. 

Q. Did you understand what he was talking about? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did you take that to mean that he wanted to know when you were going to do a job together? 
A. Yes. 

Q. That is, a crime? 
A. That's right. (AB1219). 

16Apart from that exchange, there does not appear to have been any direct relevant conversation between Mr Martin and Mr L'Estrange in advance of the Crossroads incident. It appeared to be acknowledged by Mr Martin in his evidence that he had no direct conversation with Mr L'Estrange to include him in the plans to commit that offence. Mr Martin said ""I think I went through Feks [Mr Jelisavac]. I may have went through Feks."" (AB 1221). 

17So far as Mr Martin was concerned, the purpose of going to the Crossroads Hotel was to rob a drug dealer. However, he gave no evidence as to any direct discussion to that effect between him and Mr L'Estrange. 

18Mr Martin said that the people who went to Ingleburn were himself, Mr Bell, Mr Quarta, Mr Jelisavac and Mr L'Estrange. Mr Martin and Mr L'Estrange were together in a ute driven by Mr Martin. Mr Quarta and Mr Jelisavac were together in another car and Mr Bell was apparently in a third car. According to Mr Martin, the plan was that Mr Bell would point out the drug dealer to them and they would follow him. Mr Martin's evidence about the whole incident was extremely vague and in many instances was prompted by the Crown reminding him as to the contents of the intercepted telephone conversations. His version of events was that they were too slow following the person they had targeted and that they lost him. 

19The intercepted conversations are consistent with Mr Martin's evidence that Mr L'Estrange was in one of the cars when they began following the man in question and that there was conversation as to the need to move more quickly. In one conversation, Mr L'Estrange received a call from Mr Quarta (presumably in a different car) telling them to hurry up. Mr L'Estrange is then recorded to have said ""hurry up, hurry up. Hurry up"", presumably to Mr Martin. 

20However, Mr L'Estrange denied that he was aware of any plan to rob the drug dealer. He gave evidence at his trial in which he explained that he understood the purpose of the trip was for other members of the group to buy speed from a dealer called Ray. He said that they would not have robbed that man because they knew him. He also said that they knew where Ray lived, which was inconsistent with Mr Martin's evidence as to their having lost him while following him. In cross-examination, Mr L'Estrange explained why they were urging each other to hurry: 

Because they missed Ray at the pub and his girlfriend said the day before, or the day before that, ""don't go to his place again"", because his girlfriend was upset because they left syringes in the bathroom."" (AB 1669). 

21There was some conversation consistent with that version of events in the intercepted telephone conversations (AB136). 

22According to the evidence of Mr L'Estrange, it was on that occasion, after they followed Ray from the Crossroads Hotel on 15 March 2006, that Mr L'Estrange went with Mr Martin to Mr Martin's sister's house. Mr Martin said that occurred on the evening of 26 March 2006. That discrepancy assumed some significance in the trial. 

Evidence as to the two counts on the indictment 

23As already noted, the Crown case in support of the first count rested on the alleged existence of a conspiracy to commit the robbery at Canley Vale. The robbery was never in fact carried out. 

24A great deal of Mr Martin's evidence related to the planning that took place between him and the other co-conspirators before it had even been contemplated (according to his evidence) that Mr L'Estrange would be introduced to the plan. 

25Mr Martin said that, in the course of their discussions about robbing drug dealers (leading to the failed attempt to rob the man at the Crossroads Hotel), Mr Bell had identified two other drug dealers to Mr Martin, one at Canley Vale and one at Guildford. A friend of Mr Bell's, an Asian woman, had told him that the man at Canley Vale had $250,000 in cash in a safe in a child's room at the man's house. Mr Martin's evidence disclosed that he, Mr Bell and Mr Jelisavac had spent some time visiting those premises in advance and discussing how they would carry out the robbery. 

26Mr Quarta had not visited the premises. He had recently been involved in a motor bike accident. He also suffered from epilepsy. It was agreed that he was not fit for the task of carrying out the robbery. Mr Martin had nonetheless told Mr Quarta that he would receive an equal share of the proceeds of the job. 

27As at 21 March 2006 Mr Martin intended doing the job at Canley Vale with Mr Jelisavac and Mr Bell. He gave evidence that he decided to bring Mr L'Estrange in on the plan only on 25 or 26 March 2006. Asked why he introduced Mr L'Estrange, he said: 

""I thought, well one more person wouldn't hurt, and also, David was - I guess you could say wishing to do a job or wanting"" 
(AB 1274). 

28Mr Martin said that he first contacted Mr L'Estrange either the day before or the day of that offence. He claimed to have said to Mr L'Estrange ""Are you ready to go off?"" (AB 1274.46). He could not remember Mr L'Estrange's response but said ""it would have been a yes"". He did not recall whether anything else was said. Asked whether any arrangements were made with Mr L'Estrange as to how the job was going to be done, he said : 

Well at that stage I don't think we even knew what we were going to do until we got there, myself, Bell and Feks. I mean, David knew that all he had to do was follow. (AB 1275) 

29A considerable part of Mr Martin's evidence entailed his explaining the conversations recorded by police. As already noted, however, there was little in that evidence to implicate Mr L'Estrange except to the extent that it revealed that he was expecting Mr Jelisavac and another person or other people to drive to where he lived that day. 

30Mr Martin stated that he had arranged to collect Mr L'Estrange at Fairfield. He then corrected that evidence, saying that it was Strathfield. Asked how those arrangements were made, he said: 

I may have even told Feks to talk to him and tell him to meet us where, because Feks knew the area and I didn't, so I left it in his hands - would have left it in his hands to tell David where to meet us so we could pick him up. (AB1275) 

31Mr Martin could not recall what was said in the car after they collected Mr L'Estrange but said that they would have discussed the job because that was the whole purpose of what they were doing. He could not recall anything Mr L'Estrange had said and stated ""As far as I can remember, he just listened and accepted what I had to say"" (AB1279). 

32According to Mr Martin, he ultimately decided not to do the job at Canley Vale. Mr Bell had turned up with other people whom Mr Martin did not know and he was concerned that a woman or child in the house might be hurt or traumatised by the actions of those people. Mr Bell suggested that they could ""go and do this other drug dealer at Guildford"" (AB1282). Mr Martin said that they went to his sister's place before leaving to go and do the job at Guildford. 

33Mr Martin gave a detailed description of the commission of the offence at Guildford. He said that he kicked the door open and that he, Mr L'Estrange and Mr Jelisavac went into the house. He said that Mr Jelisavac was armed with a meat cleaver. He and Mr L'Estrange were unarmed. According to Mr Martin, Mr Bell did not go into the house with them because the people in the house knew what he looked like. 

34Mr Martin said he went upstairs to a bedroom where one of the residents was asleep. He found a samurai sword under the bed, which he said he later gave to Mr L'Estrange. According to Mr Martin, Mr L'Estrange held the sword and stood guard over the people in the house whilst Mr Martin and Mr Jelisavac searched the premises. 

35It happened that some friends of the residents of the house had that day won the grand final of their local cricket club competition. They had celebrated well into the night at Guildford Leagues Club, which was just across the road from the house broken into by Mr Martin and his associates. One of the people being held in the house managed to call them for help. 

36The arrival of the victorious cricketers, all well-intoxicated and armed with cricket bats, prompted the offenders to make a hasty retreat. Mr Martin gave evidence that he and Mr L'Estrange ran to the backyard and jumped over the fence that ran along the left side of the house. A number of the cricketers, who were called as witnesses by the Crown, gave evidence confirming that the offenders ran away at speed. Separately, the Crown case disclosed that the fence was a six-foot ""Colorbond"" steel fence. According to Mr Martin, Mr L'Estrange was behind him. Mr Martin said that he heard Mr L'estrange drop himself over the fence, landing on his back. On Mr Martin's version, Mr L'Estrange must somehow have kept hold of the samurai sword during that manoeuvre, since it ended up in the car with them. Mr Martin did not know where Mr Jelisavac was at that stage. He said they caught up with him later. 

37Mr L'Estrange denied that he was present with Mr Martin and his associates at either the proposed robbery at Canley Vale or at the break-in at Guildford. His explanation for the telephone conversations disclosing that he was waiting on the street for Mr Martin and Mr Jelisavac was that he had agreed to give Mr Martin a car stereo and had arranged for them to collect it that night. 

38An important aspect of Mr L'Estrange's defence was the fact that, after suffering a stroke in 1997, Mr L'Estrange has a measure of disability on the right side of his body. It was his case that he is unable to run in the manner described in the evidence because his right foot gets in the way of the left and he trips himself over. He contended, further, that he suffers significant disability in his right arm, such that he could not hold a samurai sword in the manner described by Mr Martin, let alone clear a six-foot steel fence. 

39The Crown called evidence from Mr Martin's sister, ostensibly to corroborate the evidence given by Mr Martin that the four men (including Mr L'Estrange) had gone to her house on the night of the two offences. As already noted, Mr L'Estrange accepted that he had been to her house, but said that occurred on the night of 15 March 2006 after the Crossroads incident. Without descending to detail, it is enough to say that aspects of Ms Martin's evidence were very unsatisfactory. 

Grounds of Appeal 

40The first ground of appeal is that the trial miscarried. That ground is based upon the other grounds of appeal and does not require separate consideration. 

Grounds two and three: evidence relating to the Crossroads incident 

41The second ground of appeal relates to the admission of the evidence in the Crown case concerning the incident at the Crossroads Hotel dealt with in the trial judge's pre-trial ruling given 28 August 2008. The third ground relates to the judge's failure to give the jury any warning or direction as to the use to be made of that evidence. 

42Ground 2 is: 

The trial judge erred in admitting evidence of other alleged criminal conduct. 

43As already noted, the trial judge ruled that the evidence of the Crossroads incident was admissible and ought not to be excluded. The pre-trial ruling also dealt with other evidence objected to on behalf of Mr L'Estrange as being prejudicial. The trial judge upheld the objection insofar as it related to references to Mr L'Estrange and the other members of the group having met whilst in prison and, separately, material disclosing that other members of the group had referred to Mr L'Estrange as ""an evil cunt"" and otherwise described him as a person with a willingness to engage in violence. 

44In ruling on the evidence relating to the Crossroads incident, the judge noted that the two counts on the indictment were to be heard together and that there had been no application for separate trials of the two counts. His Honour expressed the view that the Crossroads evidence was ""admissible under the Harriman principle"", noting that it was not tendency or coincidence evidence. 

45The judge recorded the Crown's anticipation that Mr Martin's direct evidence would establish that Mr L'Estrange was a willing participant in the abortive attempt to rob a drug dealer at the Crossroads. The telephone intercepts were described as being capable of showing that Mr Martin, Mr Bell, Mr Quarta and Mr Jelisavac: 

were conducting a criminal business of planning and attempting to carry out profitable criminal activities, usually involving robbery in company and collateral and associated offences. This business was ongoing since at least the abortive Crossroads episode and continued through the 26 th . There is admissible evidence that the accused was a part of this business, available and ready, willing and able to participate as required. 

46Against that assessment, the judge turned to consider whether the evidence should be excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995. His Honour concluded: 

In my view [the evidence] has strong probative value and may show the nature of the relationship of the accused, Martin and the other people very clearly. 

Separately, the judge considered whether the evidence was likely to derail the jury from their proper task. He determined that it was not. His Honour declined to exclude the material under section 137 ""or for any other discretionary reasoning"". 

47The first specific error alleged in respect of the trial judge's ruling is that: 

In purporting to apply the common law as set out in Harriman v R (1989) 167 CLR 590, the trial judge failed to carry out the balancing exercise required to be carried out in accordance with the law in R v Blick [2000] NSWCCA 61. 

48In Blick , the Court considered the correct approach to an application made by a defendant in criminal proceedings to have evidence excluded pursuant to section 137 of the Evidence Act . That section provides: 

In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. 

49The principal judgment in Blick was given by Sheller JA. His Honour noted (at [18]) that, at common law, a trial judge on the tender by the prosecution of photographic evidence to identify an accused person had first to determine whether the material was admissible. If it was, the judge could refuse to admit the evidence if of the view that its probative value was outweighed by its prejudice to the accused. 

50Sheller JA took the view that section 137 mandates a different approach. His Honour said (at [20], James and Dowd JJ agreeing at [31] and [32] respectively): 

Even so, and with due respect, there seems to me to be a risk of error if a judge proceeds on the basis that he or she is being asked to exercise a discretion about whether or not otherwise admissible evidence should be rejected because of unfair prejudice to the defendant. The correct approach is to perform the weighing exercise mandated. If the probative value of the evidence adduced by the prosecutor is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, there is no residual discretion. The evidence must be rejected. 

51It may be acknowledged that the trial judge articulated his reasons for declining to exclude the evidence in language consonant with the approach disapproved in Blick. In my view, however, a careful analysis of the judge's reasons reveals that his Honour did undertake the weighing exercise mandated by the section. It is clear enough that, when describing the evidence as being ""admissible"", his Honour was referring to its probative value. His Honour then identified matters of prejudice before articulating his final assessment that the material ought not to be excluded under section 137. I do not think that the judge's reasons reveal error in that particular respect. 

52The second specific error alleged in the trial judge's ruling is that his Honour: 

Failed to consider the important distinctions between Harriman , as applied in R v Quach [2002] NSW CCA 519, and the current case, in balancing the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect. 

53The burden of the appellant's argument in support of that contention was that the evidence in the present case was considerably less probative than the evidence under consideration in the decisions in Harriman and Quach and that, on that basis, the trial judge ought not, when performing the weighing exercise mandated by the section, to have reached the conclusion he did. 

54In considering that complaint, it is important to bear in mind, as acknowledged in Blick at [19], that the trial judge's judgment as to how the probative value of the evidence sought to be adduced should be weighed against the danger of unfair prejudice to an accused will be ""one of opinion based on a variety of circumstances, the evidence, the particulars of the case and the judge's own trial experience"". 

55Sheller JA stated: 

In that sense, the result can be described as analogous to a discretionary judgment; see Heydon, 'A guide to the Evidence Acts', 2 nd ed, para 3.725. 

56The fact that the judge did not assess the evidence by comparing it with evidence admitted or excluded in other decided cases could not of itself be said to amount to error in that context. 

57The third specific error alleged in respect of the trial judge's ruling is that: 

In assessing the prejudicial effect of the evidence, the trial judge failed to take account of, or sufficiently take into account the risk of the jury engaging in tendency reasoning. 

58It is convenient to consider that contention together with the fourth specific error relied upon, which is that the trial judge failed to consider the extent to which the evidence would distract the jury from the determination of the offences charged. 

59In my view, there is force in those complaints. The trial judge observed, correctly, that the evidence was not tendency or coincidence evidence. The Evidence Act defines both coincidence evidence and tendency evidence by reference to the purpose for which a party seeks to have the evidence adduced: see part 1 of the dictionary to the Act. 

60In the present case, the Crown Prosecutor characterised the evidence as evidence ""about [Mr L'Estrange's] association with particular people"". Implicitly, the Crown disavowed any reliance on the evidence for the purpose of proving that Mr L'Estrange had a tendency to act in a particular way ( cf section 97 of the Evidence Act ) or to prove that he committed the offences charged on the indictment on the basis that it was improbable that those events and the Crossroads incident occurred coincidentally ( cf section 98 of the Act). 

61It has frequently been observed, however, that such disavowal does not remove the risk that the jury will reason in that way. As submitted on behalf of Mr L'Estrange, the distinction between such reasoning and evidence adduced for the purpose of establishing background or context is fragile at best. In HML v The Queen; SB v The Queen; OAE v The Queen [2008] HCA 16 (2008); 235 CLR 334, Hayne J noted at [116] that the risk of misuse of the evidence is the very risk to which the general rule of exclusion is directed. Indeed, any characterisation of evidence of prior criminal conduct as ""background"" or ""context"" should sound a warning of the need to give careful attention to the risk that the purpose for which the jury might find the evidence most useful is that of placing the charges in the context of their having been brought against a person who has done this kind of thing before. 

62In the present case, the risk of tendency reasoning was high. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine the jury using the evidence in any other way. The Crown contended that the evidence could be used to explain an otherwise surprising feature of the Crown case that Mr L'Estrange had readily agreed to join the group on the evening of 26 March 2006, and (on the Crown case) to carry out the two crimes although he had not been involved in their planning. 

63There is an element of circularity in that reasoning, which only serves to highlight the prejudice of admitting the evidence. Whether Mr L'Estrange was agreeing to carry out the two offences charged on the indictment when he allegedly gave an affirmative answer to the question ""are you ready to go off"" was the very issue to be determined by the jury. It was very likely that they would use the evidence of the Crossroads incident for the purpose of assisting their interpretation of that obscure exchange and that they would do so by engaging in tendency reasoning. In my view, the risk that the jury would engage in impermissible paths of reasoning was a material consideration which his Honour was required to take into account. His Honour did not address that risk when he gave the pre-trial ruling. 

64The result, in my view, is that the decision to admit the evidence miscarried. For my part, I do not think that the evidence of the Crossroads incident was admissible. Assuming it was relevant for any purpose other than to establish tendency (a purpose disavowed by the Crown), which is doubtful, its probative value was undoubtedly outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. 

65The fifth specific error alleged is that the trial judge: 

Failed to consider the prejudice arising from the cumulative effect of the evidence in combination with the ""co-conspirator's evidence"" being led to establish count 1 and the increased difficulty in separating it from being used for tendency reasoning. 

66This ground refers to the fact that the telephone intercept evidence relied upon by the Crown included a number of conversations between Mr L'Estrange's alleged co-conspirators to which Mr L'Estrange was not a party. That evidence included conversations in which the co-conspirators referred to Mr L'Estrange's alleged desire to be included in ""a job"" and their decision to include him in the planned robbery at Canley Vale. 

67Undoubtedly, the cumulative impact of the Crossroads evidence on evidence of that kind underscores the prejudicial impact of the evidence in the present case. However, in light of my conclusion that the decision to admit the Crossroads evidence miscarried in any event, it is not necessary to give separate consideration to this ground. 

68The sixth specific area alleged is that the trial judge: 

Failed to give consideration to a limitation of the evidence. 

69Counsel who appeared for Mr L'Estrange at the hearing of the pre-trial argument had indicated that Mr L'Estrange proposed to make admissions of the fact of his relationship with the various co-offenders at a time proximate to the events of 26 March 2006. The proposition raised in the appeal appears to be that, in light of that indication, the judge ought to have given a ruling under section 136 of the Evidence Act limiting the evidence as to the events of 15 March 2006. 

70If I have understood the submission correctly, I think it misconceives the effect of that section. Section 136 provides: 

136 General discretion to limit use of evidence 

The Court may limit the use to be made of evidence if there is a danger that a particular use of the evidence might: 

(a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party; or 
(b) be misleading of confusing. 

71The section focuses on the use to be made of evidence. The occasion for the exercise of the discretion conferred by the section is the circumstance where evidence potentially of use for more than one purpose should be confined to a limited use so as to avoid the consequences referred to in the section. Where, as in the present case, what is sought is to have part of the evidence excluded altogether, the discretion invoked is that arising under section 135 of the Act. 

72In the context of the present case, if the use to be made of the evidence as to the events of 15 March 2006 was to be limited to establishing the existence of prior dealings between the co-offenders and not to establish that their prior dealings extended to the commission of criminal offences together, the evidence was of no use to the Crown. 

73In any event, it could scarcely be said that an application to that effect was made on behalf of Mr L'Estrange. I am not persuaded that the trial judge erred in that particular respect. 

74The third ground of appeal is that: 

The trial judge erred in failing to warn the jury against tendency reasoning in respect of evidence of alleged earlier criminal activity at the Crossroads Hotel. 

75This ground extends to the judge's failure to give a warning both at the time when the evidence was admitted and during the summing up. 

76The Crown acknowledges that no warning was given at the time the evidence was admitted. As to the summing up, the Crown pointed to the following remarks of the trial judge: 

In the early period of March 2006, there are said to have been a number of telephone calls establishing contact, and association, between the accused and Quarta and other people. 

15 March 2006 is said to be the date of the episode at Crossroads, or Ingleburn, going out there, and you have heard different versions of what that was all about. (summing up, page 16). 

The Crown put to you that you look at these events in sequence. It is not just the events of the 27 th . You look at the 15 th and then the 20 th and so on but on the 15 th with the preceding series of calls you can see from the events of the 15 th the intention of the accused to be involved with Martin and the others, shows their agreement, association between them ...(summing up, page 31) 

77Where evidence that invites tendency reasoning is admitted in a criminal trial other than as tendency evidence, the need for clear direction to the jury is well recognised: see R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 at 516B per Hunt CJ at CL; JDK v R; R v JDK [2009] NSWCCA 76 at [32] per McClellan CJ at CL. As already indicated, the risk that the jury would use the evidence for an impermissible purpose was high in the present case and a warning was plainly required both at the point when the evidence was lead and in the summing up. Nothing in the trial judge's summing up addressed that issue. This ground should be upheld. 

Was the Crossroads incident required to be proved beyond reasonable doubt? 

78Ground 4 is: 

The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that they could only use the evidence of the uncharged prior criminal act if satisfied of its proof beyond reasonable doubt. 

79The appellant's entire written submission on this ground was as follows: 

In circumstances where the purpose of the evidence that was admitted of other discreditable or criminal conduct was to establish a step in the proof of the prosecution case, the jury should have been directed that they could use it in that way only if persuaded of its truth beyond reasonable doubt: HML , supra per Gummow J at 362; Kirby J at 363/377 and Hayne J at 406. 

80The succinctness of that submission belies the complexity of the issues it raises. First, it is by no means clear that a principle in the unequivocal terms articulated by the appellant emerges from the decision of the High Court in HML . Regrettably, the appellant gave only page references to that decision. The point references intended to be relied upon appear to be the statement of Hayne J at [196] and the statements of Kirby and Gummow JJ expressing their agreement with that statement (per Kirby J at [46] and [83]; per Gummow J at [41]). Hayne J said at [196]: 

It was pointed out in Pfennig that the purpose of evidence of other discreditable or criminal conduct that is admitted at trial is to establish a step in the proof of the prosecution case; if the evidence is not capable of doing that, it is to be rejected as inadmissible. Because this is the basis for admitting the evidence (that the jury may use it as a step towards inferring guilt) the jury may use it in that way only if persuaded of its truth beyond reasonable doubt. The direction in this case about what standard of proof was to be applied was correct. 

81The different conclusions reached by the other members of the Court in HML are collected in the judgment of Kirby J at [82]. They include the following proposition stated by Gleeson CJ at [31]: 

There is no general principle that whenever, at a criminal trial, the prosecution sets out to prove, as a fact relevant to a fact in issue, that some criminal conduct occurred, that fact must be established beyond reasonable doubt. 

82One apparent difference between those views is that the principle stated by Hayne J holds that the evidence is either admissible to establish a step in the proof of the prosecution case or inadmissible. The principles stated by Gleeson CJ do not assume that dichotomy. His Honour appears to contemplate the possibility of evidence of prior criminal conduct which assists the evaluation of the facts in issue but which, not being an element of the offence in question, raises no separate question of standard of proof. 

83As already indicated, I do not think that the evidence of the Crossroads incident was admissible. In light of my view on that issue, there is a measure of artificiality in my purporting to determine whether the evidence was propounded to establish a step in the proof of the prosecution case in the sense considered in HML . 

84In any event, having regard to the conclusion I have reached as to grounds 2 and 3, I consider it preferable not to determine the complex issues raised by the decision in HML in the present different factual context. 

Need to distinguish between the evidence on each count 

85Ground 5 is: 

The trial judge erred in failing sufficiently to distinguish the evidence admissible on the first count and that on the second count in the circumstances of the case and the role of a finding of guilty on the first count in the determination of the second. 

86As already explained, evidence of conversations between the other co-accused to which Mr L'Estrange was not a party were admitted in support of count 1 of the indictment, which alleged a conspiracy. The appellant acknowledges that the evidence was admissible in those circumstances to prove the charge against each alleged co-conspirator: Ahern v The Queen [1988] HCA 39 (1988); 165 CLR 87. 

87The trial judge explained to the jury that evidence of conversations in the absence of Mr L'Estrange would not ordinarily have been admissible against him and was only admitted because of an exception to that rule in the case of a charge of conspiracy (summing up, page 5). His Honour also directed the jury that the exception only applied to count 1, not to count 2 (summing up, page 4) and that the conversations to which Mr L'Estrange was not a party were not evidence in count 2 (summing up, page 8). He had already directed the jury at the outset of his summing up as to the need to consider and decide upon each count separately (summing up, page 2). 

88The appellant submits, however, that the directions given were inadequate in the circumstances. In particular, it was submitted that proof of the conspiracy (count 1) inferentially supported the Crown case in respect of count 2 because it placed the appellant in the company of the other offenders earlier on the same evening. In those circumstances, it was submitted that the trial judge was required to give clear directions identifying the discrete body of evidence upon which the jury could rely in considering each separate charge. 

89The appellant sought to sustain that contention with the proposition that there were grounds in the present case to separate the trial of the two counts. It was acknowledged that no such application was made before the trial. It should be noted that the reason no such application was made was that counsel appearing for the appellant at the pre-trial hearing acknowledged, properly in my view, that the two offences charged in the indictment were linked, on the Crown case. The Crown had characterised the second offence as following directly from the decision not to proceed with the first. The trial judge had, during argument, described the conspiracy charge as being intimately related to the later charge, and that indeed was the way in which the trial was ultimately run. 

90No direction of the kind identified by the appellant was sought at the trial and accordingly Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies to this ground. 

91So far as the appellant was concerned, his defence was an ""all or nothing"" defence. He denied being present during either incident. Having regard to the way in which the case was run, both on behalf of the Crown and on behalf of the appellant, I am not persuaded that the trial judge's directions were inadequate in that respect. It seems likely that so much was recognised in the failure to seek any further direction on those matters at the trial. I do not think this ground warrants a grant of leave under rule 4. 

Failure to give a propensity warning in respect of two matters charged 

92Ground 6 is that the trial judge erred in failing to give a propensity warning in respect of the evidence on the two counts on the indictment. No such direction was sought at the trial and accordingly Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies to this ground. 

93This ground invoked the principles stated by McHugh J in KRM v The Queen [2001] HCA 11; (2001) 206 CLR 221. In that case, in the context of a discussion of the practice of warning the jury of the need to consider each count separately and only by reference to the evidence applicable to that count, his Honour noted that in some cases of multiple counts ""some feature of the evidence may create a risk that the jury would use that particular evidence or a conviction in respect of a count to reason that the accused is the kind of person who would commit the crime charged in another count"". McHugh J stated that where that risk exists and where separate trials are not ordered, ""a propensity warning will almost certainly be required"". 

94The appellant submitted that leave should be given under rule 4 in the present case because there was a strong risk that the presumption of innocence would be eroded particularly in respect of count 2 in the absence of a warning against propensity reasoning. 

95It may be acknowledged that, regardless of whether or not a particular direction is sought, the overriding duty of the trial judge is to ensure a fair trial according to law and, to that end, to give full and correct instructions to the jury: BRS v The Queen [1997] HCA 47; 191 CLR 257 at 302, 306. However, in considering whether the failure to give a particular direction deprived a person of a fair trial in a particular case, an appellate court must be astute to the difficulty of evaluating that question after the event. Rule 4 reflects, in part, the fact that those present at the trial are best placed to judge the fairness of giving or not giving a particular direction in the particular circumstances of the trial. 

96Sometimes counsel exercise their forensic judgment not to seek a direction which, if given, will emphasise evidence adverse to the accused. A propensity direction in respect of the two counts alleged in the indictment in the present case may well have been judged to be unnecessary and undesirable in the context of the way in which the trial was run. 

97Conversely, however, the risk that the jury would use the evidence on count 1 to reason that the appellant was the kind of person who would commit the offence charged in count 2 was compounded in the present case by the absence of any warning against such reasoning as between the evidence of the Crossroads incident and the two counts on the indictment. Ultimately, it is not necessary to decide whether leave should be granted to argue this ground, since the appeal is to be determined on other grounds. It is sufficient to indicate my view that, had a warning of the kind commended in KRM been sought, the trial judge would, in my view, have been required to give it. 

Improper cross-examination of the appellant's expert 

98Ground 7 is: 

The trial judge erred in allowing the Crown to ask improper questions which allowed inadmissible evidence before the jury and in failing to sufficiently warn the jury against using such evidence. 

99As already explained, a critical factual issue at the trial was the extent of the appellant's physical disability. The appellant gave evidence that he could not have scaled a six-foot high steel fence, as Mr Martin had said. He also said that he could not have carried a weapon in each hand as described by Mr Martin. 

100In support of his case, the appellant called a medical expert witness, Dr Sharp. During the cross examination of Dr Sharp by the Crown, there was the following exchange: 

Q. And you know from documentation provided to you that he has, in the past, exaggerated his condition? 
A. I'm not sure I've seen that information. 

Q. Doctor Brew said it in the report of 22 April, 1998. 
A. That was Dr Brew's opinion, not Mr L'Estrange's opinion. 

Q. Doctor Brew in his report - do you have a copy of it handy? 
A. I do have a copy. 

Q. You see in the last paragraph, ""There is no question, however, that there is a super added functional element so that he is exaggerating his deficit. However, on balance, I think the degree of exaggeration is less than the real demonstrated deficits."" What does that mean? 
A. It means he thinks the degree of disability he has demonstrated is not all real. 

Q. So, you accept the suggestion then that in the past someone else has thought that Mr L'Estrange has exaggerated the effects of the stroke on him? 
A. That is what Dr Brew's opinion was at the time, yes. 

Q. Indeed, in the report, one of the reports you had available to you which was that of Dr Santamaria, which is dated 10 February, 1998 - do you have that one handy? 
A. I do have it somewhere. 

Q. Let me ask you this; do you remember him saying, as at 10 February 1998, ""His long term outlook is poor. He has a prognosis which is, at this point, to a person with severe physical handicap."" Do you remember that? 
A. What was the last bit? 

Q. ""Severe physical handicap""? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Indeed, he said a physical and emotional handicap? 
A. Yes, I do recall that. 

Q. You accept that by May 1998, he had improved substantially in all of those aspects? 
A. He does appear so, yes"" (AB1585-86). 

101Surprisingly, no objection was taken to that evidence by defence counsel. 

102There was no warrant for putting the content of Dr Brew's report before the jury in that form. It was plainly inadmissible hearsay. At least three aspects of the cross examination exacerbated the vice of doing so. First, the formulation of the first question in the exchange set out above characterised the opinion of another doctor (not a witness in the trial) as knowledge held by the appellant's expert witness, Dr Sharp. 

103Secondly, the Crown should not have asked Dr Sharp what Dr Brew meant in his report. The vice of asking that question is amply illustrated in the answer given, which had the effect of placing before the jury a misinterpretation of a hearsay opinion cloaked with the authority of having come out of the mouth of the appellant's own expert. It should have been contrary to the instinct of every lawyer in the courtroom for the cross examination to take that path. 

104Finally, it was quite wrong for the Crown to invite the appellant's expert to speculate as to whether the appellant was exaggerating his symptoms when he saw a different doctor in February 1998. Self-evidently, the evidence had the potential to be extremely damaging to the appellant's credibility on a critical aspect of his defence. 

105The appellant's credibility on the issue as to whether his physical disabilities were such as to preclude him from doing the things attributed to him by the Crown's key witness was a critical aspect of his defence. The inadmissible evidence adduced by the Crown in cross-examination would inevitably have dramatically undermined his case in that respect. In my view, ground 7 should be upheld. 

106In R v Morgan [2000] NSWCCA 7, impermissible cross examination that enabled the Crown to put evidence before a jury that would not otherwise have been admissible was held to warrant a conviction being quashed and a new trial ordered. In my view, the result should be the same in the present case. 

Evidence as to the appearance of the appellant's arm 

107Ground 8 is: 

The trial miscarried as a result of critical evidence being misrepresented by the Crown and incorrectly summed up by the trial judge. 

108This ground relates to evidence in the appellant's case at trial as to the disability in his arm. Dr Sharp had given evidence that, as a result of the appellant's stroke, his arm was permanently in a bent position. However, a photograph of the appellant taken towards the end of his period under arrest depicted his arm straight down by the side of his body. 

109The Crown cross-examined Dr Sharp to the effect that the photograph demonstrated that the appellant was exaggerating the extent of his disability to Dr Sharp (AB1588). In re-examination, Dr Sharp accepted that a possible explanation for the photograph was the fact that the appellant had been handcuffed for a period of time before the photograph was taken, which had the effect of forcing his arm into a straight position temporarily. 

110The appellant gave evidence after Dr Sharp. He was cross examined by the Crown as to how long he had the handcuffs on for. He did not purport to be able to give a specific answer to that question, but said ""I would say a while"", recalling the events that had occurred between the time of his arrest and the time when he recalled the photograph and fingerprints being taken. It was his recollection that he had the handcuffs on throughout that period. He denied that the handcuffs had been taken off when he got to the police station. However, when asked by the Crown whether it followed that he had the handcuffs on for 3 or 4 hours, he said, ""It didn't feel that long but I'm not quite sure. I am not sure."" 

111The following day, after reviewing his custody records, the appellant clarified his evidence on that issue, saying that he was handcuffed for a total of one hour and 10 minutes. 

112In her closing address to the jury, the Crown submitted that the appellant had lied about those matters. She said: 

Well I submit to you that what the lies were, were what the accused was telling you this morning about the handcuffs coming off and then going back on. Or it was a lie what he said to you yesterday, or maybe both of them, we don't know. But they're clearly very inconsistent versions that he gave of events in order to try to explain how it was that his arm's like that. 

113The trial judge made the following remarks on the issue in his summing up: 

Then he said in that evidence, when he gave evidence-in-chief the first time, that the hands had been kept handcuffed for most of the time while he was at the police station, before the photograph was taken on the 29 th , 'for about four hours' ...Then you heard him give some further evidence and be cross-examined again on that subject after he had overnight considered a document which was the police document relating to his, the details of the times and so on, when he was at the police station before the photograph was taken. He still said that he had been handcuffed for various times, although the version he gave of it was that the handcuffing had been in the front for the periods of broken time when he was handcuffed. 

114The appellant submits that the way in which that issue was left to the jury both by the Crown and by the trial judge amounted to a misrepresentation of the evidence as a result of which the trial miscarried. 

115Having regard to the equivocation with which the appellant answered the questions put to him in cross examination by the Crown, it was in my view a robust submission to say that he had lied in one or both of the versions he gave. In my view, on a fair reading of the evidence, the inconsistencies were such as to point rather to uncertainty or unreliability than to dishonesty. The distinction is one as to which lawyers' minds will inevitably differ and that in itself commends a conservative approach on the part of the Crown, in the interests of ensuring a fair trial. 

116I am not persuaded, however, that the way in which the jury was addressed on the issue in the present case was so unfair as to amount to a miscarriage of justice. In my view, ground 8 should be rejected. 

Are the verdicts unsafe and unreasonable? 

117Ground 9 is that the verdicts are unsafe and unreasonable in all the circumstances. 

118Two specific contentions were made in support of this ground. First, the appellant submitted that the verdicts are unsafe due to the admission of evidence of the uncharged acts and the failure to give directions as set out above. As already indicated, I am persuaded that grounds 2 and 3 are made out and that the trial miscarried on that basis. In my view, that is the appropriate characterisation of the consequences of those matters. 

119Separately, the appellant submits that the verdicts are unsafe and unreasonable in that there was insufficient admissible evidence supporting the second charge against the appellant for the jury to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. 

120As noted in the written submissions of the Crown, it was not contended that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt in respect of count 1. However, the appellant's submissions addressing this point applied with equal force to that count. 

121The test is whether it was open to the jury upon the whole of the evidence to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63 (1994); 181 CLR 487 at 494-495. 

122The appellant does not submit that there was no evidence capable of sustaining the verdict as a matter of law. Accordingly, the success of the appellant's submissions as to the alleged unreasonableness of the verdict rested on the contention that, applying the test stated in M at 494, the evidence, ""upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force"" so as to warrant the intervention of this Court, notwithstanding the advantages enjoyed by the jury. 

123Counsel for the appellant provided detailed written submissions setting out a careful and well-reasoned analysis of the evidence of Mr Martin and that of his sister. I have given careful consideration to those matters against my own reading of the record of the trial. I accept that the evidence was highly unsatisfactory in many respects. I am left with some unease as to the strength of the Crown case. Ultimately, however, I have not been satisfied that it was not open to the jury to convict the appellant on the strength of the evidence of Mr Martin. A critical factor in my conclusion is my acceptance of the need to pay due deference to the advantages of being present at a trial and the limitations on the ability of this Court to assess the strength of a case that is so heavily dependant upon the credibility of a single witness. 

124Having expressed my reservations as to the strength of the Crown case, it follows that I am not persuaded that the Court should apply the proviso, as submitted on behalf of the Crown. On the contrary, in my view the difficulties with the Crown case warrant careful attention on the part of the Director of Public Prosecutions to the question whether there should be a retrial in this matter. 

125I would allow the appeal on grounds 1, 2, 3 and 7. The orders I propose are that the convictions be quashed and a new trial ordered. 

126R A Hulme J : I agree with McCallum J.
