1 By this originating summons, the plaintiff an estranged wife, seeks a declaration that an instrument of transfer executed by her along with a deed of separation, on or about 11 November 1993 (sic), conveying her right, title and interest in a jointly owned matrimonial home known as 46 Thomson Terrace, Singapore ('the property') to her husband, for a nominal consideration of one Singapore dollar, is void upon the ground that it was obtained by him under duress and or undue influence.
She alleged that she would not have transferred the property to her husband if not for his threat that he would kill their two young children and commit suicide, if she refused to execute the said transfer.
2 The husband denied the wife's allegations. He averred that she was carrying on an illicit affair with one Henry Ho Kum Hong ('Henry Ho') and was determined to walk out of their marriage. His several pleas and entreaties to bring to her senses were unsuccessful and being insistent on freeing herself from the marriage bond, she voluntarily and without any pressure on his part executed the transfer.
3 Testimonies of the parties as to the circumstances leading to the execution of the transfer were at considerable variance. It is therefore necessary to deal with the claims and evidence in this matter at some length.
4 Parties were married in June 1988. Wife is a tour guide and the husband a businessman. They have two young children through their union, a boy and a girl, five and four years of age respectively. The husband is 11 years older than the wife and this age difference had apparently something to do with their perceived incompatability -more so from the point of view of the wife.
5 Shortly after the marriage, they bought a property, a terrace house for $436,000. The property is currently valued by Richard Ellis at S$1,350,000 and its value at the time when the transfer was executed ie, on or about 11 November 1993 was S$950,000. The valuation of the property as of 12 November 1993 as accepted by the Commissioner of Stamps was $800,000.
Financial contributions
6 There was much dispute as to the monetary contributions made by each party towards the purchase price of the property. The wife claimed that she was the major contributor and that she had paid out a total of $240,206 by way of initial deposits and monthly loan repayments, in addition to disbursing a sum of $26,000 for the purchase of furniture and fittings and a further sum of $90,200 for the husband's business. The tabulation of her contributions as appears at paras 4 and 5 of her affidavit of 21 October 1994 is as follows:
Initial deposit $43,600
Monthly instalments of approximately $3,500 towards the housing loan obtained from Hong Leong Finance Ltd from about June 1988 to June 1991 (sic) 36 months
$126,000
Monthly instalments of $2,500 for another 13 months from July 1991 to July 1992
$32,500
Further contributions from 29 August 1992 to 4 December 1993
$38,106
Furniture and fittings $26,000
Contributions to husband's business from December 1988 to February 1993 $90,200
Total: $356,406
7 In this connection she claimed that in or around 1985 her income as a tourist guide was substantial and that her average monthly receipt was in the region of $20,000. However her income tax returns for the period 1988 to 1996 showed that her annual income for the abovestated period was only between $10,000 and S$15,000 (see pages 57 and 78 of NE).
8 The husband disputed the wife's figures substantially. His position was that apart from a sum of $11,700 which came from the wife's CPF and another sum of about $38,106 voluntarily paid by the wife, all other contributions towards the property came from him. His tabulation of the parties' respective contributions as gathered from his counsel's written submission (see pages 40 to 51, particularly pages 40, 44, 45 and 51) is as follows:
Husband's Contribution
Wife's Contribution
Option Money $5,000.00

9 Leaving aside the dispute relating to the parties' actual monetary contributions towards the purchase of the house, their accounts as respects events leading to the deed of separation and the said transfer, are as follows.
Wife's version
10 The wife claimed that from 1993, their relationship had steadily deteriorated to the point they began discussing the prospect of separation between themselves and the husband taking the position that she left the matrimonial home leaving the children in his custody after transferring all her interests in the jointly held property to him.
11 As she was unwilling to accede to his demands, the husband became aggressive and started to utter threats to kill both their children and commit suicide. Even on the morning of 11 November 1993, when the wife was reluctant to proceed to the husband's solicitors' office to sign the documents, he in a fit of temper, tore birthday cards and letters, splashed water on the bed, spat on the floor and uttered threats to smash the television set, burn the flat and cut up the sofa set. As this was not the first time the husband had manifested such threats, she, in a state of fright and being mindful for the safety of her children, relented and proceeded to the office of the husband's solicitors where she executed the deed of separation and the transfer instrument. She stated that at her husband's solicitor's office all the formalities were carried out by the husband's solicitor Mr James Wan ('Mr Wan') in a most perfunctory manner and that he merely handed her the documents and asked her to sign them without explaining to her the import and significance of the deed of transfer.
12 She denied that she was carrying on any extra-marital relationship with Henry Ho or anyone else. She claimed that Henry Ho whom she had first met in December 1992 had been a good friend offering occasional assistance to her at the most once a week, as an English interpreter to explain the nature and quality of some health products she was marketing part-time, to her English- speaking customers (see page 17 of NE).
13 She alleged that her husband is a person of violent disposition. He has scars on his chest which she understood were stab wounds suffered by him before their marriage, when he fought with some people with knives. The husband had also warned her that he would break Henry Ho's legs if she continued her association with him. She took his threats seriously since her husband is a judo expert holding a black belt. She claimed that she was in great fear and was afraid of 'very severe consequences' if she went against his orders and hence her signing the documents proffered to her by the husband's solicitors.
14 She admitted however that from the beginning of November 1993 at least ten days before she had visited her husband's solicitors to execute the deed under reference, she had engaged the services of a firm of solicitors known as Ng Ong & Chee and received advice from them. She said that she in fact wanted them to handle the execution of the deed of separation and had briefed them about her husband's threats. She revealed that her solicitors' advice was that she should not sign the deed.
However after she had signed the same, she went back to her solicitor to relate the events, and was upbraided by him for not heeding his advice. All the same, her solicitor wanted to sort out the custody matter first and intended to deal with the issue relating to the property, three years later. She explained that she signed the deed against the advice of her solicitor because she had been subjected to much mental torture by her husband's begging and 'kowtowing' to her not to leave him and above all his threats to kill the children and committing suicide (pages 23,24 and 27 of NE).
Husband's account
15 The husband's account can be summarised as follows.
16 Sometime in October 1992, he discovered that his wife was having an affair with Henry Ho, a part-time insurance agent. At that time the eldest child of the marriage was only about 18 months old and the youngest eight months. As he loved his children very much, he was determined to save the marriage and was prepared to let the past rest. Towards this end, he tried his best to persuade his wife to change her ways. But she was adamant and confessed to him that she was madly in love with Henry Ho and asked her husband to free her from the wedlock. She said that she did not desire anything and all she wanted was her freedom. She repeatedly told him that he could have the children, the house and the rest and thereafter to allow her to be free from the marriage (para 14 of the husband's first affidavit of 23 December 1994).
17 The husband did his best to dissuade her but to no avail. She was not interested in the marriage nor the family and even once threatened that if he did not grant her the freedom she wanted, she would kill the children and destroy him thereafter.
18 The husband still did not give up, hoping that counselling might help his wife to change her ways. He therefore sought the assistance of a marriage counsellor, Mr James Tan, at the counselling and care unit at Sophia Road, Singapore. He also managed to persuade his wife to meet the counsellor on 8 November 1993 but it was an exercise in futility. The wife told him immediately after their visit to the counsellor that it was hopeless and their marriage could not be salvaged. She kept pressing him to seek the services of a lawyer to prepare documents for their separation and advised him that he could find one by going through the yellow pages. She again reminded him that he could have the children and the house if he would let her go. The only payment she demanded from him was for a sum of $47,000 (see paras 17, 18 and 19 of the husband's first affidavit).
19 Eventually following the suggestions by his wife, he scanned through the yellow pages and after a few telephone calls settled for James Wan & Co as Mr Wan was available to see him to prepare the documents on a basis of urgency. He first called on Mr Wan on 9 November 1993 and instructed him to finalise the documentation as concerns separation and the transfer of the property. Consequently, by prior appointment, parties attended at the office of Mr Wan where after explanation and the wife acknowledging that she understood everything, signed the documents (see paras 21 and 22 of the husband's first affidavit).
The documents having been signed and each party having been supplied with a copy each of the deed of separation, left Mr Wan's office. No copy of the transfer instrument was provided to them as they were advised by Mr Wan that a few other formalities were required to be done on the document.
20 The deed of separation executed contained, inter alia a non-molestation clause, a clause providing that the custody, care and control of the children be given to the husband with reasonable access to the wife and another clause in relation to the husband assigning to the wife personal chattels and effects then in her possession and control. There was no reference to the property in that deed.
21 The husband learnt from his solicitors on or about 15 November 1993 that his wife was demanding the payment of the sum of $47,000. The husband had promptly paid this sum to her on or about 20 December 1993 (see pages 34D-F and 35A-D of NE).
22 The matter did not come to an end. Disputes soon erupted between the parties over the terms of access to the two children and there followed a series of letters between the respective solicitors and police complaints by the husband against the wife. Interestingly however, no mention had been made by the wife's solicitors in any of those letters on the issue relating to the property.
23 It was not until 7 March 1994 - about four months after the execution of the transfer instrument - the husband's solicitors were for the very first time told by the wife's solicitors of the allegation that the wife was made to sign the transfer under duress. The relevant segments of Ng Ong & Chee's letter dated 7 March 1994 read as follows:
We are further instructed that before our client signed the Deed of Separation with your client dated 12th November 1993, our client was threatened by your client that unless she gave custody of the children as well as the matrimonial property to your client, your client would kill the children before committing suicide. Our client was put to great fear for the safety of the children and accordingly, was forced to transfer the matrimonial property to your client. In the circumstances, the transfer was under duress and may be voidable at law.
Our client instructs that all payments up to the date of transfer of the aforesaid matrimonial property was borne solely by her. Our client wants the return of the amounts paid by her for the said matrimonial property. Kindly advise your client that this shall not in any way prejudice our client's strict legal rights and our client reserves her right to any other remedy available to her at law.
Further there is no consideration for the transfer. Kindly make available to us a copy of the transfer document so that we may peruse them and advise our client accordingly. < Emphasis added. > (signed Ng Ong & Chee)
24 There followed then a lull for another 4 months. Then on 20 July 1994, the plaintiff's present solicitors wrote to the defendant's solicitors in the following terms:
As you know we act for Mdm Lim Buay Cheng. Our client instructs us that on or about 12 November 1993, she signed 2 documents at your office, one was a Deed of Separation and the other which she was not given a copy of. Our client believes that the latter document could have been a transfer referred to in the telefax of M/s Ng Ong & Chee of 7 March 1994 to yourselves.
We are instructed to put your client on notice that our client objects to the circumstances against which our client signed the said document. The factual particulars are set out in the said telefax of M/s Ng Ong & Chee of 7 March 1994 to yourselves.
Further our client did not have the benefit of independent legal advice before signing the said document.
Do also let us have a copy of the transfer document for our perusal as soon as possible. In the meantime your client must not take any steps in reliance of the said document.
< Emphasis added. > (signed Tan Lim & Tan)
25 The issues were then joined and the plaintiff commenced proceedings in this matter after filing a caveat against the property. The husband denied that he had ever threatened to break the legs of Henry Ho. He also denied that he suffered knife injuries on his chest as a result of any physical violence and explained that the only one scar found on his chest was due to a skiing accident during his stint as a student in Japan.
Solicitor's evidence
26 Mr Wan who acted for the husband in preparing the deed of separation and the transfer, confirmed the averments of the husband. He said that he took pains to explain the contents of the documents to be executed to both parties and that the wife signed them after stating that she had understood its contents. He added that he especially advised the wife about the consequences of her executing the deed of transfer and that she would thereafter have no share in the property. He further suggested that she might want to think it over before signing or to seek other opinions. However the wife's reply was: 'I understand what I am signing as I do not want to have anything to do with < the husband > .' Mr Wan stated that the wife executed the transfer voluntarily and after advice of its consequences (see paras 4 to 12 of his affidavit). Mr Wan also produced his attendance notes purportedly made on 12 November 1993 to support his foregoing averments.
27 When cross-examined as to the reasons for not specifically denying the allegations of duress raised in the wife's former solicitors' letter dated 7 March 1994, he mentioned that following the said allegations, he was in fact in telephone communication with the wife's former solicitor, Mr Chee Wai Pong and had mentioned to him that the allegations as to duress were all unfounded. As Mr Chee reportedly commented to Mr Wan that the former would cease to be acting for the wife, he did not take the matter any further (see pages 122/123 of NE). As for not forwarding a copy of the transfer, Mr Wan replied that as he was instructed at that time by the husband concerning custody of the children, he was attending to that matter and might have forgotten to transmit a copy to the wife's solicitors (see page 119 of NE).
28 Neither Mr Chee Wai Pong nor any other solicitor from the wife's former solicitors' office was called to rebut Mr Wan's averments despite a suggestion as to rebuttal evidence by the court (page 133A-B of NE). The court also noted that the wife did not at the time of the execution of the deeds or before, disclose to the husband's solicitors that she had already at the material time retained the services of a firm of solicitors.
29 The husband informed the court (page 98B of NE) that he was prepared to make an additional monetary contribution to his wife, even if he were to succeed in his defence. This offer was further confirmed by his counsel during submission that the husband would be prepared to pay the wife a sum of $180,000 voluntarily which would be in addition to his earlier payment of $61,407.44 (comprising a sum of $47,000 paid sometime in December 1993 and another sum of $14,407.44 - exh AB-143 - being refund made by him to the wife's Central Provident Fund ('CPF') account).
30 There was a peripheral dispute as to whether the wife attended at the office of Mr Wan to execute the deeds on 11 or 12 November 1993. The wife said that it was on 11 November 1993 but the husband maintained that it was on 12 November 1993. However this detail is not really material to the resolution of the issues at hand.
Conclusion
31 The main issue in this case is whether the transfer executed by the wife in favour of her husband should be set aside on grounds of undue influence or duress. The wife's contention is that she executed it solely because of her husband's threats to harm her children and his committing suicide. The husband's position on the other hand was that it was she, who in order to walk out of the marriage, voluntarily transferred the property to him after demanding the said sum of $47,000 and that there was no truth in her allegations that he threatened or coerced her into executing the deeds in question.
32 One thing that is clear from the evidence of the wife was that she had the services of a firm of solicitors and was in fact in consultation with them, well before she visited Mr Wan's office to execute the deeds. Her evidence in this regard appearing at pages 58 to 60 of the notes of evidence is noteworthy. It reads:
Q: Now about the Deed of Transfer you signed. You told the court yesterday that you went to see Messrs Ng, Ong & Chee even before you signed that Deed? A: Yes.
Q: When you went to see them first time, did you take along any document or any draft Transfer with you? A: No.
Q: What exactly did you tell your solicitor at Messrs Ng, Ong & Chee? A: I wanted him to act for me in the matter of my Deed of Separation. I also told him that my husband had threatened me with regard to the children. I told him that I had great emotional pressure from him. I told him that if I don't sign he had threatened to kill the children and commit suicide. The lawyer told me not to be frightened of him. So I told him that was easier said than done. I told him when I return to my house, I will have to face him again. That's all.
Q: Did you tell the solicitor at Messrs Ng, Ong & Chee about the Transfer? A: I did.
Q: What did you tell him about the Transfer? A: I told the lawyer that my husband wanted the whole house to be transferred to him otherwise he will harm the children.
Q: Did he give you any specific advice as regards the Transfer? A: Lawyer said I had made some contributions to the house. He advised me not to sign the Transfer at random. He asked me to bring my husband down to see him. He said he will explain to him.
Q: Did you try to bring your husband to see Messrs Ng, Ong & Chee? A: That time he already had a lawyer. So I told him that since you have a lawyer, I also have a lawyer. But he was not agreeable and he wanted me to use his lawyer.
Q: And you agreed to that? A: I had no choice as I was forced to.
Q: Notwithstanding the advice given to you, why did you still proceed to sign the Transfer? A: After my lawyers had advised me, I was not so frightened but when I went home and faced him, he gave me a lot of mental pressure. He threatened me saying that if I refused to sign the Transfer, he would kill the children and commit suicide himself and will make me feel guilty for the rest of my life.
Q: How did you react to these threats? A: I was frightened. I felt nobody could help me. I had no choice but to sign the form.
33 It would appear from her evidence that she had been in consultation with her solicitors and had been advised even from the beginning of November 1993. In reply to a question whether she gave any thought to the advice given by her solicitors before she executed the transfer deed, she replied (page 24 of NE):
I did, but after I had seen Messrs Ng, Ong & Chee my husband tortured me mentally every night. My husband begged me not to leave him; said he would kow-tow to me and if I leave him he would suffer financial difficulties; he would kill the children and commit suicide and my conscience will be troubled for the rest of my life.
34 She further confirmed that before she signed both deeds she had also the benefit of advice from the marriage counsellor who told her not to fear and to consult a good lawyer which she did (page 22A-D and 35 of NE).
35 When questioned as to the reason why she remained silent on the issue of duress for nearly four months after the execution of the transfer, she alleged that her previous solicitor did not want to handle her matter because she had signed the document against his advice (page 39 of NE).
36 It was submitted by the wife's counsel that the transfer by the wife of the matrimonial house for a consideration of $1 must be viewed with suspicion and it behoved the court to set aside the transaction for such a transfer must have been brought about by improper influence exercised by the husband. In this regard he relied on a passage from 18 Halsbury's Laws of England (4th Edn, para 340) where it is stated:
It is noticeable that the relation of husband and wife is not one which gives rise to the presumption that undue influence was exercised. A large gift, however, by a wife to her husband will be regarded with some degree of suspicion, and, if there is any proof that the husband exercised an improper influence, the court will be inclined to set the transaction aside. ... < Emphasis added. > 
37 Counsel argued, quoting Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Barclays Bank Plc v O'Brien And Another < 1994 > 1 AC 180 at 190H and 191A, that although the relationship between the husband and wife is not one which gives rise to the presumption of undue influence, courts, due perhaps to a special tenderness of treatment afforded to wives, do recognise that 'the sexual and emotional ties between the parties provide a ready weapon for undue influence and that a wife's true wishes can easily be overborne because of her fear of destroying or damaging the wider relationship between her and her husband if she opposes his wishes.'
38 L P Thean JA in Lim Geok Hian v Lim Guan Chin < 1994 > 1 SLR 203 observed that 'undue influence is the unconscious use of one's power or authority over another to acquire a benefit or to achieve a purpose.' (page 216, supra). He said that cases of undue influence fell into two categories. First, where actual influence has been proved to have been exercised, and second, cases where by virtue of a particular relationship between the parties the court presumes that undue influence has been exercised unless the contrary is proved.
39 I was not addressed on any authority which states that there is a presumption of undue influence between a husband and wife and even the dicta by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Barclays v O'Brien (supra) referred to by counsel for the wife were predicated upon a de facto existence of a relationship under which the complainant (the wife herein) generally reposed trust and confidence in the alleged wrong-doer (see page 189H, supra) and the assumption that the wife's true wishes can be easily overborne because of her fear of destroying or damaging the wider relationship (page 198A, supra).
40 I cannot discern in this case whether the wife had any such de facto relationship as alluded to by Lord Browne- Wilkinson suggesting that she had any trust or confidence in her husband.
41 In reviewing the wife's evidence, it became apparent that the husband was decidedly in no position to influence the wife. She had a mind of her own and was intent on leaving her husband for a life outside, willy nilly the consequences. Her protestations that she was not involved with Henry Ho and that he was no more than a friend rendering gratuitous assistance to explain her health products to her English speaking customers, were spiritless and tongue-in-cheek. All the husband's pleas and to borrow a phrase from her, his 'kowtowing' to her not to abandon him and the marriage were of no avail. It was patent that she was no longer attracted to her husband whom according to her was 11 years older than her and hence the incompatability. But all said, could there be any truth in her complaint that her husband threatened to kill the children and commit suicide if she did not transfer the property.
42 On review of all the evidence, I am not persuaded that such a threat was uttered in the manner alleged by the wife and even if it was, it was unlikely that this wife whom I had the opportunity of observing in the witness box, was such a person who could be easily moved by the threat adverted to. She is, in my view, quite worldly, resourceful, hard-nosed and not a person who could be pushed around. If indeed she was, as she claimed, moved and destabilised by such threats concerning her children, she would have in all likelihood stayed home with her children at least for the time being rather than precipitously walking out of the matrimonial home despite her husband's 'kowtowing' to her.
43 At any rate, would this wife who had deemed it wise to engage in some spirited correspondence with the husband as respects access to the children from about 27 January 1994 onwards (see AB-97), have kept silent about the husband's alleged coercion and threats to kill the children for nearly four months (ie from 11 November 1993 to 7 March 1994). Her silence and inaction for such a long period despite her being represented by solicitors, belie her claim that the transfer was a result of those alleged threats on which she now tries to build her case.
Furthermore, her not calling her own solicitor to whom she had apparently related the husband's threats before and immediately after the execution of the transfer - despite a pointed reference to rebuttal evidence (page 133 of NE) - tends to weaken her assertion that such threats were indeed uttered by the husband.
44 I do not find that there was any duress or improper pressure brought to bear on her by the husband to effect the transfer now in contention. The simple truth appears to be that she wanted to be free from the marriage and hence her voluntarily and after advice, executing the deed of separation and the deed of transfer which she is now endeavouring to impugn. In this context, it should be observed that although Mr Wan should have enlisted the help of a third party to explain the contents of the deed to the wife considering the substantial asset value of the property, such a deficiency on his part does not degrade his testimony which I accept, that he in fact explained its contents and cautioned her of the consequences. The wife's omission to mention to Mr Wan that she had by then engaged the services of a firm of solicitors, further tends to undermine her veracity.
45 Another matter considered by the court is whether the transaction is inherently inequitable so that this court ought to intervene and set aside the deed of transfer. Principles of law relevant to this issue are well-encapsulated by Thean JA in Lim Geok Hian (supra) where he cites with approval the principles articulated by the English Court of Appeal in Alec Lobb (Garages) Ltd and others v Total Oil GB Ltd < 1985 > 1 All ER 303. In Alec Lobb, the plaintiffs, the operators of a petrol filling station, applied to court to set aside a lease and lease-back agreement entered into with a petroleum company on the ground, inter alia, that there was inequality of bargaining power between them and that the terms of the transactions had not been shown to be fair, just and reasonable. The English Court of Appeal held that notwithstanding the inequality of bargaining power between the parties, the defendants' conduct in relation to the transaction could not be considered unconscionable, coercive or oppressive.
46 Dillon LJ commented at pages 312j and 313a:
The whole emphasis is on extortion, or undue advantage taken of weakness, an unconscientious use of the power arising out of the inequality of the parties' circumstances, and on unconscientious use of power which the court might in certain circumstances be entitled to infer from a particular, and in these days notorious, relationship unless the contract is proved to have been in fact fair, just and reasonable. Nothing leads me to suppose that the course of the development of the law over the last 100 years has been such that the emphasis on unconscionable conduct or unconscientious use of power has gone and relief will now be granted in equity in a case such as the present if there has been unequal bargaining power, even if the stronger has not used his strength unconscionably. ...
47 In the result, the court held at page 305:
... Where one party had acted extortionately, oppressively or coercively towards the other, the court would in fairness set aside a transaction so made. However, a transaction was not rendered harsh or unconscionable merely because the parties were of unequal bargaining power and the stronger party had not shown that the terms of agreement were fair, just and reasonable. Furthermore, a transaction was not unconscionable merely because a party was forced by economic necessity to make it. On the facts, although the plaintiffs had no realistic alternative, no pressure had been exerted on them by the defendant, which was reluctant to enter into the transaction, and furthermore the plaintiffs themselves had sought the defendant's assistance to avert financial collapse and had sought the prior advice of their solicitors and accountant, which they had chosen to ignore. Accordingly, the judge had been right to find that the defendant's conduct was not unconscionable or oppressive. In any event the plaintiffs' claim in equity was barred by laches. The plaintiffs' appeal would therefore be dismissed ...
48 As stated by the Privy Council in Pao On And Others v Lau Yiu Long And Others < 1980 > AC 614 at 635C-E, '<in> determining whether there was a coercion of will such that there was no true consent, it is material to inquire whether the person alleged to have been coerced did or did not protest; whether, at the time he was allegedly coerced into making the contract, he did or did not have an alternative course open to him such as an adequate legal remedy; whether he was independently advised; and whether after entering the contract he took steps to avoid it.'
49 As stated earlier, the wife in the present case had the services of legal counsel from the outset. She was advised of the consequences of her actions not only by her counsel but in my finding also by the husband's counsel. She had all the time in the world to reflect upon her actions yet she had decided to sign the deed which according to her was even against the advice of her solicitors: She did not produce any evidence from any other source to confirm her allegations that her husband had threatened to kill the children and commit suicide. At any rate, she did not even feel fit to articulate the husband's alleged threats until 7 March 1994 - about four months after the execution of the deed - although their respective solicitors were exchanging missives concerning their ongoing dispute relating to children.
50 Though the transfer mentioned a consideration of $1, the fact the husband returned to the wife a sum of $47,000 and refunded her CPF contributions including interest amounting to $14,407.44 is not disputed. The husband claimed that he was the one who bore the brunt of the financing towards the purchase of the house. The wife's evidence that she was earning about $20,000 a month as a tourist guide was not substantiated by her tax returns or pay vouchers. It was suggested to the court that her tax returns were filled in by the husband. But the fact remains that she was a signatory to the tax returns and so could not now be heard to say that she signed the returns blindly. Those who consciously embark upon evading their tax obligations by filing false returns must learn that falsehood will serve them ill in time of need. In the result I am not inclined to give credence to her claim that she was earning an average of $20,000 a month as a tourist guide. Her claim that she was the major contributor towards the purchase price of the property was not supported by credible evidence, further compounded by her prevarications and several contradictions (pages 41 to 49 of NE). By and large, I found her to be an unreliable witness who was given to improvisation. In this context, it must be mentioned that her testimony that she kept tab of all the events in her diary received a black mark and the court's disapprobation when it was discovered that all the so-called entries were made by her in a 1994 diary - all at one go (see pages 8E, 19 and 20A of NE).
51 Having regard to all the evidence, it would seem that the husband was the true homemaker whilst the wife was generally about her fun seeking activities besides being a tourist guide. I was also disposed to accept the husband's averment that the wife's actual monetary contributions towards the purchase of the property was $11,700 and an additional sum of $38,106 as against his contribution of $156,463.50.
52 The husband has already returned a sum of $61,407.44 to the wife and now undertakes to the court to pay the wife an additional sum of $180,000 to the wife even if her claim were to be rejected by the court.
53 It should be observed at this juncture that the value of the property as at 11 November 1993, as estimated by the Commissioner of Stamp Duties was $800,000. On the other hand, the valuation report by Richard Ellis submitted to the court by the wife's counsel pegged the price at $950,000 at the relevant time. The outstanding mortgage sum on the property as of 2 November 1993, as advised by counsel was about $163,000. It would appear therefore that the nett value of the property at the time the deed of transfer was signed was either $637,000 ($800,000 less $163,000 based on the Commissioner of Stamp Duties' valuation) or $787,000 ($950,000 less $163,000 based on Richard Ellis' valuation).
54 Considering the fact the husband in effect would be paying the wife a total of $241,407.44 ($61,407.44 which is already paid plus the additional proposed payment of $180,000), the wife would be receiving in fact 30.67% of the nett value of the property based on Richard Ellis' valuation ($241,407.44 787,000 x 100 = 30.67%) or 37.89% of the nett value based on the valuation by the Commissioner of Stamps ($241,407.44 637,000 x 100 = 37.89%). In my opinion, even if this matter were to be argued on the basis of the principles embodied under s 106 of the Women's Charter (Cap 353), bearing in mind the husband is the homemaker who is now left with two young children to care for and that he is the major financial contributor towards the purchase price of the property, I am of the view that the wife has been adequately compensated by the payment already made and the proposed additional payment to be made by the husband. As I observed earlier, the transfer document executed by the wife was not vitiated by any undue influence, duress or any element of unconscionability. In my finding the wife voluntarily and after receiving advice transferred the property to the husband who is in fact the true homemaker. In the premises having approved the husband's undertaking to pay the wife a further sum of $180,000 which he is hereby ordered to pay on or before 15 April 1997 or by any extension thereof as may be granted by the court, I dismiss the wife's claim herein with costs.
Dated this 15th day of November 1996.
