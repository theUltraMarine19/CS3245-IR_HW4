(delivering oral judgment): In this appeal, the appellant was convicted of four offences under the Films Act as follows: 
 
 
(1) making video tapes without a licence under s 6(1) of the Act; 
 
(2) distributing uncensored video tapes under s 6(1); 
 
(3) having in his possession 217 video tapes without a valid certificate authorizing the exhibition thereof under s 21(1) of the Act; 
 
(4) having possession of an obscene video tape under s 29(1) of the Act.
  
 
 
He was sentenced as follows:
First charge: Fine of $5,000 and in default thereof three months` imprisonment.
Second charge: Fine of $5,000 and in default thereof three months` imprisonment.
Third charge: Fine of $100 per tape (totalling $21,700) and in default thereof three days for each tape (totalling 651 days);
Fourth charge: Fine of $500 and in default thereof five weeks` imprisonment.
Because the appellant has not been able to pay any of the fines, all the default punishments have taken effect. Because the default sentences of imprisonment run consecutively, the court having no power to make them run concurrently by virtue of s 224(b)(iv) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the result is that the appellant will have to serve about 29 months in prison.
The facts adduced in evidence showed that upon a raid conducted by officers from the Board of Film Censors, 219 video tapes were found in the premises of the accused`s sister. The accused pleaded guilty to the four charges. It should be noted that the first charge and the second charge do not specify the number of video tapes he was accused of having made or distributed whereas the third charge specified 217 video tapes in his possession. That being the case, it would appear that the accused has been charged for three separate offences for what was essentially one composite unlawful act on his part, ie he was making video tapes for the purpose of distribution.
Two points arise in this appeal. The first is that the default sentences on the first and second charges were excessive in that they bore no proportion to the maximum penalty that could be suffered by the accused. The maximum fine that can be imposed under s 6(1) of the Films Act is $20,000 and the maximum default sentence is six months by virtue of s 224(c)(iii) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The default sentence should therefore be one and a half months. That is the submission.
The second point is that by imposing a default sentence of 651 days` imprisonment in respect of the third charge, the district judge has erred in law as the maximum default sentence, by virtue of s 224(c)(iii)(C) of the Criminal Procedure Code, is only six months and therefore the default sentence of 651 days` imprisonment exceeded the maximum punishment allowed by the law.
The deputy public prosecutor submitted that the sentence on the third charge is correct as s 224(c)(iii) applies to each fine. If I understand her argument, what the deputy public prosecutor is submitting is that each of the fines falls within s 224(c)(iii)(B) of the Code and therefore the total default sentence may exceed four months.
I do not agree with the construction of s 224(c)(iii) contended for by the deputy public prosecutor. Sub-paragraphs (A), (B) and (C) of that provision must be read subject to the terms of the main para (c) which refers to `the offence`. The offence here was not having unlawful possession of one tape but of 217 tapes. There was only one offence. Although a fine was imposed for each of the tapes, the total fines on all the tapes constitute the collective punishment for that one offence. Accordingly, the default sentence on the total fine of $21,700 must fall within sub-para (C) which provides that the default term of imprisonment shall not exceed six months. I therefore agree with the submission of counsel for the appellant on this point.
As the appellant is a first offender and as the culpability of the accused in respect of the first three charges overlapped to a certain extent, I am of the view that the default sentences on the first and second charges are excessive, even though they cannot be said to have ignored the principle of proportionality in sentencing. The sentence on the third charge is wrong in law and the default sentence has the effect of a maximum sentence against a first offender. However, I must take into account the large number of tapes involved in the offence. Even then, I find it excessive. The sentence on the fourth charge ignores the principle of proportionality in sentencing.
Taking into account the fact that the accused was charged with making one tape rather than a big number of tapes in this respect, I have to give the benefit of doubt to the accused since the charge itself does not specify the number of tapes that was involved and the facts showed that at the time of the police raid only one tape was in the process of being made and taking into account the similar situation that the charge of distributing tapes did not specify the number being distributed and all the other factors that I have considered earlier, I have formed the view that the following default sentences should be adequate: first charge - one and a half months; second charge - one and a half months; third charge - four months; fourth charge - two weeks. And so I order.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellant was charged for having abetted an offence under s 406(a) of the Companies Act (Cap 50) by inducing Bank of America NA & ST (the bank), through deceitful means, to give credit to his company, Lamipak Industries Pte Ltd (Lamipak), to the extent of $757,930. Briefly, the deceitful means employed consisted of submitting to the bank false documents purporting to show that Lamipak had purchased and received goods from a firm, Showa Trading, which it had not. Three other similar charges of similarly inducing three other banks on three separate occasions to grant credit to Lamipak were, with the consent of the appellant, taken into consideration for the purpose of determining the sentence. All these offences were committed over a period of about six months between October 1984 and Februay 1985. Three out of the four banks that had granted such credit to Lamipak had been repaid in full together with interest and other banking charges. As for the fourth bank, which is United Overseas Bank Ltd, a part payment of $200,000 had been made, and the balance of the principal sum of $872,843.42 remains unpaid. The reason for the non-payment is that at the material time, provisional liquidators of Lamipak had been appointed and if such payment were made it would or might amount to a preferential payment. A winding-up order against Lamipak was made on 1 October 1985.
The appellant was arrested by the Commercial Crime Division, CID on 17 October 1985 and was kept in custody for two days. He was granted bail on 19 October 1985 and thereafter he daily reported to CID six days a week for 18 months. Subsequently, the Commercial Affairs Department took over the investigation. There followed a period of further investigation by the Commercial Affairs Department and discussion between the prosecution and the defence, which resulted in the charge against the appellant under s 406(a) of the Companies Act. The complaint in respect of which the appellant was arrested is unrelated to the charge. He pleaded guilty to the charge and was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of nine months. Against that sentence, this appeal is now brought.
It is urged by Mr Sherrard on behalf of the appellant that, first, in all the circumstances of this case, financial penalty, ie a fine, would be adequate and no custodial sentence is necessary, and, secondly, and failing the first plea, a short custodial sentence in this case would be a very severe punishment to the appellant, and in connection with this second plea, he relies on what is generally known in England the `clang of prison gates` principle, to which I shall revert shortly.
Until the commission of the offences, the appellant had an unblemished record; indeed I would say he had an admirable record. He is a self-made man, starting his business with very little financial resources and had through his drive and industry succeeded in building up a substantial company, Lamipak, which, but for its imprudent investment in the real property market, would in all probability not have become insolvent. Lamipak and its subsidiaries had collapsed, and the appellant is now a bankrupt. However, it must be emphasized that the collapse of his companies was not brought about or contributed to by these offences he had committed. It appears that that was due to the collapse in the property market in 1984/85 and the recession in Singapore. The appellant is an innovator and an inventor; he was responsible for the development of high molecular weight and high density polyethylene products, and he designed machines for the manufacture of such polyethylene products. He had, to use his counsel`s words, `placed Singapore on the world map` in the field of manufacture and processing of plastic film. His expertise had been sought by the Republic of Ireland and the People`s Republic of China. In 1984/85, he served in two out of the nine sub-committees of the Economic Committee of Singapore and had been active in community work and development. Taking into account all these contributions made by the appellant and also all other mitigating circumstances, Mr Sherrard submits that a financial penalty - a fine - would be an adequate and appropriate punishment. I agree that the circumstances here are highly exceptional and there are very strong extenuating circumstances in his favour. I agree also that the charge preferred against the appellant is one of the lowest levels in terms of criminality under s 406(a) of the Companies Act; plainly, there are different levels of criminality envisaged in this provision. It is of course not argued that the appellant is not criminally culpable; that of course he is. Nor is it argued that the charge against the appellant and the three other charges taken into consideration are not serious. What is argued by Mr Sherrard is that the appellant was only guilty of deception - deceiving the banks into granting credit facilities to Lamipak. He was not charged for fraudulently or dishonestly inducing the banks. I accept his argument on this distinction but for the purpose of this appeal it is unnecessary for me to embark on a discussion on the distinction between inducing a bank by deceitful means and inducing a bank by fraudulent or dishonest means.
Nonetheless, I am unable to agree that only financial penalty is a sufficient punishment. This is not a case of an isolated instance of deviation from or transgression of the law momentarily committed without much plan or deliberation. It is a case where a very senior and responsible officer of a company on four separate occasions by deceitful means induced four banks over a period of about six months to grant credit facilities to his company, in which he owned 81% of the shares, and on each occasion a large sum of money was involved. Putting it at its lowest, these transactions reflect a consistent and systematic plan of deceit on banks. I am therefore of the opinion that a custodial sentence ought to be imposed.
The next question is the length of such custodial sentence. On this, I accept the argument advanced by Mr Sherrard that in this case the `clang of prison gates` principle should apply. Putting it briefly, the principle is that in the case of a man with an unblemished record, the fact that he has a criminal conviction and finds himself in prison is a very grave punishment and a short prison term should in certain circumstances suffice. In the case of 
 R v Jones 
 (1980) 2 Cr App R (S) 134, Lord Lane CJ, after referring to the various mitigating factors in the case before the court, said at p 135: 
 
All these are matters which it is proper for the court to take into account. But there is one matter which we consider to be paramount in cases of this sort, and that is this. When a man aged 58 or in that region finds himself faced for the first time in his life with a criminal conviction, the mere fact that he goes to prison at all is a very grave punishment indeed. Of course the fact that he goes there means necessarily that he is going to suffer financial loss. But the closing of the prison gates behind him, for whatever length of time they may stay closed, is a very grave punishment indeed. It seems to us that in those circumstances, and in this particular case, against the background of this man`s character and the comparatively small sums of money involved, this is a case par excellence where a short prison sentence was ample.
 
 
 
This principle was adopted and applied subsequently in numerous cases, some of which were cited by Mr Sherrard in support, namely, 
 R v Jacob 
 (1981) 3 Cr App R (S) 298, 
 R v Ward 
 (1981) 3 Cr App R (S) 350, 
 R v Kelly 
 (1983) 5 Cr App R (S) 1, 
 R v Patel 
 (1984) 6 Cr App R (S) 169 and 
 R v Carr 
 (1984) 6 Cr App R (S) 359. With this principle I respectfully agree, and I adopt it for this case having regard to the particular circumstances. In the words of Lord Lane CJ, in the circumstances of this case, and in particular the background of the appellant`s character and his contribution to society and the country, this is a case par excellence where a short term of imprisonment is adequate punishment.
In my opinion, in this case, a term of imprisonment of three months would be adequate in all the circumstances. I therefore set aside the sentence of nine months imposed by the learned magistrate and substitute therefor a term of three months. To that extent I allow the appeal.

This is an appeal by Ng Eng Huat against his conviction and sentence on the following two charges: 
 
First Charge
 
 
 
You Ng Eng Huat nric no: 0173065-G are charged that you, on or about the 8th day September 1985, at about 11 pm, at the intersection of Marymount Road and Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1, Singapore, did a negligent act which endangered the personal safety of others, to wit, by reversing motor car EY 6543 U colliding into the front portion of motor car EQ 7499 A, and causing the said vehicle to hurl backward and colliding into the front portion of stationary motor lorry YN 2683, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 336 of the Penal Code (Capt 103). 
 
Second Charge
 
 
 
You Ng Eng Huat nric no: 0173065-G are charged that you, on or about the 9th day of September 1985, at about 7pm, at Ang Mo Kio Police Post, Singapore, did give information to Corporal 2487 Chong Kwek Fah of the Singapore Police Force, contained in Traffic Accident Report No 70149: `On 8 September 1985 at about 2300hrs I was driving my car EY 6543 U along Marymount Road towards Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 and heading towards Thomson Road when I came to the filter lane of Marymount Road and Ang Mo Kio Ave 1, I stop my vehicle and to give way to the vehicle came from my right hand side. Whilst I stop my vehicle suddenly one motor car EQ 7499 A came and hit against my vehicle. As a result my vehicle rear portion was slightly dented. No one was injured.`
Which information you knew to be false, knowing it to be likely that you would thereby cause such public servant to carry out an investigation into a case of careless driving committed by one Goh Seng Guan on 8th September 1985, at about 11 pm at the intersection of Marymount Road and Ang Mo Kio Ave 1, Singapore, which the said public servant would not have done if the true state of facts were known to him, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 103).
The appellant was sentenced to four weeks` imprisonment on the first charge and two weeks` imprisonment on the second charge, the sentences to run concurrently.
The facts are these.
On 8 May 1985, at about 11 pm Oliver Goh Seng Guan (PW6) and his girl friend Mevilla Chay Chye Peng (PW7) were travelling along Marymount Road in the direction of Ang Mo Kio Ave 1 in a motor car EQ 7499A driven by PW6. Suddenly, a motor car EY 6543U driven by the appellant shot out of Bright Hill Drive into Marymount Road without looking out for PW6`s oncoming car which caused PW6 to sound his horn. The two cars then proceeded towards Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1, with the appellant`s car preceding PW6`s car.
At the slip road leading into Ang Mo Kio Ave 1, PW6 found his way blocked by the appellant`s car. Five men alighted from the appellant`s car. The appellant, with Lee Cheng Chuan (DW2), approached PW6`s car. They were aggressive, arrogant and fierce and PW6 was assaulted by DW2 through the car window.
After the assault, all the men returned to appellant`s car and PW6 thought that the matter was over. The appellant drove his car forward for about two car lengths. All of a sudden, the appellant reversed his car very quickly which caused PW6 to engage his reverse gear and reverse his car but his car was hit by the appellant`s car. The impact caused PW6`s car to hurl backwards, colliding into the front portion of the lorry behind him. This provoked the lorry driver Lim Beng Teong (PW4) and his passenger Ong Chay Thiam (PWS), who had both witnessed the incident, to have an exchange of words with the appellant and his passengers. At this juncture, PW6 made good his escape from the scene by driving through a gap which was created when the appellant reversed his car. PW6 and PW7 then proceeded straight to the Paya Lebar police station where a report was lodged.
The appellant made a police report (ex P4) on 9 September 1985 at about 7 pm at the Ang Mo Kio Police Post to Cp Chong Kwek Fah (PW1). His report was that he stopped his car at the slip road of Marymount Road leading into Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 to give way to the vehicle coming from his right, when suddenly car EQ 7499A came and hit his car from the rear.
According to PW1, the appellant`s report gave him the impression that the driver of car EQ 7499A was at fault. He accordingly took action along the line of traffic investigation and sent the report, ex P4, to the Traffic Police for further investigations, which were carried out by W/Cpl Soomy Koh (PW2) and W/Sgt Foo Kok Poo (PW3) of the Traffic Police. In view of what was stated in the report ex P4, these two officers investigated along the premise that PW6 might have been guilty of careless driving. However, investigations showed otherwise.
The main point taken by counsel for the appellant on the first charge is that the trial court erred in law in convicting the appellant when the evidence of the prosecution witnesses (PW4, PW5, PW6 and PW7) showed that the appellant intentionally reversed his car to collide into PW6`s car. It is argued that the act of the appellant of reversing his car to collide with PW6`s car was not a negligent act under s 336 of the Penal Code. The act was an intentional and deliberate act.
I agree with the submission of counsel for the appellant. On the evidence it is clear that the act of the appellant of reversing his car was not a negligent act but an intentional and deliberate act of the appellant to collide into PW6`s car. Such act of the appellant was not a negligent act within the meaning of s 336 of the Penal Code (see 
 Kala Bhika Baria v State 
 (1966) Cr LJ 7).
However, the evidence accepted by the trial court clearly shows that the appellant had committed the offence of using criminal force on PW6, an offence under s 352 of the Penal Code.
Criminal force is defined in s 350 of the Penal Code as follows: 
 
Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person`s consent, in order to cause the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force illegally to cause, or knowing it to be likely that by the use of such force he will illegally cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the force is used, is said to use criminal force to that other.
 
 
 
Section 352 provides the punishment for use of criminal force where there are no aggravating circumstances as follows: 
 
Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person, otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation given by that person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine which may extend to $500, or with both.
 
 
 
An appellate court, in an appeal against conviction, may alter the finding of the lower court: s 256(b)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The question I have to consider is whether in this case I should substitute the conviction for an offence under s 336 with an offence under s 352 of the Penal Code.
There are two main tests required in the exercise of the appellate court`s power to alter a finding. First, the facts must be such that the substituted charge was available from the start and could have been framed and tried concurrently under s 172 of the Criminal Procedure Code; secondly, the evidence must have been presented in such a way as to raise all the same issues of fact as would have been raised had the substituted charge been framed and trial claimed on it. Not only must the evidence for the prosecution be the same but the court must be satisfied that the evidence for the defence would also have been the same: per Taylor J in 
 Lew Cheok Hin v R 
 
 
 
[1956] MLJ 131
 .
In the present case, the offence which the appellant was convicted was that he did a negligent act which endangered the personal safety of others. But the evidence adduced by the prosecution showed that the appellant did the act deliberately and not negligently. The defence was essentially a complete denial of the fact that he did reverse his motor car EY 6543U into PW6`s motor car. As such, no defence of grave and sudden provocation could have been raised. The appellant could have been convicted by the trial court for the offence under s 352 of the Penal Code of using criminal force: s 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
I substitute the conviction to one under s 352 of the Penal Code and maintain the sentence of four weeks` imprisonment.
The sentence of four weeks` imprisonment in the circumstances of this case is not manifestly excessive. The conduct of the appellant smacked of hooliganism. Such outrageous conduct on the part of motorists should be curbed and merits a deterrent sentence of imprisonment.
As regards the second charge, it is submitted that the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in convicting the appellant under s 182 of the Penal Code when the appellant had raised a doubt in the prosecution`s case.
Counsel for the appellant`s argument is that in his report ex P4, the appellant had made a traffic accident report that his car was collided onto the rear by PW6`s car and that this report is supported by PW4, the lorry driver, who stated in his police report ex P6 that he stopped at the slip road of Marymount Road and Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 because there was an accident between vehicle EY 6543U and another vehicle and who, in answer to the question of counsel for the appellant, had said that it did occur to him that an accident had occurred earlier because he saw them having a dispute and that it was a minor accident.
It is submitted, that the learned magistrate had failed to take the evidence of PW4 into consideration when he convicted the appellant of the offence under s 182. It is argued that the appellant reported only about the first collision and it is submitted that the prosecution had failed to prove that the information in the appellant`s report was false and has also failed to prove positively that the appellant knew the police report ex P4 to be false. It is argued that s 182 makes punishable the positive act of giving false information, it does not make the act of withholding of information an offence. It is submitted that the appellant could not be convicted of an offence under s 182 for failing to report that he had reversed his car to collide onto PW6`s car.
Counsel for the appellant has put up an ingenious argument but on the facts of the case, it is without substance. The learned magistrate had accepted the evidence of PW6 and clearly there was no `first collision` as alleged by the appellant. The lorry driver did not see what happened earlier. He came upon a scene where two vehicles had stopped and the drivers were having a dispute, naturally he presumed that there had been an accident.
On the evidence, it is clear that the appellant had made a false report alleging that it was PW6`s car that collided onto the rear of his car, when in truth it was he who reversed his car and deliberately collided onto PW6`s car.
The sentence of two weeks` imprisonment, in the circumstances of this case, is not manifestly excessive. In fact, the learned magistrate had been lenient. The learned magistrate could have made the sentences to run consecutively. The offence is serious, the report misled the police and it was made maliciously to put the blame on PW6.
The sentence is to run concurrently with the sentence of four weeks` imprisonment for the offence under s 352 of the Penal Code.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The plaintiff was at the material time an employee of the second defendant, who was a scaffolding sub-contractor of SA Shee & Co Pte Ltd; the first defendant was the owner of a site, on which the building, now known as Peninsula Plaza, was being constructed, and SA Shee & Co Pte Ltd was engaged by, the first defendant as the main contractor in the construction of the building. On 8 August 1979, while the plaintiff was working at the construction site, tying poles with rattan on the third floor of the partially completed building, a brick fell from the upper floors and landed on his head, and in consequence he sustained very serious injuries. He brought this action against the defendants for damages for negligence.
His claim against the second defendant was simple and straightforward. The second defendant was his employer and he claimed against him, the second defendant, for failing to provide a safe and proper system of work and exposing him to the risk of damage and injury. The second defendant entered an appearance, but did not defend the claim, and interlocutory judgment was entered against him with damages to be assessed. The solicitors then acting for the plaintiff applied for damages to be assessed and damages were assessed at $209,920; final judgment for this amount was entered against the second defendant. This judgment has not been satisfied and the second defendant`s whereabouts are unknown.
The plaintiff now pursues his claim against the first defendant as the owner and the occupier of the construction site (the premises), and in his statement of claim he avers that the first defendant was negligent in the following respects: in failing to take reasonable care to see that the plaintiff would be reasonably safe in using the premises; in failing to take any adequate or effective precautions to ensure that the brick from the upper floors of the building would not fall on him; in causing or permitting the premises to be in an unsafe and dangerous state, and lastly, in failing to discharge the common duty of care towards him.
The claim is resisted by the first defendant, and the defence is simply this: the first defendant had engaged SA Shee & Co Pte Ltd (the main contractor) to construct the building and had handed over to the main contractor possession of the premises, and at all material times the first defendant was not an occupier of the premises. Further, the first defendant avers that it had acted reasonably in entrusting the construction of the building to the main contractor and that the first defendant was not responsible to ensure the safety of the premises or the adequacy or effectiveness of precautions or measures taken against any risk or damage.
The facts are not very much in dispute. It is common ground that the first defendant was at the material time the owner of the site on which the building was then under construction, that it had engaged the main contractor under a building contract dated 20 October 1976 to carry out the construction, that possession of the premises had been handed to the main contractor, and that Alfred Wong & Partners were the architects of the first defendant in charge of the project. It is also common ground that at the time of the accident the second defendant was the scaffolding sub-contractor engaged by the main contractor and the plaintiff was an employee of the second defendant. At that time the main contractor was still carrying on construction works at the premises and the accident took place at that part of the premises abutting the service road at the rear. It was not suggested, and there was no evidence to the effect, that that part of the premises where the accident took place had been completed and possession thereof had been handed back by the main contractor to the first defendant.
It is argued on behalf of the plaintiff that the first defendant is liable to him on two grounds. First, at the material time the first defendant was the occupier of the premises and the plaintiff sustained injuries there at owing to the negligence of the first defendant. Secondly, at the material time the first defendant was the owner of the premises where activity was being carried out and the plaintiff suffered injuries as a result of the activity being negligently carried out there at.
In support of his claim on the first ground, the plaintiff relies on the provisions of the building contract made between the first defendant and the main contractor. The first defendant had engaged Alfred Wong & Partners as the architects to supervise the construction of the building and under various provisions of the contract the architects as the agent for the first defendant had extensive powers in relation to the works carried out by the main contractor. In particular, reliance is placed on the following conditions of the contract, namely:
 
 
(a) Condition 2(1) under which the main contractor had to comply with all reasonable instructions issued by the architect; 
 
(b) Condition 6(3) under which the architect may issue instructions requiring the main contractor to open up for inspection any work materials or goods or of any executed work; 
 
(c) Condition 6(4) which provides that the architects may issue instructions in regard to removal from the site of any work, material or goods, and 
 
(d) Condition 6(5) which empowers the architects to issue instructions requiring the dismissal from the works of any person employed thereon.
  
 
 
Counsel for the plaintiff also relies on the fact that the first defendant engaged supervisors to supervise the works: one site engineer to look after the mechanical and electrical works, one clerk-of-works to look after structural works and one clerk-of-works to look after the building works. It is argued on behalf of the plaintiff that in view of all these the first defendant did not cease to be in possession of the premises entirely and had retained sufficient control to make the first defendant the occupier of the premises. I am unable to accept this argument. Possession of the site was at the material time vested in the main contractor and it had control of the site and the building then under construction. According to Chew Meng Chong, DW2, possession was handed over to the main contractor on 9 June 1976 who took complete control of the site. The architects were engaged by the first defendant as professional advisers in the construction of the building and they were independent contractors and not servants of the first defendant. Plainly, the purpose of engaging the architects and the supervisors was to ensure the quality of workmanship and materials of the building and that the building was constructed by the main contractor in a workman-like manner and in accordance with the building contract. It was not suggested, and again there was no evidence, that apart from such supervision, they or any of them exercised any control of the premises. In these circumstances, it can hardly be said that the first defendant, as the owner of the premises, had through the architects and the supervisors retained any measure of control over the premises in consequence of which it remained as an occupier thereof.
Both counsel for the plaintiff and the first defendant relied on 
 Wheat v E Lacon & Co Ltd 
 
[1966] AC 552
 in support of their respective arguments. That case, in my view, is not of much assistance here, apart from some general observations made by Lord Denning on the term `occupier`. He said, at pp 578-579: 
 
In 
 Salmond On Torts
 14th Ed (1965), p 372, it is said that an `occupier` is `he who has the immediate supervision and control and the power of permitting or prohibiting the entry of other persons`. This definition was adopted by Roxburgh J in 
 Hartwell v Grayson, Rolls & Clover Docks Ltd
 [1947] KB 901 and by Diplock LJ in the present case. There is no doubt that a person who fulfils that test is an `occupier`. He is the person who says `come in`. But I think that test is too narrow by far. There are other people who are `occupiers` even though they do not say `come in`. If a person has any degree of control over the state of the premises it is enough. The position is best shown by examining the cases in four groups and one of the groups he gave was a situation where one employed an independent contractor to do work on premises or a structure. He said, at p 580:
 
 
 
Fourthly, where an owner employed an independent contractor to do work on premises or a structure, the owner was usually still regarded as sufficiently in control of the place as to be under a duty towards all those who might lawfully come there.
 
 
 
This dictum is an obiter and sets out in broad terms an instance where an owner of premises could be considered an occupier thereof. Much of course depends on the facts of a particular case. In this case, in my opinion, the facts cannot sustain a conclusion that the first defendant was at the material time an occupier of the premises.
Counsel for the plaintiff also relies on the case of 
 Lembaga Kemajuan Tanah Persekutuan v Mariam & Ors 
 
 
 
[1984] 1 MLJ 283
 . There, Felda, a statutory authority, entered into a written agreement with a contractor for weeding and maintenance of some land under a scheme in Pahang. The contract prohibited the contractor from sub-contracting any part of the work under the contract without the consent of Felda`s chairman. In breach of this clause the contractor sub-contracted the work to a sub-contractor who engaged workers to carry out the work. A kongsi- house was built for the workers so employed to live. One night the kongsi-house collapsed and a worker was killed. His dependants brought an action against Felda, the contractor and the sub-contractor. Both the contractor and the sub-contractor disappeared and the substantive defendant was undoubtedly Felda. The contract between Felda and the contractor provided, inter alia, that possession of the site was given to the contractor `as complete as may be reasonably possible but not so as to constitute a tenancy`. On the basis of this clause it was submitted on behalf of Felda that the contractor had exclusive possession of the land and Felda could not be an occupier so as to render it liable to the deceased. That argument was rejected and the Federal Court of Malaysia held that, having regard to the other provisions of the contract, which gave to Felda general control and supervision of the work of the contractor and also the well-being of the workers working in the scheme, Felda did not cease to be in possession of the land and was an occupier who had control over the land at the relevant time. The court also held that that was an agricultural contract and besides weeding, for which Felda had entered into the contract in question, there must be other works involved on the land, such as planting, replanting, earth work, and fertilizing. In the result, the court came to the conclusion that only such possession was given to the cont ractor `as was reasonably necessary for the purpose of weeding and maintaining the scheme`. That case is clearly distinguishable, and the facts here are entirely different. This is a building contract and to carry out the contract the main contractor must have, and was given, possession of the entire site and it had taken control of the site.
Even if I am wrong and the first defendant was at the material time an occupier of the premises, the first defendant, as the occupier, would still not be liable to the plaintiff. The duty owed by the first defendant to the plaintiff who was upon the premises as an invitee - in my opinion, he was an invitee - is to use reasonable care to prevent damage to him from unusual danger which the first defendant knew or ought to know. But the plaintiff was not injured by reason of any defective or unsafe physical condition of the premises. The plaintiff was injured by current operations at the premises, and the current operations were not carried out by the first defendant but by the main contractor or others on its behalf. It is therefore irrelevant whether or not the first defendant was at the material time an occupier of the premises.
I now turn to the next ground on which the plaintiff`s claim is founded, namely: the first defendant being owner of the premises was liable for damage caused by the current operations conducted at the premises. It is not disputed that the injuries sustained by the plaintiff were caused by current operations but these were being carried out at the said premises by or on behalf of the main contractor; the first defendant was merely the owner of the premises. If there was any negligence, such negligence was caused by or attributable to the main contractor or others on its behalf who caused the brick to fall on the plaintiff. The main contractor was an independent contractor and the first defendant cannot be vicariously liable to the plaintiff for any negligent act or omission of the main contractor in this case.
I did initially think that the cases of 
 Honeywill & Stein Ltd v Larkin Bros (London`s Commercial Photographers) Ltd 
 
[1934] 1 KB 191
 and 
 Bunker v Charles Brand & Son Ltd 
 
[1969] 2 QB 480
 might be applicable, and invited counsel to submit further arguments. However, on further consideration, I am satisfied that neither of them is really applicable. In the first case, the plaintiffs who were acoustic specialists had installed a sound reproduction apparatus in a theatre and subsequently obtained permission from the owner of the theatre to have photographs taken for their own business purposes, and they engaged the defendants to take the photographs. The defendants used flashlight to take the photographs which involved ignition of a certain amount of magnesium powder and that powder on being ignited flared up and developed intense heat and was dangerous to fabric and other inflammable material. The defendants in taking the photographs, ignited the magnesium powder near the curtain which caught fire and damage was caused. The plaintiffs paid to the owner of the theatre an amount to cover the cost of repair and claimed the same amount from the defendants. The defendants resisted the claim on the ground that the plaintiffs would have had a defence to the claim by the theatre owner on the ground that the damage was caused by the defendants who were independent contractors. It was held by the Court of Appeal in England that the plaintiffs were liable to the owner of the theatre for damage caused by the defendants, and that the work involved was of a dangerous character which imposed on them, the plaintiffs, an obligation to take special precaution and they could not avoid liability by engaging an independent contractor to carry it out. Slesser LJ, in delivering the judgment of the court said, at p 200: 
 
To take the photograph in the cinema with a flashlight was, on the evidence stated above, a dangerous operation in its intrinsic nature, involving the creation of fire and explosion on another person`s premises, that is in the cinema, the property of the cinema company. The appellants, in procuring this work to be performed by their contractors, the respondents, assumed an obligation to the cinema company which was, as we think, absolute, but which was at least an obligation to use reasonable precautions, to see that no damage resulted to the cinema company from these dangerous operations: that obligation they could not delegate by employing the respondents as independent contractors, but they were liable in this regard for the respondents` acts.
 
 
 
The factual situation here is entirely different. The first defendant was the owner of the site and engaged the main contractor to carry out thereon the construction of the building, and the main contractor, amongst other things, engaged the second defendant as the scaffolding subcontractor. The second defendant employed the plaintiff who was injured while working at the site. In these circumstances, vis-a-vis the plaintiff, there is no question of the first defendant being under such an absolute obligation as enunciated in the judgment of Slesser LJ. If there were such an obligation then every owner of a construction site would be liable to an employee, whether of the main contractor or sub-contractor, who is injured at the worksite. I cannot see how in ordinary circumstances such an owner can be held liable.
The second case of 
 Bunker v Charles Brand & Son Ltd 
 
[1969] 2 QB 480
 is also not applicable. There, the main contractor of a tube tunnel engaged a specialist sub-contractor to carry out certain work in the tunnel and an employee of the latter was injured at work in the tunnel. He claimed against the main contractor for damages for breach of duty under the Occupiers` Liability Act 1957. O`Conner J held, inter alia, that the main contractor remained occupier of the tunnel and that control of the tunnel remained in the main contractor through its responsible officials. That decision therefore turned on the facts of the case and the provisions of the Occupiers` Liability Act 1957.
In my view, the injuries sustained by the plaintiff were caused by the current operations carried out by or on behalf of the main contractor or by the unsafe system of work provided by the second defendant as the employer, or by both. In either case, the first defendant is not liable, even if it can be said to be an occupier of the premises. In this connection, the recent case of 
 Ferguson v Welsh & Ors 
 
[1987] 1 WLR 1553
 is of some assistance. There, a district council engaged a contractor to demolish a building on a site owned by the council. The contractor in turn engaged a sub-contractor to carry out the work and in the course of the demolition an employee of the subcontractor was injured owing to the unsafe system of work provided by the sub-contractor. It was held that the council, though an occupier of the site, was not liable either under the Occupiers` Liability Act 1957 or at common law. Lord Keith, in his speech, said at p 1560: 
 
The absence of safety arose directly out of the system of work adopted by the Welsh brothers, and the nature of the instructions given by them to Mr Ferguson as to how he should go about performing his work for them. It would be going a very long way to hold that an occupier of premises is liable to the employee of an independent contractor engaged to do work on the premises in respect of dangers arising not from the physical state of the premises but from an unsafe system of work adopted by the contractor.
 
 
 
Lord Goff went further. He said, at p 1564: 
 
I wish to add that I do not, with all respect, subscribe to the opinion that the mere fact that an occupier may know or have reason to suspect that the contractor carrying out work on his building may be using an unsafe system of work can of itself be enough to impose upon him a liability under the Occupiers` Liability Act 1957, or indeed in negligence at common law, to an employee of the contractor who is thereby injured, even if the effect of using that unsafe system is to render the premises unsafe and thereby to cause the injury to the employee. I have only to think of the ordinary householder who calls in an electrician; and the electrician sends in a man who, using an unsafe system established by his employer, creates a danger in the premises which results in his suffering injury from burns. I cannot see that, in ordinary circumstances, the householder should be held liable under the Occupiers` Liability Act 1957, or even in negligence, for failing to tell the man how he should be doing his work. I recognize that there may be special circumstances which may render another person liable to the injured man together with his employer, as when they are, for some reason, joint tortfeasors; but such a situation appears to me to be quite different.
 
 
 
For all these reasons, the plaintiff`s claim against the first defendant fails and is dismissed with costs.

Refusal of appellate court to interfere with award unless error in principle
 
The respondent is a young Indian girl who, while on a visit to Singapore, was injured by a taxi driven by the appellant. She was ten years old at the time of the accident and her right eye was so severely injured that she has lost the sight of that eye. The learned trial judge found the appellant solely to blame and awarded a global sum of $50,000 as general damages for the loss of sight of the right eye, pain and suffering and loss of her marriage prospects.
The appellant now appeals against the award of $50,000 general damages. It is settled law that an appellate court should not interfere with an award of damages unless it is satisfied that the judge has acted on a wrong principle of law, or has misapprehended the facts, or has for these or other reasons made a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage suffered; or unless the amount is so grossly excessive or insufficient as to lead to the conclusion that some error in principle must have taken place (see 
 Pickett v 
 
 British Rail Engineering 
 
[1980] AC 136
).
During the trial the respondent`s counsel submitted that she should be awarded $35,000 for the injury to the right eye, pain and suffering and loss of amenities and $15,000 to $25,000 for loss of marriage prospects. Counsel for the appellant submitted that the award for the eye injury, pain and suffering and loss of amenities should not exceed $30,000 and $3,500 for loss of marriage prospects.
In his grounds of decision the learned judge accepted the evidence that although payment of dowry is illegal in India, dowry is now given but in the form of a gift to the bridegroom and that the respondent on attaining marriageable age would find it difficult to get a husband unless her parents agree to make a substantial gift which her father `estimated would be 50% to 100% more than if she had not been blinded in one eye`. In his grounds of decision the learned judge merely indicated that he took into consideration in awarding the global sum, a High Court award in Suit No 3760 of 1979 of $28,000 to a 51-year-old taxi driver for loss of his right eye.
It is the contention of appellant that it must be inferred from his grounds of decision that the learned judge had in mind $28,000 as the appropriate damages for the loss of the sight of the right eye and that therefore he assessed the respondent`s loss of marriage prospects at $22,000. From that inference it is submitted that the learned judge erred in principle by approximating the loss of marriage prospects with the concept of the payment of dowry or the making of a gift to the bridegroom by the bride`s parents.
On the assumption that the trial judge erred in principle in any way or has acted on a wrong principle of law the question remains whether the appellant has satisfied this court that the amount of the global award was grossly excessive or a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage suffered by the respondent. In our judgment he has failed to do so. It is to be observed that the unchallenged medical evidence was that she suffered severe injuries to her right eye which necessitated toilet and suture. The injuries were: 
 
(1) Total hyphaema
 
 
 
 
(2) Scleral laceration extending from the limbus at 3 o`clock all the way back to the equator medially; another scleral laceration from 9 o`clock limbus extending for about 4 mm. 
 
(3) The right upper eyelid was shredded with full thickness lacerations, 
 
(4) The right lower lid had a laceration along the rim.
  
 
 
The medical evidence also was that the injured eye showed signs of shrinkage three months after the accident and that she may occasionally suffer severe pain in that eye.
At the trial the judge`s attention was drawn to awards made in three cases for the loss of an eye. In Suit No 3753 of 1975 the plaintiff, a 27-year-old church verger and gardener was awarded $24,500 for the loss of the left eye. In Suit No 2667 of 1976, a 21-year-old painter was awarded, by agreement, $25,000 for the loss of the right eye. In Suit No 3760 of 1979, a 51-year-old taxi driver was awarded $28,000 for the loss of the right eye and this was the only award the trial judge referred to in his grounds of decision.
In our opinion, bearing in mind that the respondent was a ten year old girl who had suffered severe eye injuries and the consequential loss of her right eye, the trial judge in arriving at the global sum of $50,000, in all probability had in mind a figure of not less than $40,000 for the loss of the respondent`s right eye, pain and suffering and loss of amenities. In any event, the award of $50,000 was not, in our judgment, such a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage suffered by the respondent as a result of the appellant`s negligence and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.

The first plaintiff, an infant, was knocked down and injured by a motor lorry, no YA 9087D, at Sungei Tengah Road on 15 January 1981. The lorry at the material time was driven by the defendant. Suing by his father and next friend, he brought this action against the defendant claiming damages for negligence; joined as the second plaintiff is his father who claimed damages for loss and expenses incurred on account of the injuries sustained by the first plaintiff. At the time of the accident, the first plaintiff was eight years old and he lived with his parents at 96 Sungei Tengah Road in Chua Chu Kang. He said that on that day, at about 11.00am, he left his house to catch a bus to go to school. He had to cross the road and before he crossed he looked at both sides, left and right, and saw no vehicle approaching; he then walked across the road. When he reached the other side of the road he was knocked down and lost consciousness. He said that when he was knocked down he was standing on the grass verge and not on the road; he was not facing the lorry and the nearside front part of the lorry hit him.
The appeal arises from a claim made in the district court by the appellants against the respondent for damages for negligence arising out of a road accident in which the first appellant, a young boy, was knocked down and injured by a lorry driven by the respondent. At the conclusion of the hearing in the district court, on the two versions of the accident before him, that of the first appellant and the respondent, the learned district judge found that the respondent`s version was the more probable one and dismissed the appellants` claim. Against that decision, the appellants appealed to the High Court. T Kulasekaram J also dismissed the appeal, this time on the ground that the respondent was not travelling at an excessive speed at the time of the accident and was not in any way negligent. It is against this decision that the appeal has been brought.
The claims were resisted by the defendant; he denied any negligence on his part. He said that on that day he was driving his lorry along Sungei Tengah Road; he was on the left side of the road and was travelling slowly - 40 mph, he said. As he was approaching the spot, where the accident took place, he suddenly saw a boy, iethe first plaintiff, rushing across the road followed by a girl; the first plaintiff was only 11/2 m away from him. He applied his brakes and swerved the lorry to the left, but was unable to avoid colliding with the first plaintiff. According to him, the right front part of his lorry hit the first plaintiff.
The case was tried before the district court and at the conclusion of the hearing, the learned district judge held that the defendant was not negligent and dismissed the claim. Against that decision the plaintiffs appealed to the High Court which dismissed the appeal; the learned judge held that the defendant was not travelling at an excessive speed at the time of the accident and was not in any way negligent. Against that decision this appeal is now brought.
The main thrust of the appeal is directed towards the findings of fact made by the learned district judge. The learned district judge recounted the two versions of the accident as given by the first plaintiff and the defendant respectively, and then posed the following questions: `The question was who was negligent? Was it the infant plaintiff or the defendant?` The learned district judge then proceeded with his examination of the first plaintiff`s and the defendant`s versions of the accident and came to the conclusion that the defendant`s version of the accident on the balance of probabilities was true and on that basis he found that the defendant was not negligent.
On this approach adopted by the learned district judge in arriving at his finding we have two observations. First, it seems to us that it is more appropriate to approach the matter with the question: was the defendant negligent? If the defendant was not negligent, then that would conclude the matter. If the defendant was negligent, the next question is: was there any contributory negligence on the part of the first plaintiff? Secondly, in a case such as the present one, it is not really a question of accepting the defendant`s version of the accident in preference to that of the first plaintiff. The first plaintiff, at the time of the accident, was only eight years old, and at the time of the trial was about ten years old. Obviously, not much weight really can be attached to his evidence as regards how the accident happened; in particular, his evidence that he was knocked down when he was on the grass verge and that it was the front nearside of the lorry that hit him could not be accepted, in view of the incontrovertible evidence that the front offside of the lorry was damaged and that blood stains were found on the road. As a matter of inference, the first plaintiff must have been hit by this part of the lorry and at the time of the impact he must have been on the road. However, having rejected the first plaintiff`s evidence, the learned district judge in our view should then have considered the evidence of the defendant and other evidence, both sworn and documentary, to determine whether the defendant was negligent. Now, the really substantive part of the evidence of the defendant is the following, given in examination-in-chief: 
 
On 15 January 1981 I was driving lorry No YA 9087D along Sungei Tengah Road going towards Chua Chu Kang. I was on the left side of the road. I don`t know how far from the grass I was driving. I horned. I saw nobody in front. I was travelling at 40mph. I never looked. I don`t know whether on my lorry it`s kmh or mph. I was travelling slowly. I went up. I saw a boy. I could not - but I swerved, went to left to the grass. The boy ran. I can`t see. He ran very fast. I could not see. He ran from here. (Indicates from right to left.) When the boy ran I was about this distance away.
 
 
 
(
 Court:
 About 11/2 metres away). When I saw boy running I applied my brakes. I could not stop. I swerved to left and went to the grass. I turned fast. I applied brakes and turned. When I hit the boy, I was already on the grass.
 
 
 
(Witness is asked to draw rough sketch. Witness draws sketch - admitted and marked D5.)
 
 
 
I hit the boy in front on the right front of my vehicle. The right front of my lorry was damaged. (Witness is shown D1 to D3.) The front right portion of my lorry, the van, hit the boy above the lights. When lorry stopped, I came down. I saw a small girl, I think the boy`s sister. This girl was running behind the boy.
 
 
 
Purely on the basis of the defendant`s evidence the learned district judge found that the defendant was not negligent. He said: 
 
Accepting the defendant`s evidence as correct, I could not see how he could be said to be negligent. He was not speeding. He said he negotiated a bend before reaching the spot where the collision occurred. His view to the front was obstructed by thick vegetation on the side of the road and he sounded his horn. All of a sudden the infant plaintiff dashed across the road about 11/2 metres away to his front. He jammed on his brakes and swerved left to avoid colliding into the infant plaintiff. Having regard to the circumstances what the defendant did was what that could be expected of a reasonable driver. He was certainly not negligent.
 
 
 
The defendant`s evidence is not the whole of the evidence to be considered. There is the evidence of PW1, the police sergeant, who arrived at the scene soon after the accident. He took measurements and drew a sketch plan of the scene of the accident which was accepted without any challenge. According to him, at the stretch of road where the accident took place there is a slight bend to the left; the road slopes slightly upwards and then downwards. The sketch plan shows a narrow road with a width of about 4m 10cm and also shows long tyre marks starting from points `J` and `K` leading to the point `H` where the vehicle came to a standstill and the length is 17m 20cm. The telltale sign here is clearly the tyre marks, which are indicative that the defendant must have seen the first plaintiff and applied his brakes at the spot approximately just before his lorry reached the points `J` and `K` ; it is from these points the tyre marks appear. The lorry did not appear to have stopped until it reached the points `G` and `H` with about three quarters of its length on the bushes. According to PW 1, the bushes are about two to three feet high. It is clear to us that the bushes played an important part in bringing the lorry to a halt.
On this evidence, it is necessary to consider the question whether the defendant was driving the lorry at an excessive speed in the circumstances. According to him, he was driving the lorry at 40mph though he subsequently attempted to qualify it by saying that he did not know whether the speedometer in his lorry recorded the speed in kilometre or mile; but he is a driver by occupation. At any rate, this speed was accepted by his counsel in his closing submission. The learned district judge found that the defendant was not speeding. It is not clear to us, however, whether the learned district judge was of the view that the lorry travelling at 40mph was not speeding or that the lorry was travelling at a speed less than 40mph and therefore was not speeding. Whatever might be the speed at which the lorry was travelling, the question still is whether it was travelling at an excessive speed in the circumstances. The stretch of road is a rural road with a width of four m ten cm and with bushes of two to three feet high on the left and trees and vegetables on the right and has a slight bend to the left. The defendant said that he sounded the horn; that indicates that he was expecting either vehicles or pedestrians along the road. In these circumstances, he ought to slow down and drive at a speed at which he could take effective avoiding action should something untoward happen in front of him, as it did. According to him, as he was negotiating the bend, all of a sudden, the first plaintiff dashed across the road, from right to left, about 11/2 metres away in front of him. This piece of evidence is inherently incredible. The first plaintiff could not suddenly appear from nowhere and dash across the road. The defendant must have seen him at a distance of more than 11/2 metres away in view of the tyre marks, which start from the points `J` and `K`. According to him, when the lorry collided with the first plaintiff it was on the side of the grass verge, which means that he must have collided with the first plaintiff at a point near `H`. That is the point at which he swerved his vehicle to the left. So, at the time when he saw the first plaintiff running across the road, the latter must have been at least ten meters away in front of his lorry; but he was not able to stop or swerve the lorry in time to avoid the collision. As a matter of inference, the defendant must have been driving his lorry at the speed which was excessive in the circumstances. We are therefore of the view that the defendant was negligent in the driving of his lorry at the material time.
We now turn to consider the question whether the first plaintiff was guilty of any contributory negligence. He was at the time of the accident eight years old. Notwithstanding his young age, it is necessary to consider whether in the circumstances he had failed to exercise reasonable care expected of him in his situation. The road where the accident happened is a rural road and at the material time the defendant`s lorry was the only vehicle travelling along there. The first plaintiff was on his way to school. According to him, he looked around to see if there was any traffic before he started to cross the road to catch a bus. He must have been familiar with the road. He must have heard, if he had not seen, the lorry coming; particularly if the defendant sounded the horn. In the circumstances of this case, we think that the first plaintiff, though a young child of eight years old, cannot be regarded as too young to be incapable of contributory negligence; he can be expected to exercise reasonable care of not running across the road in the path of an oncoming lorry; he ought reasonably to have foreseen the danger. In our opinion, he was partly to blame for the accident and there was contributory negligence on his part. In view of his young age, we apportion the liability as follows: two-thirds thereof to the defendant and one-third to the first plaintiff.
The second plaintiff claimed against the defendant the sum of $1,453 as special damages incurred on account of the injuries sustained by the first plaintiff. These are loss and expenses of the first plaintiff and not the second plaintiff. The second plaintiff has no cause of action against the defendant. In 
 Donnelly v Joyce 
 
[1974] 1 QB 454
 the Court of Appeal, in England awarded as special damages to the infant plaintiff: (i) travelling expenses of the parents to and from hospital. (ii) costs of special socks and boots and (iii) loss of wages incurred by the plaintiff`s mother while caring for the plaintiff. The third item was attacked on appeal. It was argued that the loss was that of the mother and not the plaintiff and there was no legal obligation on the part of the plaintiff to reimburse her. The Court of Appeal in response to such argument said, at pp 461-462: 
 
We do not agree with the proposition, inherent in Mr Hamilton`s submission, that the plaintiff`s claim, in circumstances such as the present, is properly to be regarded as being, to use his phrase, `in relation to someone else`s loss`, merely because someone else has provided to, or for the benefit of, the plaintiff - the injured person - the money, or the services to be valued as money, to provide for needs of the plaintiff directly caused by the defendant`s wrongdoing. The loss is the plaintiff`s loss. The question from what source the plaintiff`s needs have been met, the question who has paid the money or given the services, the question whether or not the plaintiff is or is not under a legal or moral liability to repay are, so far as the defendant and his liability are concerned, all irrelevant.
 
 
 
The plaintiff`s loss, to take this present case, is not the expenditure of money to buy the special boots or to pay for the nursing attention. His loss is the existence of the need for those special boots or for those nursing services, the value of which for purposes of damages - the purpose of the ascertainment of the amount of his loss - is the proper and reasonable cost of supplying those needs. That, in our judgment, is the key to the problem. So far as the defendant is concerned, the loss is not someone else`s loss. It is the plaintiff`s loss.
Hence it does not matter, so far as the defendant`s liability to the plaintiff is concerned, whether the needs have been supplied by the plaintiff out of his own pocket or by a charitable contribution to him from some other person whom we shall call the `provider`; it does not matter, for that purpose, whether the plaintiff has a legal liability absolute or conditional, to pay to the provider what he has received, because of the general law or because of some private agreement between himself and the provider; it does not matter whether he has a moral obligation, however, ascertained or defined, so to do. The question of legal liability to reimburse of the provider may be very relevant to the question of the legal right of the provider to recover from the plaintiff. That may depend on the nature of the liability imposed by the general law or the particular agreement. But it is not a matter which affects the right of the plaintiff against the wrongdoer.
Hence, in the instant case, the loss and expenses set out in the statement of claim, if proved, are those of the first plaintiff and he is entitled to recover them in this action; they arose out of his need for the services which in this case were paid for by the second plaintiff. But the second plaintiff has no cause of action against the defendant and ought not to have been joined in the first place. His appeal is therefore dismissed.
We now make the following orders: we set aside the parts of the orders made by the District Court and the High Court insofar as they relate to the claim and appeal of the first plaintiff; an interlocutory judgment is to be entered for the first plaintiff and, the case be sent back to the district court for damages to be assessed and, when assessed, be apportioned in the proportions we have decided and final judgment be entered accordingly. The first plaintiff is to have his costs here and below. As regards the dismissal of the appeal of the second plaintiff, we disallow the costs thereof to the defendant; the argument advanced successfully in resisting the appeal of the second plaintiff was never raised in the courts below. There will be the usual consequential order for the refund of the plaintiffs or their solicitors of the amount deposited as security for costs of the defendant.
The first appellant was at the time of the accident eight years old. He lived with his parents along a rural road at No 96 Sungei Tengah Road in Chua Chu Kang. To go to school he has to cross the road to catch the school bus. He said that on 15 January 1981 at about 11 am he came out of his house, looked and saw no traffic on the road, and then walked across the road. He was sure he did not run across the road. When he got to the other side of the road, he was knocked down and lost consciousness. At that time he was standing on the grass verge and not on the road. He was not facing the lorry. His left thigh was injured. In cross-examination he first said that the nearside front part of the lorry hit him; later he said he was not aware that he was knocked down by a lorry. In answer to the court, he said he was alone that day.
The respondent`s version was as follows: 
 
On 15 January 1981 I was driving lorry No YA 9087D along Sungei Tengah Road going towards Chua Chu Kang. I was on the left side of the road. I don`t know how far from the grass I was driving. I horned. I saw nobody in front. I was travelling at 40 mph. I never looked. I don`t know whether on my lorry it`s kmph or mph. I was travelling slowly. I went up. I saw a boy. I could not - but I swerved, went to left to the grass. The boy ran, I can`t see. He ran very fast. I could not see. He ran from here. (Indicates from right to left.) When the boy ran I was about this distance away.
 
 
 
(
 Court:
 About 11/2 metres away.) When I saw boy running I applied my brakes, I could not stop. I swerved to left and went to the grass. I turned very fast. I applied brakes and turned. When I hit the boy, I was already on the grass.
 
 
 
...
I hit the boy in front on the right front of my vehicle. The right front of my lorry was damaged. The front right portion of my lorry, the van, hit the boy above the lights. When lorry stopped, I came down. I saw a small girl, I think the boy`s sister. This girl was running behind the boy.
...
I horned and I went ahead. On the right side of the road there were trees, vegetables. There was small road on right. I could not see this small road.
What the boy said is not true, he was not standing when I collided into him.
The respondent was unshaken in his cross-examination; in answer to questions, he explained further as follows: 
 
Q: How many times did you horn?
 
 
 
 
A: One time only. 
 
Q: Why did you want to horn? 
 
A: I thought car coming from other side. Cars can come up and down. It was at corner, bend, I horned. 
 
Q: Why swerve left? 
 
A: I braked. The boy ran. I turned left. I could not stop. That`s why I swerved left. 
 
Q: Why did you not swerve right? 
 
A: If I turned right he would die.
  
 
 
In considering these two versions, the learned district judge who heard the case said in his grounds of judgment: `The question was who was negligent? Was it the infant plaintiff or the defendant?` He then analysed the evidence before him.
The learned district judge observed that the respondent was a naive and simple person. He had attended school up to primary five but had only passed primary three. He was not articulate in speech, and appeared to be a dull person. On the respondent`s version of the accident, the learned district judge said: 
 
He was not speeding. He said he negotiated a bend before reaching the spot where the collision occurred. His view to the front was obstructed by thick vegetation on the side of the road and he sounded his horn. All of a sudden the infant plaintiff dashed across the road about 11/2 metres away to his front. He jammed on his brakes and swerved left to avoid colliding into the infant plaintiff. Having regard to the circumstances what the defendant did was what that could be expected from a reasonable driver. He was certainly not negligent.
 
 
 
The learned district judge also found that the respondent`s version was supported by independent evidence. The police sergeant who inspected the lorry soon after the accident saw the offside front signal light cracked and the offside front portion near the cracked signal light dented. The damage to the lorry was consistent with the evidence of the respondent that when the impact took place the first appellant was on the offside of the lorry and not on the nearside as alleged by him. The police also found bloodstains on the road which put beyond doubt that the first appellant was hit by the lorry when he was running across the road and not whilst he was standing on the grass verge.
At the hearing of the appeal, the submission for the appellants was that the respondent was driving at an excessive speed that day. Counsel relied on the evidence-in-chief of the respondent that he was travelling at 40mph (approximately 64kmh). He said that that speed was in excess of both the maximum authorised speed of the lorry and the speed limit along Sungei Tengah, which in each case was 50kmh.
I cannot accept this submission. It is not correct to say that the respondent was driving the lorry at 40mph. As I read the record of evidence, the respondent did not know at what speed he was travelling. It was only his estimate that he was doing 40mph. The evidence of 40 mph, referred to by counsel, has been taken out of the context of the evidence of the respondent which was as follows: 
 
I was travelling at 40mph. I never looked. I do not know whether on my lorry it is kmh or mph. I was travelling slowly.
 
 
 
This evidence of the respondent must be considered with his other evidence on which the learned district judge found as a fact that the respondent `was not speeding`. On a review of the evidence in the High Court, T Kulasekaram J concluded that the respondent was not travelling at an excessive speed that day. Here, one must recall that just before the accident the respondent was travelling along a rural road; he had negotiated a bend to the left with the road sloping upwards; he saw thick vegetation in front of him on the side of the road; he sounded his horn to warn others of his approach; and whatever was the speed, he was travelling slowly. Taking the totality of the evidence, I am of the view that there was ample evidence before the learned district judge who heard and saw the respondent give evidence to find, as he did, that the respondent was not speeding.
Next, even if the respondent was travelling at about 40mph, that by itself is not an act of negligence, though it would be an element to prove negligence. On the facts that the first appellant ran across the road, that the respondent suddenly came upon the first appellant at the top of the slope of the road, that he jammed the brakes and swerved the lorry to the left and not to the right to avoid the first appellant, all prove, to my mind, that the respondent had full control of the lorry. I agree with T Kulasekaram J that the respondent was not in any way negligent.
Another ground of appeal was that the learned district judge had failed to properly consider the length of the brake marks of the lorry and had failed to draw the proper inferences from them. The complaint was that the evidence of the respondent was inconsistent with the evidence of the brake marks in that if the respondent had swerved as he claimed, then the curve of the brake marks would be more pronounced than shown on the sketch plan.
The brake marks shown on the sketch plan are 17m (approximately 56 feet) in length. They trace the path of the lorry from the road to the grass verge; admittedly, they are not markedly curved. But the markings on a sketch plan are only rough estimates. On this sketch plan, it is to be noted that the tyre marks of the lorry at `J` and `K` start about 25 feet away from `C` and `D` which denote the `edges of entrance to house`. Though there is no evidence of it, it is reasonable to infer that this is the house where the first appellant lived with his parents. It is also to be noted that the lorry came to a stop, about another 25 feet away from `C` and `D`. To my mind, these facts support the case for the respondent that the first appellant came out of the house and dashed across the road. It may be that he heard the sound of the horn and thought that it was his school bus.
Then again, as regards the tyre marks of 56 feet, they indicate that the respondent could not have been driving his lorry at 40 mph as the overall stopping distance would then have been about 120 feet. The tyre marks show that at the material time the respondent was driving his lorry at about 25mph: see the Highway Code in England referred to in 
 Bingham`s 
 
 Motor Claims Cases 
 (9th Edn) 1986 at p 121. Here, it is relevant to recall the evidence of the respondent that he did not know whether the speedometer of his lorry recorded the speed in mph or in kmh and, his further evidence, that at the material time he did not look at the speedometer and had only estimated that he was travelling at 40 which the learned district judge recorded as `mph`. Bearing in mind that we in Singapore had converted to metric years ago, it was most improbable that the speedometer of the lorry was in mph. I am of the view that the evidence in the record is consistent with the respondent travelling at 40kmh, ieabout 25mph, and not that he was doing 40mph. So, on the sketch plan, the conclusion I come to is that the tyre marks corroborate the evidence of the respondent that he was not speeding that day. I would not therefore disturb the concurrent findings of the courts below.
As I view this appeal, the real issue is where did the accident occur. In this regard, the issue is not dissimilar to the issue that was before the Privy Council in 
 Muthusamy v Ang Nam Cheow 
 
 
 [1978-1979] SLR 25 
. In that case: 
 
The appellant said it occurred on his side of the road near the broken centre white line when the motorcycle shot across the road. At first the respondent said it occurred when he was three to four feet on the main road after passing the stop sign, that is on the appellant`s side of the road, but he later changed his story and said it occurred after he had crossed the broken centre white line implying that the appellant went to the wrong side of the road and collided into him.
 
 
 
This court allowed the appeal on the ground that 
 
the trial judge was wrong in his finding that the accident occurred after the respondent had crossed the broken centre white line and had straightened his motorcycle and that it was a head on collision.
 
 
 
The Privy Council in turn allowed the appeal and restored the decision of the trial judge. The Board said: 
 
It is of course true to say that an appeal to a court of appeal is a rehearing of the case. But much authority goes to show that such a court is, and indeed should be, much fettered in practice in its ability to disagree with findings of a trial judge in matters of this kind, particularly when they are restricted to the judge`s notes of the evidence given, and given through an interpreter, and particularly when the judge has formed the opinion from the manner in which one of the parties has given his evidence that he was lying.
 
 
 
Another approach to this appeal would be to consider whether the appellants have proved the case on a balance of probabilities. Here, I am reminded of the words of Lord Diplock in 
 Mahon v 
 
 Air New Zealand 
[1984] AC 808
: 
 
Where facts are in dispute in civil litigation conducted under the common law system of procedure, the judge has to decide where, on the balance of probabilities, he thinks that the truth lies as between the evidence which the parties to the litigation have thought it to be in their respective interests to adduce before him. He has no right to travel outside that evidence on an independent search on his own part for the truth; and if the parties` evidence is so inconclusive as to leave him uncertain where the balance between the conflicting probabilities lies, he must decide the case by applying the rules as to the onus of proof in civil litigation.
 
 
 
In the present case, at the close of the appellants` case, on the evidence of the first appellant that he was standing on the grass verge when he was collided into by the lorry, the learned district judge found that a prima faciecase had been made that he heard the defence. On the respondent`s version of the accident that the first appellant suddenly dashed across the road that he had to jam his brakes and swerve to the left, at the close of the whole case, the learned district judge was bound to consider on a balance of probabilities the evidence of the two versions before him. He rejected the case for the appellants. I am of the opinion that the learned district judge had correctly applied the `rules as to onus of proof` when he dismissed the appellants` claim. For the reasons I have given, I would dismiss this appeal.

ss 109 & 406 Penal Code (Cap 224)
 
This is an appeal against the sentence imposed by Lai Kew Chai J on a plea of guilty by the appellant to a charge of abetting a director of a public listed company, Pan Electric Industries (Pan-El), who was also a director of other companies which are subsidiaries of Pan El in the commission of the offence of criminal breach of trust. The charge related to breach of trust in respect of $144,852.88 which was the interest due to a stockbroking company in connection with the acquisition of three million Grand United Holdings Ltd (GUH) shares for $4,778,895 by a Pan El subsidiary Orchard Hotel (S).
The sentence imposed on the appellant was one of two years` imprisonment and a fine of $500,000; the maximum sentence permissible under the law was one of three years` imprisonment and, so far as the fine is concerned, unlimited.
First, it is appropriate to state the principles upon which this court, as an appellate court, should act when considering an appeal as to the sentence imposed by a trial court. It is axiomatic that each case depends on its own facts. It is also an elementary principle that an appellate court can and will interfere if the sentence imposed was not justified by law. Mr Knight has referred us to a passage in Archbold, which we accept, setting out the principles upon which an appellate court acts.
One principle is that the court can interfere if it is satisfied that the sentencing judge has made the wrong decision as to the proper factual basis for sentence. In relation to this principle, it has not been shown to our satisfaction by Mr Karthigesu, who has related in detail the facts which were put before Lai Kew Chai J that he imposed the sentence on a basis other than the proper factual basis. It is to be observed that the facts set out in the statement of facts which was read out to the learned judge were unequivocably accepted by the appellant.
Another principle is that the court can interfere where it is satisfied that there has been an error on the part of the trial judge in appreciating the material placed before him. The judgment of the trial judge sets out fully, and in our opinion, accurately, the background facts which led to the charge against the appellant, which was a misuse of Pan El funds in circumstances which amounted to criminal breach of trust. The funds were used to create an artificial price for the shares of GUH. It was accepted by the learned judge that it was done for the personal benefit of the appellant.
It was the appellant who gave instructions to Tan Kok Liang to go into the open market and manipulate the market price of GUH shares and by raising the price, a result of which was favourable for the appellant. So we are not satisfied that the trial judge erred in any way in appreciating the material placed before him.
Also, having regard to the facts placed before Lai Kew Chai J which were undisputed by the appellant, the learned judge found that the offence was not an unpremeditated one in so far as the appellant was concerned.
Another principle is that the court can interfere if it is satisfied that the sentence was wrong in principle. This has not been shown, and in our opinion, the sentence was one which in no respect can be said to be wrong in principle.
The last principle which we need to refer to is that the court if satisfied that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive can interfere.
Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, in particular, having regard to the commercial matrix the background facts and the fact that the offence was committed in order to manipulate the market price of a publicly listed company in Singapore we are of the opinion that the sentence which the trial judge imposed - of two years` imprisonment and $500,000 fine - was not excessive, let alone manifestly excessive.
In the result, this appeal must be dismissed and the sentence affirmed.

The plaintiff, born in December 1953, joined his father`s firm as a clerk in 1976 on a salary of $200 per month. He married in 1976 and has one child born in December 1977. At the end of June 1981 when he was drawing a salary of $300 a month, he, to supplement his income, made arrangements with the defendants, who were and are running a factory at 20 Bedok South Road, Singapore for the manufacture of printed circuit boards (PCB) to work for them as a machine operator. He continued to work for his father at the same time.
On weekdays he was to work from Monday to Friday from 5.00pm to 11.00pm and on Saturdays from 12 noon to 5.30pm. Sundays were not working days for him but he could do so if he so desired in which event he would be paid double wages. He was a daily paid worker rated at $8.80 per day from Monday to Saturday. At the end of August 1985 his wages were to have been $9.26 per day.
He commenced work for the defendants on 1 July 1981 at 5.00pm as a machine operator. He was asked to observe the other machine operators working on their respective machines. After two hours of such observation he was asked to operate a machine. At the defendants` factory there were several of such machines. His job was to blank pieces of printed circuit boards (PCB see PB5) each of which had 14 segments. First of all he puts on gloves made of cloth and each of his wrists is then strapped to a pull away device but before so doing he would have preheated the PCB in the oven (see PB4). He then places the preheated PCB on to the die of the power press machine between the guide pins, which operates to hold the PCB in position. Now there are two press buttons one on each side of the PCB and they are about two to three inches (four fingers placed side by side) away from the die. If and when these two buttons are pressed simultaneously, but not otherwise, the punch ram which is about 10 inches above the die will move sharply in a downward direction and blank one of the segments of the PCB. Concurrent with the commencement of the descent of the punch the machine operates to draw the pull away device away from the area of the die and towards the operator. After blanking (punching) one of the segments of the PCB the punch ram returns automatically and immediately to its original position and remains there until the said two buttons are again pressed simultaneously. On its return to its original position the punch ram carries with it the blanked segment which falls from the punch ram soon after. Before it so falls off the operator would push the PCB to trap the blanked segment which is then put away. The operation is then started all over again by the simultaneous pushing of the said two buttons until all the 14 segments of the PCB are blanked. It will be noted that as the work progresses on the PCB it will be getting progressively shorter and the operator would have to adjust the PCB accordingly. When the opera tor gets to the last two segments of the PCB he can no longer use the board to retrieve the segments falling from the punch for which purpose the operator has to use one of his hands and in the case of the plaintiff it would be his right hand.
He continued doing the same work until 18 July 1981 which was a Saturday. He reported for duty at 12 noon. He worked on one of the machines at the factory until 3.00pm when he says he was given another machine to continue his work of blanking pieces of PCB (but this is not accepted by the defence. They say he only worked on one machine that day and that it was the machine on which the accident occurred).
I will now let the plaintiff tell, in his own words, what happened (pp 10 and 11 of notes of evidence): 
 
On 18 July 1981 just before the accident I was engaged on the last segment of the PCB. I placed the last segment in the guide pins on the die. I then depressed the two buttons simultaneously. The ram came down and punched the last segment adhering to the ram. The moment the ram came to a stop the last segment dropped. As it was dropping I placed my right hand below it in order to retrieve it. If I do not catch the segment before it falls it will drop onto the lower die. In this case I would still have to retrieve it with my right hand. While I was trying to retrieve the falling segment the ram came down suddenly and my fingers were crushed. (The ram was much larger than the size of the segment I was working on). I was surprised by this action.
 
 
 
For 18 days I had worked on machines like this but this was the first time that the ram came down without the two buttons being depressed. If I pressed one button accidentally the ram won`t go down. If the ram comes after I had depressed the two buttons but with me still holding onto the buttons the ram would not injure my fingers as the buttons are four or five inches away from the line of descent of the ram. The pull away device would give me a jerk in a backward direction. I can`t say how far back my hands would be pulled back. On that day I did not pay attention to the cord but I do remember the colour was not like these exh (P2 and D2). It looked like a soiled white rope. I did not tamper with the pull away device. It was set up by the company`s set-up man. On that day the pull away device had been set up by the set-up man. I was taken to St Mark`s Hospital. Report of Dr R Sundarason (PB37).
As a result of the accident the plaintiff suffered amputation of the right index finger, the right middle finger and the right ring finger and he now sues the defendants for injuries suffered by reason of the unsafe system of work/breach of statutory duty and/or negligence of the defendants their servants or agents.
 Liability 
There is no dispute as to how the accident occurred. It happened by the punch ram coming down on the plaintiff`s right hand without his having pressed the two buttons simultaneously while he was retrieving the last punched segment of the printed board. The defendants evidence is that even if the ram was to `double punch`, that is to say, the punch ram coming down twice in quick succession on just the single simultaneous push of the two buttons, the pull away safety device should and would come into operation simultaneously and pull the operator`s hand away from the die area and so prevent an accident. As I understood the evidence the safe system provided for by the plaintiff was that the machine itself would and should not double punch but if for any reason the machine became faulty and did in fact double punch then the final fall back position on to the pull away safety device would come into instant operation simultaneously with the commencement of the fault and thus pull away the hands of the operator from the danger of an accident. In the instant case we do know that there was a double punch. I accept the evidence of the plaintiff that the ram came down without his having pushed the two buttons simultaneously. I therefore in the circumstances of this case conclude that the machine became faulty and for some unknown reason did a double punch. In these circumstances the accident could still have been avoided had the pull away safety device functioned as it was intended to. But we do know that it did not function because of the fact of the injury to the plaintiff`s right hand. Why and how then did the pull away safety device fail? The defendants suggest, although they have no evidence to back it, that, perhaps, it was the plaintiff who had tampered with the device which resulted in its non function. On the other hand, the plaintiff categorically states that he did not tamper with the pull away device and he was not shaken on this although cross-examined by defence counsel. I accept the evidence of the plaintiff on this and reject the defendants suggestion particularly that of Ismail, the set-up man (DW4) that this accident could have been perhaps caused because the plaintiff had interfered with its safe operation. I therefore find the defendants liable for the accident in that they had not provided a safe system of work as required by law of a factory operator. In this I find support in the Industrial Officer`s Report (PB1-3) and the defendant Investigation Committee`s Report dated 20 July 1981.
On the question of damages suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. On the special damages both parties have agreed it at $2,387. On the question of loss of earnings for the period of 52 months from 1 November 1981 to end of February 1986, I reject the plaintiff`s claim as he took no steps to mitigate the damage. He did not go back to find out if his employer would employ him. I accept the evidence of the defendants that if the plaintiff had gone back to the defendants they would have taken him on in another capacity at the same pay.
On the question of damages for pain and suffering the sum is $30,000. As for loss of future of earnings I award him $45,000.
There will be interest at 6% from 19 January 1982 up till 22 March 1985. The sum on which interest will be paid is $2,387 plus $30,000 = $32,387. I also order that the sum of $7,417 paid into court by the defendants be paid out to the solicitors for the plaintiff Messrs Amarjit Rubin & Partners.

s 22(1) Limitation Act (Cap 10, 1970 Ed)
 
On 22 October 1980 the plaintiffs commenced an action against three defendants, including the third defendants, in which they claimed as against the third defendants damages for negligence, conspiracy to do a wrongful act, damages as constructive trustee in knowingly and dishonestly disposing of the trust monies and fraud. On 16 February 1981 the defence of the third defendants was filed. No further step was taken by the plaintiffs over the long period of four years and two months. Then the plaintiff or those acting for them woke up from their long slumber and on 10 April 1985 the plaintiffs filed and served the one month notice of intention to proceed and on 13 May 1985 the plaintiffs filed the usual summons for directions which was fixed to come up for hearing on 29 July 1985. In the interim period, the defendants taking the view that the periods of limitation of the causes of action of the plaintiffs would have expired on 1 July 1985 with all deliberate speed filed a summons-in-chambers on 2 July 1985, the following day, for an order that the plaintiffs` action be dismissed for want of prosecution.
After hearing the third defendants` application I dismissed it but I ordered the plaintiffs to pay costs of the application. Against that decision the third defendants have appealed and I now give my reasons. In view of my decision, I proceeded to hear the plaintiffs` summons for directions and made the usual orders.
The plaintiffs are and were at all material times a finance company and were, inter alia, in the business of financing hire purchase transactions. The first defendants, which have since been compulsorily wound up, were alleged to have hire purchased 74 sets of industrial sewing machines (the sewing machines) under a hire purchase agreement dated 26 December 1978 under which the plaintiffs had financed the sum of $105,000. Until the sewing machines were duly purchased by the first defendants from the plaintiffs under the hire purchase agreement, they were owned by the plaintiffs and were in the possession of the first defendants as hirers.
As required by a term of the hire purchase agreement, the first defendants had to insure the sewing machines against loss by fire. By a fire policy issued on 24 March 1979, in which the first defendants appeared as the insured party, the third defendants agreed to indemnify the first defendants up to $140,000 against any loss of the sewing machines by fire. Within the box provided in the insurance policy for `the interest on property insured`, there was expressly typed in the statement that the property insured, including the sewing machines, was the property of the insured `or held by them in trust or on commission for which they are responsible, whilst contained in the building ... situate (at) No 315 Alexandra Road, Second Floor, Singapore ...`
On 1 July 1979 a fire broke out in the building and, as the plaintiffs claimed, all the sewing machines were destroyed, although the third defendants claimed in their defence that not all of them were destroyed and that the loss value attributable to the destruction by fire of the sewing machines was only $44,461.37 even if the plaintiffs had any interest in them, which the third defendants denied.
Four days after the fire, the plaintiffs put the third defendants on notice of their claims as owners of the sewing machines under the hire purchase agreement. They wrote to the first defendants requiring them to give written instructions to the third defendants to pay out the insurance monies directly to the plaintiffs and a carbon copy of the letter, which set out the interest of the plaintiffs in the sewing machines, was extended to the third defendants. There was no response from the third defendants. So by a letter dated 12 November 1979 the plaintiffs through their solicitors demanded the payment of $140,000 from the third defendants. It was a long letter in which the interest of the plaintiffs was again set out and by which the third defendants was informed that the plaintiffs had been appointed under the hire purchase agreement as the agent to collect the insured sum and to give a valid receipt. Again, the third defendants did not respond.
In March 1980 the plaintiffs sued the first defendants and by August 1980 they obtained judgment in Suit 638 of 1980 under which it was declared that the plaintiffs were entitled to receive the insurance monies from the third defendants. The third defendants were not a party in that suit and the judgment was therefore not binding on them. The plaintiffs gave the third defendants notice of the judgment obtained by them against the first defendants and again demanded payment which was not made and they instituted these proceedings against the third defendants.
Some reference has been made to the allegations in the statement of claim. After setting out the knowledge of the third defendants that the sewing machines were trust property, as spelt out in the fire policy itself, and that the plaintiffs had immediately after the fire casualty made a claim to the insured monies, the plaintiffs alleged in para 8 of the statement of claim that during a period after the fire the first defendants, the second defendants, its managing director, and the representative of the third defendants `conceived and carried out a fraudulent and dishonest design` to ignore the lawful claims of the plaintiffs and to pay out the insurance monies to the first defendants. This serious allegation also appears as a claim of conspiracy in para 14 of the statement of claim.
Paragraph 10 of the statement of claim was the alternative claim in these terms: 
 
If contrary to the allegation of the abovesaid para 8 any of the defendants (with or without others) who assisted in the aforesaid design did not know that it was fraudulent and dishonest, such defendants nevertheless knew of circumstances which would have indicated to an honest and reasonable person (including a company) that such a design was being committed, alternatively knew of circumstances which would have put such a person on inquiry whether it was being committed but nevertheless failed to make any or any reasonable such inquiry.
 
 
 
Although more particulars of the serious allegations of fraud and of the claims of fraudulent breaches of trust against the third defendants as constructive trustees, in which trust monies were allegedly involved, would have been most helpful, I was compelled to take the view that strictly on a reading of the pleadings the claims of fraud and for the reliefs of tracing, payment out and damages against the third defendants as constructive trustees were set out sufficiently as separate causes of action to which the third defendants had, in any case and notwithstanding the paucity of particulars, filed their defence. Perhaps, I should say that I do not, as I should not, say anything about the merits of these allegations which will properly be for the trial judge.
So far as the insurance monies of $140,000 are concerned, the questions which will arise in this case are whether these were trust monies and whether the third defendants had become a constructive trustee and therefore liable to account to the plaintiffs for that sum. The relevant law will be the law of constructive trusts. I understand the plaintiffs` allegations on this aspect of their claims to amount to this: that the third defendants knew or had notice that the insured sum would upon the casualty happening, become trust monies inasmuch as the sewing machines were trust property and that they had held the insured sum or dealt with it in a manner inconsistent with the trust: see 
 Snell`s 
 
 Principles of Equity 
 (28th E d) pp 194 and 195 and the three cases cited under footnote 16.
Apart from the allegations of fraud, liabilities as constructive trustees, conspiracy to do a wrongful act, the plaintiffs had also alleged negligence.
On the bases of these several causes of action the plaintiffs claimed as against the third defendants (1) damages for negligence, (2) damages for conspiracy, (3) all such orders as may be just for following or tracing of property by the plaintiffs, (4) all other necessary accounts, directions and inquiries and other reliefs as to interests and costs. The third and fourth named reliefs relate to the alleged liabilities of the third defendants as constructive trustees to account to the plaintiffs.
I will now have to turn to the defences filed. Apart from acknowledging the receipt of the claims from the plaintiffs or their solicitors, every allegation in the statement of claim was denied. On the positive side, the third defendants contended that they were entitled to pay the insured monies to the first defendants directly and that, alternatively, `such payments were in effect void for the reasons hereinafter specified` (para 8 of the defence). In para 15, the third defendants went on to assert that the sewing machines were also the subject matter of hire purchase agreements with Sin Thai Hin Trading and Nanyang Finance that not all the 74 sets were destroyed by the fire and that in any case the interest of the plaintiffs was limited to the sum of $44,461.37 against which there should be a set-off of $35,000 which had been paid by the first defendants, the insured, to the plaintiffs. The third defendants specifically pleaded that they had learned of these facts subsequent to the fire.
By para 16 of the defence it was also alleged that the policy was null and void by reason of the first defendants` non-disclosures of the following material facts or falsehoods, namely (1) that the self-same sewing machines were under three hire purchase agreements with three owners as aforesaid; (2) that the sewing machines were also insured with Cosmic Insurance Corp and AFIA; (3) that there was a previous fire at the same premises; (4) that there was no mortgage or charge on the property; and (5) that there was no other insurance in force on the same property with any other company.
Having set out the history of the proceedings in this matter, the factual background giving rise to the disputes and the summarised nature of the claims and defences, I now turn to the application before me to dismiss the action for want of prosecution. The third defendants did not exercise their right to take out a summons for directions themselves earlier but had waited and proceeded under the alternative limb in O 25 sub-r 1(4) which provided thus: 
 
If the plaintiff does not take out a summon for directions in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Rule, the defendant ... may do so or apply for an order to dismiss the action.
 
 
 
What I was empowered to do was provided in the next sub-rule which stated: 
 
On an application by a defendant to dismiss the action under para (4) the Court may either dismiss the action on such terms as may be just or deal with the application as if it were a summons for directions.
 
 
 
The principles which a court should apply when considering whether an action should be dismissed for failure to comply in due time with the important steps for bringing an action to trial were clearly set out by Lord Diplock in 
 Birkett v James 
 [1977] 2 All ER 801 in the following terms: 
 
The power should be exercised only where the court is satisfied either (1) that the default has been intentional and contumelious, eg disobedience to a peremptory order of the court or conduct amounting to an abuse of the process of the court; or (2) (a) that there has been inordinate and inexcusable delay on the part of the plaintiff or his lawyers, and (b) that such delay will give rise to a substantial risk that it is not possible to have a fair trial of the issues in the action or is such as is likely to cause or to have caused serious prejudice to the defendants either as between themselves and the plaintiff or between each other or between them and a third party.
 
 
 
Although ground (1) above was not relied upon by the third defendants in their application before me, I was of the view that the distinction between the two grounds, though related, had an important bearing in this case. The distinction drawn by the reported cases related to the subsequent fate of the causes of action pleaded in actions which had been dismissed on either ground (1) or ground (2) stated above. If an action was dismissed under ground (1) then a second action by the plaintiff pleading the same cause of action could be dismissed as abuse of process. On the other hand, if the first action was dismissed on ground (2), a second action by the same plaintiff raising the same cause of action, if filed within the period of limitation, could not be dismissed as abuse of process. In the result, it has been observed that where the period of limitation has not yet lapsed, it would be exceptional to dismiss an action on ground (2).
Lord Diplock recognised this distinction when in 
 Birkett v James 
 he said at p 808: 
 
I am of opinion that the fact that the limitation period has not yet expired must always be a matter of great weight in determining whether to exercise the discretion to dismiss an action for want of prosecution where no question of contumelious default on the part of the plaintiff is involved; and in cases where it is likely that if the action were dismissed the plaintiff would avail himself of his legal right to issue a fresh writ, the non-expiry of the limitation period is generally a conclusive reason for not dismissing the action that is already pending.
 
 
 
Goulding J in 
 Greek City Co v Demetriou 
 [1983] 2 All ER 921 felt himself bound to bear in mind and apply the distinction in that case, although the defendant was suffering losses and was prejudiced while the plaintiff was dragging his feet in the prosecution of its claims. The English Court of Appeal in 
 Bailey v 
 
 Bailey 
[1983] 3 All ER 495 also recognised the distinction.
Not all the causes of action in the instant case would expire six years from the date on which the right of action accrued. In respect of the claims of fraud and fraudulent breaches of trust no period of limitation as prescribed by the Limitation Act (Cap 10, 1970 Ed) would apply: see s 22(1) of the Act. Even with regard to the plaintiffs` claims of negligence and the tort of conspiracy, I was not altogether satisfied that the period of limitation of six years had expired on 1 July 1985. I did not have, for example, the allegations as to when the breach of duty had taken place nor the date when the conspiracy was agreed. Although the plaintiffs or their lawyers had failed to take out the summons for directions over a lapse of four years and two months, the third defendants did not do so, although they could have done so. After the plaintiffs had served the notice of their intention to proceed in May 1985 there was not a whiff of any objection from the third defendants who apparently waited for the period of limitation to expire, or so they thought, before they applied to dismiss the action for want of prosecution. Seeing that not all the causes of action pleaded in this case had expired; that such of the causes of action which had expired (if they did, as to which I had some doubt) only on the day before the application to dismiss the action; and that some two months earlier the plaintiffs had given notice of their intention to proceed which they did by filing the summons for directions, I thought in the exercise of my discretion that a dismissal would be too draconian.
I had a second reason for not dismissing the action. I was not persuaded that the delay, though flagrant and inordinate, would give rise to a substantial risk that it would not be possible to have a fair trial of the issues in the action. Nor was I persuaded that such delay was likely to cause or had caused serious prejudice to the third defendants. The issues in this case are quite clear from my earlier references to and analysis of the pleadings. In fact, the plaintiffs` evidence would probably be dependent on oral testimonies; whereas those of the third defendants would largely be documentary or would have been documented. Contrary to the bald affidavit assertions made on behalf of the third defendants, I could not see how the defences of the third defendants would materially depend on the oral testimonies of the officers of the insured, the first defendants, or the evidence of the second defendants. At any rate it was somewhat speculative to say that these witnesses might not be available, if they had to be called. Further, it was alleged on behalf of the third defendants that they had a right of contribution or indemnity from the first defendants which were wound up if the plaintiffs were to succeed, which they lost by reason of the delay of the plaintiffs. I was of the view that whatever that right was, the third defendants had ample time since the commencement of the action and could have taken out third party proceedings against the first defendants. If the third defendants had failed to do so within the period of limitation, the direct and effective cause of the loss was the third defendants` failure to take out such third party proceedings and the loss could not be laid at the doorsteps of the plaintiffs.
Counsel for the third defendants relied on 
 Toh Hock Thye & Ors v Toh Chwee Biow 
 
 
[1982] 1 MLJ 152
  a decision of the Federal Court of Malaysia which affirmed the principles of law governing a dismissal of an action for want of prosecution enunciated by a differently constituted Federal Court of Malaysia in the earlier case of 
 Vasudevan v Damodaran 
 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 150
 . The law was clearly and succinctly spelt out in the two cases: see in particular the judgment of Abdoolcader J (as he then was) who delivered the judgment of the Federal Court in the latter case at pp 150 and 151. The Federal Court of Malaysia received into Malaysia the principles set out by Lord Diplock in 
 Birkett v James 
 and applied the principles to the facts of the two cases and such applications are instructive examples for the guidance of our courts. In the instant case, I did the same thing and applied the principles to the particular facts of this case.

Whilst awaiting appearance before an examining magistrate for determination of whether or not he should be committed for trial in the High Court on a charge of rape, the applicant sought an order that the High Court compel the respondent to furnish him with certified copies of certain documents.
He apparently made two statements to the police. The second of these was made under s 126(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113, 1970 Ed) (CPC). The other was made earlier. The applicant claims it was made under s 121(5) CPC. The prosecution say that it was made under s 120 CPC. Section 121(5) does not provide for the making or recording of statements. It merely provides for uses to which a statement can be put. As the statement in question was made earlier than the one under s 121(6), I will refer to it as the earlier statement.
By way of criminal motion, the applicant sought an order from the High Court that the Public Prosecutor furnish him with a certified copy of each of certain documents arising from the investigation into the alleged offence. Requested copies were of:
 
 
(a) the information first received and recorded under s 114 CPC (the first information report); 
 
(b) extracts from the station diary; 
 
(c) extracts from the charge book; and 
 
(d) the earlier statement.
  
 
 
The first information report has been supplied to the applicant as indeed was his statement under s 121(6) CPC. Mr Murugason, counsel for the applicant, very wisely abandoned at the final hearing before me applications in respect of extracts from the station diary and the charge book. The only issue therefore before me was the application in respect of the earlier statement.
At first hearing, there was argument on each of the above documents. Reserving judgment, the question arose in my mind of whether the High Court had jurisdiction to entertain an application of this nature. I therefore asked the parties to address me further on whether the High Court had jurisdiction to hear a criminal motion for its present purpose. In doing so, I acceded to Mr Murugason`s request that in view of the general and wider interest in the matter, both on jurisdiction and substance, I would invite the Law Society to nominate counsel to appear as amicus curiae. Mr Amarjit Singh was nominated. I am grateful to him for his full and comprehensive arguments, both in favour and against the present application. Mr Fong Kwok Jen, who appeared earlier for the Public Prosecutor, was out of the country and was not able to be present at the last hearing.
There are only two statutes of relevance on the question of jurisdiction. The first is the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 15, 1970 Ed) (SCJA) and the other is the CPC.
Before I turn to the statutes on jurisdiction, I should deal with ss 76, 78 and 79 of the Evidence Act (Cap 5, 1982 Reprint). These sections were the foundation for each of Mr Murugason`s various submissions on the High Court`s jurisdiction.
Section 76 specifies what are the `public documents`. Section 78 provides that `every public officer having the custody of a public document 
 which any person has a right to inspect 
 shall give that person on demand a copy of it` (emphasis added) certifying that it is a true copy. Section 79 provides that such certified copies may be produced in proof of the contents of public documents. Mr Murugason`s argument was that s 78 gave the applicant a right, because of his `real and tangible interest` in it, to inspect the earlier statement, a public document; as a consequence of this right, he had the further right to a certified copy.
Section 78 does not give any right to inspect. It merely gives a right to a certified copy of a particular public document where there is a right to inspect that particular public document. The right to inspect must be found in a statute (even where there is a real and tangible interest) not in s 78. Examples of such a right to inspect, either to the public at large or to a particular category of persons, can be found in s 18 of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 18, 1970 Ed), s 43(10) of the Women`s Charter (Cap 47, 1970 Ed), s 12(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 185, 1970 Ed), s 23(2) of the Accountants Act (Cap 212, 1970 Ed) and ss 19 and 20 of the Registration of Deeds Act (Cap 281, 1970 Ed).
Section 78 is therefore of no avail to the applicant unless he can establish a statutory right to inspect his earlier statement to the police. Mr Murugason was unable to refer me to any law which gave the applicant such a right. Therefore, the Evidence Act is of no assistance whatsoever to the applicant in this case.
There are, of course, many instances where the police and other administrative bodies provide certified copies of public documents in their possession. These are clearly in exercise of administrative discretion and not in response to a request under a statutory right of a member of the public. To say that s 78 gives a right of inspection is a totally unwarranted stretching of the language of that provision and will destroy the necessary and justified confidentiality of the administration 
 and 
 of private persons involved in the bulk of public documents.
Section 7(a) SCJA provides that the High Court shall exercise original and appellate criminal jurisdiction. Section 15 describes the type of cases in which the High Court has original criminal trial jurisdiction. These two sections have no application. There is no appeal nor am I asked to exercise original 
 trial 
 jurisdiction.
Section 18 and para I (which has the marginal note Prerogative Writs) of the First Schedule headed `Additional Powers of the High Court` read as follows: 
 
(1) The High Court shall have all such powers as are vested in it by any written law for the time being in force in Singapore.
(2) Without prejudice to the generality of sub-s (1) of this section the High court shall have the powers set out in the First Schedule to this Act:
 
 
 
Provided that all such powers shall be exercised in accordance with any written law or Rules of Court relating to them.
 
 
 
 
 
 First Schedule 
 
 
 
 
 
1 Power to issue to any person or authority directions, orders or writs, including writs of the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, or any others, for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by any written law or for any purpose.
 
 
 
Mr Murugason sought to invoke these provisions to give the High Court jurisdiction. Before an applicant can rely on this provision, he has to show that as provided in sub-s (1) there is a written law vesting a power in the High Court or that the power invoked comes within the proviso to sub-s (2), ie, that its exercise accords `with any written law or Rules of Court relating to them`. There is no written law or rule of court which the applicant`s counsel could cite as relevant to the present application. In any event, the remedies referred to in the paragraph of the First Schedule, as further indicated by the marginal note, are remedies in the nature of a prerogative writ. That is not the nature of the application here.
Mr Murugason also argued that ss 23 and 27 of the SCJA gave the High Court jurisdiction to entertain this application. Section 23 gives `in accordance with provisions of any written law for the time being in force relating to criminal procedure` the High Court powers of `revision` in respect of criminal proceedings and matters in the subordinate courts. In this instance, there are yet no criminal proceedings or matters in any subordinate court relating to the charge against the applicant. In any event, there must in addition be a written law relating to criminal procedure under which the applicant could move the High Court. There is no such provision.
Section 27 gives the High Court general supervisory and revisionary supervision over all subordinate courts. As with s 23, this section has no application unless proceedings have, at least, commenced in a subordinate court.
The provisions I referred to exhaust all the possible provisions of the SCJA under which the High Court could possibly have jurisdiction in this matter.
The CPC has instances giving the High Court original jurisdiction other than trial jurisdiction to hear specific applications in criminal matters. Under s 184, the High Court is vested with power to transfer a criminal case from one court to another on the application of the prosecution or the accused. Another example is found in s 249 where the High Court can hear an application where a person desirous of appealing is debarred from so doing because of not having observed some formality or requirement of the CPC.
There is no point in my going through the CPC exhaustively to list out instances where the CPC gives the High Court original jurisdiction. I have referred to the two provisions merely to show that if the Legislature intended the High Court to have jurisdiction in a matter like the one before me, specific reference would have made to it in the CPC.
The only provision of the CPC which remotely has a bearing is s 57(1) which, omitting the proviso which has no relevance, reads: 
 
Whenever any court or police officer considers that the production of any document or other thing is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code by or before such court or officer, such court may issue a summons or such officer a written to the person in whose possession or power such document or thing is believed to be requiring him to attend and produce it or to produce it at the time and place stated in the summons or order.
 
 
 
Mr Murugason`s most strenuous argument was under this provision. He cited a number of Malaysian cases in support of his argument that the High Court has original jurisdiction to compel production of any document to any person under a charge in a subordinate court if that person has a `real and tangible interest` in it and considered that document necessary or desirable for the purposes of an inquiry, trial or other proceeding.
On my reading of s 57(1), this provision, as far as a court (as opposed to a police officer) is concerned, only applies to the court otherwise seised of the inquiry, trial or other criminal proceeding. It does not give the High Court any jurisdiction unless the High Court is itself, in that particular matter, exercising original jurisdiction in a criminal matter or is, under specific statutory provision, exercising appellate, revisionary or supervisory or other jurisdiction. Examples of such other proceedings are ss 184 and 249 CPC, to which reference has been made.
For procedure to bring the application before the High Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, Mr Murugason relied on cases where applications were made to the High Court in West Malaysia under s 51(i) of the CPC there. This provision is identical to s 57(1) in Singapore. An examination of the cited cases will show that in each report where reference is made to the means or procedure by which the matter came before the High Court in West Malaysia in the exercise of its 
 original 
 jurisdiction, the application was made under s 44(1) of the (West Malaysian) Specific Relief Act 1950 (Act 137), which has no Singapore counterpart. Section 44(1) reads: 
 
A Judge may make an order requiring any specific act to be done or forborne, by any person holding a public office, whether of a permanent or a temporary nature, or by any corporation or any court subordinate to the High Court.
 
 
 
In 
 Chia Kim Chwee 
 
 Raymond v PP 
 
 
[1985] 2 MLJ 436
  the Supreme Court of Malaysia held that an application to a court for a summons under s 51 must be made to the court before which an inquiry or trial is being heard or pending. This decision may well bring an end to Specific Relief Act applications to the High Court in West Malaysia for issue of a summons under s 51(i) when an inquiry, trial or other proceeding is by or before a court other than the High Court. This is particularly so when regard is had to proviso (d) to s 44(1) which makes an application possible only if `the applicant has no other specific or adequate legal remedy`.
The plain words of the provision are the starting point of any effort to interpret a statute. Our s 57(1) gives certain powers to courts and to police officers who conduct investigations. Courts have nothing to do with investigations. That subsection, stripped of all references to police officers and investigations, in order to look exclusively at its applicability to courts, will read: 
 
Whenever any 
 court
 ... considers that the production of any document or other thing is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any ... inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code 
 by or before such court
..., 
 such court
 may issue a summons ... to the person in whose possession or power such document or thing is believed to be requiring him to attend and produce it or to produce it at the time and place stated in the summons ... [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
A plain reading shows these inevitable and unarguable consequences:
 
 
(a) there must be an inquiry, trial or other proceeding by 
 or before a court 
; 
 
(b) 
 that 
 court (and no other) must consider the Production of a document or other thing necessary or desirable for the proceedings 
 before it 
; 
 
(c) 
 that 
 court (and no other) may issue a 
 summons 
 (not an order which can be issued only by a police officer) for production of the document or thing as specified in the summons.
  
 
 
This analysis is the only possible one. On it, the High Court clearly has no jurisdiction to hear an application of this type unless it is otherwise exercising jurisdiction in the case. In fact, in this case, no court has jurisdiction because, as would appear, no proceeding has as yet commenced in any court. The applicant is still waiting for a preliminary inquiry to commence to decide whether or not he should be committed for trial. Even if such an inquiry has commenced it will be before a magistrate. In the issue before me, it means that not only does the High Court have no jurisdiction; even a magistrate who can conduct committal proceedings has no jurisdiction 
 as yet 
 to hear an application under s 57(1).
In the 
 Chia Raymond 
case, the Malaysian Supreme Court was of the clear view that `... the court which must consider whether the production of the material or document asked for is necessary or desirable is the court before which the trial 
 was pending or in which the trial was proceeding 
`.
For reasons hereinafter appearing, I am of the firm view that (barring documents mentioned in the charge) an application under s 57(1) can be made to the trial court only 
 after 
 the recording of prosecution evidence has commenced. In many cases, depending on the nature of the document, application may have to be made at an appropriate time, later than commencement, when the trial is well under way before the court has before it the necessary material to decide relevancy to enable it to consider the necessity or desirability of production of the document.
Other consequences of my interpretation are that a subordinate court with jurisdiction to hear and acceding to an application under s 57(1) issues a 
 summons 
 and not an order. This summons or refusal to issue one is, in my view, not a `judgment, sentence or order` under s 246(1) CPC and is therefore not appealable, being only a procedural ruling.
This view accords with the longstanding decision of Rose CJ in 
 PP 
 
 v Hoo Chang Chwen 
 
 
 
[1962] MLJ 284
 . Any other view, in the words of the learned Chief Justice, will `open the door to a number of appeals in the course of criminal trials on points which are in their essence procedural. The proper time, of course, to take such points would be upon appeal, after determination of the principal matter in the trial court`. The decision of Rose CJ has been followed in Malaysia in 
 PP v Menon 
 
 
 
[1978] 2 MLJ 152
  and in 
 Maleb bin Su 
 
 v 
 
 PP 
 
 
[1984] 1 MLJ 311
 . I am conscious that in the 
 Chia Raymond 
 case, the Supreme Court took a different view. It may well be that that decision is restricted to cases where the application under s 51(i) relates to documents mentioned in the charge and is made before the prosecution opens its case.
If at end of proceedings the accused is acquitted, the correctness of the refusal to issue a summons under s 57(1) becomes an academic question to the defence. After a trial in a lower court, either side can, if there is an appeal, use the issue or refusal to issue a summons under s 57(1) as a ground of appeal or cross-appeal if thought justified.
Quite apart from the plain words of ss 57(1) and 246(1), there is a sound practical reason for the view expressed. Any other view can frustrate criminal proceedings and bring proceedings in a subordinate court almost to a halt. An accused person awaiting trial or on trial or one awaiting or undergoing committal proceedings can make successive applications, with or without justification, under s 57(1) and upon refusal of the application, appeal to the High Court. He can thereby bring the subordinate court proceedings to successive temporary hats. This consequence is clearly undesirable. My views:
 
 
(1) that the exercise of powers under s 57(1) is a matter for the trial court; 
 
(2) that a trial court should be asked to exercise these powers only in the course of proceedings and not before commencement of trial; and 
 
(3) that interference by the High Court can unnecessarily hold up proceedings in the trial court; all find support in the words of a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 
 Assistant Customs Collector 
 
 v Melwani 
 AIR 1970 SC 962. This case involved s 94(1) (now 91(1) of the Indian Code which is, for present purposes, identical with s 57(1) of our CPC).
  
 
 
A magistrate, upon the accused`s application, declined, in that case, to issue a summons to the prosecution to produce, before commencement of trial, the statements of witnesses recorded by the Customs authorities. In revision, not appeal, a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court reversed the magistrate on this point. The Supreme Court held the magistrate to have been correct and reversed the High Court.
The Supreme Court said (p 967) that, `Whether a particular document should be summoned or not is essentially in the discretion of the trial court ... Except for very good reasons, the High Court should not interfere with the discretion conferred on trial courts in the matter of summoning documents.` The Supreme Court went on to describe as `good reasons` those given by the magistrate for non-issue of a summons to produce the required statements before commencement of trial. The magistrate had said: 
 
The recording of the prosecution evidence is yet to commence in this case and at present there are no materials before me to decide whether or not the production of any of the statements and documents named by the accused in his application is desirable or necessary for the purpose of the enquiry or trial.
 
 
 
On sub-para (3) of my views set out above, the Supreme Court said that in s 94(1) matters, High Court `interferences would unnecessarily impede the progress of cases and result in waste of public money and time as has happened in this case`.
The 
 Chia Raymond 
case is the most recent and most authoritative one on s 51 of the West Malaysian CPC. It came before the Supreme Court on appeal from a decision of the High Court reported at p 63 of the same 
 Malayan Law Journal 
 volume.
Two persons (amongst others) were on a joint charge of forgery before a President of a Sessions Court. The charge arose out of five documents specified in the charge. The two accused persons made applications under s 51 to the President before whom they were being tried. Chia`s application was in general terms. Zainal applied for `specified and unspecified documents, comprising 29 categories, including (his) cautioned statement and the first information report` (p 64).
The learned President responded to the applications of the two accused but he did not accede totally to the respective applications. His summons to produce was confined to documents referred to in the charges of forgery and documents removed from possession of the accused.
There was an appeal to the High Court by the Public Prosecutor against the learned President`s decisions. The appeal of the Public Prosecutor was allowed, but in the exercise of what he considered as his revisionary powers, the learned judge ordered that photostat copies of the five documents referred to in the charge be furnished to the defendants.
By way of appeal and cross-appeal, issues were framed in five questions posed for the opinion of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held that the order of the learned High Court judge for production of the documents was not a proper exercise of his revisionary powers.
In discussing the questions posed to the Supreme Court, regard must be had to the nature of the documents requested by the accused in that case. The charge was one of forgery and the charge specifically mentioned five documents. The Supreme Court said that attention must be paid to ss 152, 153 and 154 of the West Malaysian CPC (ss 157, 158 and 159 in Singapore) relating to the framing of the charge. There is clearly a specific duty imposed on the prosecution to particularise the charge sufficiently so as to give adequate notice to the accused.
In this context, the Supreme Court did say that an application under s 51 can be made before the commencement of the trial but this view was qualified as appears hereafter. From the whole judgment, it is clear that an application before commencement of trial is only for the purpose of giving adequate particularity to the charge where the charge itself specifies documents.
To quote the Supreme Court, `Where the application under s 51(i) of the CPC is made in the course of the trial, the rule of relevancy must be strictly enforced` at page 439/E. The Supreme Court went on to say: 
 
If the discretion is to be exercised before the commencement of trial the court cannot anticipate how the prosecution will proceed. In other words the court would not be justified to direct the prosecution to deliver to the accused all documents taken from him for that will not be a correct exercise of the discretion under s 51 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
 
 
 
The Supreme Court of Malaysia was dealing with two categories of documents. One is documents referred to the charge. The second is other documents. In respect of the latter both the Malaysian and the Indian Supreme Courts expressed the same view in different terms. The Malaysian court said that if a court is asked to exercise discretion `before commencement of trial the court cannot anticipate how the prosecution will proceed`. The Indian Supreme Court quoted with approval the words of the magistrate. These words have already been quoted above. The views of these two Supreme Courts are my reasons and basis for saying that except in the case of documents referred to in the charge, an application under s 57(1) should be made only after the commencement of the recording of prosecution evidence.
The final part of Mr Murugason`s submission was based on s 5 of the CPC which makes English law relating to criminal procedure applicable in matters `for which no special provision has been made` by the CPC. In my view, there is, in this context, no lacuna in the CPC making it necessary to resort to English law. For his purposes, Mr Murugason relied upon the `Guidelines` [1982] 1 All ER 734; 74 Cr App R 302 of the Attorney General of England for the disclosure of `unused material` to the defence. These guidelines are reproduced in 
 Archbold`s Criminal Pleading 
 (42nd Ed) p 328. Even if applicable, these guidelines are not English `law relating to criminal procedure`. They have no legislative or judicial origin. Further, the passages he referred to deal specifically with the statements of persons other than the accused. Even with these, there are many specified exceptions in the Guidelines. One such is a statement that the prosecution can use in cross-examination if the maker is called as a witness by the defence. This clearly will exclude statements by an accused.
Both English cases cited by Mr Murugason dealt with statements of persons other than the accused; not with a statement of an accused person. They are therefore of no assistance to the applicant in this `criminal motion`.
For the reasons set out by me, I dismiss the application on the grounds that the High Court has no jurisdiction for the present application. Further, even if it had, every cited reason and authority is against grant of the application.
Section 57 also applies to things other than documents. These invariably are physical objects which the prosecution intend to use to prove their case. With these, adequate precautions are necessary; but the prosecution should give the defence `reasonable access to the exhibits for the purpose of inspection and examination`, to quote Donaldson MR in 
 R 
 
 v 
 
 Lambeth Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex p McComb 
 
[1983] QB 551
; [1983] 1 All ER 321. This in fact has been the practice here even in cases attracting the death penalty. (See 
 Teo Hock Seng 
 
 v 
 
 PP 
 
 [1978-1979] SLR 1 
; [1978] LS Gaz Rep 343 ).
By way of conclusion, let me make a few remarks which will put this judgment and the reasons behind it in perspective. I fully appreciate that entirely different considerations apply in civil actions between parties and in criminal cases where the State proceeds against an accused person. Notwithstanding this, I feel compelled to say that, even if I had jurisdiction, acceding to the applicant`s request will be tantamount to introducing, as against the Public Prosecutor but not, be it noted, against an accused, the civil procedure process of discovery which is available between parties in litigation. There is no warrant in legislation or practice in Singapore or anywhere in the Commonwealth for such concept. In the 
 Chia Raymond 
case, the Malaysian Supreme Court put it succinctly and with consummate clarity when the court at p 434/A said, `The discretion (under s 51(i) should not however be exercised so as to enable the accused to gain access to materials before the trial as in the case of pre-trial discovery and inspection of documents in a civil proceeding.`

The appellant in magistrate`s appeal No 282 of 1984, Tan Kwee Hak, appeals against his conviction and sentence by a magistrate`s court on a charge of driving a motor car, a RXY Mazda No EQ 7967 R in a manner so rash as to endanger human life, an offence under s 279 of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to five weeks` imprisonment and disqualified from obtaining or holding a driving licence in respect of all classes of vehicles for five years.
After the appellant was convicted the prosecution applied for a forfeiture order of the motor car in question. The appellant opposed the application and contended that he was the owner and submitted that the motor car be returned to him. Orient Consumers Credit applied to be heard on the question of forfeiture and it was contended on its behalf that in accordance with the terms of a hire purchase agreement, the agreement had been duly terminated and submitted that the motor car should not be forfeited but ought to be returned to the company. The magistrate made an order of forfeiture. Orient Consumer Credit now appeals against the forfeiture order in magistrate`s appeal No 285 of 1984. The appellant is also appealing against the forfeiture.
I propose to deal first with Tan Kwee Hak`s appeal against conviction and sentence. The facts are that at about 2.30 on the morning of 8 January 1984 three police officers, PC Rahim, PC Lee Kah Tong and PC Chong Kok Cheong, who were attached to the Traffic Enforcement Unit and were there on duty at the junction of Orchard Boulevard and Paterson Road saw three sports cars turning sharply into Orchard Boulevard from Paterson Road in the direction of Grange Road. The appellant was driving the Mazda car with a lady passenger seated beside him. One of the other sports cars was a Porsche car No ER 4 K driven by Low Kok Tiong and the other was a Lotus car No SS 20 S driven by Boon Peng Kiong. All three knew each other. The police officers immediately gave chase and saw the three cars were travelling fast, overtaking each other and other vehicles travelling in the same direction by weaving in and out and switching lanes without giving any signals and cutting into the path of other vehicles thereby forcing those vehicles to brake and swerve to avoid a collision.
After the cars had turned into Grange Road they continued to overtake some other vehicles by cutting and forcing into their paths and as they travelled along Napier Road and then along Holland Road before its junction with Farrer Road the three cars continued to overtake other vehicles as well as each other at speeds up to 150 to 160 kmph which were well in excess of the authorized speed of 50 kmph. The prosecution evidence showed that the drivers of these three sports cars were racing with each other in circumstances which clearly amounted to driving in a manner so rash as to endanger human life. The drivers of the Porsche and Lotus cars had also been charged with the same offence and they had pleaded guilty.
The appellant in his defence said that while he did overtake other vehicles he did so in a normal manner and did not weave in and out of other vehicles or cutting sharply into their paths. He said his speed along Orchard Boulevard was about 90 kmph and along Holland Road about 90 to 100 kmph. He said that he was not racing with the other two cars but after leaving Grange Road he wanted to catch up with them and had no intention of overtaking them and take the lead. The drivers of the Porsche and Lotus cars gave evidence for the defence and both of them said that they did not see the appellant when they were travelling along Orchard Boulevard on to the Holland Road/Farrer Road junction and that the appellant`s car did not overtake their respective cars.
The trial judge accepted the prosecution evidence and found the defendant guilty of the offence as charged. In my judgment it was a finding which the trial judge was entitled to arrive at on all the evidence before him and the appeal against conviction must be dismissed. With regard to the appeal against sentence, the sentences of imprisonment imposed on the drivers of the Porsche and Lotus cars who pleaded guilty to similar charges were on appeal set aside and in the circumstances I allow the appeal against the sentence of five weeks` imprisonment by setting that sentence aside and substituting therefor a fine of $1,000. The order of disqualification is reduced to three years.
I turn now to consider the forfeiture order made under s 385 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113, 1970 Ed) by the trial judge. It is common ground that the power conferred by s 385 is a discretionary power. This section reads as follows: 
 
(1) During or at the conclusion of an inquiry or trial in any criminal court the court may make such order as it thinks fit for the disposal of any document, livestock or other property produced before it.
 
 
 
 
(2) The power conferred upon the court by this section includes power to make an order for the forfeiture or confiscation or for the destruction or for the delivery to any person of any property regarding which any offence is or was alleged to have been committed or which appears to have been used for the commission of any offence but shall be exercised subject to any special provisions regarding forfeiture, confiscation, destruction or delivery contained in the Act under which the conviction was had or in any other Act applicable to the case.
  
 
 
In the present case the trial judge in making the order for forfeiture took into consideration that the appellant was in a good financial position to purchase the car which was valued at $47,760. He also took into consideration that although the offence was committed only two months after its purchase, the appellant had continued paying the monthly instalments after the car was impounded. The monthly instalments of $1,573 were payable to the claimant Orient Consumers Credit on a hire purchase agreement under which the appellant undertook to pay 24 monthly instalments of $1,573.00. The trial judge found that `by ordering the forfeiture of this motor car this court would be imposing an additional penalty of $25,168 on the (appellant)` but nonetheless came to the conclusion that an order of forfeiture would not `create an additional excessive overall penalty.` He arrived at that conclusion because the appellant was a person who had `(bought) an expensive sports car but has no regard for the safety of others` and had no reason to drive it rashly and thereby putting the life and safety of other road users at jeopardy.
In my judgment that reason may well be a proper reason for disqualifying the appellant from driving motor vehicles but not a proper reason for ordering forfeiture of the car in question and in all the circumstances of the case I am of the opinion that the order of forfeiture should not have been made.
There remains the question as to whom the motor car in question should be ordered to be delivered to. On the undisputed evidence adduced by Orient Consumers Credit that it had duly terminated the hire-purchase agreement and therefore had the right to possession of the motor car I am of the opinion that the proper order to be made under the provisions of s 385(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code is that the motor car No EQ 7967 R be delivered to Orient Consumers Credit.

Appeal against order of assistant registrar
 
This is an appeal by the plaintiff against the decision of the assistant registrar ordering that:
 
 
(1) the interlocutory judgment entered on 29 February 1984 be set aside; 
 
(2) the sum of $18,000 paid into court by the defendant on 9 February 1985 and accrued interest thereon be paid out to the defendant; 
 
(3) there be no order as to the costs of application.
  
 
 
The plaintiff`s claim is for damages for personal injuries suffered by him as a result of a collision at Vernon Park on 5 February 1982 with a Ministry of Environment lorry no YA 4059 D driven by one Lee Kong, an employee of the government. The action was commenced on 19 January 1984.
On 7 February 1984, the defendant entered appearance. On 9 February 1985, the defendant paid the sum of $18,000 into court in satisfaction of the plaintiff`s cause of action. On 24 February 1984, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff`s then solicitors stating that the defendant admitted liability and asked that the plaintiff proceed to enter interlocutory judgment with damages to be assessed. No defence was filed and interlocutory judgment was entered against the defendant with damages to be assessed on 29 February 1984. Assessment of damages was fixed for mention on 23 February 1985.
In March 1985 the plaintiff was informed by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) that the SAF had decided to award him compensation. On 3 May 1985 the SAF paid to the plaintiff a lump sum disability compensation of $15,720.41 under the SAF Pensions (Amendment) Regulations 1981 for the disability suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the accident at Vernon Park on 5 February 1982.
On 27 September 1985 the defendant applied by summons-in-chambers for, inter alia,the interlocutory judgment to be set aside and on 7 November 1985, the assistant registrar made an order in the terms prayed for.
The plaintiff was enlisted in the full-time National Service from the period 26 June 1980, to 25 June 1982. In February 1982 his duty hours on weekdays were from 7.45am to 5pm.
On 5 February 1982, the plaintiff finished the day`s duty at 5pm and thereafter immediately changed into civilian clothing and left Mount Vernon Camp. While walking along Vernon Park, which is a public road just outside the camp, the accident took place.
It is the contention of the defendant that the government in this case has a defence under s 14(4) of the Government Proceedings Act (Cap 21, 1970 Ed) (the Act) which provides that: 
 
No act or omission of a public officer shall subject him to liability in tort for death or personal injury, in so far as the death or personal injury is due to anything suffered by a member of the forces being a thing as to which the conditions mentioned in sub-s (1) or (2) are satisfied.
 
 
 
It is submitted that since the public officer the driver Lee Kong, is not liable, the government is not liable as its liability is vicarious.
The contention of the plaintiff is that s 14(4) of the Act will protect the tortious public officer only if the conditions in sub-s (1) or (2) of s 14 are satisfied.
Section 14 provides as follows: 
 
(1) Nothing done or omitted to be done by a member of the forces while on duty as such shall subject either him or the Government to liability in tort for causing the death of another person, or for causing personal injury to another person, in so far as the death or personal injury is due to anything suffered by that other person while he is a member of the forces if -
(a) at the time when that thing is suffered by that other person, he is either on duty as a member of the forces or is, though not on duty as such, on any land, premises, ship, aircraft or vehicle for the time being used for the purposes of the forces, and 
(b) the minister responsible for finance certifies that his suffering that thing has been or will be treated as attributable to service for the purposes of entitlement to an award under any written law relating to the disablement or death of members of the force of which he is a member.
 
 
 
Provided that this subsection shall not exempt a member of the said forces from liability in tort in any case in which the court is satisfied that the act or omission was not connected with the execution of his duties as a member of those forces.
 
 
 
It is submitted that s 14 of the Act, which are provisions relating to the armed forces, is not applicable in this case as at the time of the accident the plaintiff was not on duty, he was not on land used for the purposes of the forces but on a public road, and his injuries were not attributable to service, as required by s 14(1). It is also contended that the certificate issued by the minister responsible for finance under s 14(1)(b) was a nullity. It is submitted that the issue of such a certificate is a condition precedent to an award. In this case the certificate was issued on 15 August 1985 after the decision to award compensation was made and after the payment of compensation and that the only purpose of the minister responsible for finance in issuing the certificate was to claim immunity from suit.
Regulation 2 of the SAF Pensions Regulations, 1978 defines `injuries received in and which are attributable to service` as including injuries received in the following circumstances: 
 
(a) whilst on a journey necessary to enable a member to report for service or to return home after service; or
(b) consequence of some act lawfully performed in the discharge of the member`s duties;
 
 
 
The plaintiff submits that injuries received on his journey home after service are attributable to service but it does not mean that he was on duty.
In support of his arguments counsel for the plaintiff relied on the case of 
 Bell 
 
 v Secretary of State for Defence 
 [1985] 3 All ER 661. In that case, the deceased, who was a serviceman stationed in West Germany, sustained head injuries during horseplay in barracks. He was transferred from the army medical reception centre to a local civilian hospital, but the army doctor failed to provide the hospital with accurate notes of the deceased`s injuries with the result that there was a significant delay before the civilian doctors could make an accurate diagnosis. The deceased subsequently died from his injuries. The plaintiff, the deceased`s father, suing as administrator of his estate, brought an action for damages against the Secretary of State for Defence under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 s 1 alleging, inter alia, that the army doctor had been negligent in failing to provide proper medical notes to the civilian hospital and that that had prevented the deceased receiving proper treatment in time. The Secretary of State claimed immunity from suit pursuant to s 10(1) of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 under which nothing done or omitted to be done by a member of the armed forces while on duty could subject the Crown to liability in tort for causing the death of a person while he was a member of the armed forces if (by s 10(1)(a)) at the time the victim was `either on duty ... or (was), though not on duty as such, on any land (or) premises ... used for the purposes of the armed forces` and if (by s 10(1)(b)) the Secretary of State certified that the serviceman`s death was, for the purposes of `entitlement to an award` under the provisions relating to the disablement or death of members of the armed forces, attributable to his military service. The Secretary of State subsequently issued a certificate pursuant to s 10(1)(b)).
The question whether s 10 gave immunity to the Secretary of State against being vicariously liable for the negligence of the army medical staff was tried as a preliminary issue. The judge upheld the Secretary of State`s claim to immunity and the plaintiff appealed, contending (i) that the certificate issued under s 10(1)(b) was a nullity because there was no one who was entitled to receive an award as the result of the deceased`s death, since there was no one who was dependent on him and therefore the only purpose of the Secretary of State in issuing the certificate was to claim immunity from suit, and (ii) that for the purposes of s 10(1)(a) the army doctor`s negligence had occurred when the deceased was not on army land but at the civilian hospital.
It was held: 
 
(1) On the true construction of s 10(1)(b) of the 1947 Act the Secretary of State was entitled to issue a certificate that a serviceman`s death was attributable to his service for the purposes of an `entitlement to an award` even though at the time when the certificate was issued it was clear that there was no one entitled to receive such an award and the only effect of the certificate was to enable the Secretary of State to claim immunity from suit, because the certificate was merely declaratory of the fact that the death was attributable to service and it did not follow that an award would be made if a certificate was issued.
(2) (Sir John Donaldson MR dissenting) The injury suffered by the deceased, ie the failure by the army doctor to give the civilian hospital accurate information about the deceased, had occurred at the civilian hospital and not on Crown land and accordingly, the Secretary of State was not entitled to claim immunity because under s 10(1)(a) such immunity was restricted to an injury suffered by a serviceman while on duty or while on Crown land. The plaintiff`s appeal would therefore be allowed.
 
 
 
Our s 14(1) of the Government Proceedings Act (Cap 21) is similar to s 10(1) of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947.
In dealing with the extent of the immunity under s 10(1), Sir John Donaldson MR said (p 665): 
 
The broad concept underlying the section is simple enough. Where one serviceman, who is on duty, negligently kills or injuries another serviceman, who is also on duty, any compensation shall be provided under the service pension scheme contained in the Order in Council and not under the common law. Difficulties can, however, arise when the serviceman who was killed or injured was not in fact on duty at the relevant time, but is, in effect, deemed to have been on duty because he was then on some land, premises, ship, aircraft or vehicle for the time being used for the purposes of the armed forces of the Crown. The difficulty lies in determining what is the relevant time.
 
 
 
In the instant appeal Trooper Bell was not in fact on duty at any material time, but he was deemed to be on duty at all times until he was taken from the army vehicle into the German civilian hospital. Thereafter he was neither on duty nor deemed to be on duty. Accordingly it becomes necessary to consider whether the relevant time was before or after his arrival at the hospital. This involves construing para (a) in s 10(1).
In the instant appeal, the plaintiff was not in fact on duty at the material time nor could he be deemed to have been on duty because he was then not on some land, premises, ship, aircraft or vehicle for the time being used for the purposes of the armed forces.
The certificate issued under s 14(1)(b) erroneously stated that the plaintiff sustained the injuries `whilst on duty`. The issue of the certificate is a pre-condition to any entitlement to an award. It is clear that the only purpose of the issue of the certificate was for the government to claim immunity from suit. In the instant case it was issued five months after the decision to make the award was made. In my view the certificate is a nullity.
In the result the appeal is allowed with costs.

The appellants are partners of a business carried on under the name and style of Rainbow Sound Enterprise at 6-C Golden Wall Flatted Factory, Jalan Rajah, Singapore. According to the certified extract of the business registration, the general nature of the business is that of manufacturing cassette tapes and import and export of tapes and the second appellant is registered as the person responsible in the management of the business of the partnership.
On 10 June 1981, Inspector Jim Lee Ah Lai (PW2) led a party and raided the premises of the partnership at 6-C Golden Wall Flatted Factory, Jalan Rajah. Included in the party were Detective Corporal David Lim, Detective Constable Sung Kok Ann, Detective Constable Toh Eng Yan, Photographer Detective Corporal Zakariah, members of the Singapore Phonogram Association, and one PT Fernando a private investigator (PW 1). On arrival at the premises, they were informed by a male Chinese, Chong Swee Peng, that the first appellant, who was then not present there, was the person in charge of the factory. Chong was asked to get in touch with the first appellant, which he did. The first appellant subsequently arrived and identified himself as the person in charge of the factory. He was shown the search warrant and a search was then carried out at the premises and suspected pirated copies of cassette and cartridge tapes were seized. Thereafter, they searched a container which was parked outside the factory at a loading bay. The container was locked and the first appellant opened the container and various suspected pirated copies of cassette tapes were also seized. All the copies of cassette and cartridge tapes seized were loaded onto a lorry and also to a police bus and were brought to the premises of EMI (Singapore) at Jurong where they were transferred to two containers. The containers were later brought to a warehouse at Ruby Industrial Complex under the charge of Commercial Crime Division`s storekeeper, Sim Thye Seng (PW 3).
Subsequently, representatives of respective recording companies went to Ruby Industrial Complex with portable cassette players and cassette tapes which are true copies of the original records of songs. They listened to and compared the songs recorded in the true copies with those in the cassette tapes referred to in the charges. It was their evidence that the records of the songs contained in the cassette tapes seized and described in the charges were copies of the original recordings. The cassette tapes containing records of these songs were produced and admitted. The prosecution produced two affidavits (exhs P83 and P125) affirmed by Carol Phillips, a director of International Recording Copyright, who deposed therein to the fact that on 10 June 1981, copyrights subsisted in Singapore in the respective gramophone records and the owners of the copyrights thereof were the persons respectively named in the affidavits and that the copies of the said gramophone records annexed to the affidavits were true copies of the records respectively; she made these affidavits on behalf of the owners of the copyrights in the said gramophone records. These two affidavits were admitted by the learned magistrate under s 5(1) of the Act. Evidence was also adduced before the learned magistrate to prove that the cassette tapes containing records of the songs described in the charges were not manufactured by or with the consent of the owners of the copyrights of the records or their licensees. At the close of the prosecution, the learned magistrate found that a case against the appellants had been made out which, if unrebutted, would warrant their convictions; he therefore called upon the appellants to enter their defence. Both of them however elected to remain silent and no evidence was adduced on their behalf. The learned magistrate convicted them on the 14 charges and fined each of them $300 for each of the 14 charges. Against these convictions, this appeal is now brought.
Mr Kan on behalf of the appellants attacked the convictions on various grounds. His first submission is that the affidavits (P83 and P125) were not in compliance with s 5(1) of the Act and were wrongly admitted. It is convenient at this stage to set out s 5(1) of the Act which is as follows: 
 
An affidavit made before a notary public by or on behalf of the owner of the copyright in any gramophone record and stating -
 
 
 
(a) that at the time specified therein, copyright subsisted in such record;
(b) that he or the person named therein is the owner of the copyright; and 
(c) that a copy of the record annexed thereto is a true copy thereof, shall be admitted in evidence in any proceedings under this Act on its production by the prosecution without further proof.
 
 
 
The objectionable part of each of the affidavits, according to Mr Kan is para 2 thereof which (so far as relevant) is as follows: 
 
On 10 June 1981, copyright subsisted in Singapore in the following gramophone records and the owners of the copyright are as set out below:
 
 
 
... .
 
 
 
Mr Kan`s complaint is centred on the two words, `in Singapore.` He submitted that the inclusion of the words `in Singapore` in para 2 of the affidavit was not provided for under s 5(1)(a) of the Act and that rendered the affidavit defective and inadmissible. He relied on two decisions of the High Court, both unreported, namely, 
 Aw Theng Fung v PT Fernando 
(MA 39/82) (unreported) and 
 Lam Radio & Record v 
 
 PT Fernando 
(MA 119/81) (unreported). Miss O`Connor for the prosecution disputed that that was decided by the High Court in the two appeals; on the contrary she said that the appeal in 
 Aw Theng Fung v 
 
 PT Fernando 
was disposed of on the ground that the affidavit should have stated the additional words `in Singapore` which it did not and that the appeal in 
 Lam Radio & Record Pte v 
 
 PT Fernando 
though successful, was not allowed on the ground that the words `in Singapore` were present in the affidavit in question. I have perused the records of these two appeals and there is nothing therein which really substantiates Mr Kan`s argument and I am inclined to accept what Miss O`Connor said. In my view, the words: `copyright subsisted`, in s 5(1)(a) of the Act obviously mean copyright subsisted in Singapore, as that is the copyright contemplated and recognised by the law of Singapore. Though the words `in Singapore` are not present, it is implicit that that statutory provision refers to copyright in Singapore. As Miss O`Connor submitted, copyright does not exist in vacuo; it must be linked to a country territorially. However, when it comes to a question of determining whether copyright in relation to a gramophone record subsists in Singapore, it seems to me essential to show as, a matter of evidence that copyright subsists in Singapore in that record. Consequently, if an affidavit in accordanc e with s 5(1) of the Act is used it is essential to state therein that at a particular date copyright in relation to the record in question subsisted in Singapore and the words `in Singapore` are in my view necessary.
Mr Kan also argued that the learned magistrate wrongly accepted the two affidavits, P83 and P125, without allowing the appellants an opportunity to cross-examine the deponent on the affidavits and he relied on s 179(e) of the Criminal Procedure Code, under which in a trial before a magistrate`s court or a district court, an accused shall be allowed to cross-examine all the witnesses for the prosecution. The two affidavits were admitted by the learned magistrate under s 5(1) of the Act, and under s 5(2) they constitute prima facie evidence of the matters stated therein respectively and until the contrary is proved, the court shall presume that the affidavits were made by or on behalf of the owners of the copyright in the records stated therein. If Mr Kan wished, at that time, to cross-examine the deponent on her affidavits, he should have applied to the learned magistrate for leave to do so. That he did not do. According to the record, no application appeared to have been made by him to the learned magistrate for leave to cross-examine the deponent on the two affidavits; nor did the learned magistrate indicate in any way his refusal to any application, if made, for leave to cross-examine the deponent. Mr Kan merely argued that the affidavits were defective and inadmissible in that they contained the additional words `in Singapore`, and was content to let the matter rest after the affidavits were admitted. In the circumstances, it is hardly open to him to complain that no opportunity had been given to him to cross-examine the deponent.
In each of the charges brought against each appellant, the prosecution treated a record of each song in a cassette tape, iea sound track of a song in the tape, as a gramophone record within the meaning of s 2 of the Act. In other words, each of the charges brought by the prosecution relates only to a recording of one song out of a collection of songs as recorded in a tape and there was no evidence at all as to the remaining songs. This obviously was intended to overcome the difficulty encountered in 
 Kwah Hai Gong v 
 
 PP 
 
 [1978-1979] SLR 374 
 where the High Court held that in order to succeed, it was essential for the prosecution to prove, inter alia, that the cassette tape, alleged to be a pirated copy, is an exact copy or reproduction of the gramophone record in which copyright subsists. Mr Kan submitted that this course adopted by the prosecution was untenable and that a sound track of a song in a tape was not a gramophone record. Such an argument would probably be sustainable but for the meaning of the term, gramophone record, as defined in s 2 of the Act. Under s 2, unless the context otherwise requires, a gramophone record means `the material first embodying the recording of a sequence of sounds capable, by the use of that material, of being automatically reproduced aurally, but does not include a sound track associated with a cinematograph film`. Clearly the term `gramophone record` under the Act assumes a meaning wider than its ordinary meaning. Thus, in the case of 
 Heng Yik Fang v PP 
 
 
[1973] 1 MLJ 193
  the High Court held that cartridge and cassette tapes are gramophone records within the meaning of the Act. The learned Chief Justice said, at p 194: 
 
In my opinion the definition must be read in the context of the Act as a whole. The Act is an enactment dealing specifically with one subject matter, namely, the provision of penalties for infringement of copyrights in gramophone records and to permit government to broadcast by radio or television musical works or gramophone records without infringing any copyright. The Act creates one offence only, namely, by providing that any person `who makes, reproduces, imports for sale, sells, exposes or offers for sale, or has in his possession for sale, any pirated copies of any gramophone record, shall be guilty of an offence` and provides the penalty for such offence. The Act does not leave the expression `gramophone record` to be construed in its ordinary dictionary meaning but gives it a much wider meaning by defining it in s 2.
 
 
 
Accordingly, in my judgment the cartridge and cassette tapes found in the possession of the appellant come within the definition of `pirated copies` in the Act.
It seems to me that the statutory definition of a `gramophone record` contemplates a sound track, other than a sound track associated with a cinematograph film, as a gramophone record. A sound track of a song in a tape, which is a recording of a song, is a recording of sequence of sounds capable by the use of the tape of being automatically reproduced aurally. The fact that the tape contains a recording of other songs is immaterial; it is irrelevant to the question whether the sound track itself falls within the statutory definition. In my view, a recording of a song in a tape (which also contains a record of other songs) is a gramophone record within the meaning of the Act, and if the gramophone record of that song was made or reproduced without the consent lawfully given by the owner of the copyright of the record of such song, then it is a pirated copy within the meaning of s 2 of the Act.
It was further argued by Mr Kan that the prosecution had failed to prove that the copies of the cassette tapes referred to in the charges were pirated copies, ie copies made or reproduced without the consent lawfully given by the owners of the copyright in the records of which these copies were made or reproduced. It was said that all that was proved before the learned magistrate was that the labels and inlay cards attached or affixed to the cassette tapes were not those of the owners of the copyright in question; but it was not proved that the cassette tapes were not tapes of the owners. I find no merit in this argument. There was ample evidence on which the learned magistrate based his finding that the copies of the cassette tapes referred to in the charges were pirated copies. At any rate, the point in issue is not whether the tapes are not the tapes of the owner of the copyright in the record, but whether the records of the songs in the tapes are pirated copies, ie copies made or reproduced without the consent of the owner of the copyright in the record.
Lastly, it was argued that the learned magistrate erred in his finding that the seized tapes were in the possession of the appellants. It was not disputed that at the material time the appellants were partners of the business carried on at 6-C Golden Wall Flatted Factory, Jalan Rajah and the second appellant was the person responsible for the management of the partnership business. The pirated copies were found either in the business premises or in the container parked just outside the premises at a loading bay. When the police raided the business premises the first appellant identified himself as the person in charge at the premises and he had the key to the container and he opened the container. He told PW 2 that the tapes which were then being seized were for export. In my view, on the totality of the evidence the learned magistrate was justified in his finding that the pirated copies were in the possession of the appellants for sale at the material time.
In the result, I dismiss the appeal of the appellants and affirm the convictions and sentences.

The plaintiffs are the owners of the property, Lot 24-18 of Mukim IV with a house thereon known as 18 First Avenue, Singapore. The defendant is the owner and occupier of the adjoining property, Lot 24-231 also of Mukim IV with a house thereon known as No 15 Second Avenue, Singapore. The plaintiffs` house faces the First Avenue, and the defendant`s house faces the Second Avenue, and they share a common boundary (the common boundary) at the back of the respective houses. The defendant`s property is much higher than the plaintiffs` property; the difference in levels of the two properties is about 15 feet.
The plaintiffs` property came to the family a long time ago. The first plaintiff`s father bought the property in 1936 and conveyed it to the first plaintiff`s mother in 1941. Subsequently, the mother conveyed the property to the first plaintiff in 1955, and in January 1976 the first plaintiff conveyed the property to himself and the second plaintiff as joint tenants and since then they have been holding the property as such. The defendant bought his property on 7 March 1967. At that time the defendant`s property sloped down steeply towards the plaintiffs` property at or near the common boundary. Separating the two properties was a fence of about five feet high at the top of the slope - on the same level as the land on which the defendants` house stands - and next to the fence on the slope were a hedge and lalang. There was no retaining wall at the slope, except a small white inlet wall at the bottom of the slope which was built by the predecessor in title of the defendant. The purpose of this inlet wall was of course to prevent earth on the top from slipping.
Immediately or soon after his purchase, the defendant removed the fence and the hedge and lalang separating the two properties and built a retaining wall in their place. The wall is almost perpendicular, the top of which is on the same level as the land on which stands the defendant`s house and along the edge of the retaining wall at the top the defendant erected a chain link fence of about five feet high. The bottom of the retaining wall rests on the plaintiffs` property. In 1974 or thereabout, the first plaintiff carried out renovation to his house and in the course of such renovation his architect, Lim Kok Cheng (PW 1), found that the retaining wall built by the defendant was standing wholly on the plaintiffs` property. He duly informed the first plaintiff, first over the telephone and subsequently by a letter (exh P 9). After receipt of his architect`s letter, the first plaintiff consulted his solicitors and they wrote a letter dated 19 July 1975 (exh AB 1) to the defendant, complaining that the retaining wall encroached on the plaintiffs` property and requesting it to be removed by 31 August 1975. This was followed by another letter of 14 August 1975 to the defendant, also written by the solicitors for the first plaintiff, complaining that the retaining wall was not structurally sound and that a shed or hut erected on the defendant`s property also encroached on the plaintiffs` property, and requesting the defendant to remove the shed and to reconstruct a wall in accordance with requirements of the planning authority. No action appeared to have been taken by defendant in response to such requests. About two years later, on 2 July 1977, the plaintiffs` solicitors wrote a further letter to the defendant complaining once again of the encroachment by the retaining wall on the plaintiffs` property and requesting the defendant to remove it within 14 days; the defendant however did not comply with this request. Then on 5 December 1977, the plaintiffs took o ut a writ against the defendant. In their statement of claim (which was subsequently amended, re-amended and further re-amended) the plaintiffs pleaded that during the period between March 1967 and October 1968, the defendant wrongfully built the retaining wall on the plaintiffs` land and thereby trespassed on the plaintiffs` land and wrongfully remained in possession of the portion of land occupied by the retaining wall and the plaintiffs have thereby been deprived of the use and enjoyment of the said portion of land. They claim for: (i) a declaration that the defendant is and has been in wrongful possession of the plaintiffs` land and has trespassed thereon; (ii) an order that the defendant do forthwith pull down and remove the existing retaining wall and erect a new wall in place thereof but standing within the boundary of the defendant`s land, and (iii) damages. The claim is resisted by the defendant and he raised two defences: (i) the claim by the plaintiffs is barred by the Limitation Act, and (ii) the plaintiffs` claim for relief is also barred by delay amounting to laches in that the plaintiffs did not make any complaint about the retaining wall until 19 July 1975 or thereabout and did not commence any proceeding until 5 December 1977.
It is not in dispute that the defendant had built the retaining wall at or near the slope abutting on the common boundary but on the plaintiffs` property. According to the survey plan (exh P 13) the retaining wall occupies an area of approximately 11.8 sq m of the plaintiffs` property. It is also not in dispute that the defendant having built the retaining wall, erected the chain link fence along the edge and on the top of the retaining wail: see exhs P8D, P8F and P13; thus the fence also stands on the plaintiffs` property. The defendant also erected a shed or hut on his land at or near one end of the retaining wall and a part of this structure stands on the plaintiffs` property. The defendant therefore has committed acts of trespass on the plaintiffs` property, and the plaintiffs have a claim against him. The question is whether this claim is barred by (i) the Limitation Act (Cap 10, 1970 Ed) (the Act) and (ii) laches, as pleaded in the defence.
Mr Rubin for the defendant submitted that the claim of the plaintiffs was for damages for trespass and not for recovery of possession of their property and the relevant period of limitation was that under s 6 of the Act, which is six years from the date the cause of action accrued. As more than six years had elapsed since the defendant built the wall encroaching on the plaintiffs` property the claim of the plaintiffs was therefore time-barred. I am unable to accept this argument. The claim by the plaintiffs is in effect for possession of that portion of their property occupied by the retaining wall, though the claim was framed in a somewhat devious way. The plaintiffs did not ask for an order for possession of that portion of their property encroached upon by the retaining wall and the fence. They asked for an order requiring the defendant to demolish the existing retaining wall and rebuild a new wall in place thereof but within the boundary of the defendant`s land. Such an order if made and complied with would in effect give to the plaintiffs possession of that portion of their property encroached upon. In my view, the relevant period of limitation is that under s 9 of the Act, which is 12 years from the date the cause of action accrued. Further, assuming that the claim is only one for damages for trespass, it has still not been time-barred: the trespass complained of is that caused by the retaining wall constructed by the defendant on the plaintiffs` property and the wall is still encroaching on their property; in other words, the trespass is continuing. This defence therefore clearly cannot stand.
As regards the defence of laches, the short answer to it is this: there is an express statutory provision prescribing the period of limitation for the plaintiffs` claim, and in view thereof the doctrine of laches is not applicable: see the judgment of Wilberforce J (as he then was) in 
 Re Pauling`s Settlement Trusts 
 [1964] Ch D 303; [1961] 3 All ER 713 which was affirmed on appeal.
Both the defences pleaded and relied upon by the defendant having failed, the next question is what order should be made to satisfy the plaintiffs` claim. The first relief asked for is a declaration that the defendant is and has been in wrongful possession of the plaintiffs` property and has trespassed thereon. In principle there is no objection to making this declaration.
The second relief asked for is an order that the defendant do pull down and remove the retaining wall and erect a new wall in place thereof but within the boundary of the defendant`s land. It is in effect a mandatory injunction and the question is whether it should be granted in this case. `The grant of a mandatory injunction is, of course, entirely discretionary and unlike a negative injunction can never be ""as of course"". Every case must depend essentially upon its own particular circumstances.` (per Lord Upjohn in 
 Redland Bricks v Morris 
 
[1970] AC 652
. This is a general principle, and I now turn to consider the circumstances of this case. The defendant`s house is very near to the common boundary - less than ten feet away. Before the retaining wall was erected in 1967 there was at or near the common boundary a steep slope towards the plaintiffs` property. No survey was carried out at the time to determine where the common boundary was: whether it was at the top or the bottom or in the middle of the slope. On the slope were a hedge and lalang. The defendant got rid of the hedge and lalang and built an almost perpendicular retaining wall at the slope, and probably it was erected at a position at the bottom of the slope and vertically upwards; and at the top the defendant filled up the land, thus gaining a couple of feet of land or thereabout. To require the defendant now to demolish the existing retaining wall and build a new one wholly within the boundary of his land would in effect result in the plaintiffs gaining an area of about 11.8 sq m of land immediately adjoining the common boundary and on the same level as the land on which their house stands, which is an improvement of their land they never had before the wall was erected.
The back of the defendant`s house is less than ten feet from the common boundary, and if the retaining wall is to be demolished and rebuilt, then it will have to be a vertical retaining wall all along the common boundary with a length of about 100 feet and the cost of such works would be considerable. Dr Lau (PW 5) estimated that the cost would be about $60,000. That seems to me to be a conservative estimate and probably it would be or could be more than that depending of course on how the works are to be carried out and the materials to be used. Even at $60,000 it is a large sum of money to be expended. The area of the plaintiffs` property encroached upon by the retaining wall is a narrow strip of land of about 11.8 sq m and even if the existing retaining wall is demolished and rebuilt all along the boundary but standing on the defendants` property the plaintiffs would gain effectively only this narrow strip of land. The defendant, on the other hand, would have to incur a considerable amount of money, and, in addition, because of the close proximity of the defendant`s house to the common boundary, great care would have to be taken by his engineer, contractor and workers in the demolition of the existing wall and construction of the new wall; otherwise his land might slip and his house collapse. In my view, if the mandatory injunction asked for by the plaintiffs is granted the obligation imposed on the defendant is extremely onerous and is out of all proportion to the benefit to be gained by the plaintiffs. In my view, it will not produce a fair result. In 
 Charrington 
 
 v Simons & Co 
[1970] 1 WLR 725
 the plaintiff complained that the defendants in breach of a negative covenant re-surfaced a tract and raised the level thereof above that of the surrounding land belonging to the plaintiff who was cultivating an orchard on his land. The difference in levels of the track and the surrounding land interfered with or impeded the plaintiffs cultivation o n the surrounding land and he brought the action against the defendant seeking, inter alia, a mandatory injunction requiring the defendant to remove any part of the track above the level of the surrounding land. Buckley J who heard the case granted the mandatory injunction but suspending it for three years , which suspension, however, was lifted by the Court of Appeal: see [1971] 1 WLR 599. Buckley J in considering the grant of a mandatory injunction said, at p 730: 
 
Where a mandatory order is sought the court must consider whether in the circumstances as they exist after the breach a mandatory order, and, if so, what kind of mandatory order, will produce a fair result. In this connection the court must, in my judgment, take into consideration amongst other relevant circumstances the benefit which the order will confer on the plaintiff and the detriment which it will cause the defendant. A plaintiff should not, of course, be deprived of relief to which he is justly entitled merely because it will be disadvantageous to the defendant. On the other hand, he should not be permitted to insist on a form of relief which will confer no appreciable benefit on himself and will be materially detrimental to the defendant.
 
 
 
The concept of `fair result` as one of the criteria in determining the grant of a mandatory injunction was accepted by Megarry J in 
 Shepherd Homesv Sandham 
 [1971] Ch D 340 where he said, at p 351: 
 
Second, although it may not be possible to state in any comprehensive way the grounds upon which the court will refuse to grant a mandatory injunction in such cases at the trial, they at least include the triviality of the damage to the plaintiff and the existence of a disproportion between the detriment that the injunction would inflict on the defendant and the benefit that it would confer on the plaintiff. The basic concept is that of producing a `fair result`, and this involves the exercise of a judicial discretion.
 
 
 
There is one further point which should also be taken into account. The first plaintiff denied that the defendant constructed the retaining wall with his permission; he was at that time the sole owner of the property. However, as a matter of practicality the wall could only be built from the bottom upwards and to build such a wall the defendant`s contractor and workers must have entered the plaintiffs` property, and, of course, they could only do so with the first plaintiff`s permission. The defendant could not have constructed the wall only from his land without such entry. It is true that there was no direct evidence before me on this point, but as a matter of inference and common sense, I can arrive at no other conclusion. It seems to me that, if this was the position, as I think it was, then the first plaintiff must have either expressly or impliedly permitted or acquiesced in the construction of the wall, though at that time he had no knowledge or was not aware that the wall was being erected solely on his property. It is curious that the defendant did not raise in his defence that the retaining wall was built with the licence of the first plaintiff, express or implied; that would have been a defence to the plaintiffs` claim of trespass by the defendant`s construction of the wall. In 
 Armstrong v 
 
 Sheppard & Short 
[1959] 2 QB 384
 at pp 399-400 Lord Evershed MR said: 
 
It is, I think, true to say (and these cases establish it) that if A gives authority to B for the doing of an act on A`s land, and the act is done and completed, then, whatever be the strict description of the authority, whether it be called a permission or a licence, it is, generally speaking at any rate, too late for A, who gave the authority, to complain of it. And that will go to this extent - that a man may by such means extinguish a proprietary right: for example (to quote an instance from the cases), if I having an easement of light, permit another to come and build a wall up against my window so as to extinguish the easement, if the wall is built and completed, that may well be the end of it, and I cannot complain of the infringement of my ancient light or require the wall to be taken down.
 
 
 
In that case the defendant for the purpose of carrying effluent water from the defendant`s land to the public sewer constructed a manhole and sewer pipes on the plaintiff`s land with the permission of the latter who at that time was not aware that they were constructed on his property. On discovering this subsequently he brought an action against the defendant for trespass claiming for damages and injunction. The trial judge declined to grant an injunction on the ground that the damage was trivial and awarded the plaintiff nominal damages. The trial judge`s decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. In this case though licence or permission for the construction of the retaining wall was not raised as a defence, it is nevertheless an important factor to be taken into account in considering whether or not the mandatory injunction asked for ought to be granted. In my opinion, having regard to the licence or permission for the construction of the wall by the defendant it would be inequitable to require the demolition thereof and erection of a new wall in its place at great cost and inconvenience to the defendant.
For all these reasons, I am not disposed to grant the mandatory injunction asked for by the plaintiffs. But along the edge and at the top of the retaining wall there is a chain link fence erected by the defendant. This in fact is on the plaintiffs` property. The defendant should remove this fence and re-erect it along the common boundary without encroaching on the plaintiffs` property. There is also a hut or shed at the corner of defendant`s property and a part of that structure also encroaches on the plaintiffs` property. He should also demolish this structure. Mr Rubin at the commencement of his closing speech made a statement at the Bar that the defendant would be prepared to move the chain link fence to the common boundary and to demolish the shed or hut, both of which encroached on the plaintiffs` property. Hence, what I require the defendant to do will not really be too onerous and in effect will give to the plaintiffs possession of that portion of their land which the defendant has been and is presently occupying.
On the question of damages, there is no evidence that the plaintiffs have suffered any damage or loss as a result of the trespass. Before the retaining wall was built by the defendant there was steep slope and the plaintiffs had never had any effective enjoyment of the portion of land on which now stands the wall. Miss Ivy Tay (PW 6) testified that the plaintiffs had lost rental from their property because of the lack of privacy to the tenants staying there. That surely is not because of the retaining wall but because of the fact that both the plaintiffs` house and the defendant`s house are too near to the common boundary. On this the first plaintiff is partly to blame: in renovating his house in 1974 he extended it towards the common boundary. I therefore award to the plaintiffs only nominal damages in a sum of $500.
I now make the following orders: (1) a declaration in terms of prayer (1) of the statement of claim; (2) an order that the defendant remove the existing chain link fence and re-erect it along the common boundary and without encroaching on the plaintiffs` property and demolish the existing hut or shed which encroaches on the plaintiffs` property, and (3) an order that the defendant pay to the plaintiffs a sum of $500 as nominal damages for the trespass.
As for costs, I do not think that the plaintiffs should be allowed the whole of the costs of this action. They have failed in their claim for the substantive relief asked for. Further, the action has been unnecessarily prolonged and in the course of the trial amendments were made to the pleadings, the costs of which I have reserved. In the circumstances, I think a fair order as to costs is that the defendant pay to the plaintiffs only two-thirds of the costs of this action.

At the crack of dawn on 9 December 1980 the first plaintiff, who was riding motorcycle AX 2820 with his wife, the second plaintiff, as pillion rider had a collision with motor pick-up GE 8192S driven by the defendant. As a result, the second plaintiff suffered severe brain damage by reason of which she underwent gross intellectual deterioration and personality changes. According to plaintiffs the accident was caused entirely by the negligence of the defendant who, on the other hand, claimed that plaintiffs were responsible for their own misfortune or, alternatively, were respectively 35% and 20% contributorily negligent.
The accident occurred near the mouth of the sliproad from Upper Thomson Road, which had three lanes, leading to Marymount Road. According to the first plaintiff, he was travelling along Upper Thomson Road on his way to the Toa Payoh Hospital as his wife needed medical attention. He was travelling on the second lane, close to the first lane. At that time a major portion of the first lane was under repair. The first plaintiff said in evidence that defendant`s pick-up had come from Lornie Road and was travelling between the second lane and the third lane when it was first sighted by him. Intending to turn left into the sliproad, the defendant overtook the motorcycle and then swerved left into his path. Inevitably, a collision occurred; the right handle bar of the motorcycle caught the nearside rear view mirror of the pick-up and both plaintiffs were thrown off the motorcycle.
On the other hand, defendant said in evidence that having purchased fish from the Jurong Fishing Port in the small hours of that morning he had come onto Upper Thomson Road on his way to Ang Mo Kio market and was travelling in the middle lane at all material times when the motorcycle, which he had sighted from the nearside rear view mirror moments earlier, attempted to overtake him from his left. In the process the right handle bar of the motorcycle caught the nearside rear view mirror of the pick-up. As a result, the plaintiffs were thrown off their motorcycle. In his police report he stated that since he had intended to turn left, he had switched on his signal. He said: `At the time of the accident, my vehicle was very slightly slanted to the left and I had yet to make the turn yet.` In the course of his evidence, the defendant stoutly maintained that he had stayed in the middle of the second lane and that he had not begun to make the turn to the left.
On a balance of probabilities and having heard and seen the witnesses, I accept the first plaintiff`s version as to how the accident occurred. I find that the defendant had overtaken the plaintiffs and attempted to turn into the sliproad thereby incommoding the first plaintiff by his change of direction. He admitted he had seen the plaintiffs and yet he made the left turn causing the accident. The pick-up was slanted towards the sliproad, as was confirmed by the sketch plan and the evidence of the son of the defendant. The defendant was accused by the traffic police of having turned left and cutting across the path of the first plaintiff. He compounded the offence by paying $50 and explained that he had done so on the advice of his insurance company. I did not find his explanation acceptable. Counsel for defendant submitted that the evidence of the first plaintiff was riddled with inconsistencies as regards the path of the pick-up and the point of impact. They were not inconsistencies at all. It was also submitted that on the first plaintiff`s version the collision should have been between the front of the motor cycle and the nearside body portion of the pick-up. I do not think that this must inevitably be so. There is nothing improbable in the story of the first plaintiff. It was also said that the first plaintiff was a provisional licence holder and that the second plaintiff had voluntarily assumed the risk. There was no evidence that the first plaintiff was unable or unlikely to exercise the normal standards of reasonable care when riding the motorcycle, notwithstanding the fact that he was not licensed to carry a pillion rider. On the contrary, I gathered the impression that he was in control of the motorcycle and in spite of his evasive action, he could not avoid the pick-up which had cut into his path. I therefore conclude that the defendant was entirely to blame for the accident.
I now turn to the claims for damages and interest. The second plaintiff, who was 21 years old and a mother of two children at the time of the accident, suffered a fracture of the right collar bone and severe brain damage. In consequence of the brain damage, she suffered (a) gross intellectual deterioration and (b) personality changes. Dr R Nagulendran, a consultant psychiatrist, expressed the uncontroverted opinion that her memory function was impaired. Her speech was childish and she would not be able to undertake any task which would involve initiative. She could achieve sufficient stability such that she could be left alone, say in a flat, without doing anything silly. Although she did not require constant supervision she could not be left alone for any extended period. With an IQ level of between 50 and 70 she was like a retarded child and needed supervision. There was some improvement in her personality changes. She had become less aggressive and destructive and could be taught to carry out simple duties under supervision. It was clear that she was and always will be unemployable. Relying on

  and 
 Liong Thoo v Sawiyah 
 
 
 
[1982] 1 MLJ 286
  counsel for the second plaintiff submitted that an award of $90,000 would be appropriate for pain and suffering and loss of amenities. It was also claimed for the second plaintiff that the clavicle fracture should separately attract an award of $4,500 on the authority of 
 Santokh Singh v Singapore Bus Service 
 
 
 [1982] 2 MLJ 
 xiviii
Counsel for defendant relied on 
 Chan Kam Lan v Ong Lean Kee 
 
 
 [1979] 1 MLJ 
 xxxviii where for a more severe residual brain injury the award was $50,000 inclusive of the claim for a compound fracture of the right tibia. He submitted that allowing for inflation this item should be no more than $60,000, inclusive of the clavicle fracture. Having regard to the differences between the injuries in the instant case and those reported in the cases cited by both sides, I award $70,000 under this head inclusive of the clavicle fracture.
With regard to actual and future losses of earnings, the second plaintiff was working as a production operator in a factory. Between September 1980 and January 1981 she averaged $322.39. However, her productivity was too low at work and having regard to her disinclination to acquire new skills, as can be seen from her employment history, I accept defence submission that the multiplicand for both actual and future loss of earnings should be $300 per month.
With regard to the multiplier I would think that on the facts of this case and the trend in the well-known authorities, including 
 Lai Wee Lian v Singapore Bus Service 
 
 (1978) Ltd 
 
 
 [1984-1985] SLR 9 
 it should be 16 years.
Therefore, the amount to be awarded for actual loss of earnings is $300 per month calculated from mid-February 1981 up to July 1986, inclusive of the four 13th months in 1982 to 1985, totalling, ie $300 69.5 months, $20,850.
So far as the amount for loss of future earnings is concerned, it works out at $57,600.
As far as losses of CPF contributions are concerned, these will be allowed for actual and future earnings at the official rates.
Turning to the claims for domestic help, the facts are these. The sister of the second plaintiff, Teo Lee Ngoh, gave up her job from which she was earning $350 per month and looked after the second plaintiff and the children up to her marriage in March 1983. The first plaintiff paid her $250 per month for her services. Thereafter another sister took over the duties and continued to do so up to the trial and was paid $350 per month. I therefore allow the second plaintiff`s claims for domestic help at an average of $275 per month from December 1980 up to the end of July 1986, totalling, ie $275 for 68 months, $18,700. As for future domestic help, I accede to the submission of counsel for the second plaintiff and allow this item at the reduced rate of $200 per month for ten years on an annuity basis totalling $18,528.00.
With regard to the claim for interest, I will exercise my discretion and in line with the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
 Lee Soon Beng v Wee Tiam Sing 
 
 
 
[1986] SLR 94
  award interest on (a) the general damages of $70,000 at 6% per annum calculated from 13 May 1982, on which the defence and counterclaim was filed, up to date hereof; and (b) the actual loss of earnings, the CPF contributions and the expenses for domestic help which would have been earned or were incurred respectively since the accident in December 1980 calculated at 3% per annum, being half the rate of 6% per annum seeing that these items would have been earned or were incurred from month to month from February 1981 (taking into account the fact that second plaintiff had received remuneration up to mid February 1981).
I also award the first plaintiff $500 for pain and suffering for his relatively minor injuries. I will also award costs to the second plaintiff. As for the costs of the first plaintiff, I will hear arguments in chambers.
There will be judgment accordingly.

This appeal is against the decision of the magistrate who found as a fact that the second defendant, the servant of the first defendant, drove his motor lorry no YC 1107 H which was carrying plywood in such a way as to hit the rear view mirror of the motor bus No SBS 3355 H which was being driven by the plaintiff`s driver. The accident happened along the 10 milestone Woodlands Road whilst both vehicles were travelling in the same direction towards Upper Bukit Timah Road. Where the accident occurred, the road had two lanes for vehicular traffic and road works were being carried out on the road divider separating the dual carriageway at that stretch where the accident occurred. The bus was travelling on the left lane with about three feet clearance to the kerb and its rear view mirror was sticking out by about a foot across the white lane separating the two lanes. The plaintiff`s driver said that second defendant suddenly overtook him but in doing so the plywood on the lorry hit against the rear view of the bus. He took evasive action by swerving the bus to the left and in so doing collided into the left kerb.
PW1, the bus driver, made two reports on the same day, one to the plaintiff and the other to the police. In both reports he stated that the lorry hit or grazed the rear view mirror.
PW2, the foreman who inspected the bus at 8am on the day after the accident, said in his evidence-in-chief that the rear view mirror was broken but that he overlooked repairing it. In cross-examination, he however admitted that he did not have the mirror replaced because it appeared to have been replaced when he came to examine the damage to the bus; it looked new to him. He explained that it was usual to replace mirrors because the bus needed to be shifted around. He also said that any mechanic or panel beater could have replaced it if he had found it inconvenient to drive the bus around without a mirror and that there was no need to requisition for a mirror from stores because most panel beaters kept one or two spares in the locker.
The magistrate accepted the evidence of PW1 and PW2 in preference to the evidence of the defendant`s driver.
In his grounds of decision, the magistrate gave the following grounds for finding the defendant negligent:
 
 
(a) The defence rested on a bare denial which did not help in any way to substantiate a more probable case. 
 
(b) It was highly improbable that the motor lorry could overtake the bus without grazing the right view mirror of the bus. 
 
(c) PW1 was a more, reliable witness than DW1. 
 
(d) PW1`s evidence was substantiated by that of PW2. 
 
(e) There was no plausible reason why PW1 should suddenly swerve to the left and collide into the left kerb of the road.
  
 
 
Counsel for the defendant contended that ground (a) amounted to a reversal of the burden of proof. I agree, but only if the statement is read in isolation. In the context of the whole judgment, the magistrate meant that the defendant had not rebutted the plaintiff`s evidence. As for finding (b), there was evidence to show that the road was narrow, that the right rear view mirror of the bus extended into the right lane, that there were road works on the right lane, that the two vehicles were large vehicles, and that the lorry was carrying plywood which was protruding six inches from its left side. I cannot quarrel with this finding. As for ground (e), counsel for the defendant says that there may be any number of reasons for PW1 swerving into the kerb. That may be so. But the point of the magistrate`s finding was that it could not have been a coincidence that PW1 drove into the kerb at the time and place where DW1 overtook him. That was the implausibility. I see nothing wrong with the finding.
As for findings (c) and (d), the complaint was that PW1`s evidence was not more reliable than that of DW1 and that PW2`s evidence did not support PW1`s evidence on the damage to the mirror. As to the first complaint, counsel for the defendant said that PW1 was an evasive witnesses because he did not answer in a forthright manner the questions of defendant`s counsel on whether the lorry was travelling in its own lane and whether there were workers on both sides of the road. But the notes of evidence also show that DW1 also did not answer his questions in the same manner, particularly on how far he was from the bus when he first heard the `bang`. All these matters were within the purview of the magistrate. As he had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses, I cannot disturb his finding on the relative credibility of the two witnesses.
As to the second complaint, the magistrate accepted PW2`s evidence `on this point` because it was a sensible and logical explanation. What was this point? What was this sensible and logical explanation? It was PW2`s evidence that he believed that the right view mirror was damaged and replaced. Although the magistrate did not expand on these findings, an examination of the evidence will show what he had in mind. The evidence was that PW2 saw a job card which referred to a damaged mirror; on inspection, he did not see a damaged mirror but a mirror which looked new to him (in comparison with the bus which was between four to five years old); he therefore concluded that the mirror he saw was a replacement; and when asked who could have replaced, he said that any mechanic or panel beater could have done it if he had found it inconvenient to drive the bus without a rear view mirror; on re-examination, he explained further that it was usual to replace broken mirrors on buses because during the night a bus might need to be shifted around. Counsel for the defendant did not directly put to PW2 that the mirror was not broken but skirted this issue by asking questions to elicit answers that the mirror was not broken. Having got the answers he did not want, counsel for the defendant now complains that PW2 was unreliable witness.
PW2 can be said to be unreliable in the sense that his explanation for the replacement of the mirror was not and cannot be relied upon as evidence. It was pure conjecture as the mirror could have been replaced for any number of reasons by any number of persons than for those reasons and by those persons referred to by PW2. But this area of unreliability says nothing about the reliability of PW2`s evidence that he saw a replaced mirror. If this evidence was believed, then it follows that as a matter of probability the previous mirror must have been broken. It appears to me that he accepted the evidence of PW2 that he saw a replaced mirror and also his explanation for replacing the mirror. As I have pointed out, the explanation was not evidence. But his statement that he saw a replaced mirror was evidence. He was believed.
There is another obstacle in the way of the appellant in this appeal. The finding of the magistrate that only DW1 was to be blamed for the accident was based primarily on his acceptance of the evidence of PW1. The evidence of PW2 was only secondary and served to reinforce his belief in PW1`s evidence. It has not been demonstrated to me that the magistrate`s decision would have gone in favour of the appellant with PW2`s evidence. In other words, even discounting the whole of PW2`s evidence, the magistrate found against the defendant on the oral evidence of PW1.
The decision of the magistrate was based substantially on his assessment of the quality and credibility of witnesses. In order to reverse, I must not merely entertain doubts whether his decision is right but be convinced that it is wrong: see Lord Edmund Davies in 
 Whitehouse 
 v 
 Jordan 
 [1981] 1 All ER 267 at p 276. I am not convinced that the magistrate was wrong for the reasons given above.
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.

The first appellant, Loh Shak Mow and the second appellant, Alan Wong Hoi Ping were jointly tried and convicted by a District Court and sentenced to terms of imprisonment. They now appeal against their convictions and sentences.
The first appellant was convicted of:
 
 
(a) Six charges of abetment of cheating (DAC 3874/83-3879/83), under ss 420 and 109 of the Penal Code Cap 103 by conspiring with one Lee Kwong Fai and diverse others to cheat clients of Broadview Commodities various sums of money totalling $1,928,988.88 between December 1981 and August 1982 by deceiving them into believing that their gold trading orders would be placed with authorised international gold exchanges and thereby inducing them into paying moneys into Broadview Commodities.

(b) One charge of dishonestly retaining stolen property (DAC 2560/84), to wit, moneys amounting to $169,703.17 in the possession of Broadview Commodities in October 1982.
  
 
 
The first appellant was sentenced to terms of imprisonment totalling six years and the second appellant was sentenced to terms of imprisonment totalling 12 months.
The short facts are these. The first appellant (Loh) carried on his own shipping business, State Carriers & Transportation Pte Ltd (State Carriers), in Singapore. In February 1981 he went to Hong Kong and there, through a friend, he met Lee Kwong Fai (PW4) of Broadview Finance of Hong Kong (BVF).
Lee Kwong Fai (Lee) was the chairman of BVF and his father Lee Kum and his friend Sylvia Leung (PW5) were two of the directors. BVF was a registered member of the Hong Kong Commodities Exchange Ltd and both Lee and Sylvia were allowed to trade in spot gold and gold futures with the Hong Kong Commodities Exchange.
In Hong Kong, Lee and Loh discussed setting up a company in Singapore to trade in spot gold and gold futures. Lee then came to Singapore and had further discussions with Loh.
In April 1981, Loh and Lee incorporated a commodities firm in Singapore called Broadview Commodities (BVC) in order to trade in spot gold, gold futures and other commodities.
Alan Wong Hoi Ping (Alan Wong) was then practising as an advocate and solicitor in the firm of Lee & Lee. He was engaged in March 1981 to incorporate BVC. BVC was incorporated on 20 April 1981, with Loh and Lee holding one million shares each.
The staff of BVC comprised most of Loh`s former employees in State Carriers, including Eileen Lim (PW8), Abdullah bin Abdul Hadi (PW 9), Chen Ah Kong (PW 10), Vincent Lim (PW7), Carol Ng (PW13) and various employees of Lee at BVF Hong Kong, which included Eliza Leung (PW2), Sylvia Leung (PW5), Kelvin Ngai (PW3) and Ho Yuen Tin. The Hong Kong staff came to Singapore to assist the BVC staff in gold dealing, documentation and in the preparation of accounts in connection with gold trading.
By December 1981 the relationship between Loh and Lee had became strained. Lee then invited Alan Wong to be a director and chairman of BVC. In December 1981 Alan Wong became the chairman and a director of BVC. On that date Lee and Loh each transferred 100,000 $1 shares to him. On 9 December 1981 he received another 100,000 shares from each of them. None of these shares was ever paid for. Lee and Loh held 40% each of the shareholding of BVC and Alan Wong 20%. Alan Wong was also made a signatory of BVC cheques.
In July 1982 Alan Wong went to the Philippines to prepare and set up a company in Manila called BV (Philippines) Incorporated (BVP). The shareholders were, amongst others, Loh, Lee and Alan Wong.
In 1980 or 1981 Lee had started a trading company called Linkrich and in September 1982 Loh and Alan Wong became directors. Loh and Alan Wong had 600,000 shares each, Lee 599,999 and BVF 199,999 shares.
Matters between Lee and Loh came to a head in February 1983. Sylvia Leung (Sylvia) was sent to Singapore by Lee on 18 February 1983. Lee said she was to balance the accounts in respect of BVF. On 19 February 1983 Sylvia went to the office of BVC and Loh alleged that Sylvia had `stealthily used the telex` and had taken away copies of the telex. Loh, accompanied by a few members of his staff, including Vincent Lim, proceeded to the Dynasty Hotel and asked her to return the copies of the telex. There was an argument which resulted in the police being called. By this time Alan Wong had arrived. They all went to the Central Police Station where a report was lodged against Sylvia and she was arrested. As a result of that report police investigations were conducted. After Sylvia was charged in court she assisted the police in their investigations into the accounts of BVC.
The facts as found by the trial judge on the evidence adduced by the prosecution are these.
At the time of BVC`s incorporation, it was falsely represented to the Registrar of Companies by Loh and Lee that the company had a paid-up capital of S$2m.
The assets of State Carriers sold by Loh to BVC were grossly overstated or fraudulently stated in order to make up part of its paid-up capital of $560,000. The balance of $1.4m was made up of false margin receipts (exh P108) to support a purported payment by BVC to BVF in Hong Kong of margin deposits for commodity futures trading. At most the paid-up capital was only $88,997.85.
As regards the margin receipts (exh P108) which were dated from 21 April 1981 to 25 May 1981 for sums totalling S$1.4m, there was an exchange of letters and telexes in respect of these receipts in a clever attempt to give the impression that margin deposits of $1.4m were in fact paid in Hong Kong into BVF.
Clients of BVC who were interested in trading in gold futures were required, inter alia,to execute a General Agreement for Customer Accounts. Under the agreement, orders placed by clients to purchase or sell futures and commodities were to be executed by BVC, as brokers, through brokerage commission houses and international exchanges including the Hong Kong Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society, the New York Commodity Exchange (COMEX) and Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT).
Before being allowed to trade, clients had to pay margin deposits against orders made by them. They were also required to top-up deposits when these were depleted due to trading losses. Before the gold trading operations began at BVC, Lee explained to Loh three methods of dealing in gold - operating as a commission house, operating partly as a commission house and partly marrying orders where BVC would buy from or sell to the client, and only marrying orders. After discussion Loh agreed to the method of marrying orders after it was explained to him that the profits by such a method would be greater but there would be a corresponding increase in financial risks. Both Loh and Lee agreed that for the time being they would operate BVC as a commission house as BVC than had no cash.
When BVC began its operations on 18 May 1981 it channelled the orders of its clients, but without informing them, through Sun Hung Kai Acli at various times to help BVC place clients` orders and to confirm these orders. BVC earned only a commission from the orders.
After two weeks, it became clear to both Loh and Lee that these commissions were insufficient to meet the operating expenses of BVC as the Company had to pay commissions and margins to Sun Hung Kai Acli for the execution of clients` orders. This led to a quarrel between Loh and Lee over the low profits.
Sometime in June 1981 Loh and Lee decided to `bucket` clients` orders, which meant that BVC was to retain the margin deposits paid by these clients without placing their orders on the market at the various international exchanges and was to meet the clients` orders itself. It kept the commissions paid to BVC on each lot of orders and also absorbed all their clients` losses in gold trading as its own profits. This meant that the directors of BVC were essentially gambling against their own clients. They succeeded in doing this without being discovered by their clients and brokers by adopting various measures.
Clients and brokers were not permitted to enter the operations room. BVC produced telex messages of BVF in Hong Kong purportedly confirming that clients` orders had been placed as requested on the international exchanges. Dealers such as Kelvin Ngai and Abdullah bin Abdul Hadi wore headphones to give the impression that they were receiving the prices of gold from the international exchanges. On one occasion Andy Loho Bun (PW 1) an employee of BVF in Hong Kong, was persuaded by Loh to pretend to be an announcer on the New York COMEX floor to make various announcements of price movements and market conditions.
To reduce the financial risks of such an enterprise, the staff of BVC who operated as dealers were taught to manipulate clients` orders to ensure that clients would suffer losses or earnings with reduced profits.
Prices were largely manipulated by the manner in which the bid and ask prices were announced by the dealers including Lee, Kelvin Ngai and later Abdullah bin Abdul Hadi, who maintained charts of price movements and were in a better position to study market trends.
In May 1982 after Kelvin Ngai left Singapore, to return to Hong Kong, Abdullah bin Abdul Hadi took over as the gold dealer. By that time he was fully aware that BVC was taking positions against its clients as regards trading orders in gold futures. He continued with the trading practice of confirming clients` orders in Singapore and obtaining confirmatory telexes from Hong Kong to convince the clients that the orders had been placed when they were not. The orders were confirmed in less than a minute.
Both the Hong Kong staff and the Singapore staff of BVC knew of the company`s bucketting operations and that there had been no actual trading between BVC and BVF as held out to the clients. It is not possible to believe that Loh, a director of BVC who was in charge of the office, could not have known that the company was taking positions against its own clients.
As the dealers were in fact gambling with their clients, it was important that they had up-to-date information as to the company`s financial position. For this reason a secret Positions Book was maintained by Rosalind Lee (PW6) who was employed as an accounts clerk at BVC from April 1981. This book contained such details as how much was owed to clients, money at hand at BVC, money in the bank and the position as regards floating loans and profits. It was only accessible to the dealers and the BVC`s directors Lee, Loh and Alan Wong and to some of the accounts staff including Eliza Leung and Sylvia Leung. This book was shown to Loh and Lee everyday before trading commenced.
Because BVC was taking positions against its own clients, a company investment account was opened partly to conceal clients` margin deposits retained in the bucketting operations. The margin deposits were used to pay the company`s expenses and were also shared between the directors as profits. Some of the funds in the company`s investment account were used to trade with commission houses such as Sun Hung Kai Acli to cover some of the clients` orders in case BVC lost when taking positions against them.
From the account books kept by BVC it is plain that the bucketting operations were lucrative for BVC and brought about enormous profits. From these bucketting operations the company made a profit of $19,870.56 in May 1981 which rose to $359,089.58 in January 1982.
Between January and September 1982 the profit was $6,604,266.20. During this period, if clients` orders amounting to $8.7m had not been bucketted, BVC would in fact have lost $393,992.10.
Between 7 July 1981 and 31 August 1982 Mdm Chew Swee Poh (PW 15) deposited with BVC as margin deposits $1,062,862.47 in order to trade in gold futures. Between 18 August 1982 and 25 August 1982 she opened another trading account in the name of her son`s fiancee and lost $80,000.
Believing that their gold trading orders would be placed with authorised international gold exchanges, William Tsai paid into BVC $312,128.26 between May and August 1982 Lee Tow Kiat (PW 16) paid $236,298.15 between 28 August 1982 and 13 December 1982 and Michael Choo (PW 14) paid $237,700 between 11 March 1982 and 13 August 1982.
In July 1981 Lee discovered that Loh had made use of company`s moneys for his personal matters. This and other matters, including problems between Loh and Kelvin Ngai in respect of whose conduct Lee was compelled to execute an indemnity on the 15 December 1981 strained the relationship between Loh and Lee which led to Lee (after consulting Loh) inviting Alan Wong to be a director of BVC to provide a check on Loh`s use of company funds.
The evidence of Lee was that when he invited Alan Wong to be a director of BVC he informed Alan Wong that BVC had no working capital, that the paid-up capital of $2m was false, to which Alan Wong replied, `To open a casino when will it close down.` According to Lee, Alan Wong remarked: `Have you seen a casino close shop?` Later he also explained the gold trading operations of BVC and asked Alan Wong if it was unlawful not to put clients` orders in the market as it was in Hong Kong. Alan Wong asked to see the Hong Kong Securities Act. Subsequently after seeing the Act Alan Wong replied that it was not unlawful as there was no commodities trading law in Singapore unlike that in Hong Kong.
When the first lot of shares of BVC was being transferred to Alan Wong at the office of the accountants Wong & Teo, Loh too informed Alan Wong that the company had no money and was gambling with its clients. Alan Wong was subsequently shown the operations room and was told of the methods of operation and he again confirmed that it was not an offence not to put clients` orders through the market.
In December 1981 Alan Wong became the chairman and director of BVC. Lee ceased to be chairman of BVC and on 22 December 1981 he returned to Hong Kong and sent Ho Yuen Tai to Singapore to assist Kelvin Ngai.
Sometime in mid-January 1982 Kelvin Ngai and Ho Yuen Tai went to the law firm of Lee & Lee to see Alan Wong. He took cheques for Alan Wong`s signature and also showed him the secret Positions Book maintained by BVC. Alan Wong was also given a clients` margins list which showed the moneys of the clients, their account numbers and their effective margins or floating losses. Alan Wong examined both the documents. Subsequently the three of them went to a coffee-house at the DBS Building. There Kelvin Ngai asked Wong whether bucketting was illegal in Singapore to which Alan Wong replied that it was not.
From Alan Wong`s first statement to the police, he was aware at least by April 1982 that BVC was engaged in bucketting or was taking positions against its own clients. In his statement to the police on 5 August 1983 Alan Wong spoke of two resolutions dated 13 April 1982 and 16 April 1982 relating to loans made by Loh and Lee to BVC totalling $1.5m. He said he was told by Loh and Lee that the company was short of funds and that they were loaning the money to the company free of interest but did not explain how the shortage came about but hinted that the company lost money through taking positions.
In August 1982 Loh obtained information that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) was about to raid the offices of BVC and was at least going to check BVC`s accounts. Loh then instructed the staff of BVC to photocopy all important accounts and trading documents, including clients` ledger cards, trading balance sheets, daily business reports and record of clients` effective margins. This enabled BVC to continue with operations despite the fact that the MAS had carted away all its books and records when BVC`s office was raided on 29 September 1982.
Loh also requested Lee to come to Singapore to help him to prepare accounts for the benefit of MAS. Lee arrived in Singapore on 12 August 1982 and met both Loh and Alan Wong. The three of them then discussed how the accounts could be rewritten and irregularities in the keeping of records and books corrected for the benefit of MAS. Sylvia Leung and her sister Eliza Leung were recalled to Singapore from Hong Kong to supervise the rewriting of the account books of BVC. They were responsible for preparing false trading statements to give the impression that actual trading had taken place between BVC and BVF.
There was wilful destruction of evidence to prevent the MAS from discovering the offences of cheating and criminal breach of trust committed by the directors of BVC. Telexes and investment ledger cards were destroyed; accounting books and documents including general ledgers and investment ledger cards were rewritten; payment vouchers and margin receipts were falsified; company resolutions were invented. Alan Wong signed two of these resolutions dated 13 April 1982 and 16 April 1982.
The result was that the MAS raid did not result in the discovery of either the defalcations of Loh and Alan Wong or the bucketting of clients` orders. The accounts and supporting documents had been so prepared that on the surface they appeared to have been properly kept. On the instructions of Loh the BVC staff did not reveal the truth as to the trading operations of BVC to the MAS investigators.
By December 1982 Lee decided to sell his shares in BVC. By January 1983 the relationship between Loh and Lee had further deteriorated. On 18 January 1983, Sylvia Leung came to Singapore to inform Loh that BVF wished to terminate its arrangements with BVC and requested him to get a buyer for Lee`s shares in BVC. To persuade Loh to sever BVC`s ties with BVF, she informed him that BVF was in financial difficulties and that if it ceased business the reputation of BVC would also be affected. She suggested that it would be better if both parties mutually terminated the agreement. As a result, Loh instructed Alan Wong to write the letter of termination (exh D 33) and to serve it on Sylvia Leung. However, there were further disputes between Lee and Loh and Alan Wong over the price of Lee`s shares in BVC. Their relationship became worse.
Around 18 February 1983 Sylvia Leung telephoned Loh from Hong Kong and told him that she was coming to settle the accounts between Lee and Loh. She arrived in Singapore on 18 February 1983. She met a very angry Loh who told her that he would not be able to find another company like BVF which would assist BVC in bucketting clients` orders. Sylvia Leung had come to Singapore to square the accounts between BVC and BVF. Lee had sent her to reduce the false margin deposits purportedly held by BVF on behalf of BVC which, on the face of the record, showed a debt by BVF of more than S$600,000.
Following her arrival in Singapore, Sylvia Leung attempted to square accounts by sending false telex orders showing trading losses of $620,400 without the knowledge of Loh and Alan Wong. Later when Loh discovered this, he confronted her at the Dynasty Hotel with a few members of his staff. A commotion that followed resulted in the police being called by the hotel staff. This led to Sylvia Leung`s arrest on a charge of forgery under s 468 of the Penal Code. Police investigations that followed resulted in Loh and Alan Wong being charged. 
 Offences of Criminal breach of trust (CBT) 
The evidence is that the secret profits derived from the bucketting operations of BVC were shared amongst the directors in proportion to their shareholdings - 40-40-20. To avoid detection of these drawings, documents were manufactured and accounting books adjusted to give the impression that the moneys were remitted to BVF in Hong Kong as payment of margin deposits or that they were returns of loans made by the directors to BVC. 
 CBT charges against Loh Shak Mow - first charge 
The evidence was this. On 23 February 1982, a cash cheque (exh P51) for $100,000 was drawn on BVC`s account at the Bangkok Bank. It was signed by Loh and Ho Yuen Tin, who was then Lee`s representative in Singapore. A payment voucher (exh PSIB) of the same date described the $100,000 as payment to BVF and stated that it was `remittance to Hong Kong`. The cheque was cashed by Ho Yuen Tin in Singapore on 23 February 1982 at 2.44pm. $50,000 was in turn deposited into Loh`s personal account with the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) seven minutes later. The balance $50,000 was remitted to Lee and deposited in his personal current account with the American Express Bank in Hong Kong on 27 February 1982. A false margin receipt was issued (exh P51A) dated 23 February 1982 (the date of the cheque) by BVF signed by Sylvia Leung (on the instructions of Lee) for HK$27,226.60, the then equivalent of S$100,000. The margin receipt was dated 23 February 1982, when the moneys were only received in Hong Kong on 27 February 1982. 
 Second charge 
The evidence was this. On 9 March 1983 a cash cheque for $100,000 (exh P52) drawn on BVC`s account with the Bangkok Bank was prepared by Rosalind Lee on Loh`s instructions. It was signed by Ho Yuen Tin and Rosalind Lee. The cheque was cashed by Ho Yuen Tin at 2.20pm on the same day and half the amount $50,000, was deposited in Loh`s account with DBS ten months later. The other $50,000 was remitted to Hong Kong and credited to Lee`s personal account with the American Express Bank. Again, the BVC bank payment voucher described the drawing of the $100,000 as payment to BVF from BVC as `remittance to Hong Kong`. It was thus prepared by Rosalind Lee as Loh had instructed her to treat this amount as a margin deposit. Similar false entries also appear in BVC`s ledge account and cash book. A false margin receipt was issued by BVF for HK$2,272,731.08 (the then equivalent of $100,000) signed by Sylvia Leung dated 9 March 1982 two days before even the moneys were in fact received in Hong Kong by Lee on 11 March 1982. 
 Third charge 
The evidence was this. On 12 March 1982 another cash cheque (exh P53) for $100,000 was drawn on BVC`s account with the Bangkok Bank. The cheque was cashed the same day at 2.33pm. Sixteen minutes later, a sum of $50,000 was deposited into Loh`s personal account with the DBS. However, a bank payment voucher (exh P53B) issued by BVC stated that the $100,000 was remitted to Hong Kong by Ho Yuen Tin to BVF. A false margin receipt (exh P53A) was issued by BVF signed by Sylvia Leung for HK$270,773.36. 
 Fourth charge 
The evidence was this. On 23 March 1982 a cash cheque (exh P54) for $100,000 was drawn on BVC`s account with the Bangkok Bank on Loh`s instruction and it was signed by Ho Yuen Tin and Rosalind Lee. Rosalind Lee was told by Loh to treat it as a margin receipt to BVF. It was cashed in Singapore on the same day at 2.37pm and ten minutes later a sum of $49,000 was deposited into Loh`s DBS account. $50,000 was remitted to Lee.
False accounting documents were prepared: (1) showing that the $100,000 was remitted to BVF as margin deposit; (2) a margin receipt (exh P54A) showing that BVF received HK$273,597.40 (S$100,000) margin deposits signed by Sylvia Leung in August 1982 and backdated to 16 April 1982; (3) a payment voucher dated 23 March 1982 (exh P54B) which was signed by Eliza Leung in August 1982 and in March 1982 as she was then not in Singapore. 
 Fifth charge 
The evidence was this. On 2 April 1982 another cash cheque (exh P55) for $100,000 was drawn on BVC`s account with the Bangkok Bank on Loh`s instructions. It was signed by Ho Yuen Tin and Rosalind Lee. The bank payment voucher (exh P55B) dated 1 April 1982 which was approved by Loh who signed on it, indicated that the $100,000 was `remittance to Hong Kong by Mr Ho Yuen Tin` and the payee was BVF. The cheque, however, was cashed in Singapore on 2 April 1982 at 2.56pm. Twenty-three minutes later $49,000 was deposited in Loh`s personal account with the DBS. On 6 April 1982 the remaining S$50,000 was paid into Lee`s personal account with the American Express Bank in Hong Kong. 
 Sixth charge 
The evidence was this. On 22 April 1982 a cash cheque for $400,000 (exh P56) was drawn on BVC`s account with the Hong Kong & Shanghai Banking Corp (HSBC). The cheque was signed by Loh and Kelvin Ngai. The two of them then cashed the cheque on the same day. Sixteen minutes after the cheque was cashed, Loh deposited $190,000 into his personal account with the DBS. Another $200,000 was sent by Kelvin Ngai by telegraphic transfer to BVF`s account at the HSBC in Hong Kong. The entire sum was taken out the same day and credited to Lee`s personal account with the HSBC Hong Kong. However, the payment voucher (exh P56B) issued by BVC, which was `approved` by Loh, made it appear that the whole of the $400,000 was paid to BVF as `trading loss`. 
 Seventh charge 
The evidence was this. On 27 April 1982 a cash cheque for $200,000 (exh P57) was drawn on BVC`s account with the HSBC, Singapore. The cheque was signed by Ho Yuen Tin and Loh. It was cashed on the same day and $100,000 was deposited into Loh`s personal account with the American Express Bank and the remaining $100,000 was sent to Lee in Hong Kong and credited to his personal account with the American Express Bank in Hong Kong.
Despite the fact that the whole of the $200,000 had been distributed equally between Loh and Lee, the bank payment voucher (exh P57B) issued by BVC described that sum as payment to BVF in respect of a `trading loss` and a margin receipt (exh P57A), also dated 27 April 1982 purported to show that the entire sum of S$200,000 (HK$549,024.60) was received by BVF. 
 Eighth charge 
The evidence was this. On 14 May 1982 another cash cheque of $100,000 (exh P58) was drawn on BVC`s account into the HSBC, Singapore. It was signed by Ho Yuen Tin and Loh. A bank statement voucher (exh P58B) of the same date stated that the $100,000 was `payment for remittance to Hong Kong` with the payee named as BVF. The voucher was approved by Loh, whose signature appears on it. However, the cheque was cashed on the same day at 10.32am and 24 minutes later half the amount, $50,000, was banked in Loh`s personal account with the DBS. The other half, $50,000, was sent to Lee in Hong Kong and credited to his personal account with the HSBC, Hong Kong.
A false margin receipt was issued by BVF (exh P58A) dated 13 May 1982 signed by Sylvia Leung purported to show that the entire sum of $100,000 (HK$274,174.92) was received by BVF. The cheque itself was cashed on 14 May 1982 a day later. 
 Ninth charge 
The evidence was this. On 13 July 1982 another cash cheque (exh P59) for $60,000 was drawn on BVC`s account with the HSBC. It was signed by Ho Yuen Tin and Loh. A bank payment voucher (exh P59B), also dated 13 July 1982 stated that this sum was `remittance to Hong Kong as trading deposit`. However, $30,000 was deposited into Loh`s personal account with the DBS and the remaining $30,000 was sent by telegraphic transfer to BVF and this sum was subsequently deposited into Lee`s personal account. Again a false margin receipt (exh P59A) for HK$163,010.54 (S$60,000) signed by Sylvia Leung was issued by BVF. 
 Eleventh charge 
The evidence was this. On 31 August 1982 a cash cheque (exh P61) for $300,000 was drawn on BVC`s account with HSBC. It was signed by Lee Kwong Fai and Rosalind Lee. The bank payment voucher (exh P61 A) issued by BVC stated that the said sum represented a `deposit to BVFI` and that this sum was received by Lee Kwong Fai. Both Lee Kwong Fai and Loh signed the voucher as having approved it and Lee Kwong Fai also signed as the recipient of the $300,000. Entries in both BVC`s Cash Book II and the general ledger give the appearance that the $300,000 was paid to BVF.
The cheque was cashed in Singapore on the same day by Lee Kwong Fai who was accompanied by Loh. After the cheque was cashed Lee Kwong Fai took half the amount and gave the other half to Loh. In his statement to the police Loh did not deny receiving the money but stated that he was paid because he had `at times` settled Lee Kwong Fai`s gambling debts. 
 Twelfth charge 
The evidence was this. On 17 September 1982 S$356,800 (HK$1m) was sent to BVF from BVC`s account at the HSBC on Loh`s instructions. This telegraphic transfer was authorised by Alan Wong, Lee Kwong Fai and Rosalind Lee whose signatures appear on the telegraphic transfer form (exhs P62 and P62A). A copy of the telegraphic transfer form (exh P62A) was used as a bank payment voucher. This remittance of $356,800 was treated as a margin deposit to BVF in BVC`s books on Loh`s instructions to Rosalind Lee. A false margin receipt (exh P62B) dated 16 September 1982 for HK$1m was issued by BVF signed by Sylvia Leung who forged the signature of one Stella So.
On the same day another cheque (exh P62C) drawn on BVF`s account with HSBC in Hong Kong for HK$ m was issued to one Kenny Hioe. This cheque was then deposited on 17 September 1982 into the personal account of one Kenny Hioe in the Citibank.
It was not in dispute that Kenny Hioe was a friend of Loh. The HK$1m was deposited into Kenny Hioe`s account on Loh`s instructions and was to be used to pay for the shares of Lee and Loh in Artapala, a new gold trading company that they had intended to form in Hong Kong.
By 4 October 1982, BVC moneys equivalent to HK$2m had been paid into Kenny Hioe`s bank account in Hong Kong. The entire sum was returned to Kenny Hioe through a Citibank cheque and was duly acknowledged in writing by Loh and Lee on 13 October 1982. Loh`s bank statement from the Citibank for October 1982 (exh P63G) and a bank deposit slip (exh P63G) show that the sum of HK$2m was paid into Loh`s account on 13 October 1982. According to Lee, he did not receive any portion of it as Loh kept the HK$2m and said that he would retain it on behalf of Lee for safe-keeping. 
 CBT Charges against both Loh Shak Mow and Alan Wong 
(The tenth charge against Loh and the first charge against Alan Wong.)
The evidence was this. On 25 August 1982 a cash cheque (exh P60) for $200,000 was drawn on BVC`s account with HSBC. The cheque was signed by Alan Wong and Rosalind Lee. The purpose of the drawing was falsely stated in the bank payment voucher (exh P60A), dated 25 August 1982 as `being payment for returning to Loan Account`. The payee was stated as Lee. This payment was approved by Alan Wong who signed in the column `Approved by` in the payment voucher Exh P60A. Lee signed the voucher as the recipient of the $200,000.
The cheque exh P60 was cashed on the same day at 2.38pm at the HSBC at Robinson Road by Lee and Loh. Lee took $80,000 and another $80,000 was deposited into Loh`s personal account with the DBS Shenton Way where Alan Wong was paid his share of $40,000 and this sum was paid into Alan Wong`s personal account with the DBS 27 minutes after the cheque was cashed. The distribution of the $200,000 was proportionate to the shareholdings of Loh, Lee and Alan Wong in BVC: 40%-40%-20%.
When questioned by the police Loh`s response to this charge was the same as that for the third charge, namely, that these moneys were gambling debts that were being settled by Lee.
Alan Wong made various statements to Supt Bakar Moosa and to ASP Henry Soh (PW 19) between 1 August 1983 and 7 March 1984. He at first denied having received any money other than his director`s fees. He also insisted that he was unaware if BVC made any profits in 1981 and 1982. In his statement under Notice of Warning, he admitted he had received the $40,000 which he stated were `the mid-year profits of the company`. 
 Thirteenth charge against Loh Shak Mow and the second charge against Alan Wong 
The evidence was this. On 4 October 1982 a sum of S$700,000 (HK$2.046m) was sent by telegraphic transfer (exh P63) to BVF in Hong Kong from BVC`s account with the HSBC. The telegraphic transfer was signed by Lee and Rosalind Lee. Prior to this Loh had telephoned Sylvia Leung in Hong Kong and had instructed her to deposit HK$1m in Kenny Hioe`s account when she received the HK2.046m, and to put the balance in Alan Wong`s account with the Hang Lung Bank in Hong Kong. Sylvia Leung was furnished by telex with Alan Wong`s account number with the Hang Lung Bank in Hong Kong. Loh`s instructions to his accounts clerk at BVC, Rosalind Lee, was to treat the $700,000 as margin deposits to BVF. False margin receipts (exh P63AB) were subsequently issued by BVF.
On the same day (4 October 1982) a cash cheque (exh P63B) for HK$1m was drawn on BVF`s account with the HSBC, Hong Kong. The cheque was cashed and a cashier`s order for the same amount was purchased in the name of Kenny Hioe. On 5 October 1982, HK$1m was deposited in Kenny Hioe`s account with the Citibank.
The balance of HK$1.046m was then withdrawn from BVF`s account with the HSBC, Hong Kong, by the use of a cash cheque (exh P63J) dated 4 October 1982. This was in turn used to purchase a cashier`s order (exh P63K) for the same amount of HK$1.046m in the name of Alan Wong on 5 October 1982. This sum was paid into Alan Wong`s personal account with the Hang Lung Bank in Hong Kong.
On 9 October 1982 Loh and Alan Wong went to BVF`s offices in Hong Kong. There they filled up share transfer forms as Lee had intended to transfer some of his shares in a Hong Kong Company called Linkrich to Loh and Alan Wong. Linkrich was a trading company which Lee had started in 1980 or 1981 and which had done some import and export business. A certified copy of the Change of Particulars of Directors shows that on 9 October 1982 Lee declared a change of directors and shareholders in that Loh and Alan Wong had been appointed directors on 1 September 1982. According to this declaration, Loh and Alan Wong had 600,000 shares each in Linkrich, with Lee retaining 599,999 and BVF the remaining 199,999 shares.
Later in the morning of 9 October 1982, Loh and Alan Wong with Sylvia Leung proceeded to the Hang Lung Bank in Hong Kong where Alan Wong maintained a personal account. Alan Wong then drew a cash cheque (exh P63) on his account at the bank for HK$1.046m, the amount that had been credited to his account on 5 October 1982 by Sylvia Leung from the HK$2.046m remitted from BVC by Loh. Loh had asked Alan Wong to make out the cash cheque and pay the cash into Linkrich account as people could not trace where the cash had come from. The entire sum of HK$1.046m was then used by Alan Wong to open a bank account for Linkrich Ltd.
Upon receiving a cheque book for the Linkrich account, Alan Wong immediately issued another cash cheque (exh P63P) drawn on the Linkrich account and withdraw HK$500,000. This amount was then deposited in his personal account with the Hang Lung Bank. Alan Wong then left instructions with Sylvia Leung to whom he gave his calling card on which was written his DBS Singapore account number, to send by telegraphic transfer the HK$500,000. (S$169,713.17) to his account in Singapore. This was done and the equivalent of S$169,713.17 was credited to Alan Wong`s account in Singapore on 12 October 1982. (This is the second charge against Alan Wong.)
Loh, who had remained in Hong Kong, issued another cheque (exh P63W) to himself on 12 October 1982 drawn on the Linkrich account and withdrew HK$200,000. This sum was then deposited into his personal account with the Citibank, Hong Kong. Lee similarly withdrew HK$200,000 from the Linkrich account.
Loh, in his statement to the police, did not deny that out of the $700,000 remitted from BVC to BVF on 4 October 1982 a total sum of $393,487.83 was taken by him.
In his police statement, Alan Wong explained that in late August 1982 Loh and Lee had requested him to remit the equivalent of 2 million pesos as capital for Broadview (Philippines) and that this sum was supposed to be a loan from him to the Company. Loh and Lee had guaranteed repayment. Accordingly, he remitted S$517,000 (2 million pesos) to Broadview (Philippines). In October 1982 he had been paid HK$500,000 (S$170,000) `as part reimbursement of my loan of S$517,000` either by Lee or Sylvia Leung in Hong Kong and had then remitted the amount to his account with the DBS Singapore. 
 Fourteenth charge against Loh Shak Mow and the third and fourth charges against Alan Wong 
The evidence was this. On 10 December 1982 on Loh`s instructions, Rosalind Lee sent by telegraphic transfer (exh P64) S$133,000 (HK$400,000) to BVF. Loh led her to believe that the sum represented a margin deposit to be placed with BVF but no margin receipt was ever issued by BVF. In fact it was a drawing of Lee from BVC. This sum was credited to the account of BVF at the HSBC on 11 December 1982. Loh asked Sylvia Leung (who was then in Singapore) to check if there were sufficient funds in the company`s account to pay him and Alan Wong as well.
Loh was, like Lee, to receive $133,000 and Alan Wong 20% of all drawings. According to Sylvia Leung, Loh, however, insisted that Alan Wong was to receive 20% of $266,600 or the total amount that had been drawn by Lee and Loh. After checking the accounts of BVC with the Mitsui Bank and the HSBC, Sylvia Leung thought that there was $150,000 in the Mitsui Bank and $37,000 in the HSBC. Rosalind Lee therefore prepared a cheque (exh P65) for $37,000 on BVC`s account with the HSBC. This cheque was signed by Rosalind Lee and Alan Wong. The accompanying payment voucher (exh P65A), also dated 13 December 1982 and signed by Sylvia Leung in Singapore, falsely held out the $37,000 payment as `margin deposit` to BVF. Similar false entries were also made in BVC`s Cash Book and Ledger.
Sylvia Leung said that she did not cash the cheque for $37,000 although she endorsed it at Loh`s request. Loh informed her that Alan Wong had requested her assistance in this regard. On 13 December 1982 after endorsing the cheque exh P65 she gave the cheque back to Loh. However, the particulars entered on the reverse of this cheque (exh P65) show that the cheque was cashed on 14 December 1982 at 2.35pm. Fifteen minutes later, at 2.50pm a sum of $35,000 was deposited into Alan Wong`s DBS account.
On 13 December 1982 Rosalind Lee prepared another cash cheque (exh P66) for $150,000 on BVC`s account with the Mitsui Bank. This cheque was signed by Alan Wong and Rosalind Lee. BVC`s payment voucher for this sum could not be traced by the prosecution. There is, however, an entry in the Cash Book on 13 December 1982 which states payment voucher as `220/12`. According to Sylvia Leung, the particulars recorded on that voucher too were that it was a payment as `margin deposit`.
Sylvia Leung`s evidence was that she cashed the cheque exh P66 and handed the $150,000 to Loh. After having had lunch with Loh and Alan Wong she returned to the office of BVC. At about 4pm when Alan Wong came to BVC she entered Loh`s room and told Loh that from the $150,000 she had given him, he had to give Alan Wong $16,340 and another $330 to Lee. She then saw Loh take some money out of his pocket and handed the money to Alan Wong who returned some change. Loh then handed to her $330 which he asked her to take to Hong Kong for Lee.
A DBS deposit slip (exh P66A) and Loh`s DBS bank statement for December 1982 show that a sum of $145,000 in cash was deposited into Loh`s account on 14 December 1982.
From the $133,000 sent by telegraphic transfer exh P64 to BVF, the Mitsui Bank cash cheque exh P66 for $150,000 and the HSBC cash cheque exh P65 for $37,000, totalling $320,000, Lee received $133,000, Loh $133,300 and Alan Wong $53,340.
Loh did not deny in his statements to the police that he had taken the moneys stated in any of the fourteen charges of criminal breach of trust.
Alan Wong had, when questioned by the police during the earlier interviews, denied having received any profits or other payments from BVC, apart from his director`s fees. It was on 6 September 1983 that he admitted that he had received dividends from BVC and that the $35,000 cash deposited into his bank account on 14 December 1983 `could have been the dividend from BVC received by me in December 1982 and possibly handed over by Sylvia`. He also stated that the Mitsui Bank cheque exh P66 for $150,000 was `the end of the year declaration of dividends`.
In respect of the $16,340 (the subject of the third charge) Alan Wong stated in his statement under Notice of Warning that he was `not aware whether this sum was paid to me or for what purpose`.
At the end of the prosecution case, Mr Gilbert Gray QC, counsel for Loh, submitted that the direction given by Lord Diplock in 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  as to the test to be applied when dealing with a submission of `no case to answer` was clearly wrong and that despite Lord Diplock`s direction the duty of the court to determine whether the prosecution has established a prima facie case beyond reasonable doubt remains.
The district judge shared counsel`s view that Lord Diplock`s directions were clearly in error, but said that he was bound by the directions as the Singapore Court of Criminal Appeal has since ruled in 
 Abdul Ghani v PP 
 
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 93
  that the directions of Lord Diplock are not obiterand are binding on all courts in Singapore.
Having considered the totality of the prosecution evidence the district judge was clearly of the view that the prosecution had established a prima facie case which, if unrebutted, would warrant the conviction of both the accused on all the charges that they were being tried. He therefore called on them to make their defence. 
 Defence of Loh Shak Mow 
Loh testified on oath that in February 1981 he had met Lee in Hong Kong. Lee had said that he had five to six years` experience in gold trading and was one of the leaders in the Hong Kong Exchange and that he wanted to incorporate a gold trading company in Singapore. Subsequently, in the same month, Lee came to Singapore and met Loh, Alan Wong and the managing director of Golden Hope, a gold trading company. After they had observed gold trading at the premises of Golden Hope, Lee and Loh agreed to form a gold trading company. His own company, State Carriers, was not doing well because of the slump in the shipping business. As Lee could not obtain office premises for the new gold trading company, he suggested that State Carriers cease business and that its premises be used for the new company to be called Broadview Commodities (BVC).
He told Lee that he wanted $550,000 for State Carriers` assets. He admitted that State Carriers had never paid $70,000 for renovation nor for the other assets stated in the list of assets. He denied giving any instructions in the preparation of the list of assets or even of having seen it. He agreed that the authorised capital of $2m of BVC was to be made up of $1m from himself and $1m from Lee. As Lee had accepted a valuation of State Carriers`s assets at $500,000, the balance was to be paid in cash. He raised over $200,000 in cash and borrowed another $20,000 from a Hong Kong friend. $1.44m including his $400,000 was placed with BVF Hong Kong as margin deposits (exh P108). He denied that the margin receipts that were issued by BVC in respect of the $1.44m were false documents. According to him, it was not possible for the margin receipts to be false because a company which was as large as BVF `would not give out margin receipts `anyhow`.` He also relied on the exchange of letters (exhs P109 and P109A) and telexes (exhs P110 and P110A) between himself and BVF.
Lee had assured him that BVF would be an agent for BVC and that BVF would place all the Singapore orders in other markets and confirm these orders as quickly as possible. BVC had begun its operations on 20 May 1981, initially with Sun Hung Kai Acli in Singapore. The hot-line telex between BVC and BVF was set up in June 1981 and when orders were sent out on the telex, he was told that BVF would send the orders to other broking firms.
He stated that on 13 April 1982 it had been resolved that BVC would accept a loan of $700,000 from him and Lee - $350,000 each. On 16 April 1982 another loan of $400,000 each was given as working capital. These loans were given because BVF had wanted margins and margin receipts were issued in Hong Kong.
As soon as he came to know Lee, the two of them used to gamble at poker, horse-racing, mahjong and all kinds of gambling. In April or May 1982 Lee owed him over S$1m.
In September 1982 he and Lee decided to set up another Hong Kong company called Linkrich to deal in canned goods and trade between China and the Philippines. Subsequently, with some friends in Hong Kong, he and Lee had wanted to set up another gold futures company in Hong Kong with a capital of HK$7m and between themselves Lee and Loh were to pay HK$2m. When the company was not incorporated, the $2m was eventually paid into his bank account in Hong Kong because `Kenny Hioe paid Lee who repaid me what he owed me`.
Loh further testified that in 1982 he contacted Far East Computers to set up a computer system for all accounts at BVC. As the computer company needed to look into the account books constantly and some of these books were always wanted in the BVC office, he had given instructions for them to be photocopied. He denied that these were prepared for purpose or that he had instructed anyone to rewrite or destroy accounting books. He had only instructed frivolous telexes which stated `good morning` and contained love messages to be destroyed and he put the operations room in order as telexes had all been placed at random in the operations room. When a telex was sent by BVC to BVF a copy of the message would be available to BVF. Similarly BVF would have a copy of their telexes sent to BVC. Copies of any incriminating telexes would therefore be available in Hong Kong.
He never asked Lee or Eliza Leung to come to Singapore to assist him to make preparations for the impending MAS raid. In fact he had no knowledge that there was going to be a raid. He also denied that he asked members of his staff including Chen Ah Kong or Rosalind Lee to lie to the MAS. On the day of the raid he was in the Philippines.
After the MAS raid business at BVC was as usual. The system of business did not change in any way.
On 19 January 1983 Sylvia Leung and Lee`s father came to Singapore to get more margin deposits. Loh had the impression that they had come to borrow money and he was not happy about this as BVC had margins in Hong Kong. At their meeting Alan Wong was also present. He wanted to know the accounts between BVC and BVF and was annoyed when Sylvia Leung was not able to tell him. He told Sylvia Leung that she should have brought the accounts with her as she had come to see BVC`s accounts. He told Sylvia Leung that after the accounts were settled all future orders would be placed with a Singapore firm instead of BVF. He emphasised that he was the first to mention the termination of business between BVC and BVF and told Sylvia Leung that he would do so through his solicitors.
A letter of termination of the agreement sent by BVC`s solicitors dated 19 January 1983 (exh D 33) was sent to BVF giving one month`s notice of such termination to take effect on 19 February 1983. BVC`s solicitors received a letter dated 1 February 1983 from BVF`s solicitors in Hong Kong (exh D 34) agreeing to the termination.
On 18 February 1983 he saw Sylvia Leung again in Singapore but he did not know the reason for her visit. He asked her to return the margins that BVC had with BVF as business was to be terminated on the following day. He had left firm instructions with his staff that Sylvia Leung was not to see the accounts or touch the telex machines. However, on 19 February 1983 he was informed that Sylvia Leung had stealthily used the telex. He proceeded with some of his staff to see Sylvia Leung at the Dynasty Hotel. He asked her to return the copy of the telex but she refused. There was an argument which resulted in the police being called. They all went to the police station. There he asked Vincent Lim to make the report.
He then telephoned Lee in Hong Kong and asked how Lee was going to settle the matter of the false telex sent by Sylvia Leung. Lee said that they should talk over the matter slowly. Lee first said `don`t charge Sylvia` and he would send the margins to Singapore and they could settle the matter slowly. No agreement was arrived at and he subsequently commenced civil proceedings against BVF in respect of a claim of $763,211.63, the amount of the false orders sent by Sylvia Leung to Hong Kong on 19 February 1983.
Loh reiterated that he was never in charge of the trading operations at BVC and that it was the Hong Kong persons including Lee, Kelvin Ngai and Ho Yuen Tin who did. It was Lee who was all along managing the operations. He had no reason to suspect that the orders at BVC were not being sent to BVF for execution and denied deceiving any clients or brokers of BVC. He was never told by Lee anything of bucketting or marrying or crossing orders. As BVC turned over millions of dollars worth of gold, Abdullah bin Abdul Hadi (who was only an office boy at State Carriers) and Chen Ah Kong were not `mentally equipped to do bucketting against clients`.
Loh stated that he was never dishonest in any way when he dealt with clients or brokers and he never had a single complaint from any of his clients at BVC. He stated that some of the clients including Mdm Chew (PW 15), Michael Choo (PW 14), Lee Tow Kiat (PW 16) and William Tsai, had previous experience in gold trading and could not easily be deceived.
In respect of the CBT Charges, Loh maintained his innocence. His evidence was that most of these moneys were amounts given to him by Lee for his gambling debts. Lee had, since 1981, gambled `big` between $100,000 and $200,000 and the two of them had indulged in various forms of gambling and had gambled in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Lee had borrowed $70,000 or $80,000 and at times over $100,000 from him at the race course. From February to August 1982 the total amount Lee owed him was S$1.2m.
Loh pointed out that whenever BVC paid out the amounts set out in the CBT charges, margin receipts were issued. Lee repaid his gambling debts in instalments. He paid some in Hong Kong and in Singapore. He would also `pay back part of BVC`s margins sent to Hong Kong and make up the balance`. When he received money he therefore believed it was his money repaid to him by Lee. Any money he received through Lee or BVF or BVC he thought was repayment of Lee`s gambling debt to him.
Loh gave more details in respect of the charges that he jointly faced with Alan Wong. According to him in late August 1982 there was a gambling session which went on for three to five days at the Dynasty Hotel, Singapore. Lee and others from Hong Kong and Taiwan participated. Lee lost to almost everybody and his losses totalled over $100,000. Loh won $20,000 to $30,000. The losses of Lee were `put in my account as Lee did not know the others well`. Lee later asked if he could `take some money from BVC first and pay the debts`.
Lee asked if there could be a distribution of the profits of BVC. Loh told Lee to speak to Alan Wong as he could not make the decision. Loh had no objection to the payment if there was money.
On the following day Loh received $80,000 (subject of the tenth CBT charge against Loh). He thought that it represented profits made by the Company. He paid the $80,000 into his DBS account. He denied going with Lee to cash the cheque and giving Alan Wong part of the money. He denied seeing the cheque exh P60 for $200,000 or the bank Payment voucher exh P60A, which in fact stated that the $200,000 (which had been distributed amongst the three directors) was a payment to Lee alone `for returning to loan account`.
In 1982 Loh and Lee decided to set up another gold trading company in Manila called Broadview (Philippines) and in connection with this Alan Wong had paid 2 million pesos ($517,000) towards the capital of Broadview (Philippines). The two of them were to repay Alan Wong later for this transaction and this was done.
In respect of the fourteenth charge against Loh (third and fourth charge against Alan Wong) Loh admitted that the $145,000 cash credited to his account on 14 December 1982 (DBS deposit slip exh P66A) included the $133,330 stated in the charge.
Loh gave the following explanation. He had nothing to do with the signing of any document relating to this payment. After Sylvia Leung arrived from Hong Kong, Lee telephoned him and asked if he could get an advance from the company. Loh said that he would speak to Alan Wong and informed Alan Wong of Lee`s request. Alan Wong said he would decide after Sylvia Leung had arrived. He did not know what happened but subsequently Sylvia Leung handed him the $133,000 which he understood to be `in advance from BVC`.
Loh denied having been dishonest with moneys entrusted to BVC. 
 Defence of Alan Wong 
Alan Wong testified that in April 1981 whilst he was working as an advocate and solicitor with Lee & Lee he had acted in the incorporation of BVC. He had also applied for the company to be an associate member of the Gold Exchange of Singapore.
In December 1981 he was informed that there was a dispute between Loh and Lee as regards Kelvin Ngai. He was asked by Loh to go to the office of BVC to settle the dispute. Loh had accused Kelvin Ngai of dishonesty. Lee told Loh that he had employed Kelvin Ngai and would be responsible for all the deeds of Kelvin Ngai, as a result of which an indemnity was prepared and executed by Lee on 15 December 1981.
That same day (15 December 1981) following a telephone call from Lee he met Lee at the Cockpit Hotel Coffee House at about 10pm. Lee told him of the strained relationship between Lee and Loh. Lee invited him to become a director and chairman of BVC and would transfer 10% of his shares in BVC to him and would ask Loh to do the same. Lee said that he would be paid director`s fees of $5,000 per month.
Alan Wong emphasised that that night at the Cockpit Hotel Lee did not disclose to him that the paid-up capital of BVC was false or that BVC was involved in bucketting. Lee also did not tell him of the financial situation of BVC. He was only told that Lee had made a market survey in respect of gold trading in Singapore and that BVC, if properly run, `would have potential`.
On 16 December 1981 Loh and Lee transferred 100,000 shares each to Alan Wong and in December 1982 a further 200,000 were similarly transferred to him.
Alan Wong maintained that to his knowledge BVC had not been involved in bucketting clients` orders and that he did not at any time suspect that BVC was doing so. He knew little of BVC`s trading operations. He had had no discussions with the BVC staff about the trading operations. Alan Wong denied that when Kelvin Ngai visited him with Ho Yuen Tin in January 1982 they had discussed the legality of bucketting at BVC. Nor had he discussed this matter with Rosalind Lee in August 1983.
On 19 June 1983 Alan Wong wrote on behalf of BVC to BVF (exh D 33) on the instructions of Loh, giving notice of termination of agreement between the two Companies. On the following day he gave the letter to Sylvia Leung at the Mayflower Restaurant at Shenton Way and she signed an acknowledgment on the duplicate of the letter. She remarked that it would take time to render the accounts as required by BVC. BVF subsequently replied to the letter D 33 through their solicitors on 1 February 1983 (exh D 34). When BVF failed to return the margin deposits, legal action was commenced against the company in Hong Kong. As BVC has been wound up the action is in abeyance.
Alan Wong also stated that BVC had also taken legal action against the clients who did not make good their losses. Legal action was commenced against Mdm Chew Swee Poh in 1982 in Singapore.
The defence of Mdm Chew was that BVC had bucketted her orders and her solicitors had applied for discovery, before pleadings, of all the trading orders of Madam Chew. Copies of her application and affidavit were sent to BVC for instructions but Alan Wong received no response. Alan Wong had further consulted American solicitors to determine the existence of confirmatory telexes from the floor of COMEX.
In respect of the first charge against Alan Wong, his evidence was that in August 1982 he visited Loh, Lee, Kenny Hioe and a few others at the Dynasty Hotel in Singapore. They were playing cards. He was told by Loh that Lee had lost $80,000 during the gambling session and Lee wanted to borrow money from BVC to pay off his debt but Loh was not agreeable unless all the directors drew from the profits of the company in proportion to their shareholdings. Alan Wong did not object to Loh`s proposal.
Alan Wong admitted to being a signatory to the cheque exh P60 for $200,000 which was made out to Lee. He agreed that he had signed the bank payment voucher exh P60A which falsely stated that the payment of $200,000 was to Lee and was a return of the loan to Lee. His explanation was that Rosalind Lee had asked him to sign both the cheque and the payment voucher. He had asked her why they had been prepared in `this way` and she told him that she had been instructed by Lee to prepare them. He stated that when he signed the cheque and the payment voucher he had no reason to suspect that there was no such loan account in BVC from which the amount could be paid off. Loh had mentioned that the sums were paid out as distribution of profits. He did not know if there had been any distribution of profits before this.
In respect of the second charge of CBT of $169,713.17, Alan Wong`s evidence was that in July 1982 there were proposals for BVC to set up gold trading operations in Malaysia and in the Philippines. He went to Manila with Loh to set up Broadview (Philippines) Incorporated. The paid-up capital of Broadview (Philippines) which was to be 2 million pesos was to come from Singapore. Alan Wong said he sent S$513,774.50, the equivalent of 2 million pesos to the Philippines from his DBS account (see exh D10) on 13 August 1982. He maintained that although the 2 million pesos were advanced by him, the investment in BV (Philippines) was intended to be `an investment of BVC and not of the three directors personally`. He had advanced these moneys at the request of Lee and Loh.
On 8 October 1982 when he was with Loh and Lee in the Philippines, he asked for the repayment of the moneys he had advanced to BV (Philippines). Lee told him that he would sort out the payment in Hong Kong on the following day. On the morning of 9 October 1982 he met Lee in the office of BVF and asked about the repayment. Lee then informed him that he had earlier on deposited HK$1,046,783.63 into Alan Wong`s personal account with the Hang Lung Bank in Hong Kong. Alan Wong stated that when Lee told him that he felt it was `rather strange` when he first heard it but Lee showed him a bank pay-in-slip (exh P63L) confirming the deposit into his account.
Alan Wong maintained that it was on 9 October 1982 that he came to know of a Hong Kong company called Linkrich. He was invited to be a director of that Company by Lee and Sylvia Leung and had agreed. Loh similarly became a director of Linkrich. Lee and Loh were to be the signatories of Linkrich`s cheques. Sylvia Leung had showed him the application forms for the opening of a bank account for Linkrich which Lee had signed and he and Loh signed the forms in front of the bank officer.
Lee then asked Alan Wong for a cheque for the same amount of HK$1.04m that had been paid into his account to be used as the paid-up capital of Linkrich. He drew a cheque for that amount and handed it to Sylvia Leung. This cheque was to be deposited into Linkrich`s bank account to be opened at the Hang Lung Bank. Lee told him that after the $1.04m had been transferred to Linkrich account Alan Wong could draw a cheque for HK500,000 in respect of his disbursement to Broadview (Philippines). At the Hang Lung Bank his cheque was cleared into the account of Linkrich and he then issued a cheque for HK500,000 (exh P61) on the account of Linkrich. He had made out a cash cheque as the bank officer had told him that it would facilitate the transfer into his personal account. He denied the evidence of Sylvia Leung that he had made out this cash cheque on Loh`s advice so that the source of the money could not be traced. The sum of HK500,000 (S$169,713.17) was eventually remitted to his DBS account in Singapore.
Alan Wong denied ever receiving the sum of $16,340, the subject matter of the 
 third charge. 
In respect of the 
 fourth charge 
 of CBT of $37,000, Alan Wong admitted that he had received the sum. His version was that in the first week of December 1982 Sylvia Leung came to Singapore from Hong Kong and asked for a loan from BVC as BVF had cash flow problems. Loh was reluctant to give any loan but upon Sylvia Leung`s pleas it was agreed that a loan of HK$400,000 was to be advanced to BVF. Subsequently, Sylvia Leung wanted more. Loh then informed her that payments made to Lee, Loh and Alan Wong, in drawings, had to be proportionate to the director`s shareholdings in BVC.
On 13 December 1982, upon receipt of a telephone call from Rosalind Lee, Alan Wong went to BVC where he was asked to sign two cheques for $37,000 (exh P65) and $150,000 (exh P66). Rosalind Lee informed him that these two cheques had been prepared on the instructions of Loh and that the cheque for $37,000 was meant for him. He understood that the cheque of $37,000 was his share of the drawings made in the proportion of 40-40-20 as it was `roughly half of half of $250,000`. He had since realized that on such a calculation he should in fact have received $37,500. As he needed cash and he was busy he gave the cheque P65 to Rosalind Lee to cash it for him. On the following day, Sylvia Leung handed him cash of $37,000. When reminded by his counsel that Lee had in fact not received $75,000 from the $150,000 cheque P. 66 Alan Wong`s response was that `my presumption about the fact of distribution of profits must be wrong`.
Alan Wong maintained that no allegation of dishonesty had ever been made against him in his life.
 Evidence of the defence witnesses 
Three witnesses were called by Loh: Zee Sei Leung (DW3), Au-Yang Mei Yuk (DW4) and Wilfred Douglas Anthony (DW5). The trial judge was of the view that none of these witnesses were able to support the defence of either Loh or Alan Wong. 
 The appeal of Loh Shak Mow 
The first point taken by Mr Gray for the appellant is that the trial judge ought to have found no case to answer.
Counsel made the same submission on 
 Haw Tua Tau`s 
 case as he did before the trial judge, submitting that the direction given by Lord Diplock as to the test to be applied when dealing with a submission of `no case to answer` is clearly wrong and that despite Lord Diplock`s direction the duty of the Court to determine whether the prosecution has established a prima facie case beyond reasonable doubt remains.
This point can be disposed off shortly. I must regard myself for the purpose of this appeal bound by the decision of the Singapore Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Abdul Ghani v PP 
 
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 93
  that the directions of the Privy Council are not obiterand are binding on all courts in Singapore. The trial judge was right in applying the test laid down by the Privy Council in 
 Haw Tua Tau`s 
 case and he was in my view, correct that on the totality of the prosecution evidence the prosecution had established a prima facie case.
The next point taken by counsel is that there was wrongful admission of secondary evidence.
The complaint is that the trial judge failed to accede to the repeated objections of counsel for the appellant that secondary evidence of the contents of documents was being given contrary to the Evidence Act, ss 61 to 65. Documents, telexes, bank accounts and orders in Hong Kong concerning BVF and Lee Kwong Fai should be properly proved. There was abundant evidence that vital documents existed and were available but they were not produced with the result that the cross-examination was hopelessly impeded. The defence were seriously disadvantaged in their attempt to show that if there was dishonesty it was in Hong Kong.
Counsel said that an important part of the prosecution case was that incriminating copies of telexes were destroyed in Singapore on the orders of Loh. Much emphasis was placed on the contents of the destroyed telexes by the prosecution and the trial judge attached great importance to this topic to the detriment of Loh. The originals of these telexes existed in Hong Kong but were never produced.
Counsel for the respondent said that the documents that the appellants requested for were raised during cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses. Two months before the trial the prosecution made available to the defence whatever documents it had in its possession and in fact instructing solicitors for both the appellants came and inspected all the documents that were in the possession of the prosecution. The documents that were available in this case was massive but there was no communication whatsoever made to the prosecution that the defence required all the documents of BVC. The prosecution says that whatever documents that were available and which were consistent with the evidence of the witnesses were produced. The prosecution did not in any way hide away documents which were in its possession.
Counsel for the appellant replied that it was wrong to suggest that no objection was taken to the admissibility of secondary evidence as to the contents of documents until cross-examination. He said that as soon as the matter arose concerning telexes received in Hong Kong objection was made and the objection was repeated and later on cross-examination of witnesses it was proved that original documents existed in Hong Kong and could be produced at the start.
Counsel for the respondent did not really argue that the secondary evidence was not wrongly received.
What I have to consider is whether the reception of the inadmissible evidence influenced the mind of the trial judge so seriously as to lead him to a conclusion which might have been different but for its reception. There are two points for consideration, first, whether the reception of the inadmissible evidence has in fact occasioned a failure of justice and, secondly, whether if it is excluded there was sufficient evidence to justify the finding of the trial judge.
The next point of Mr Gray is that the CBT charges were misconceived and inappropriate. The argument of counsel is shortly this. The charges alleged that the appellant being a director of BVC and having dominion over certain property to wit, money belonging to BVC, committed criminal breach of trust in respect of it. The initial capital was fictitious and what little there might have been was quickly lost, long before the first CBT charge in February 1982. The only source and flow of money through BVC was its involvement in the cheating of clients. The money which passed through BVC was `stolen money`. It was loot from the conspiracy and not money belonging to BVC. BVC had no right to it and no question of entrustment could arise. There was no money owned by BVC which could form the basis of a CBT charge.
With all due respect to counsel I do not agree with the argument advanced by him. There can be no doubt that the money that was paid to BVC by its clients became the property of BVC and that the directors had dominion over the property. The clients knew that when they paid the money to BVC it was placed there for the purpose of being under the control of BVC.
Mr Gray says that if BVC had money of its own, it was always able to meet its obligations to clients with its own money and submits that then the drawings of its directors were not criminal breach of trust.
There is no substance in this submission. The appellant and Lee Kwong Fai were engaged in a conspiracy to cheat and subsequently from the proceeds of the cheating, which were received by BVC, the appellant and Lee Kwong Fai had secreted moneys out of BVC by disguising them as margin payments to BVF and putting them into their respective bank accounts. The issue here was not whether BVC was able to meet its financial obligations. The issue was whether the appellant dishonestly misappropriated the moneys. On the evidence the trial judge found that the appellant dishonestly misappropriated the moneys and the appellant was therefore guilty of criminal breach of trust.
It is submitted that the trial judge`s findings of fact were against the weight of evidence and wrong. Most of the witnesses were tainted, biased and untruthful.
Mr Gray dealt extensively with the evidence of most of the witnesses for the prosecution and highlighted its inadequacies and contradictions and he dealt at length with the grounds of decision criticising the trial judge`s findings of fact that they were against the weight of evidence and wrong.
The complaints of the appellant are many. The main ones are:
 
 
(a) The trial judge believed the principal prosecution witnesses, particularly Lee Kwong Fai, Sylvia Leung, Kelvin Ngai, without considering the various discrepancies, contradictions and incredible features in their evidence. 
 
(b) The trial judge did not consider at all the defence that the prosecution witnesses from Hong Kong, principally Lee Kwong Fai, Sylvia Leung and Kelvin Ngai, all had grudges against the appellant and hence motive to give highly incriminating and possibly false evidence against the appellant. 
 
(c) The trial judge failed to consider the submission by the appellant that if indeed he had been guilty of cheating and criminal breach of trust, he would not have reported Sylvia Leung to the police in February 1983 for cheating by forgery and thus taken the risk of the police investigating into the affairs of BVC. 
 
(d) The trial judge failed to consider the documentary evidence adduced by the appellant to show that the appellant believed that BVF was actually carrying on trading on exchanges for the clients of BVC and that if any cheating by bucketting of orders was being carried out, it was either not made known to the appellant or was done without his knowledge. 
 
(e) The trial judge erred in disbelieving the appellant`s evidence that the photocopying of accounts and books of BVC in 1982 was done for the benefit of a computer firm entrusted with computerising the records of BVC when the prosecution failed to call upon the computer firm personnel to give evidence although they had been interviewed by the police and by the prosecution. An adverse inference should have been drawn as a result of that failure. 
 
(f) The trial judge erred in concluding that the offences of criminal breach of trust would have been made out even on the appellant`s own evidence that he had received moneys from BVC in settlement of Lee Kwong Fai`s personal gambling debts. The appellant`s defence to the CBT charges was that the cheques and telegraphic transfers drawn on BVC`s bank accounts were payments to BVF in Hong Kong as marginal deposits. Lee Kwong Fai, the director of BVF, instructed Ho Yuen Tim and others to use part of these moneys to repay gambling debts to the appellant. If an offence was disclosed by this, this was Lee Kwong Fai`s criminal breach of trust in respect of money he had dominion over as agent of BVC and not criminal breach of trust by the appellant of BVC`s moneys. 
 
(g) The trial judge failed to consider the submission in law that if the offence of abetment of cheating was disclosed by the evidence, BVC was a conduit through which money obtained from clients `flowed` into the hands of the appellant and its other directors. Therefore, the appellant having been found guilty of abetment of cheating should not in addition have been found guilty of the offence of CBT in respect of the moneys of the company, which itself, if the prosecution evidence was believed, fruits of another offence in the first place. 
 
(h) The trial judge did not give sufficient consideration to the evidence adduced by the appellant. 
 
(i) The conviction is against the weight of the evidence, as by his evidence and by the discrepancies in the prosecution`s evidence, a reasonable doubt was cast on the prosecution`s case.
  
 
 
The trial judge had given the most careful consideration to the evidence adduced by the prosecution and the defence. He was aware that the prosecution case pivoted on the evidence of accomplices. He had warned himself of the dangers of convicting the appellant on the evidence of accomplices. He had no reason to disbelieve the prosecution witnesses. The evidence of the witnesses from both Hong Kong and Singapore was consistent in all material aspects and was supported by numerous documentary exhibits. Even if the appellant`s allegation was true that the Hong Kong witnesses had reasons to lie against him, there was no reason why all the witnesses from BVC, most of whom had been brought over by the appellant from his previous Company, State Carriers, should lie against him. The appellant was unable to suggest any cogent reasons why they should all lie under oath and have him unjustly convicted and punished. The appellant also alleged that the clients of BVC were telling lies when they testified. In fact his allegation was that all the prosecution witnesses were engaged in a conspiracy to lie against him.
With all the massive evidence adduced by the prosecution of cheques made out to Lee Kwong Fai, cash cheques cashed in Singapore, false bank payment vouchers and receipts, and of moneys taken by the directors in proportion to their shareholdings and the absence of company resolutions to support any legitimate distributions of company profits the trial judge could not but accept the evidence of the prosecution witnesses.
Mr Gray submits that the documentary evidence adduced by the appellant, principally the letters exhs D 33, D 34 and D 35, show that the appellant believed that BVF was actually carrying on trading on Exchanges for the clients of BVC and that if any cheating by `bucketting` of orders was being carried out, it was either not made known to the appellant or it was done without his knowledge.
The evidence adduced by the prosecution clearly showed that the appellant had full knowledge of BVC`s operations.
The documentary evidence D 34 and D 35 by themselves would not show that the appellant in fact believed that BVF was actually carrying on trading on exchanges for BVC. The facts leading to the writing of these letters have to be considered to determine whether the documents were true and could be relied upon. The trial judge was entitled to consider apart from these documents whether other evidence adduced showed that there was no trading between BVF and BVC. There was ample evidence on the records to show that the appellant had knowledge of bucketting and that the orders of clients were not put on the exchange.
The prosecution evidence was that there had been no trading whatsoever between BVC and BVF and in fact these margins purportedly sent or paid by Lee Kwong Fai right at the inception was false and was never paid. The documents in BVC were tailored. The figures given therein were false and were in fact used to cover up the bucketting operations.
The evidence was that immediately after the MAS raid on BVC the company was able to continue business the very next day. If the documents had not been photostated prior to the raid it was virtually impossible for the company to begin business immediately after the raid. It would take time to go to the MAS to get all the documentation and to get them photostated.
The appellant said that the photostating was done for the benefit of the computer firm entrusted with computerising the records of BVC. The prosecution witness said that it was done in anticipation of the MAS raid. The appellant`s story that this photostating was done for the benefit of the computer firm was not supported on the evidence. The prosecution was not bound to call upon the computer firm personnel to give evidence. If the appellant wished to establish that the photostating was requested by the computer firm and that the appellant ordered the photostating for that reason the defence should have called the computer firm personnel to establish that fact.
Having regard to the evidence, the trial judge was entitled to find that the appellant and Lee Kwong Fai were in fact engaged in a conspiracy to cheat and that subsequently they secreted the proceeds of the cheating by disguising them as margin payments to BVF and then obtaining the money unlawfully through all these means and putting them into their respective bank accounts as evidenced by the bank documents.
The trial judge has not erred in concluding that the offences of CBT would have been made out even on the defence of the appellant that he had received moneys from BVC in settlement of Lee Kwong Fai`s personal gambling debts. The moneys clearly belonged to BVC and could not be used by Lee Kwong Fai to pay for his own personal gambling debt.
As I have said the appellant and Lee Kwong Fai were engaged in a conspiracy to cheat and that subsequently they secreted out the proceeds of the cheating by disguising the receipt of the moneys by them by creating false margin receipts and stating in the payment voucher that these were payments to BVF as margins, trading losses, remittances to Hong Kong and returns to directors` loan account. Most of the cheques drawn were cash cheques and encashed in Singapore. The evidence showed that half the amounts stated on the cheques were given to the appellant which he immediately credited into his bank account within minutes of its withdrawal. If appellant`s allegations that Lee Kwong Fai was repaying his gambling debts were true, why only half the amounts were used to settle the gambling debts when the alleged amount owing to the appellant was substantial. No explanation was given by the appellant. The truth is that the appellant and Lee Kwong Fai were distributing the proceeds of the cheating equally between them.
Mr Gray raised the point that the CBT charges were unfair, that they merely duplicated the cheating charges. On the evidence adduced distinct offences of abetment of cheating and CBT were committed by the appellant. The abetment of cheating offences related to the clients of BVC and the CBT charges related to the moneys belonging to BVC. The acts alleged constituted offences failing within two separate definitions of law by which offences are defined or punished. The provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code permit the appellant to be charged with and tried at one trial for each of those offences.
The trial judge gave reasons for rejecting the appellant`s evidence. The trial judge gave anxious consideration to the evidence of the appellant and his witnesses which raised no doubt in his mind as to the guilt of the appellant.
The law regarding the functions of an appeal court when dealing with a question of fact in which questions of credibility are involved is clear. In an appeal from the decision of a trial judge based on his opinion of the trustworthiness of witnesses whom he has seen, the appeal court must, in order to reverse not merely entertain doubts whether the decision below is right but be convinced that it is wrong (
 Caldera v Gray 
 
 [1936] MLJ 137 
 a Privy Council case).
Having regard to the evidence I am not convinced that the decision of the trial judge is wrong.
The appeal of Loh Shak Mow against conviction is dismissed.
It is submitted that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. There is no doubt that the appellant was deeply involved from the start but the principal planners and operators of the fraud were the people from BVF, the principal prosecution witnesses from Hong Kong. Lee Kwong Fai was the evil genius and he had made a fortune from the offences and he has gone scot free.
I am of the view that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive in the circumstances. The sentences are set aside and I substitute a sentence of two years` imprisonment on each charge, the sentences on the first two charges to run consecutively and the sentences on the other charges to run concurrently, making a total of four years` imprisonment. 
 The appeal of Alan Wong 
The first ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in ordering a joint trial of the charges against Loh Shak Mow of abatement of cheating by conspiring to cheat under ss 109 and 420 of the Penal Code, with the charges against the appellant of criminal breach of trust as agent under s 409 of the Penal Code.
The appellant was charged with four charges of criminal breach of trust as agent in his capacity of director and chairman of BVC having dominion over money belonging to BVC, under s 409 of the Penal Code. He was convicted as charged on charges (1), (3) & (4) and convicted under s 411 of the Penal Code for dishonestly retaining stolen property, namely $169,713.17 in respect of charge (2).
The prosecution applied for the appellant and Loh Shak Mow to be jointly tried. Counsel for the appellant objected to the CBT charges against the appellant being tried with the abatement of cheating charges against Loh Shak Mow. After hearing arguments the trail judge granted the application.
The DPP in his submission on his application for a joint trial said that although the appellant was not involved actively in the trading of BVC he knew of the operations. He said that the CBT charges against the appellant were consequences of the cheating charges. The prosecution would show that moneys which were obtained from the conspiracy were shared by the three directors. There was thus a unity of purpose and a unity of action resulting in the criminal breach of trust.
After saying all that the DPP said that what was alleged against Loh Shak Mow would apply to Alan Wong even though the latter was not charged as a conspirator. The evidence of conspiracy was against both but in the exercise of his discretion the public prosecutor was proceeding against Alan Wong only in respect of the CBT charges. The DPP said that the court could amend the charges or sever the hearing during the trial.The DPP also said that he would allege in the charges that Alan Wong was a conspirator but he was not charging Alan Wong for that and that his was a complicated case.
When the joint trial commenced the DPP applied to amend the abatement of cheating charges against Loh Shak Mow not to name Alan Wong as a conspirator but to name Lee Kwong Fai and `divers others` as conspirators. That application was granted.
At the outset Loh Shak Mow was charged with conspiring with `others unknown`. Only one amendment was made during the trial namely to allege that Lee Kwong Fai and `divers others` were conspirators. No application at any stage of the trial was made by the DPP to charge that the appellant was a conspirator or even to name him in any conspiracy charges against Loh Shak Mow.
At the close of the case for the prosecution counsel for the appellant tendered a written submission on the question of the joint trial and requested the trial judge to reconsider his earlier ruling. The trial judge refused to listen. His notes read: `Kan not permitted to address court on whether an earlier decision of the Court on joinder of trial was wrong, as this is now a question solely for an appellate court.` The trial judge was wrong in refusing to reconsider his decision.
The only provision which authorised joint trial of offenders under certain specified circumstances is s 175 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The trial judge gave no reasons for ordering a joint trial either when the application for a joint trial was made or in his grounds of decision. It was for the trial judge to decide whether the two accused should be tried together or separately. The discretion must be exercised judicially.
The usual tests applied to decide whether different acts are parts of the same transaction (to bring it within s 175 of the Criminal Procedure Code) are proximity of time, unity of place, unity of purpose or design and continuity of action (
 Public Prosecutor v Loh Ang Sing 
 
 [1965] 2 MLJ 129 
).
There were three groups of charges: (1) four CBT charges against the appellant; (2) 14 CBT charges against Loh Shak Mow; (3) 28 charges of abatement of cheating against Loh Shak Mow. The prosecution proceeded on six of the 28 abatement of cheating charges against Loh Shak Mow. The rest were stood down.
The date of deceiving alleged in the first of the 28 abatement of cheating charges against Loh Shak Mow was 5 January 1982 and the date of the 26 charge was 17 August 1982. The dates of deceiving in 26 of 28 charges against Loh Shak Mow were before the date of the alleged criminal breach of trust (25 August 1982) by the appellant in the first charge against him. In fact all the six charges of abatement of cheating which the prosecution elected to proceed against Loh Shak Mow were before the first CBT charge against the appellant. It is not disputed that Loh Shak Mow and Lee Kwong Fai shared the profits 50/50 until 25 August 1982 and that the appellant did not know this and that the appellant did not receive any share of the profits before 25 August 1982. There is no proximity of tithe and no unity of purpose and continuity of action.
Conspiracy to cheat or actual cheating was not material to the question whether the appellant committed criminal breach of trust. The CBT charges against the appellant were not dependent on there having been cheating at BVC nor on the source of the funds at all. Had BVC`s funds been acquired perfectly legitimately the directors who dishonestly misappropriated any part of it could have been charged with criminal breach of trust.
The trial judge did not consider the case on the basis of the evidence admissible against each accused separately. He considered the case as if he was trying charges of conspiracy in which the acts and statements of all the alleged conspirators pursuant to the conspiracy were admissible against both the accused.
The result of the joint trial was that the appellant was subjected to an unnecessarily long and complicated trial lasting some eight weeks when evidence was adduced of cheating or attempted cheating or conspiracy to cheat which was not probative of the offences with which the appellant was charged and on which he was unfairly and improperly cross-examined by the DPP as to the offences with which he was not charged, with the result that the trial judge did not consider the case on the basis of the evidence admissible against each accused separately. He treated the appellant as a conspirator in a conspiracy with which he was not charged and in which he was not named.
The consequence was that the appellant was confronted by grossly prejudicial material which influenced the trial judge, adversely to the appellant, when he came to consider the disputed evidence relating to the charges against the appellant. With the result that the trial judge failed to consider adequately or properly the essential question whether it was proved by the prosecution that the appellant in receiving the moneys from BVC on each occasion charged did so with the dishonest intention to cause wrongful loss to BVC.
A joint trial should not have been ordered as it was not fair and just to the appellant and the joinder has occasioned a failure of justice. I am impelled to the conclusion that the appellant`s convictions must be quashed. I allow the appeal and quash the convictions and sentences.
The appellant has been subjected to an unnecessarily long and complicated trial of some eight weeks. He was unfairly and improperly cross-examined as to the offences with which he was not charged. He was confronted by grossly prejudicial and irrelevant evidence. At the end of it he was convicted and sentenced to 12 months` imprisonment on the basis that he was a party to the whole conspiracy to cheat with which he was not charged and in which he was not named. He must have spent a most miserable anxious year of his life waiting for the appeal to be heard. He had to leave the legal firm where he was a partner and had a lucrative practice. I am told that he practised on his own and that soon came to an end as he had few clients and that he is now not doing anything. He has endured quite enough. I do not order a retrial, to do so would be inequitable.

The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of abetting one Tan Kok Liang in committing a criminal breach of trust which offence is punishable under s 109 read with s 406 of the Penal Code. The punishment prescribed by law is imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or a fine, or both. Under s 406 no sum is expressed to which the fine may extend. Accordingly, under s 223(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (the CPC) the amount of the fine is `unlimited but shall not be excessive`.
The charge reads as follows: 
 
You, Tan Koon Swan are charged that you on or about 11 September 1985 in Singapore abetted one Tan Kok Liang, a director of Pan-Electric Industries Ltd (the company) in the commission of the offence of Criminal Breach of Trust in that you engaged with him in a conspiracy to dishonestly dispose of property belonging to the company, namely its funds, over which he had dominion and which he did so dispose of in violation of s 157(1) of the Companies Act (1985 Reprint) a direction of law which prescribed that he was to dispose of such property honestly which he did not, and this he did when he authorised or arranged for the company to pay a sum of S$144,852.68 comprised in CB Cheque No 750813 belonging to the company for the acquisition of Grand United Holdings Bhd securities by Orchard Hotel (S) Pte Ltd a subsidiary of the company, which act was committed in consequence of your abetment, and thereby committed an offence punishable under s 109 read with s 406 of the Penal Code (Cap 103).
 
 
 
According to the statement of facts, which was admitted by the accused, the accused had played a significant and central part in forward contracts and the financing thereof which brought about the demise of the Pan-Electric Group. He, in effect, admitted that he had conspired with Tan Kok Liang and had made use of the resources of the group. It is also clear that, as a necessary part of the conspiracy, the accused had engaged in price support schemes so that forward contracts could be extended or rolled-over and could be financed by the banking system. It was in connection with one such support scheme that the dishonest misappropriation was committed by Tan Kok Liang to pay the accrued interest charges to a firm of stock-brokers.
In the context of considering what has been set out in the statement of facts and what has been admitted by the accused, the following matters must be noted:
 
 
(a) the accused has pleaded guilty to and had been convicted of the offence of abetment of a particular breach of trust; 
 
(b) the prescribed punishment for the offence is imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or a fine, or both such imprisonment and fine; 
 
(c) the offence in this case relates only to a relatively minor aspect of what is, as revealed by the statement of facts, a much wider and rather more complicated mosaic of facts, including alleged criminal wrong-doings, in respect of which there have been no convictions; 
 
(d) the accused has not been convicted of any other offence arising out of or in connection with the facts and circumstances referred to in the statement of facts; and 
 
(e) in considering the sentence in this case no other charges are taken into account with the consent of the accused under s 177(1) of the CPC.
  
 
 
Accordingly, it has to be noted in all the circumstances of the case that the only sentence which this court can mete out is a sentence for the offence for which the accused has been convicted before it. Looking at the offence, the accused had engaged with one Tan Kok Liang in a conspiracy to dishonestly dispose of the sum of S$144,852.68 of Pan-Electric Industries (hereinafter referred to as Pan-El). As a result of the conspiracy Tan Kok Liang violated s 157(1) of the Companies Act and dishonestly paid out the money of the company to a firm of stock-brokers. He was aided and abetted by the accused.
So far as the commercial matrix in which the offence was committed is concerned, this may be stated within a reasonably short compass. In November 1984 the accused held or had contracted to take delivery of a total of 34m shares in Grand United Holdings Berhad (hereinafter referred to as GUH), a publicly listed company in which the accused was the substantial shareholder. He had to complete and pay for a block of such shares by 19 November 1984. Having failed to arrange the necessary financing because, as he claimed, he was deeply involved in a crisis which had embroiled his political party, Malaysian Chinese Association, he sought `expedient help`. Through two friends, he was introduced to one Peter Tham who, in addition to being the Managing Director of a stockbroking firm known as Associated Asian Securities Ltd (hereinafter referred to as AAS), was a substantial shareholder of Pan-El and Growth Industrial Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as `GIH`) which were at all material times also publicly listed companies. They met on or about 14 November 1984. What had been agreed between the accused and Peter Tham as a result of that meeting and what had transpired thereafter no doubt prompted counsel for the accused to describe it as a `fatal meeting`.
As a result of that meeting, Peter Tham agreed to buy from the accused the 34m GUH shares at $1.75 per share or at the total cost of $59.5m. It has to be emphasised that on 13 November 1984 GUH shares were transacted in the market at about $1.34 per share. If Peter Tham had entered into the transaction on his own account he would have suffered the colossal loss of some $13.9m.
Peter Tham instead decided to make use of the resources of Pan-El and GIH, the two publicly listed companies at his disposal, to purchase the 34 million GUH shares from the accused. Peter Tham also used AAS to put through the transactions. As the sums involved were `staggering`, and they could have pushed the Pan-El group to the brink, Peter Tham arranged to fund the purchases by the use of a `roll-over` mechanism. By this mechanism, arrangements were made with an agent or a stockbroker who would use his or their financial resources, obtained through his or their own borrowings from the banking system, to purchase the same shares from the Pan-El and GIH groups. Simultaneously, the groups would contract to re-purchase the same shares but in order to provide for the roll-over period delivery thereunder and payments therefor (inclusive of the rather high funding charges) were agreed to take place six months later. During the roll-over period the shares would remain as security with the broker or financial institution funding the arrangement.
The sale or `roll-over` had to be done at just below the market price while the re-purchase price would be calculated by adding to the sale price the funding charges, which were way above market rates, and other charges.
Since the market price of GUH shares was substantially lower than the agreed price of $1.75 per share, Peter Tham had to artificially raise the price of GUH shares. He did this by using a wholly-owned subsidiary of GIH which bought from the open market 2.8m GUH shares. In that way he artificially enhanced the price per share from $1.34 on 13 November 1984 to $1.70 on 19 November 1984 which was the day the Pan-El and GIH groups had to take delivery of the 34m GUH shares from the accused.
By 7 December 1984 the accused received $59.5m for his 34m GUH shares from the Pan-El and GIH group of companies. On that day the GUH shares dropped to $1.50 per share in the absence of price support purchases by Peter Tham. The potential loss to the Pan-El and GIH group of companies was in the region of $20m.
At the same fateful meeting with Peter Tham, the accused had also agreed to buy Pan-El shares from Peter Tham. The accused claimed in mitigation that he had reluctantly agreed to do so and that other shares were unlawfully passed on to him by Peter Tham. By December 1984 the accused had purchased approximately 24m Pan-El shares and 9.8m GIH shares. The 24m Pan-El shares gave the accused 15% control of Pan-El. The 9.8m GIH shares gave him 16% control of GIH, which made him one of the largest single shareholders of GIH. With GIH`s 31% control of Pan-El and the 15% Pan-El control through his personal shareholdings the accused in truth and in fact wielded substantial control of Pan-El.
In March 1985 Sigma International Ltd (Sigma), another publicly listed company in the control of the accused and of which the accused was the chairman, announced its intention to purchase the 24m Pan-El shares from the accused and an additional 10 or 11m shares from the associates of the accused. The consideration for these shares was by way of the issue of two new Sigma shares for each Pan-El share. After this share exchange Sigma secured 22% control of Pan-El. Together with GIH`s 16% control of Pan-El, the accused consolidated his control of Pan-El.
At all material times one Tan Kok Liang was a director of Pan-El and of several of its subsidiaries including Orchard Hotel (S) Pte Ltd and Orange Grove Property Pte Ltd (hereinafter referred to as Orange Grove). Pan-El is now in the hands of provisional liquidators. Tan Kok Liang was also a director of GIH which held a 31% stake in Pan-El. He and Peter Tham at all material times were the only two members of the Investment Committees of Pan-El and GIH with full powers to invest on behalf of the two groups.
I now turn to May 1985 after the accused had consolidated his control over Pan-El. Under those circumstances, the accused could and did give instructions to Tan Kok Liang. It is now appropriate to turn to the proximately more direct circumstances which involved the dealing of GUH shares and under which the offence was committed by the accused. They are succinctly set out in the last four paragraphs of the statement of facts which the accused had accepted as correct. I now reproduce them: 
 
22 Before May 1985 just before the 27.775m GUH shares were due for delivery from Ballas, E G Tan and Capel through AAS, Tan Kok Liang was concerned about how he was to effect payment. He discovered from AAS that the accused was the owner of the shares and the person who had landed the Pan-El-group with the shares. The accused told Tan Kok Liang that if necessary he was to arrange to roll over as much as he could with the group`s available finances.
(23) On 10 May 1985 the closing market price for Grand United Holding (GUH) shares was only $1.35. This would have made it difficult if not impossible for Orange Grove to `roll-over` the GUH shares that were due to be delivered to and paid by Orange Grove. On the request of the accused, Tan Kok Liang went into the market and purchased 9.8m GUH shares, which the Pan-El group did not need, to artificially create a price which would facilitate the roll over. From 10 May 1985 to 16 May 1985 (when 21.8m GUH shares were rolled over) the price rose to $1.56. 
(24) Out of the 9.8m GUH shares purchased in order to create the artificial price support, 3m were purchased by Orchard Hotel (a subsidiary of Pan-El) through Lin Securities Pte Ltd another stockbroking company. For this $4,778,895 was paid. 
(25) On 11 September 1985 Tan Kok Liang conspiring with the accused instructed or arranged for Pan-El to pay $144,851.68 representing interest charges to Lin Securities Ltd. This money, which Tan Kok Liang as the Director had dominion over, was the property of Pan-El. The accused engaged with Tan Kok Liang in this conspiracy to dishonestly dispose of this money belonging to Pan-El. The sum was paid vide cheque CB No 750813 belonging to Pan-El for the acquisition of GUH securities by Orchard Hotel, a subsidiary of Pan-El. This was clearly a breach of Tan Kok Liang`s duty to Pan-El and a violation of s 157(1) of the Companies Act (1985 Reprint) which prescribed that Tan Kok Liang was to dispose of such property honestly. The payment of this sum was clearly made in consequence of the abetment by the accused. It was made not for Tan Kok Liang`s own benefit but for the accused`s benefit.
 
 
 
In mitigation learned counsel for the accused traced the latter`s personal and political background. He is very much a self-made man. It was submitted that in late 1984 the accused had to meet a wide range of commercial and political responsibilities and that the offence was committed under extenuating circumstances in which he was the largest single loser in the `bizarre affair`.
Learned counsel for the accused strongly urged this court not to impose a custodial sentence as he had made partial restitution and had suffered enough. It was urged that instead of imposing a custodial sentence I should order instead a fine `of a very substantial amount consistent with the gravity of the offence`.
So far as partial restitution is concerned, it was submitted that shortly after the accused was arrested and charged he had made representations through counsel to the prosecution. It was stressed that in line with such representations the accused had made further arrangements to solve the problems with five stockbroking firms in Singapore which had previously transacted with Pan-El on GUH and other shares. The accused had, through financially guaranteed arrangements, agreed to purchase from three stockbroking firms shares in GUH and another publicly listed company at the cost of nearly $14m. It is also claimed that the accused is committed to similar arrangements with two more stockbrokers. The liability of the accused, if and when enforced, could expose him to the tune of S$53m.
In addition, the accused has made the further restitution of $34m.
The following additional reasons were also canvassed on behalf of the accused in an attempt to persuade me to impose a substantial fine in lieu of a custodial sentence: 
 
(a) The accused has pleaded guilty and has shown great remorse for what he did. It also saves the court time and costs in unravelling a highly complex set of transactions.
(b) The accused is a first offender and a man of good character. 
(c) There is no possibility of such an offence occurring again since the lessons learnt have been most painful to him. 
(d) The accused has already been severely punished by his huge financial losses and the trauma of awaiting trial. 
(e) The accused is Member of Parliament for Gopeng having been elected on 3 August 1986. He desperately needs to return and serve his constituency and his country. 
(f) The accused is the President of the Malaysian Chinese Association, the Second largest component party in the ruling Barisan Nasional, (and) his services as the President of MCA are urgently required by the 400,000 members particularly at this time. 
(g) The agreement on the forward contracts which he signed with the brokers demand his credibility to revitalise the operations of Grand United and Supreme Corporation. A custodial sentence will destroy that credibility and the accused will be at a total loss to pursue his commitment to honour this obligation to the stockbrokers in Singapore.
 
 
 
The learned DPP pointed out that having taken everything into account the prosecution decided to proceed on the one charge to which the accused has pleaded guilty. To get the accused to make as much restitution as possible, the prosecution undertook not to press for a punitive sentence. However, the learned DPP made it plain that the matter of sentence is and always has been left to the court and that in the administration of justice in Singapore there is no room whatsoever for any plea bargaining on sentence.
Although the accused has made the partial restitution I have referred to, it has to be noted, as the learned DPP observed, that the losses caused to shareholders have become irreparable. Pan-El is now in provisional liquidation. Many others have suffered.
I must now pronounce the appropriate sentence. I remind myself of the principle that the only sentence this court can mete out is a sentence for the offence for which the accused has been convicted. The accused had committed the offence of abetting a director of a public and listed company in the dishonest misappropriation of the money of the company and in violation of the director`s duties under the Companies Act. As between the director and the accused, it was plain that the accused was far more culpable. It was also not an offence that could be viewed in isolation; nor was it unpremeditated. The dishonest misappropriation was carried out as a part of the conspiracy to `artificially create a price which would facilitate the roll over` and the financing of the shares in GUH, another public and listed company. The offence of abetment committed by the accused in these circumstances struck at the very heart of the integrity, reputation and confidence of Singapore as a commercial city and a financial centre. I cannot ignore the aftermath of the collapse of the Pan-El group. In my judgment public interest plainly requires that the accused should receive a punishment which will not only fit his crime but which will also act as a deterrent to other persons who may be similarly disposed. Our commercial market place must be protected from and purged of the likes of the accused. I have carefully considered every submission made on his behalf. In my judgment the appropriate sentence is imprisonment for a term of two years and a fine of $500,000 in default of which there will be imprisonment for a further term of six months.

The appellant was charged with riding a scooter along a road whilst under the influence of drink to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of such vehicle, an offence under s 69(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Reprint) (the RTA). He claimed trial and was convicted on 31 October 1985 and sentenced to a fine of $800 and disqualified from holding or obtaining a Class 2 driving licence for a period of two years.
The facts adduced by the prosecution were as follows: on 7 December 1983, at about 8.20pm, the appellant was riding motor scooter AZ7747 J along Telok Blangah Way at about 50 kmph when, according to him, he suddenly felt giddy. He applied the brakes but the scooter went out of control and he fell off. He remembered being carried to the side of the road. The police arrived at the scene at about 8.28pm and established that the scooter had skidded and that the appellant had a head injury. The appellant was not arrested but was taken to the Singapore General Hospital where he was examined about two hours later by Dr Koh Cheng Huat (PW1) who also, at about 10.45pm took a specimen of the appellant`s blood for alcohol analysis. The specimen was analysed by Dr Danny Lo Siaw Teck, the Senior Scientific Officer.
At the trial the report of PW1 dated 26 January 1984, (P5) and the report of Dr Danny Lo (P6) were admitted in evidence. P5 states as follows: 
 
On admission, he was conscious, vital signs stable. Periorbital haematoma of both eyes with two cm lacerations over the right eyelid. There was no neurological deficit. He was found also to be hypertensive.
 
 
 
Skull xray - no abnormalities detected.
 
 
 
ECG - no abnormalities detected.
 
 
 
Chest xray - no abnormalities detected.
 
 
 
Blood alcohol level = 152 mg ethanol per 100 ml of blood.
 
 
 
P6 states as follows: 
 
I, Dr Danny Lo Siaw Teck Senior Scientific Officer, Singapore do hereby certify that at 9.40am on the eighth day of December 1983 there was handed to me by S Ganesan, one sample blood seal General Hospital Singapore and marked Ajmer Singh, Ad No 2038228G.
 
 
 
On analysis, I found the blood sample to contain 152 mg ethanol per 100 ml blood.
PW1 gave evidence and said that when he examined the appellant, the appellant had strong alcohol in his breath and that at 8am the next morning (ie about 12 hours after the accident), he had observed the appellant`s gait was unsteady. PW1 when cross-examined, admitted that he did not know the diffusion rate but he agreed that on the basis of the statement at p 308 of 
 JK Mason`s 
 Forensic Medicine for Lawyers (that the diffusion rate of ethanol is 15 mg per 100 ml of blood per hour) the alcohol content in the appellant`s blood could have been zero at the time he observed the appellant`s gait. PW1 nevertheless asserted that he was positive that the appellant`s unsteady gait was due to the after effect of alcohol and not hypertension or the injury to the appellant`s head. PW1 was not asked or cross-examined as to whether the appellant`s blood was taken with consent.
On the basis of his evidence, the magistrate called for the defence. The appellant`s story was that whilst in his nephew`s house, he and his nephew had drunk four bottles of beer, that he suffered from hypertension, that he fell from his scooter not because of drink but because a motor car overtook him and stopped in front of him; he had to apply his scooter brakes suddenly and fell off his scooter. He also said that when the car overtook him, he had a slight giddiness and that when he applied the brakes he felt giddy. He thought that his giddiness was due to his blood pressure. He also admitted that whenever he consumed alcohol, he felt a slight intoxication. Under cross-examination, he said that he is not a good drinker and would get intoxicated by small amounts of drinks.
At the end of the case for the defence, the magistrate convicted the appellant. He held that the appellant`s fall was due to his high state of intoxication which made him unable to control his scooter. The magistrate also held as a matter of law that s 70 of the RTA did not prohibit the admissibility of the alcohol content of the appellant`s blood as evidence as it was taken without compulsion, that the presumption under s 71 of the RTA applied, but that even if it did not, the evidence of PW1 was sufficient to prove the prosecution`s case.
The appellant now appeals against his conviction and sentence. In the light of the appellant`s own evidence, his counsel has no hope of persuading this court that the appellant has been wrongly convicted. However, the appellant`s case is that at the end of the prosecution case, he had no case to answer as there was no evidence which was legally admissible to prove the alcohol content of his blood. Counsel contended that the appellant`s blood was taken:
 
 
(a) when he was not arrested under s 68 when he was taken to or under arrest whilst in hospital; 
 
(b) without his having been required to do so by a police officer under s 70(1); 
 
(c) without his consent as required under s 70(3); and 
 
(d) without a warning as required under s 70(4), and as a consequence, the specimen was inadmissible in evidence.
  
 
 
Counsel referred to the English case of 
 R v Bove 
 [1970] RTR 261; (1970) 54 Cr App R 316 where the accused who had been unlawfully arrested under s 2 of the Road Safety Act 1967 was acquitted on a charge of failing to provide a specimen of his blood without reasonable excuse under s 3(3) on the ground that the requirements of s 3(1) (one of which was he could not be under an obligation to provide the specimen unless he was lawfully arrested) have not been complied with. On p 263 of the report, Lord Parker CJ said: 
 
There is no doubt that in every decision of this Court, beginning with 
 Scott
 
 v
 
 Baker
 (1968) 52 Cr App R 566; 
[1969] 1 QB 659
 and ending with 
 Pinner
 
 v
 
 Everett
(supra) in the House of Lords, it has always been assumed to be the law that a man could not be convicted of an offence under s 1 unless a specimen of blood or urine had been obtained pursuant to s 3. When one turns to s 3, one finds before a specimen for a test can be required that there must have been an arrest under s 2 of the Act or under s 4 of the principal Act, and that there must have been an opportunity for a breath test at the police station. It has always been assumed in case after case that an invalid arrest will make the certificate inadmissible, and accordingly , that will be a defence to a charge under s 1 of the Act.
 
 
 
Counsel submitted that the type of illegality involved in 
 R 
 
 v 
 
 Bove 
, being in the nature of direct contravention of a statute, is different from the type of illegally obtained evidence (ie by trickery or other improper means) that was held to be admissible under the ruling in 
 R 
 
 v 
 
 Kuruma 
[1955] AC 197
. He also referred to 
 R 
 
 v 
 
 Payne 
 
[1963] 1 WLR 637
 to show that the courts in England have excluded evidence of unfitness to drive which was obtained unfairly from the accused.
It is not necessary for me to consider the English cases in any detail other than to note that they are decisions based on the construction of the rather unusual wordings of the relevant provisions of the English road traffic legislation (which have now been repealed or modified). A clear example of the approach is the statement of Lord Parker CJ in 
 Scott 
 
 v Baker 
 
[1969] 1 QB 659
 at p 671 where he said: 
 
Section 1 - now s 6(1) of the Act of 1972 - `provides that it shall only be an offence if the person drives a motor vehicle having consumed alcohol which is later shown to exceed the prescribed limit on the provision of a specimen under s 3` - now s 9 - `... it will be seen ... that there can ... be no provision of a specimen under s 3 unless the person has been arrested under sub-s (4) of s 2` - now s 8(4) - `which in turn can only be made after what I may call the first breath test; and also the specimen can only be provided if the person has been given an opportunity under sub-s (7) of s 2 to have a second breath test. It seems to me quite impossible to argue that a specimen was properly provided under s 3, as it has to be before there is an offence, unless those matters have first been complied with`.
 
 
 
The above statement was approved by the House of Lords in 
 Spicer 
 
 v Holt 
 [1976] RTR 389; 
[1977] AC 987
 where their Lordships decided: 
 
that ss 5(5), 8 and 9 [of the Road Traffic 1972] laid down a code of procedure to be followed before a person could be convicted of an offence under s 6(1) of the Act, and each step in the procedure must be taken before proceeding to the next step; that the arrest of the defendant was admittedly unlawful, and that it was therefore not an arrest under s 8(5), as it purported to be; and that accordingly, no evidence of subsequent analysis of a specimen of blood or urine from the defendant was admissible.
 
 
 
In my view, the line of decisions culminating in 
 Spicer 
 
 v Holt 
 [1976] RTR 389; 
[1977] AC 987
 has no application to the present case, as s 68 of the RTA, under which the appellant was convicted, makes no reference whatever to any procedural requirements whether in s 70 or otherwise for taking a specimen and is not part of a code of procedure, each step of which has to be followed. An English decision which has more relevance to the present case is 
 R 
 
 v Trump 
 [1980] RTR 274; (1980) 70 Cr App R 300 where: 
 
... the appellant was arrested under s 5(5) of the Road Traffic Act 1972, taken to a police station, where he was required to provide a specimen for a laboratory test and warned in accordance with s 9(7) that failure to provide the specimen make him liable for imprisonment, a fine and disqualification. He provided a specimen of blood, which on analysis revealed a concentration of alcohol above the prescribed limit. He was tried on a charge of driving when unfit to drive, contrary to s 5(1). The analysis was admitted in evidence and the appellant was convicted. He appealed against conviction on the ground that the analysis evidence should have been excluded since the laboratory test specimen had been unlawfully obtained, in that he had been constrained to provide it because of the warning in accordance with s 9(7) so that it had not been taken from him with his consent within s 7(1). The Crown conceded that the appellant`s arrest was unlawful, and the appellant conceded that the constable was entitled to require a breath test by virtue of s 8(2) and had a power of arrest under s 8(4).
 
 
 
Dismissing the appeal, the Court of Appeal held that, as the specimen of blood was obtained as a result of the warning given under s 9(7) of the Act and, therefore, not with the appellant`s consent within the meaning of s 7(1) of the Act, there was no obligation under s 7(1) to admit the analysis evidence; but that the evidence provided by the appellant was analogous to an admission and, therefore, it was within the discretion of the judge to admit it; and that, had the judge excluded the analysis evidence, his discretion would have been exercised improperly.
On the issue of admissibility of improperly obtained evidence, the Court of Appeal referred to 
 R 
 
 v Sang 
 
[1980] AC 402
 and said ([1980] RTR 274 at p 276) that in that case the House of Lords held: 
 
that (1) a judge in a criminal trial has a discretion to refuse to admit evidence if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value; (2) an involuntary confession or admission is inadmissible in evidence; and (3) there is room for further consideration of evidence tantamount to a self- incriminatory admission which was obtained from the defendant, after the offence had been committed, by means which would justify a judge in excluding an actual confession which had the like self-incriminating effect, and also for consideration of the effect of a judge`s duty to ensure a fair trial. Apart from this there is no general exception to exclude evidence improperly obtained.`
 
 
 
The Court of Appeal then concluded that a limited exception in cases to improperly obtained admissions was recognised by the House of Lords to exist in 
 R 
 v 
 Sang 
, that the extent of the exception was not fully considered and that 
 R 
 v 
 Payne 
 was still good law. As counsel for the appellant has cited 
 R 
 v 
 Payne 
 in support of his argument, I will now have to consider its relevance to the present proceedings.
In 
 R 
 
 v 
 
 Payne 
 , the defendant, who was charged with drunken driving, had been induced to submit himself to examination by a doctor to see if he was suffering from any illness or disability, upon the understanding that the doctor would not examine him for the purpose of seeing whether he, was fit to drive. The doctor gave evidence of the defendant`s unfitness to drive based upon his symptoms and behaviour in the course of that examination. He was convicted on such evidence. The Court of Criminal Appeal quashed his conviction on the ground that the trial judge ought to have exercised his discretion to exclude the doctor`s evidence. 
 R v 
 
 Payne 
was considered by the House of Lords in 
 R v 
 
 Sang. 
Lord Diplock, Lord Fraser of Tulleybelt on and Lord Scarman regarded the case in 
 R v 
 
 Payne 
 as being `analogous to unfairly inducing a defendant to confess to an offence, and the short judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal is clearly based upon the maxim 
 nemo debet prodere se ipsum` 
(Lord Diplock at p 271). I would respectfully adopt their Lordship`s view of 
 R v 
 
 Payne 
as what the accused was induced to do could have amounted to an involuntary confession to the doctor that he was unfit to drive.
The legal position after 
 R v 
 
 Sang 
as explained by 
 R v 
 
 Trump 
 as regards evidence analogous to self-incriminating admission is that its admissibility is subject to the discretion of the judge. The same rule applies in Singapore and the actual decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Cheng Swee Tiang v 
 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1964] MLJ 291
  does not conflict with 
 R v 
 
 Sang 
. Accordingly, in the present case, the magistrate was correct in refusing to exclude P6 in evidence.
I come now to the submission on lack of consent on the part of the appellant in giving a specimen of his blood to PW1. In 
 R v 
 
 Trump 
, the Court of Appeal held that the appellant had not given his consent because he gave it in response to a warning to him. But the Court of Appeal also held that `Giving the blood was very close to making an admission that the appellant had consumed an excessive amount of alcohol` thereby making it clear that what was done there did not amount to an involuntary admission. In the present case the lack of consent is of a different kind. Here, no warning was given to the appellant, but he did not appear to have objected to his blood being taken. Was there consent for the purpose of s 70? If not, did it amount to an involuntary admission of guilt? A perusal of the appeal record shows that in the proceedings below counsel for the appellant based his submissions on inadmissibility wholly on the basis of contravention of s 70 in that his client had not been arrested under s 68 or 69 or given a warning. The issue of consent was never raised by counsel for the appellant in cross-examination or in both his speeches at the end of the prosecution case and at the end of the defence case. If the issue had been raised then PW1 or even the appellant himself might have provided the evidence. Should he be allowed to raise it on appeal? A similar situation occurred in 
 R v 
 
 Sadler; R v 
 
 Palfrey 
 [1970] RTR 127; (1970) 54 Cr App R 217 where the Court of Appeal refused to consider a submission of no consent on the ground that it was not raised in the courts below in these words `It is entirely as an afterthought that it is said that it has not been established affirmatively that the blood specimen in either of the two cases was taken with the consent of the accused.` This observation, in my view, applies to this ground of appeal. Accordingly, I do not find it necessary to consider whether o r not the appellant gave his consent, and in that connection, whether `consent` in s 70(3) means consent given expressly as distinguished from consent given impliedly, iewithout compulsion by a failure to object to blood being taken. But, even assuming that no consent had been given, the appellant would still have to overcome the hurdle as to whether the evidence amounted to an involuntary confession or admission of a nature that renders the evidence inadmissible. In 
 Pakala Narayana Swami v 
 
 Emperor 
 (1939) 66 IA 66; AIR 1939 PC 47 Lord Atkin said that, `A confession must either admit in terms the offence or at any rate substantially all the facts which constitute the offence.` Here, if there had been any confession or admission, it was merely to the fact that the appellant had an excessive amount of alcohol in his blood and not to the fact that he was unable to control his scooter whilst under the influence of drink.
I now deal with the admissibility of P5 for the purpose of s 70(3) of the RTA although the grounds of decision of the magistrate do not advert to this issue. Section 70(3) provides that: 
 
For the purposes of any proceeding`s for an offence under s 68 or 69 or sub-s (2), a certificate purporting to be signed by a medical practitioner that he took a specimen of blood or urine from a person with his consent shall be evidence of the matters so certified and of the qualifications of the medical practitioner.
 
 
 
Provided that such certificate shall not be accepted as evidence for the prosecution unless a copy thereof had been served on the accused not less than seven days before the hearing.
 
 
 
Section 70(3) raises an irrebuttable presumption in respect of the qualification of the medical practitioner and of the matters so certified, i.e.the medical practitioner took his specimen with the consent of the person. P5 clearly does not comply with the requirements of s 70(3) as it does not even certify that the blood was taken and with the consent of the appellant. P5 was certainly not evidence of any of the matters certified or mentioned therein unless it was a certificate admitted under and in accordance with s 368 of the Criminal Procedure Code or PW1 has given evidence of such matters.
I turn to s 71 of the RTA which creates the presumption of incapability of having proper control of a motor scooter. Neither P5 nor P6 was a certificate which fulfilled the requirements of s 71 itself. Not only was the appellant not arrested or warned prior to his blood being taken, P5 did not comply with s 70(3) and P6 was signed by the Chief Scientific Officer, who may or may not be a medical practitioner. Accordingly, I agree with counsel for the appellant that the Magistrate was wrong in applying the presumption against the appellant.
Has the prosecution proved its case without the presumption in s 71? The magistrate decided in the affirmative. I agree with him. P6 was a document admissible under s 368 of the Criminal Procedure Code as prima facieevidence of the facts stated therein, iethat the appellant had in his blood 152 mg of alcohol per ml of blood. According to 
 JK Mason Forensic Medicine For Lawyers 
 at p 309 (a textbook cited by the appellant`s counsel to prove the diffusion rate of alcohol in blood), the likely practical effect, on an average assessment, of a given blood concentration of alcohol, at 100-200 mg per 100 ml would be: `Distinct loss of skill, slurring of speech and commencing loss of co-ordination`; that `much depends on the conditions for drinking, the availability of food, etcand that habituation to alcohol occurs - the reason for this not being entirely clear - that the same blood concentration will have a lesser effect on the regular drinker than on the novice.` In my view, this evidence alone is sufficient for the defence to be called at the end of the prosecution`s case. At the end of the case for the defence, there was no longer any doubt that the appellant was guilty as charged, as he admitted that he would get intoxicated very easily and that he fell from his scooter after riding it a short distance from his nephew`s house.
Counsel for the appellant has also criticised the magistrate for placing too much reliance on PW1`s statement that the unsteady gait of the appellant 12 hours after the accident was due to the after effect of alcohol (when there could have been no alcohol in the appellant`s blood) and not to hypertension or the injury to his head. As there is sufficient objective evidence to sustain the conviction of the appellant, with PW1`s evidence on this point, I do not find it necessary to decide whether or not any weight should have been given to PW1`s evidence. I disregard it for the purpose of this appeal.
Counsel for the appellant also argued that there was no evidence that the blood examined by the chemist was the blood taken by PW1 from the appellant. He submitted that the fact that the bottle or container was labelled `Ajmer Singh Ad No 2038228C` was insufficient to prove the chain of identification. He cited 
 R v 
 
 Orrell 
 [1972] RTR 14; [1972] Crim LR 313 where it was held that it was sufficient for the prosecution to prove by written markings on the sample bottle of urine that the sample of urine taken from the defendant was that received by the laboratory and analysed by the analyst. In 
 Tremlett v 
 
 Fawcett 
 [1984] 1 RTLR 68 it was held there was no need for the prosecution to prove specifically that a sample of urine had been sent from the police to the laboratory for analysis. In that case the sample had been marked and placed in an envelope signed across the seal by the police officer with the envelope bearing the name of the defendant. The analyst had certified that he had received the specimen in a sealed container. In the present case, P6 itself refers to a sample of blood sealed General Hospital Singapore and marked `Ajmer Singh Ad No 2038228G`. In my view, this is sufficient to prove the chain of identification and accordingly I reject counsel`s submission on this point.
As regards sentence, counsel for the appellant has not made out a case that it was excessive.
In the result, the appeal against conviction and sentence is dismissed.

These three appeals arose in the following circumstances:
 
 
(1) The first appellant was charged with three offences:
  
 
 
(i) that he drove motor car EE 4005A in a dangerous manner, an offence under s 26(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Reprint);
(ii) that he displayed an identification mark of the wrong shape on the said car, an offence under r 11 of the Motor Vehicles (R & L) Rules 1972; 
(iii) that he drove the said car with brakes which were not in good order, an offence under r 88(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Construction & Use) Rules 1974.
 
 
 
At the close of the case for the prosecution, he was acquitted on the second charge and was called to enter his defence on the first and third charges.
 
 
(2) The second appellant was charged with three offences:
  
 
 
(i) that he drove motor car SE 8498T in a dangerous manner, an offence under s 26(1) of the Road Traffic Act;
(ii) that he drove the said car with an exhaust silencer baffle pipe which was not in good and efficient order, an offence under r 90(2) of the 1974 Rules; 
(iii) that he used the said car with a bald tyre and thereby contravened r 92(1)(F) of the 1974 Rules.
 
 
 
At the close of the prosecution`s case, he was acquitted on the second and third charges and was called to enter his defence to the first charge.
 
 
(3) The third appellant was charged with three offences:
  
 
 
(i) that he drove motor car EG 403 1 M in a dangerous manner, an offence under s 26(1) of the Road Traffic Act;
(ii) that he displayed an identification mark of the wrong shape on the said vehicle, an offence under r 11 of the 1972 Rules; 
(iii) that he drove the said motor car with a slack steering ban joint, an offence under r 85(1) of the 1974 Rules.
 
 
 
At the close of the case for the prosecution, he was acquitted on the second and third charges and was called to enter his defence to the first charge.
The appellants were tried jointly. They remained silent when they were called upon to enter their defences to the charges described above. They were represented by counsel who did not make any submission. They were accordingly convicted on the charges to which they made no defence. They were fined $1,000 each and disqualified from holding or obtaining a Class 3 driving licence for one year from the date of conviction.
The appellants have now appealed against their convictions on the ground that there was no evidence to show that each of them had driven the car specified in the charge against him.
The evidence of the prosecution on each of the first charges against the appellants was based entirely on the testimony of PC8458 Lim Eng Kiat (PW2) who was the traffic police officer who single-handedly stopped and arrested the three appellants. His entire testimony is as follows: 
 
On 18 December 1983 at about 3.20am, I was on duty along ECP (East Coast Parkway). Whilst traveling along ECP, Benjamin Sheares Bridge, I saw three motor cars from the slip road from Beach Road side travelling towards airport. These three motor cars were travelling at a very fast speed. I immediately accelerated to get close to these three vehicles. I saw these three motor cars from the extreme left swerving straight to the extreme right cutting across two lanes without any form of signal causing a few vehicles which were on second and third lanes to brake to avoid collision with these vehicles. These three motor cars continued to speed and weave in and out of traffic thereby causing several vehicles to brake. I saw two motor cars were abreast and another one was behind which was occupying the extreme right lane. The two vehicles in front were trying to gain the lead. I checked the speed was at 155 kmph. Yes, it was exactly 155 kmph as my speedmeter was an electronic meter. I tried to overtake. Just before the junction of Fort Road, these three vehicles slowed down due to the red traffic light and several vehicles were stationary in front. I managed to overtake and signalled these three motor cars to pull to the roadside and recorded the particulars of the drivers. Yes, I recorded the registration numbers of the vehicles. The vehicles were EE 4005A, EG 4031M and SE 8498T. I also checked the vehicles and suspected these motor cars were illegally modified. I escorted them back to traffic police for general inspection.
 
 
 
When I stopped these three drivers I explained the offence to them, I told them that they will prosecuted in court for dangerous driving. The vehicles abreast were EE 4005A and EG 4031M where the former was on the third land and the latter was on the extreme right lane.
Volume of traffic at that time was moderate. Road surface was dry. No, there were no other vehicles which committed the same offence at that time. Yes, I used the official motorcycle TP65. PC 1178 was supposed to be my partner. However, PC 1178 didn`t see the incident. Yes, he came after I had stopped these three motor cars.
I trailed these three vehicles for about 1 km. I don`t know for how long I trailed them. Yes, I can identify the drivers (identified as the three accused). They are Tan Seow Pong 1244842/B, Pong Mun Hin 1401744/E and Chau Tiong Chee 1348888/F.`
That part of the magistrate`s grounds of decision which relates to the first charge against each of the appellants is as follows: 
 
PW2 managed to overtake these three motor cars when they slowed down due to the red traffic light at the junction of Fort Road where several other vehicles were already in a stationary position. The particulars of the three drivers were recorded. They were the three accused. The registration numbers of their vehicles were also recorded. These were EE 4005A, EG 4031M and SE 8498T. These vehicles were then sent for general inspection. These facts were not challenged by the accused. Based on these facts, particularly the fact that the vehicles were trying to gain the lead, I found that they did race among themselves.
 
 
 
Mr Fernando submitted on behalf of the appellants that since there was no evidence before the magistrate that each appellant did drive the motor vehicle specified in the charge against him, they should have been acquitted on the ground that an essential ingredient of the offence had not been proved. It was submitted that if Mr A is charged with driving motor car AB 123C in a dangerous manner, the prosecution must prove that (1) there was a person called Mr A (2) Mr A drove motor car AB 123C and (3) he drove it in a dangerous manner. In the cases under appeal, it was argued that the essential ingredient that is (2) has not been proved in each case.
Counsel referred to s 158(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code in support of the argument. He submitted that the charges in question preferred against the appellants were in compliance with this provision which required the identity of the cars to be proved. Section 158(1) reads as follows: 
 
The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place of the alleged offence and the person, if any, against whom or the thing, if any, in respect of which it was committed as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged.
 
 
 
He also referred to the case of 
 Beh Heng Seong v PP 
 
 
 
[1972] 2 MLJ 190
  which, he submitted, lent support to his submissions. In that case the accused was charged and convicted of manufacturing sour plum juice containing saccharin, an offence under the Sale of Food and Drug Regulations. The only evidence against him was the production in court of a bottle of the said juice offered for sale by the accused bearing a label with a portrait thereon and alleging that the manufacturer was one Beh Kwang Chee. No evidence was adduced to show whether Beh Kwang Chee was the name of a shop (ie name of a firm or sole proprietorship) or the name of a person or of its or his address. Also, no evidence was adduced to show that the accused was the sole proprietor of Beh Kwang Chee. He was convicted. The High Court allowed his appeal on the ground that no prima facie case had been made out against the accused. In my view, this case does not lend any support to the contention of counsel for the appellants.
For the Public Prosecutor, it was argued that the registration number of a motor car is not an essential ingredient to the offence of driving a motor vehicle in a manner which was dangerous to the public. So long as there is evidence that each of the appellants has driven a motor vehicle, that should be sufficient and the particulars of the charge relating to the registration number of the vehicle should be treated as mere surplusage. It was also contended that s 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Reprint) was applicable on the ground that if there was no proper identification of the specific car which was alleged to have been driven by each appellant, that would merely amount to an error in the statement of particulars required to be stated in the charge and that such error was not material because the appellant was in fact not misled by that error or omission. It was said that illustration (d) of that section was applicable to his case. Section 161 and the illustration are as follows: 
 
No error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated in the charge and no omission to state the offence or those particulars shall be regarded at any stage of the case as material unless the accused was in fact misled by that error or omission...
 
 
 
Illustrations
(d) A is charged with the murder of John Smith on 6 June 1891. In fact the murdered person`s name was James Smith and the date of the murder was 5 June 1891. A was never charged with any murder but one and had heard the inquiry before the magistrate which referred exclusively to the case of James Smith. The court may infer from these facts that A was not misled and that the error in the charge was immaterial.
 
 
 
Although the submission of counsel for the appellants is a clever attempt (which, it must be conceded, any accused is entitled to do) to take advantage of a simple oversight on the part of the Police Prosecutor, I have to deal with it on its merits.
Section 158(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code requires a charge to contain sufficient particulars to enable the accused to have notice of the matter with which he is charged. In a charge of driving a motor car in a dangerous manner, the identification of the motor car is such a particular. But a motor car can be identified in many ways, e.g. its registration number, its make, model or colour or even by its physical production in court. The registration number of a car happens to be the best and most convenient means of identifying a car, but not the only means. It follows that the registration number of a car when used as a means of identifying a car in a charge may be mere surplusage if that car can be identified by any other means. Having said that, I must also acknowledge that in these three cases, whether the cars were identified by their registration numbers (ie EE 4005A, SE 8498T and EG 4031 M) or their model names (ie Mitsubishi Colt Galant, Ford and Mitsubishi Colt Galant respectively), there was still no evidence which linked the appellants to the cars they were charged with driving. Now, let me take a hypothetical case where XYZ is charged with driving a motor vehicle No AB 123C in a dangerous manner and where at the trial XYZ is properly identified but the prosecution is unable to prove that the car alleged to have been driven by the accused is AB 123C. XYZ will be entitled to be acquitted on that ground alone. Why? Because it has not been proved that he has driven motor car AB 123C. But, failure to identify a car may be due to various reasons: (a) there is no such car AB 123C; (b) there is a car driven by the accused but its identity cannot be proved because the prosecution witness forgets the number or takes down the wrong registration number and there is no other means of identifying it, or (c) there is a car driven by the accused but its registration number is not ABC 123C but AB 456C. If the failure to identify the car is due to (a) or (b), there is no way of making good the charge against t he accused. But if the failure to identify the car is due to (c), then it is a simple matter for the prosecution to apply to the court hearing the case to amend at the appropriate time the charge to driving AB 456C. As McCullough J said in 
 Simpson v Roberts 
The Times, 21 December 1984, a charge which is good enough to enable an accused to identify the misdoing alleged can be amended so long as it continues to allege the same doing. Let me take a second hypothetical case where the facts are that the prosecution witness can identity XYZ and identify the car as No AB 123C but omits to say in evidence that that car is driven by XYZ. In that situation, there is no question but that the court is entitled to infer that XYZ is the driver of motor car AB 123C at the time and place stated in the charge. In other words, there will be some evidence on which the court may properly convict the accused - see Roskill LJ in 
 Scruby v Beskeen 
 [1980] RTR 420.
Let me apply the above analyses of the two hypothetical cases to the facts in these appeals. It can be seen at once that if each of the appellants had been tried separately, and PW2 had said he took down the particulars of the appellant and also the registration number of the motor car, there would have been some evidence to infer that the appellant drove the car that was identified: 
 Scruby v Beskeen 
. It is therefore clear that it is the joint trial of the appellants which has created the opportunity for the point to be raised by their counsel. Why should a joint trial in these circumstances afford a defence which would not have been available if each accused had been tried separately?
Before I answer this question, I should first like to dispose of the appeal of the first appellant, as his position, by an irony of fate, has been rendered dissimilar to that of the other two appellants. The first appellant was, in addition to his conviction for dangerous driving, also convicted on the third charge, ie driving motor car EE 4005A with defective brakes. He appealed against the conviction but withdrew the appeal when it came on for hearing before me. By so doing, he must be deemed to have admitted that he was driving the motor car EE 4005A at the time and place stated in the third charge against him. Since the third charge arose out of the same incident as the first charge, it follows that his appeal against his conviction on the first charge must fail.
The cases before me are different from those where the motor vehicles involved could not be identified at all. Here they were all properly identified. What is peculiar here is that there is no direct evidence to link each appellant to the driving of the car bearing the registration number as specified in the charge against him. But common sense dictates that each of the appellants identified by PW2 must have driven one of the three cars identified by PW2. Counsel for the appellants submitted that common sense has no application to and does not relieve the prosecution of its obligation to prove all the essential ingredients of an offence. With that proposition, I wholeheartedly agree (see Diplock J in 
 Jones v Metcalfe 
 [1967] 3 All ER 205, a case of a failure to identify the motor vehicle which caused the accident, where he said: `Like Lord Parker CJ, I have every sympathy with the magistrates because the inference of fact that the appellant was the driver of the lorry at the time of the accident is irresistible as a matter of common sense; but this is a branch of the law which has little to do with common sense.`).
But, has the prosecution in these cases before me failed to prove an essential ingredient of the charge against each of the remaining two appellants? I think not. In my view, the submission of counsel for the appellants is specious. It has nothing to do with an essential ingredient of a charge, which is here, the driving of a motor vehicle but with a failure to pinpoint a specified car to a specified accused. The prosecution has adduced prima facie evidence proving that the second appellant drove either motor car SE 8498T or EG 4031M on a charge of driving the former, and likewise in respect of the third appellant, on a charge of driving the latter. To acquit the second appellant and third appellant on the ground put forward by their counsel would lead to the conclusion that, as far as the law is concerned, neither the appellant was driving either of the two cars. This, in my view, is not only an absurdity in fact but also an absurdity in law.
In my view, the answer to the poser created by the prosecution having proved that the second appellant and the third appellant drove one or other of two cars, viz SE 849ST and EG 4031M but without being able to say who drove which, is that both the said appellants have been properly convicted of the offences as charged on the ground either:
 
 
(a) that the means of identification was mere surplusage, the prosecution having otherwise proved the existence of the motor vehicles driven by them at the time and place as charged, or 
 
(b) there was an error in each charge in respect of the means of identification of the car because if the second appellant did not drive motor car SE 8498T, then he drove motor car EG 403IM and the conclusion is likewise applicable to the third appellant.
  
 
 
An error of this nature comes within the purview of s 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The question that remains to be determined is whether such an error has misled the second and third appellants. In my view, neither appellant was misled by the error as both of them were aware they had driven the cars identified by PW2. They took a deliberate stand in refusing to enter a defence on what they believed or were advised to be a substantive defect in the case for the prosecution. I do not think that the omission to link each appellant to each of the cars as charged, in circumstances where both the appellants and the cars have been identified as having engaged in a race among themselves on the highway, is a substantive defect at all. In my view, illustration (d) to s 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code is apt.
Even if I were wrong in the above conclusions, I am of the view that section 395 of the Criminal Procedure Code applies to these three cases. The failure to pinpoint the motor cars to the appellants was, at the highest, an irregularity which has not and could not have occasioned any failure of justice. If I were to accept the submission of counsel for the appellants, I would be flying in the face of reality (that such appellant drove one or other of the two cars) and logic (that if each appellant did not drive one of the two cars, he must have driven the other car). That would be a travesty of justice. The appeals are therefore dismissed.

The plaintiffs have wholly discontinued this action against the first defendants.
The claim of the plaintiffs against the second defendant is the return or delivery of share certificate No 89407 for 1,000 Pan Malaysia Cement Works Bhd registered in the name of Chee Kheng Tong together with the relative transfer attached thereto. Damages for detention and/or conversion of the said share certificate No 89407.
The plaintiffs were at all material times stock and share brokers and a member of the Stock Exchange of Singapore (the SES) and so were the first defendants.
The plaintiffs were in possession of share certificate No 89407 which had been bought by the plaintiffs` clients Lee Ah Bee. On or about 19 March 1981 one Khoo Chee Keong came to the plaintiffs` office, fraudulently misrepresented himself as having authority to collect the shares for Lee Ah Bee, and collected two share certificates of Pan Malaysia Cement Works of 1000 each together with the duly executed transfer forms, for which Khoo Chee Keong tendered a cheque for $28,308. One of the share certificates collected by Khoo Chee Keong was certificate No 89407 (Ex P 1).
The cheque given by Khoo to the plaintiffs was dishonoured on 21 March 1981. The plaintiffs then made a police report and informed the SES of the fraud and the report of the fraud was circularised by the SES to all its members.
Khoo was arrested and charged for cheating. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 months` imprisonment on 6 June 1981. Police investigations revealed that Khoo had sold the 1000 shares to the first defendants and the other 1000 shares to the second defendant. The first defendants have returned the 1000 shares to the plaintiffs. The second defendant did not return the 1000 shares requested by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs gave a replacement certificate to Lee Ah Bee from their stock.
The second defendant says that he had known Khoo for about one year prior to March 1981. Sometime in March 1981, Khoo called at his office and said that he needed money urgently to settle some gambling debts. Khoo said that he had 1,000 Pan Malaysia Cement shares which he would like to sell to the second defendant at market price which at that time was about $14.10 or so and the price was rising.
The second defendant agreed to buy the shares and they arranged to meet outside the Lido Theatre which was just across the road from the second defendant`s bank, the Chase Manhattan Bank. He went to the bank and got some cash. He met Khoo and handed over $14,200 cash to Khoo who handed the share certificate ExP 1 with the transfer form attached to him.
Two weeks later he was called up by the police and was told that Khoo had fraudulently obtained the shares from a sharebroker firm. He gave a statement to the police and was told to keep the share certificate pending the outcome of the criminal case against Khoo.
Subsequently he learned that Khoo was convicted and sentenced. No long after that he received a letter from the plaintiffs` solicitors dated 13 June 1981 demanding the return of the shares to the plaintiffs.
The second defendant then sought legal advice. Subsequently in September 1981 he was advised by his solicitors to have the shares registered in his name. He then contacted by telephone Alfred Lim Eng Teck a remiser with GK Goh Securities and told him how he came to buy the 1,000 shares and about the legal advice he was given. Lim agreed that that was a good move. Eventually he handed the share certificate exh P1 and the transfer form to Lim for registration after signing the transfer form. Subsequently he was told by GK Goh Securities that the shares could not be registered in his name. His solicitors then took up the matter of registration with the Registrar of Pan Malaysia Cement Works.
The second defendant denies that the plaintiffs were entitled to the return of the share certificate exh P 1 for the following reasons:
 
 
(a) The plaintiffs as stock and sharebrokers, have negligently allowed Khoo to obtain possession of the share certificate; 
 
(b) The second defendant is a bona fidepurchaser for value of the said shares and had no notice that Khoo had obtained the share certificate fraudulently.
  
 
 
The second defendant submits that in the premises the plaintiffs are estopped by their own negligence from demanding the return of the share certificate and because the second defendant is the lawful owner of the shares.
Was the second defendant a purchaser for value, in good faith and without notice of the fraud?
The second defendant has given evidence of his relationship with Khoo and that he knew of the following facts about Khoo - he was then a commodities broker; he was gainfully employed in a respectable position; he seemed to be quite well he was a devout Christian and went to church regularly and took part in church activities. He became friendly with Khoo and they met often and had poker sessions with Khoo and two or three others friends.
Counsel for the second defendant asks, in those circumstances, why should the second defendant be put on notice when Khoo, a friend, wanted to sell his shares to him.
However well the second defendant knew Khoo he should have been wary and inquired how Khoo had acquired the shares.
Evidence was adduced by the plaintiffs of what the second defendant told the remiser Alfred Lim. Lim said that he knew the second defendant and had acted in the past as his remiser in the sale and purchase of stocks and shares. On or about 25 September 1981 the second defendant telephoned Lim to seek advice regarding 1,000 Pan Malaysia Cement shares which the second defendant said `he acquired by way of, in satisfaction of a gambling debt`. He gave the advice to have the shares registered in the second defendant`s name. The second defendant then brought the share certificate and the transfer deed to GK Goh Securities and sought the help of the firm to have the shares registered in his name Lim said: 
 
It is not the usual practice to ask clients to register shares into their names but in this instance my advice to second defendant was to register it into his own name because he mentioned to me that he had acquired the shares in satisfaction of a gambling debt.
 
 
 
The second defendant, however, in evidence said that what he told Lim was that he bought the shares from a friend who needed money urgently to settle a gambling debt and that he had sought legal advice and was advised to have the shares registered in his name. Lim agreed that that was a good move.
Lim was emphatic that the second defendant told him on the telephone that his friend had lost some money to him in gambling over some card games. He said that he knew of clients who bought shares from friends and he would advise them to register the shares into their names to ensure that they would get a good title and that they were not stolen or forged shares. He said that private sales of shares were infrequent and he would advise his clients to be wary. If the second defendant had told him that the shares were fraudulently obtained he would not have advised him to have the shares registered into his name. The second defendant did not at any time tell him that these shares were fraudulently obtained.
Counsel for the second defendant suggested that Lim had a poor recollection or he had misunderstood the second defendant and submitted that Lim`s evidence is unreliable.
I do not think that Lim had a poor recollection or that he misunderstood the second defendant. I accept Lim`s evidence that the second defendant told him that he (the second defendant) obtained the shares in satisfaction of a gambling debt.
As to the payment for the shares, the second defendant said that he went to his bank to cash about $6,000 to $7,000 and with the cash he already had in hand, he gave $14,200 to Khoo. However, in his defence he alleged that he paid $14,600 for the shares. In the statement of facts given by the prosecution at the trial of Khoo, it would appear that Khoo told the police that he sold the shares to the second defendant for $14,500.
The second defendant was unable to produce the cheque stub for the cash that he said he drew from the bank; he had destroyed the cheque stub in 1981 or 1982. He was also unable to produce the monthly bank statement which would show that he had drawn out the cash. He had also destroyed the monthly bank statements after he had closed the bank account in 1982.
He at first said that he recently asked the bank for the bank statements but was told that they could not give the statements as he no longer has an account with them. He then said what he meant to say was that the bank asked for his bank account number and he could not give it as he had forgotten it. He also said that he was instructed by his solicitors to go and see the bank about the statements. He did not go in 1981 because he was not asked by his solicitors to do so and it did not occur to him then that the question of his payment to Khoo would be relevant. He had consulted his solicitors and had left everything to them.
I cannot believe that he would not have a record of his bank account number with the Chase Manhattan Bank. It would be an easy matter for him or his solicitors to request the bank to supply a copy of the relevant bank statement. The second defendant could also have called Khoo to substantiate his story that he paid Khoo for the shares and how much. There is no evidence that Khoo was not available to give evidence.
I find that the second defendant was not a bona fide purchaser for value without notice.
The second defendant submits that the plaintiffs are estopped by their own negligence from demanding for the return of the share certificate from him.
The evidence is that on or about 19 March 1981 Khoo went to the office of the plaintiffs, represented himself as having authority to collect the shares, tendered a cheque for $28,308 and collected the shares. The plaintiffs say that it was the practice for stockbroking firms to deliver share scrips against payment by cheque. Gimson Chua Boon Kiat, the manager of plaintiff company, when questioned by counsel for the second defendant as to the procedure when a client had given the instructions to buy shares said: 
 
The client will call up the remiser to place X shares. The remiser would place the order through the central buyers to put on the board for the quotation of the price. Once the price on the board matches the client`s order the remiser would execute the contract note. The remiser would sign on the business done chit which would be passed to the accounts side of the firm for processing. The contract note would be sent out on the following day to the client. When the company received the share certificate and executed transfer form directly from the seller or from the stock exchange depending on the type of contract ... when we received these documents we would send debit note to the client and inform him that the shares have arrived and ready for collection. The client will either pay in cash or by cheque. The client can either send the cheque to us by post or send a representative to pay and collect on his behalf or he could come personally. Usually the client would approach the firm`s counter and give us a cheque and ask for the shares. It is the practice of all stockbroking firms that...
 
 
 
If the client produces the debit note to the counter clerk together with a cheque payable to us we would check through our records whether the shares had been picked up. The second form of payment is that the client produce a cheque and ask for the counter without the debit note. In this case we would ask him his name. We would then check through our records whether the counter ... there are always four copies of the contract note. The first copy sent to the client; the second copy is for the accounts room, the third copy is the debit note sent to the client and the fourth copy is kept by the payment dept. So when a client comes to pick up shares the payment side would run through the ledger to see whether it had been settled or still outstanding. If not settled we would accept the payment and hand over the share certificate and the executed transfer. 
 
T: Are you required to verify the identity of the person who has come to make the payment and collect the share cert and transfer is the actual client?
 
 
 
If the client produces the debit note to us we rely on the debit note and we accept that he is the client or a representative of the client authorised to collect and pay. If a person comes without a debit note to collect we will ask him the counter and the client`s name, whether he is picking up upon the behalf of a client or himself. He gives the client`s name, we will check through the ledger for the counter and the name. Once the ledger is outstanding we would give the share cert and the transfer to the person.
 
 
 
T: Am I correct to say that you take no steps to verify that the person collecting the share cert. and the transfer and making the payment is the actual client or a person authorised by the actual client?
 
 
 
That is correct. The usual practice is when a person gives us a cheque we would accept it and release the shares.
T: Do you at all verify that the cheque handed over was issued by the client?
 
 
 
We only check on the amount, the figures and the wordings. No, we were not concerned with the person who issued the cheque.
 
 
 
The necessary elements of estoppel by negligence are: (1) a duty of care owed to the party seeking to rely on the estoppel and (2) the negligent conduct must be the proximate or real cause of the loss (See 
 RE Jones v Waring & Gillow 
[1926] AC 670
(1); 
 Mercantile Bank of India v Central Bank of India 
[1938] 1 All ER 52; Spencer Bower & Turner 
 The Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation 
 (3rd Ed) pp 72-79; 16 
 Halsbury`s 
 (4th Ed) paras 1620-1623.)
The plaintiffs in this case owed the second defendant no duty of care. The plaintiffs had no reason to think that Khoo was not the representative of Lee Ah Bee and all they did was to deal with their property in the usual course of business - delivery against payment. The plaintiffs had not misled the second defendant in any way.
The fact that mere negligence in dealing with one`s own property does not give rise to an estoppel was forcibly emphasised by Lord Macnaghten in 
 Farquharson Brothers & Co v C King & Co 
[1902] AC 325
.
As regards damages the second defendant contends that the plaintiffs are only entitled to the loss of the value of the shares between March 1981 and May 1986 (the date of the hearing) which the plaintiffs have agreed amounted to $10,000.
The evidence is that Pan Malaysia Cement had after March 1981 declared bonus issues and dividends, with the result that under Certificate No 89407 there are, now 8,000 shares. The dividends declared are held by the Registrar of the Company pending the outcome of this case.
The contention of the plaintiffs is that if they had not given the replacement shares from their stock to Lee Ah Bee they would have received the bonus issues and the dividends in respect of the replacement shares. They submit that their loss would be in all $19,000.
I agree with counsel for the second defendant that the only loss suffered by the plaintiffs is the loss of the value of the shares which amounted to $10,000. The plaintiffs, in respect of certificate no 89407, have not lost the bonus issues and the dividends. In the normal course of events the replacement shares would have been sold by the plaintiffs and not kept by them to earn the bonus issues and the dividends.
I assess damages at $10,000.
In the result there will be judgment for the plaintiffs with costs. The counterclaim of the second defendant is dismissed with costs.
There will be an order that the second defendant deliver to the plaintiffs the share certificate no 89407 together with the relative transfer form and that the plaintiffs are entitled to the bonus issues and the dividends declared. There will also be an order that the second defendant pay to the plaintiffs $10,000 damages.

The applicant in this motion is an architect. He was charged and tried and found guilty on nine counts under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 104, 1970 Ed) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 103, 1970 Ed) and four counts under s 5(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 104, 1970 Ed) and was sentenced to varying terms of peremptory imprisonment from eight months to three months and to pay penalties ranging from $42,800, in default four months` imprisonment, to $2,025, in default two weeks` imprisonment, on the respective 13 counts. All sentences were stated by the trial judge to be concurrent. The applicant is unable to pay the imposed penalties on the said 13 counts. The default sentences have therefore become applicable. On each of the 13 charges where the default sentences apply, the peremptory plus default sentences will be as follows: 
 
(1) DAC 1054/83 (P1O) - (8+2) = 10 months
(2) DAC 1055/83 (P11) - (5+1) = 6 months 
(3) DAC 1056/83 (P12) - (8+2) = 10 months 
(4) DAC 1057A/83 (P13A) - (8+2) = 10 months 
(5) DAC 1058/83 (P14) - (8+2) = 10 months 
(6) DAC 1059/83 (P15) - (5+1) = 6 months 
(7) DAC 1060/83 (P16) - (5+1) = 6 months 
(8) DAC 1061/83 (P17) - (4+1/2) = 41/2 months 
(9) DAC 2184/83 (P18) - (4+1/2) = 41/2 months 
(10) DAC 1052/83 (P8) - (3+4) = 7 months 
(11) DAC 1053A/83 (P9B) - (3+1) = 4 months 
(12) DAC 1048A/83 (P4B) - (3+3) = 6 months 
(13) DAC 1049A/83 (P5B) - (3+1) = 4 months
 
 
 
It is against this background that the applicant, Richard Liong Kuo Chi, applies to the High Court by way of criminal motion for two declarations, namely, (1) that the maximum term of imprisonment imposed on him by the court in the above matters is ten months and (2) that the sentences imposed in the above matters (inclusive of the default sentences) are to run concurrently for a period of ten months from 18 August 1986, the date of conviction.
It is contended by the learned DPP that this application is misconceived in that the High Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an application of this nature and she cites in support the judgment of Coomaraswamy J in the case of 
 Kulwant Singh v PP 
 
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 10
 : 
 
The applicant was awaiting committal proceedings before a magistrate for the offence of rape. He made two statements to the police. One was under s 121(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The other was made earlier. He applied to the High Court to be furnished with certified copies of a number of documents arising out of the investigations. He was furnished with a certified copy of the first information report. His application for other documents was abandoned and he proceeded only with his application for a certified copy of the earlier statement to the police.
 
 
 
Held (inter alia): 
 
(1) the High Court has no jurisdiction to hear this application because:
(a) there is no provision in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act giving any such jurisdiction;
 
 
 
The motion papers of the applicant make no reference whatsoever to the statutory provision or provision under which he seeks to invoke the powers of the High Court. Counsel for the applicant was not able to cite any such statutory provision. I understand from the learned DPP that the applicant appealed against both the conviction and sentence of the District Court and his appeal under both heads were dismissed by the High Court. In my view, it was at this stage that the appellant could and should have asked the court to deal with the problem of his maximum term of imprisonment. It seems to me that there is no provision under our Criminal Procedure Code or the Supreme Court of Judicature Act whereby such an application can now be made and that therefore this application is misconceived.
It may well be that all is not lost for the applicant yet. Possibly the time to make his application could be when the applicant has served what he considers to be his full term of imprisonment imposed by the trial judge and has not been released by the prison authorities. Then perhaps he could make his application under s 326 of the Criminal Procedure Code. This, however, is a matter for the future.
Mr Cheng`s argument is that in the same way that sentences of peremptory imprisonment can be made to run concurrently, default sentences in the particular circumstances of this case could also run concurrently. In other words, what he is saying is that in this case the maximum sentence to be served by the applicant should be ten months, being eight months on the peremptory sentences plus two months on the default sentences and not the maximum of eight months` imprisonment plus the sum total of the default sentences.
Section 223(b)(iv) of the Criminal Procedure Code to my mind prohibits a magistrate or district judge trying the case from doing what the applicant asks me to say that the learned trial judge should have done. Section 223(b)(iv) says: 
 
Where any fine is imposed under the authority of any law for the time being in force then, in the absence of any express provision relating to such fine in such law contained, the provisions following shall apply:
 
 
 
(a) ...
(b) in every case of an offence in which the offender is sentenced to pay a fine the court passing the sentence may at any time before the fine has been paid in full in its discretion do all or any of the following things: 
... 
(iv) direct that in default of payment of the fine the offender shall suffer imprisonment for a certain term, which imprisonment shall be in excess of any other imprisonment to which he may be sentenced or to which he may be liable under a commutation of a sentence.
 
 
 
Reading s 223(b)(iv) together with s 223(c)(i) and (ii) which enacts: 
 
(c) the term for which the court directs the offender to be imprisoned in default of payment of a fine shall be as follows:
(i) if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for any term exceeding six months it shall not exceed one half of the term of imprisonment which is the maximum fixed for the offence; 
(ii) if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months it shall not exceed the term of imprisonment which is the maximum fixed for the offence;
 
 
 
It appears that a trial judge cannot make a default sentence to be served concurrently with that of a peremptory sentence. It seems to me also that by virtue of s 223(b)(iv) an imposition of a fine or penalty, as the case may be, if not paid, attracts a default sentence which has to be served in excess of the peremptory sentence imposed.
It seems to me therefore that the default sentences have to be served out in full but subject to the provisions of s 223(c)(i) and (ii). See 
 PP v Yuen Peng Lam 
 
 
 
[1969] 1 MLJ 211
 . In this case, the Malaysian court was construing s 102(c) of its Courts Ordinance 1948 (now replaced by Act 92 of 1972) which reads: 
 
When imprisonment is directed in default of payment of a fine or of costs or compensation ordered under the authority of any law for the time being in force, such imprisonment shall be consecutive to any other term or terms of imprisonment so directed and to any sentence of imprisonment otherwise imposed.
 
 
 
and held that the default sentences in lieu of fines imposed on two charges should run consecutively. Our s 223(b)(iv) is almost in pari materia with s 102(c) of the Malaysian Courts Ordinance 1948 except that for the words `shall be consecutive` in the Malaysian Act our section uses the words `shall be in excess`.
Whether the sentences should, in the instant case, be concurrent or consecutive is purely a view which I express and which cannot in my view be binding on the applicant. His proper remedy at the proper time would be against the prison authorities for what could be alleged by the applicant to be illegal or improper detention.
In view of what I have said, the motion is dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The accused, Tan Ho Teck, is charged for having committed murder by causing the death of his brother, Tan Kah Kuan, on 18 February 1984 at about 2.50pm at Block 118, Bukit Merah View, #10-99, Singapore, an offence punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code (Cap 103, 1970 Ed). Prior to the incident, the accused was living at the flat with his younger sister, Tan Lay Tin and his younger brother, Tan Kah Kuan, the deceased. Of the three of them, the deceased was the youngest. Living with them also is a friend of the accused, one Michael Liew. At that time the accused was by occupation a casual labourer, but at the date of the incident he was unemployed; the deceased was a coffee-shop assistant. Their mother left them long ago when they were very young and their father passed away in 1983.
On the morning of 18 February 1984, at about 8 am, Tan Lay Tin (Lay Tin) was awakened by somebody knocking at the front door and calling out loudly for the door to be opened. She recognized the voice as that of her second uncle, Tan Tiong Bin. But she was asked by the accused not to open the door; the accused said that the uncle was coming to collect money from him. Accordingly, the door was not opened and, eventually, after waiting for about ten minutes, the uncle left. Later that morning, Lay Tin telephoned the deceased, who, on the previous night, had stayed at their aunt`s flat. She narrated to the deceased that their uncle came that morning and that she did not open the door to him, as she was asked by the accused not to do so because the uncle came to collect money from the accused. The deceased told her that he would return to the flat later that day. Return he did later that morning, between 10 am and 12 noon.
After his return, the deceased, Lay Tin and the accused had a discussion on the money owed by the accused to their second uncle, and Lay Tin tried to call their uncle on the telephone with a view to speaking to him about the money but without success, as the line was engaged. Both Lay Tin and the deceased asked the accused to repay the money owing to their uncle. In the midst of their altercations, the accused accused the deceased of stealing the former`s watch, which the deceased denied. Lay Tin asked the accused not to make such wild allegations; she then searched for the watch in the flat but could not find it. The accused and the deceased were annoyed with each other; but the arguments between them did not continue.
Later the deceased asked Lay Tin whether she would like to go out with him for some food but she asked him to go first and said that she would follow as she had to wash her face. After she had her wash, she went down to the hawker stall but could not find the deceased. She then bought a packet of barbecued pork rice and a packet of fried `beehoon` and returned to the flat. On entering the flat, she found the deceased lying in the living room and watching a video tape; the accused was lying on the bed in the bedroom. She placed the packet of rice, which she bought for the accused, on the draining board next to the wash basin and poured the `beehoon` into a bowl, and shared it with the deceased. After they had eaten, Lay Tin and the deceased watched the videotape. Both of them were lying down on the floor while watching the videotape; the deceased was lying diagonally across the hall with his head on a pillow near the bedroom, and Lay Tin was lying beside him, next to the front door. Whilst she was watching the videotape, an idea struck her. She suggested to the accused that he should stay with her friend, Sen Cheow Kwang, for a few days. She made this suggestion because she said the accused was upset. The accused agreed to her suggestion, and thereupon she telephoned her friend, who agreed to the accused staying with him but requested her to telephone him again later that day with a view to making the arrangement. That telephone call, according to Sen who was called as a witness, was about 2.15pm. After the telephone call, she continued lying on the floor and watching the videotape. So did the deceased.
Some time later - the period she could not recall - while she and the deceased were watching the videotape, Lay Tin suddenly heard the deceased screaming aloud and shouting, `Cannot! Cannot!` (in Hokkien). She turned around and saw the deceased bleeding and at the same time she was stabbed by the accused with a knife. She struggled with the accused, attempting to wrench the knife from him, in the course of which, she was further stabbed-twice. All the three stabs were on her abdomen. The accused did not say anything. She asked him not to stab her further, and the deceased then told the accused that he (the deceased) did not steal the watch. The accused then opened the front door and let both of them out. The deceased went out first, followed by Lay Tin. After she came out of the flat, Lay Tin sought help from the neighbour, living at the flat across the corridor. She asked her neighbour to telephone her aunt and also for an ambulance. She then ran along the corridor to the staircase near the lifts A and B and went to the floor below, the ninth floor. According to her, she went there to hide herself at the landing. There she met the accused again, who then asked her where the deceased was, to which she replied she did not know. The accused then took the flight of stairs and went down while Lay Tin took the other flight of stairs and walked up to the tenth floor. On the tenth floor, she walked along the corridor to the lift at the opposite end, lift C. There she found the deceased just lying outside the rift on his back and facing upwards. When she spoke to him, he did not answer; she then felt giddy and became unconscious. She was then sitting on the floor with her back leaning against the lift door, which subsequently opened and she fen backwards with half her body inside the lift. Her neighbour, Koh Hock Phui, who had by then come to the lift, carried her out of the lift and put her in a sitting position with her back leaning against the wall. A short while later the police arrived.
On that day at the material time, PC Lim Kee Hock was performing patrolling duty with SC Mohamed Sani bin Abdul Rahim and SC Sani bin Ahmad. At about 2.52 pm, while patrolling along Margaret Drive, they received a message from the Police Control to proceed to Blk 118, Bukit Merah View, # 10-99, to attend to a case of fighting where persons had been injured. They went to Block 118 and arrived there at about 2.57 pm. They went to the tenth floor and found some blood stains in front of the flat, #10-99. They knocked at the door but there was no response. They then looked around and found the deceased and Lay Tin at the landing in front of lift C. They approached them and tried to talk to them but both of them did not respond. While SC Sani bin Ahmad stood there to preserve the scene, PC Lim and SC Mohamed Sani bin Abdul Rahim followed the trail of blood stains along the corridor, which led towards lifts A and B. They then went down to the third floor and found the accused lying on the floor and vomiting at or near the staircase. The time then was about 3.10 pm. There was a blood stain on his left leg. He was unable to talk and could not balance himself and walk steadily. PC Lim and SC Mohamed Sani bin Abdul Rahim carried him down to the void deck on the ground floor.
At about 3.14 pm, the ambulance arrived and the ambulance officer, Kamariah bte Mahmood, went up to the tenth floor and examined the deceased. She pronounced him dead. She then attended to Lay Tin and had her brought down to the ground floor where she saw the accused, who had sustained injuries on his leg. Both the accused and Lay Tin were then brought to the Singapore General Hospital.
Dr Wee Keng Poh, the forensic pathologist with the Department of Pathology at the Singapore General Hospital, upon being informed by the police, went to the flat about 5.45 pm on 18 February 1984. On examining the deceased in front of lift C on the tenth floor, he certified that the deceased had died within six hours of his examination. On the following day, at the Singapore General Hospital, Dr Wee performed a post-mortem on the deceased. He found only one fatal stab wound inflicted at the anterior abdominal wall over the epigastrium and in the midline, and that wound, in his opinion, was caused by a sharp instrument, such as a knife. It was a deep Wound about 10 cm deep. It went through the skin, the full thickness of the anterior abdominal wall and through the left lobe of fiver from the anterior surface of the left lobe through the superior surface, across the midline and cutting the right diaphragm into the right pleural cavity and through the right lobe of the lung. The direction of the wound was from the front to the back upwards and laterally to the right. Dr Wee found no other marks of external injuries or of recent operation. The cause of death, according to him, was haemorrhage due to the stab wound of the right lung and liver. In his opinion, the wound inflicted was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The wound was consistent with the deceased being stabbed while he was lying on his back facing upwards.
Lay Tin, who was taken to the Singapore General Hospital, was attended to by Dr Richard Chew Kim Huat, who is a senior lecturer and consultant surgeon of the Department of Surgery in the National University of Singapore. Lay Tin sustained three stabs wounds on her abdomen and they were:
 
 
(a) 3.5 cm stab wound at the left upper abdominal wall; 
 
(b) 2.5 cm stab wound at the left middle abdominal wall; 
 
(c) 2 cm stab wound below the ambilicus.
  
 
 
All the three wounds had penetrated the abdominal wall and entered the abdominal cavity. The liver was lacerated about three cm and there were three perforations in the stomach due to the stab wounds. Emergency surgery was performed and injuries to the stomach and liver were repaired. She made good recovery during the postoperative period and was discharged from hospital well on 26 February 1984.
The accused was brought to the A & E Department at the Singapore General Hospital at about 3.36 pm and was attended to by Dr Kothagoda Henry. The doctor`s finding is as follows (as stated in his report, exh P 40): 
 
(2) On examination, he was in coma III. The pupils were dilated. His breath smelled of alcohol and there was vomitus over his chest. There was conjunctival suffusion and sinus tachycardia (rate 130 per minute). The heart sounds were dual and regular and lung fields clear. The abdomen was soft and non-tender. The only injury noted was a two cm shallow laceration of the left leg anteriorly.
(3) Blood was taken for analysis and this was found to contain 232 mg ethanol per 100 ml of blood. Staff nurse Koh Puay Keng assisted me in the taking of the blood sample.
 
 
 
The investigating officer in this case is Inspector Lim Bong Chang of Queenstown Police Station. He saw the accused at about 5.10 pm on 18 February 1984 at the emergency unit operation theatre at Singapore General Hospital. At that time, the accused was still unconscious and Inspector Lim placed him under arrest and instructed PC Tan Mong Teck to escort the accused to Changi Prison Hospital. When he was brought to Changi Prison Hospital, he was seen by Dr Naranjan Singh at about 10 pm and he was, according to the doctor, still unconscious and in coma III.
On 20 February 1984 at about 11.50 am, Inspector Lim went with a magistrate, Mr Ismail Hamid, to Changi Prison Hospital and there the accused was charged for murder under s 302 of the Penal Code. At about 2 pm on the same day, he was informed that the accused was discharged from Changi Prison Hospital and he directed DPC 7540 Andrew Singh to bring the accused to the station from Changi Prison Hospital. On the following day, at about 11.06 am, he went with the accused, DPC 7540 Andrew Singh and DPC 1253 Koh Thiam Slew to Blk 118, Bukit Merah View, #10-99. The accused led him to his bedroom and pointed to an empty bottle of `Hennessy` brandy. The accused told him that he had consumed the bottle of `Hennessy` brandy before the stabbing incident. The bottle was produced at the trial, exh P45.
On the same afternoon, at about 12.06 pm, the accused was brought back to the police station and Inspector Lim arranged for a CID interpreter, Miss Liu Chee Kuan, to act as an interpreter and recorded a statement from the accused under s 121(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The statement (the s 121(6) statement) was not objected to by Mr Assomull, counsel for the accused, and was admitted. It is as follows: 
 
The deceased Tan Kah Kuan is my younger brother. I do not know whether or not I had murdered the deceased on the day in question as stated in the charge because I was drunk that day. I can`t remember anything. I don`t believe that I would do such a thing. He is my brother, how could I murder him? We stay together and I do not bear any grudge against him. Prior to the murder, I had consumed a big bottle of `Hennessy` at-home, that is the place of the murder. I really cannot recollect what had happened that day. That is all I have to say.
 
 
 
Four days later, Inspector Lim took a further statement from the accused under s 120(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code and the prosecution tendered the statement (the s 120(1) statement) in evidence under s 121(5) of the Code. Mr Assomull objected to the admission of this statement on the ground that in taking this statement Inspector Lim did not caution the accused that he, the accused, was entitled to decline to make any statement which would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or forfeiture and that this caution was contained in or was implicit in s 120(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code. In his submission this provision had not been complied with and this statement was therefore inadmissible. We overruled this objection as, in our view, s 120(2) does not prescribe any caution to be administered in taking the statement. There was no suggestion by Mr Assomull that the statement was obtained by an inducement, threat or promise made to the accused.
The prosecution also produced evidence showing that the accused was admitted to Woodbridge Hospital on 9 April 1980. He was sent there by Dr BK Ng of Alexandra Hospital with a report that he was admitted to that hospital for attempted suicide by cutting both his wrists. The accused in Woodbridge Hospital was examined by Dr Lim Shin Loh, the psychiatrist, who found no evidence of mental illness or mental subnormality. He was in Woodbridge Hospital until 25 April 1980 when he was discharged.
At the close of the case for the prosecution, Mr Assomull submitted that there was no case to answer, relying on the fact that the accused was heavily intoxicated and that the accused by reason thereof did not have the intention of committing the offence for which he was charged. We disagreed with him entirely and held that the prosecution had made out a case which, if unrebutted, would warrant a conviction for the offence. We therefore called upon the accused to enter upon his defence.
The accused elected to give evidence. In his opening address, Mr Assomull put forward three defences:
 
 
(i) that the accused at the time when he stabbed his brother did not have the intention to inflict the bodily injury on the deceased, as was inflicted, which caused the death of the deceased; 
 
(ii) that the accused by reason of the intoxication was insane at the time when he stabbed the deceased; and 
 
(iii) that at the time when he stabbed the deceased, he was suffering from such abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his act in causing the death of the deceased. In his evidence the accused said that prior to the incident he was living at the flat with his younger sister, Lay Tin, and his younger brother, the deceased. He also had a friend, Michael Liew, living with him. According to him, the relationship between him on the one hand and his brother and sister on the other was good; they did discuss things together and they were all pleased with the idea of living together. The idea of living together came from him originally, and his sister and brother both agreed. They did not quarrel and in fact they were the only next-of-kin he had.
  
 
 
He confirmed that on the morning of 18 February 1984, his second uncle, Tan Tiong Bin, came and knocked at the front door of their flat. He knew that it was his second uncle because he peeped through the side and saw him there. He requested his sister, Lay Tin, not to open the door as his uncle came to collect money from him, and he had no money to pay his uncle. The door was not opened and his uncle then left. He was afraid of his second uncle. He was not aware that subsequently Lay Tin telephoned his younger brother, though he was aware that his younger brother had spent the previous night elsewhere. His brother did come home and the three of them had a discussion about repaying the money owing to their uncle. Both his brother and sister asked if he had found a job and said that he should repay their uncle if he had the money. He replied that he would pay something when he found a job. He said that they were satisfied with the discussion and that there was no heated argument between them. He also denied that he accused his younger brother of stealing his watch; he only asked his brother whether he had seen his watch. He was not sure of the time then. He went to his bedroom and lay on his bed. He was upset and worried as he had no money to pay his uncle and he thought of the past and of the people who might laugh at him and say that he was mad, as he had lived in Woodbridge Hospital. He then took a glass from the kitchen and a bottle of `Hennessy` brandy on the top of the showcase in the hall; that bottle of brandy belonged to his sister. At that time he could not remember whether his brother and sister were around. He poured the liquor into a full glass and drank it. After that he went back to bed but he was not sure how long he lay down. He got up again and continued to drink the brandy until he consumed the whole of the contents of the bottle. After he had consumed the brandy, he went to the kitchen for some water as he was very thirsty. He said that at about that time, his sister suggested to him that he should stay with a friend for a few days since he had no money to pay his uncle and that he could return after he had the money. He nodded to this suggestion but he was not sure whether his sister did make the telephone call to her friend. He did not pay any attention to what his younger brother was doing. After drinking water in the kitchen, he thought of committing suicide and therefore took a knife from a drawer in the kitchen and went into his bedroom. He did not at that time notice whether his sister and brother were watching the videotape. When he was in the bedroom with the knife, he sat at the dressing table and looked at the mirror. Then he felt that a lot of people were around him, abusing him and humiliating him, which made him forget about committing suicide. He could not say who the people were. He did not at the time feel that he had the knife in his hand. The people persisted in surrounding him and refused to go away. He then chased them but was not sure where he chased them. He then felt that he tripped and had a fall. He was not sure where he fell and did not know what he did. He heard crying afterwards which appeared to be that of his sister but he did not know why she was crying. He was not sure whether he opened the door and he was not sure also whether they left the flat. He went to the kitchen to wash his head; he had a severe headache and his head was hot. He went to the sink and placed his head below the water tap and let the water run down his head. After washing his head, he looked for his pair of spectacles in the bedroom but was not sure whether he looked for it in the sitting room. Subsequently, he went out to find out if he had caused injuries to his brother and sister; he heard crying. When he left the flat, he was not sure whether he turned left or right, but he walked and went down the stairs and saw his younger sister, whereupon he asked where his younger brother was. He could not hear what Lay Tin said to him. He continued to walk down the stairs; but he did not know if he fell down, he became unconscious. He regained consciousness only when he was in Changi Prison Hospital. When Inspector Lim brought the magistrate and informed him that he had committed the offence of murder, only then did he realize that he had killed his brother. He confirmed that he gave two statements to Inspector Lim.
He then gave evidence of his family background. He had a very unhappy childhood. When he was very young, at the age of about 13 years, his mother left the family and his father then had a woman living with him, who acted as the stepmother to him and his brother and sister. He was very badly treated by the stepmother. This was corroborated by Lay Tin. In her evidence, she said that she was even more cruelly treated by her stepmother. His uncle, Tan Kok Meng, also gave evidence and he confirmed that the accused, his brother and sister were badly treated by the stepmother. The uncle also said that the accused`s father was not very responsible; at an early age he forced the accused to work and took most of the earnings from the accused. All the children were badly treated by the stepmother; they did not have food cooked by the stepmother and their clothing were not washed. In fact, he said that there was one occasion when the accused came to his grandmother`s place with a lot of wet clothing bundled up. The uncle said that he knew that they were beaten up by the stepmother.
His uncle also testified that the relationship between the accused, his brother and sister was good. He said that when the accused was in jail after his conviction for rape, his brother and sister used to bring him food.
His uncle also said that when the accused was charged for rape, he raised money to engage a lawyer to defend the accused but had never asked for repayment of the money, except that on one occasion, at a family reunion dinner, the second uncle did tell the accused that he should try to repay the money to his uncle if he could.
We now turn to the medical evidence adduced on behalf of the accused which consists of principally the evidence of Dr Nagulendran, a consulting psychiatrist in private practice, who was formerly a psychiatrist at Woodbridge Hospital. Dr Nagulendran interviewed and examined the accused at Queenstown Remand Prison on 6 and 7 February 1987, and also examined the ss 121(6) and 120(1) statements and the statements produced at the pre inquiry. He was present throughout the trial. He prepared a report dated 9 February 1987 and an addendum thereto dated 21 February 1987. He also gave evidence before us. In his opinion, the accused, at the time when he stabbed his brother and his sister, was suffering from delirium due to acute alcoholic intoxication, and as a result he was incapable of knowing the nature of his act or that what he did was wrong; he did not know what he was doing. He explained that delirium is a mental illness and cited to us authorities from learned textbook writers in support. According to an authority which he cited, delirium is defined as `a psychiatric syndrome characterized by a transient disorganization of a wide range of cognitive functions due to widespread derangement of cerebral metabolism.` In this case he identified first, the acute alcoholic intoxication and secondly, the features of delirium which were present in the accused. In so far as the acute alcoholic intoxication is concerned, there was ample evidence in support, namely:
 
 
(i) consumption of a large quantity of brandy in undiluted by the accused before the time when the accused stabbed his brother and sister; 
 
(ii) evidence of the police officers that they found the accused on the third floor, unable to talk or walk steadily and smelled of alcohol; 
 
(iii) evidence of Dr Henry that the accused, when he was brought to the Singapore General Hospital, was heavily intoxicated, and on examination, he was found to be in coma III; his blood was taken for analysis and was found to contain 232 mg ethanol per 100 ml of blood.
  
 
 
On the basis of such acute alcoholic intoxication and his examination and interview of the accused, he made the finding that the acute alcoholic intoxication together with certain predisposing factors in the case of the accused produced delirium. This finding is of course based on his own inference from his interview and examination of the accused, examination of the ss 121(6) and 120(1) statements, and evidence given by witnesses. He identified the following features of delirium being present in the accused, namely:
 
 
(a) there was a clouding of consciousness; the accused was unable to recall how he stabbed his brother and sister until, all of a sudden, he realized it; 
 
(b) the accused`s experience of fear, depression, irritability and confusion; 
 
(c) his hallucinations and illusions in that he said he saw images of people laughing at and mocking him, and his mis-identification of his brother and sister whom he stabbed; 
 
(d) the assaultive behaviour on the part of the accused in that he used the knife to attack what he saw as images when in fact they were his brother and sister; 
 
(e) the lucid period which the accused had, ie the period after he realized that his brother and sister were stabbed and he went to the kitchen and threw the knife into the basin and used the cloth to wipe the blood from his left leg. This lucid period continued till the time when he walked out of the flat and went down to the ninth floor when he saw his sister and when he asked his sister where his brother was. This lucid period fluctuates with the period of clouding of consciousness which is a characteristic of delirium; 
 
(f) lastly, the accused talked very little which was a sign of impoverishment of thought and such absence of conversation is not inconsistent with delirium.
  
 
 
Dr Nagulendran also mentioned that there were factors in the accused`s life which would make him more predisposed to having delirium upon consumption of alcohol. First, there was the broken home in which there were frequent quarrels between his father and mother, with the mother leaving home when he was very young and the father cohabiting with another woman who was regarded as the stepmother. Secondly, in 1980, he was extremely depressed when he was rejected by his girlfriend and he attempted to commit suicide. Subsequently, he was charged and convicted of rape. Thirdly, the attempt to commit suicide indicates a serious instability of the mind, and lastly, he was depressed as he was unable to pay the debt owing to his uncle. Dr Nagulendran expressed the view that the accused has a poor tolerance and with these predisposing factors he would be more vulnerable to delirium than normal persons upon his taking a vast quantity of alcohol.
Dr Nagulendran added that a person suffering from delirium also suffers from an abnormality of mind induced by disease, and such abnormality of mind substantially impairs his mental responsibility for his act.
Next, we have Professor Yeoh Teow Seng of the Department of Pharmacology at the National University of Singapore. He gave evidence on how the body handles alcohol and on the different stages of blood alcohol concentration. He said that coma I, II and III describe different levels of consciousness or unconsciousness. The progress from coma I to coma III is a gradual process. At the stage of coma III, the person would become unconscious and can only be awakened by some pain; at the stage of coma II, the person is unconscious but he can be awakened. At the stage of coma 1, the person is merely in an intoxicated state and would be unstable on his feet. He said that at coma I, a person would be irrational and have a delirium or hallucination and also at that stage, all his inhibitions would be removed and his innate nature and character is manifested.
The prosecution called Dr Chew Seck Kee, the psychiatrist in charge of Woodbridge Hospital, to give rebuttal evidence. Dr Chew examined the accused on 27 February 1984, and he gave a report dated 9 March 1984 to the effect that the accused was not of unsound mind and was fit to stand trial. According to him, the accused was able to recall all the events up to the time he went to the kitchen and took the knife. The accused even remembered his sister telling him that she would have to go to the neighbour to call for an ambulance and he also remembered how he went to the kitchen, washed his head and took a cloth and wiped his wound, and thereafter, went to look for his spectacles. In the opinion of Dr Chew, the essentials of delirium, apart from clouding of consciousness, are disorientation and impairment of memory. In this case, as the accused is capable of recalling all the details mentioned and discriminated his brother and sister and even remembered such a thing as calling of the ambulance, he had no memory disturbance or impairment. He appeared to Dr Chew to be conscious and to have full orientation of his surroundings with no amnesia of events before or after the stabbing. In view of the things he could remember, his conduct is not consistent with someone who had suffered delirium. Dr Chew therefore came to the conclusion that at the time of stabbing his brother and sister, the accused was not suffering from delirium and was sane. Dr Chew is also of the opinion that the accused was not suffering from any abnormality of mind that substantially impaired mental responsibility for the act in causing the death of his brother.
Dr Chew did concede that the accused with his predispositions could have delirium after consuming a bottle of brandy; that the accused is more prone to depression because of his predispositions, and that delirium can occur in a person having such predispositions and being prone to depression. He also conceded that a person suffering from delirium can get into a state of clouding of consciousness as quickly as he gets out of it, and that the period of lucidity would fluctuate. The clouding of consciousness can be very brief and when consciousness returns he becomes aware of his surroundings; he would be able to be aware of what he did before and outside the period of clouding of consciousness. According to Dr Chew, the predisposing factors are these: (i) extremes of life - youth and age, (ii) head injury; (iii) immaturity of the brain; (iv) condition reducing blood supply to the brain; (v) intense fear and anxiety; (vi) intense depression and (vii) condition of the brain. One or other of the factors together with alcohol or disease would be enough to cause delirium. Alcohol precipitates delirium.
We entertained some reservations on Dr Chew`s diagnosis of the accused. First, in so far as his medical report of 9 March 1984 is concerned, it is not of much assistance to us. That report was prepared by him, after his examination of the accused, for the purpose of determining whether the accused was or was not of unsound mind and fit to stand trial. The examination was not directed towards finding out whether the accused at the time when he stabbed his brother and sister was suffering from delirium due to acute alcoholic intoxication. That was not his fault as he was not asked to make an assessment on that aspect. At any rate, he could not have made such an assessment at that time as the report of Dr Kothagoda Henry was then not available, though presumably he could have obtained the necessary information from Dr Henry at the time when he wrote the report. Secondly, apart from examining the accused in March 1984, he did not appear to us to have made a subsequent thorough examination and a considered reassessment of the accused to determine whether he was suffering from delirium at the time when he stabbed his brother and sister. Here again Dr Chew was not asked to carry out such an examination and re-assessment. This, we consider, is a lapse on the part of the prosecution. On the basis of the information available, the prosecution should have been alive to the likelihood that s 85(2)(b) of the Penal Code would be invoked by the defence, and should have then requested Dr Chew to make a thorough re-examination of the accused and re-assessment of the mental condition of the accused at the material time. As it is, we find that Dr Chew in giving evidence before us was doing so on the basis of his clinical notes made by him in March 1984. Not unnaturally, he was extremely defensive on the finding he made or the lack of finding necessary to support his view. It seems to us also that his view of the accused`s mental condition at the material time was, to a certain extent, coloured by the s 120(1) stat ement of the accused and the accused`s previous medical record at Woodbridge Hospital. He very candidly admitted that he was influenced by that statement and that he would have been more inclined to believe the accused if he had not had the accused`s previous record.
Dr Nagulendran`s opinion that at the material time the accused was suffering from delirium was based on his inference from (i) the facts as he found them; (ii) the statements made by the accused, both the s 121(6) statement and the s 120(1) statement made by the accused to Inspector Lim on 21 and 25 February 1984 respectively and (iii) statements made to him by the accused when the latter was examined by him. In this connection, we find Dr Nagulendran`s report slightly unsatisfactory in one respect: he attributed too readily to the accused the latter`s subjective experience of `feeling of confusion, terror and irritability` which he identified as some of the features of delirium. There was not much evidence of the `feeling of confusion, terror and irritability` on the part of the accused at the material time. As for hallucinations and illusions which the accused said he experienced, we note that the accused made no mention of these in the s 121(6) statement. However, Dr Nagulendran had given an explanation which we accept. At the time of the s 121(6) statement, the accused only came out of coma shortly, and his memory subsequently improved as is evidenced by the s 120(1) statement where he said he saw many images around him and humiliating him, after he had consumed the brandy. It is significant that at that stage he had not as yet been examined and interviewed by any psychiatrist in relation to the incident. The accused also mentioned his experience of hallucinations and illusions to Dr Chew subsequently; there he used the words `strange devils`, as recorded by Dr Chew. Having considered all the evidence before us, we accept the accused`s evidence that he experienced hallucinations and illusions, and we accept the opinion of Dr Nagulendran.
There are uncontroverted facts which appear to us to support the findings of Dr Nagulendran. First, prior to the incident the accused, the deceased and Lay Tin were living together at the flat. There was no friction or enmity between the two brothers and between the accused and Lay Tin. There was evidence that the relationship between the accused and the deceased was good. According to Lay Tin, on the morning of 18 February 1984, after the deceased had returned to the flat there was a heated exchange of words which arose out of two matters: (i) the deceased requesting the accused to repay the money owing to the uncle, and (ii) the accused accusing the deceased of stealing the watch. That heated exchange of words, however, did not continue or accelerate into any fight or exchange of blows. According to Lay Tin, it did not develop into a serious situation. Secondly, the accused consumed a large quantity of brandy undiluted nearly a full bottle. That bottle of brandy belonged to Lay Tin and was on top of the showcase in the hall. The accused took it into his room and drank the whole of the contents thereof. We accept the evidence of the accused that he started to drink the brandy before the stabbing and had consumed the contents of the bottle before the incident. He must have started to drink the brandy at the time when Lay Tin was having a wash in the kitchen just before she went out to get some food or when she went out, If Lay Tin had seen him taking the bottle into his room she would probably have objected as, according to her, a few days earlier the accused consumed some brandy from that bottle and she admonished him for so doing without her permission; and Lay Tin did not see the accused taking the bottle into his room or drinking the brandy. Thirdly, he must be very depressed and worried that afternoon as he could not repay the money owed to his uncle, and that was apparent to Lay Tin who suggested to him to stay with her friend for a few days and took the initiative of telephoning her friend for that P urpose. Fourthly, the stabbing took place all of a sudden for no rhyme or reason; it was not preceded immediately by any quarrel between the accused and the deceased. The earlier heated exchange of words took place before lunch two or three hours earlier. There was no apparent motive or reason for the stabbing. He not only stabbed his brother but also stabbed his sister; he stabbed her three times. When he stabbed her he did not utter any words. There was no heated exchange of words between him and his sister that morning. Lastly, after stabbing his brother and sister he let them leave the flat. He did not hide the knife or wipe all the blood on him; he did not run away. When he met his sister on the ninth floor, he merely asked where his brother was and then took the flight of stairs and walked down. All these seem extremely irrational.
At the time when he stabbed his brother and sister he must have been very heavily intoxicated; he must then be in an advanced state of coma I. We accept the evidence of the accused that after the stabbing he went to the kitchen, washed his head under the tap and then went out of the flat and met his sister on the ninth floor. When PC Lim and SC Mohamed Sani bin Abdul Rahim found him on the third floor, he was wet. At that point of time his condition must be on the verge of reaching coma II; he was then vomiting and could not walk steadily or talk, and when he was carried to the void deck on the ground floor he was unconscious - he was then at least in coma II. And when he was brought to the Singapore General Hospital, Dr Henry found him in coma III.
Having considered all the evidence before us, we are satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused at the material time when he stabbed his brother and sister was suffering from delirium due to acute alcoholic intoxication and that by reason of the intoxication he was insane at the time of stabbing and did not know what he was doing. In view of this, it is unnecessary for us to consider the other defences, namely: (i) that the accused by reason of his intoxication did not form the specific intention of committing the offence on which he was charged, and (ii) that the accused was suffering from an abnormality of mind induced by disease or injury which substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his act in causing the death of the deceased.
Accordingly, pursuant to s 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code, we find that the accused did on 18 February 1984 at about 2.50 pm at Blk 118, Bukit Merah View, #10-99, Singapore, stab and cause the death of his brother, Tan Kah Kuan, but he was, by reason of unsoundness of mind at that time, incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that what he was doing was either wrong or contrary to law. We order that the accused, Tan Ho Teck, be kept in safe custody pending the order of the Minister under s 314 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
 Order accordingly.",1987-03-06 00:00:00,SG High Court

The appellants were convicted of the following offence, namely: 
 
That you between 1.30pm on the 20 September 1981 and 9.25am on 25 September 1981 at East Coast Parkway, five kilometres, Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of you both, committed murder by causing the death of one, Kalingam s/o Mariappan, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 103).
 
 
 
The facts as proved before the learned trial judges are these. On 20 September 1981 at about 12 o`clock noon the first and second appellants went to a coffee stall at a hawkers` centre. There they met the late Kalingam s/o Mariappan (the deceased) whom they both knew. The first appellant had known the deceased for a number of years but there was bad blood between them, and they had frequent quarrels and fights. The appellants had a conversation with the deceased and together they had some drinks; the appellants each had a beer and the deceased had a stout. After that the appellants invited the deceased to go with them to Changi Airport for some drinks. At first the deceased refused but later he was persuaded to go along. The first appellant drove his uncle`s lorry, No Y5505, with the deceased seated beside him and the second appellant at the back. On the way there the first appellant had a quarrel with the deceased and the first appellant drove the lorry to a side track at East Coast Parkway and stopped the lorry. All three of them alighted from the lorry. The first appellant took a rake which was in the lorry and hit the deceased on the head with it. The deceased fell, got up and ran. The first appellant tried to stop him but failed. He called upon the second appellant to catch the deceased which the second appellant did. The first appellant then went up to the deceased, caught hold of him and dragged him along for a short distance. He gave the rake to the second appellant and the second appellant then hit the deceased twice on the head with the rake. The blows landed on his nose and he fell. The first appellant then placed his foot on the deceased`s chest and asked the second appellant to bring some petrol from the lorry. The second appellant brought the petrol, poured it over the deceased`s body and the first appellant then lighted a match and set fire to the deceased, who got up and ran around howling in pain. They then left the deceased.
Before the learned trial judges there was adduced expert evidence from Professor Chao Tzee Cheng, the Senior Forensic Pathologist, who performed an autopsy on the deceased. He reported that there were three serious fractures in the skull of the deceased: (1) a hairline cracked fracture of 3 cm on the right frontal bone (2) a depressed fracture 2.5 cm on the right parietal bone and (3) a cracked fracture 3 cm on the right parietal bone at the temporal suture. In his opinion injuries (2) and (3) had caused internal brain damage which in the ordinary course of nature would have caused death and death would have followed a few minutes after the injuries. Professor Chao also said that when the deceased was on fire he was still active and that 40% of his total body surface was burnt and such extent of burn would be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
On the evidence the learned trial judges found it was the second appellant who inflicted the fatal blow on the deceased`s head, and that there was common intention of both the appellants to cause injuries to the deceased which in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. They said, at pp 28-29: 
 
Admittedly, the second accused might not have had the intention to cause hurt to the deceased even up to the time when the lorry stopped at the track off East Coast Parkway but when he chased and caught the deceased, that was when he formed the intention to join the first accused to cause hurt to the deceased. What followed clearly established that common intention. After the second accused caught the deceased the first accused came and grabbed hold of the deceased by the neck from behind. Then the second accused hit the deceased on the head with the rake which the first accused had handed to him. Together they then set the deceased on fire.
 
 
 
Before us Mr Subhas Anandan on behalf of the first appellant proceeded on only one ground of appeal, namely, the absence of common intention to cause injuries sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, and expressly abandoned all the other grounds of appeal and in particular the contention that the statement made by the first appellant under s 121(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code was not admissible on the ground that it was not made voluntarily. He argued that the learned trial judges found that it was the second appellant, who inflicted the fatal blow on the deceased, and at that time no common intention had been formed by the appellants. He conceded, however, that at the time the second appellant poured petrol on the deceased both of them formed the common intention but at that time the deceased was already dead.
We were unable to accept this argument. On the evidence before the learned trial judges it could hardly be said that both the appellants at the time or immediately before the fatal blow was inflicted did not have the common intention to cause injuries to the deceased which in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. Further, the evidence also showed that the deceased was still alive when the second appellant poured petrol on the deceased and the first appellant set fire on the deceased.
Mr Pala Krishnan on behalf of the second appellant did not really proceed with his argument on the appeal; he also abandoned the contention that the statement made by the second appellant under s 121(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code was not admissible on the ground that it was not voluntary. Nor did he dispute the finding of the learned trial judges that the second appellant inflicted the fatal blow. So far as the second appellant is concerned the absence of a common intention was immaterial as he was the one who inflicted the injuries which caused the death of the deceased, and on the evidence there was nothing which could be usefully urged on his behalf.
We therefore dismissed the appeal and affirmed the convictions of both the appellants.

In this appeal, the plaintiff obtained judgment in the High Court in the sum of $142,072 for personal injuries suffered by him in the course of his employment as a member of the crew of the ship MV `Kohekohe` (the ship) against the defendants, the owners of and other persons interested in the ship. The claim was for negligence and breach of duty by the defendants, their servants or agents in the management of the ship, in particular, that the defendants had failed to provide a safe system of work. The defendants appeal against the judgment, both on liability and quantum of damages. By way of a respondent`s notice, there is also a cross-appeal by the plaintiff for a variation of the quantum of damages.
The facts are that on 28 May 1978, the ship was anchored in the port of Kuwawa, French Caledonia. Just before the accident, the ship, a bulk carrier, had completed loading nickel ore and the plaintiff and other members of the crew were engaged in closing the hatches of the ship. They had closed three of the four hatches of the ship. The accident occurred when hatch No 4 (the hatch) was being closed.
The hatch cover was of the concertina type. It was pulled to cover the hatch by a steel hawser operated by the anchor winch. This winch, located at the bow of the ship, was about 100 m away from the hatch. Because of the distance of the winch from the hatch, the steel hawser had to pass through various sheaves and blocks which were attached to eye-lugs permanently fixed to the upper deck.
The plaintiff assisted in the closing of the hatch. He had to insert a pin through the hatch cover after it had been completely pulled over the hatch so as to secure it. As for the winchman, he could not see for himself when the hatch was completely covered by the hatch cover. He has to rely on two or three signalmen, one of whom was stationed near hatch No 3 which was next to hatch No 4.
The case for the plaintiff was that he was standing near the hatch. The cover of the hatch was being pulled by the winch. There was tension in the steel hawser. The hatch was then completely closed. The signalman at hatch No 3 gave him a signal to close the hatch. He then crossed over the steel hawser to go to the hatch cover of the hatch to insert the pin. He was straddling the hawser having his right leg over it. Suddenly the steel hawser whipped through the right leg of the plaintiff. It had completely severed the leg from his body. After the accident, it was found that an eye-leg which was at the bollard near the hatch had been pulled out of its position and the sheaves and the block had come off together with the steel hawser.
There was evidence that two methods were used on the ship for opening and closing the hatches, the anchor winch method which was used on the day of the accident, and the crane method. We have said enough on the anchor winch method. The crane method is by the use of the crane nearest to the hatch. Wire is attached by means of a shackle to the end of the hatch cover and the wire is led through various sheaves and blocks and hooked on to the cargo hook of the crane. Then by operating the hoisting lever of the crane it will move the hatch cover and close the hatch. Only two persons would be required for this operation: there is the crane operator who sits in a small cabin high above the deck and who can see what is going on at the hatch; the other person would be at the hatch; when the hatch cover is closed he would insert the pin to prevent the hatch cover from sliding back.
The chief officer of the ship called by the defendants said that he decided to use the anchor winch method that day because of the shortage of time. The ship had been loaded with nickel ore. This was done by using the ship`s cranes with grabs. When the loading was completed the ship was about to sail as the pilot had been booked. He said that it would take some time to remove the grabs from the cranes and replace them with hooks. He therefore decided, for safety reasons, to use the anchor winch method to close the hatches first. He said that the grabs could be lowered later and changed to hooks.
In his cross-examination, the chief officer said that after the accident, the anchor winch method was discarded. He agreed that the crane method was a far safer method and that it was the method recommended by the ship builders. He confirmed that the accident happened because the winchman continued heaving when the hatch cover was completely closed, and that this had caused great stress on the steel hawser. He agreed that the safety of this method depended on the signalmen and the winchman being alert and there being good co-ordination between them.
On these facts the learned judge found that (1) the proper method of closing and opening the hatch covers was the crane method; (2) the defendants in using the anchor winch method had failed to provide a safe system of work; (3) the winchman was negligent; and (4) the accident was caused solely by the negligence of the defendants.
At the hearing of the appeal, on liability, Mr Murphy for the defendants submitted that although the defendants were negligent in failing to provide a safe system of work, the learned judge ought to have found contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. The evidence counsel relied upon was that when the plaintiff put his right leg across the steel hawser, he put himself in a position of danger, in that he did not know at that time whether the winchman had stopped the engine of the winch. Had the winch stopped pulling, the steel hawser would have slackened, and this would have indicated to the plaintiff that it was safe for him to move across the hawser. The submission was that the plaintiff should have waited for the hawser to slacken. He ought to have known that he should not cross hawser under tension.
Mr Abdullah for the plaintiff answered that the learned judge had considered the question of contributory negligence and had found that there was none. He said that at the trial contributory negligence was fully argued because in his closing submission Mr Murphy had conceded negligence on the part of the defendants and had argued that the plaintiff was negligent to the extent of 30%.
A perusal of the record of appeal shows that the real issue at the trial was whether or not there was contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. There are the findings of the learned judge that the winchman was negligent and that the accident was caused solely by the negligence of the defendants. It must follow that the learned judge had found no contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff.
On the facts, it was common ground that the anchor winchman could not see what was happening at the hatch. For closing the hatch that day he relied on the signalmen. The signalman nearest to the plaintiff at hatch No 3 was a crew member called Philip. When the hatch was closed the plaintiff saw Philip give the signal to stop. Philip had given the signal to another signalman who signalled the winchman. That other signalman then gave a signal back to Philip. It was after that that Philip gave the signal to the plaintiff to go and secure the hatch. The plaintiff did not respond immediately to the signal. He said that he waited for a few seconds before he jumped across the steel hawser.
When the plaintiff went over the steel hawser it had stopped moving. It is true that the hawser was under tension. On his aspect of the matter, the reliable evidence was that the hawser had to be under tension for the plaintiff to put the pin into the hatch cover. If the steel hawser was not taut the hatch cover would slip backwards and get out of alignment. The plaintiff would then find it difficult to insert the pin.
The foregoing facts, in our view, sufficiently show that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. We agree with learned judge that the defendants were wholly to blame for the accident. They had failed to provide a safe system of work.
We turn now to the quantum of damages awarded to the plaintiff. First, as a result of the accident, the plaintiff had a traumatic amputation of the right thigh at the level of 1/3 inferior and 1/3 medium. For pain and suffering and loss of amenities, the plaintiff was awarded $42,000 as general damages. The argument for the defendants was that this sum was too high a figure as there was a separate award for loss of future earnings.
We do not agree with Mr Murphy that the learned judge took the figure of $42,000 from cases where general damages were awarded inclusive of loss of future earnings. He had in fact rejected the argument put by Mr Murphy that the general damages in this case should be between $40,000 and $42,000 including the loss of future earnings. The learned Judge specifically said that the general damages of $42,000 was for `the amputation of the right leg`. Though he did not cite any authority for the award, it appears in the record of appeal that he was referred to two cases, 
 Lee Yew Hoe v Lee Bock Huat 
 
 
 [1980-1981] SLR 372 
 and 
 RJ McGuinness v Ahmad Zaini 
 
 
 
[1980] 2 MLJ 304
 . In the first case TS Sinnathuray J gave a young man aged 17 years employed as a bakery assistant who had an above knee amputation of his right leg $40,000 for pain and suffering and loss of amenities. In the second case Roberts CJ in Brunei gave an expatriate oil driller aged 34 who had an above knee amputation of his right leg $50,000 for pain and suffering and loss of amenities. In both cases the plaintiff obtained separate damages for loss for future earnings.
In our opinion, when damages for negligence are assessed under separate head, and as the matters considered under the head of general damages, for pain and suffering and loss of amenities are wholly different from those considered under the head of loss of future earnings, there ought not to be an overlapping in these two awards. In this appeal we are of the view that the award of $42,000 as general damages is not out of line with other awards in similar cases; nor can be award be said to be excessive.
Secondly, for loss of earnings from the date of accident to the date of trial, the learned judge gave the plaintiff special damages of $6,000. He had calculated the loss of earnings at $1,000 per month for six months. Somehow counsel for the defendants had misunderstood the calculation because his submission was that it was realistic to take a loss of ten months but it was too high a figure to calculate loss at $600 per month. On the other hand, in the cross-appeal, counsel for the plaintiff contended that for the 62 months between the date of accident and the date of trial at $1,000 per month, the award for loss of earnings should be $62,000 and not $6,000.
In dealing with this question the learned judge held that even if the plaintiff had not met with the accident, it was very doubtful that he would have been employed as a seaman throughout the period of 62 months. The shipping business was in a depressed state and a lot of able-bodied seamen were out of work. There was evidence that the bosun who was on the ship at the time of the accident was out of work for more than a year. In arriving at the amount of $6,000 calculated on the basis of $1,000 per month for six months, the learned judge must have concluded that the plaintiff would not have found work for some time during the period of 62 months. On that basis the learned judge had discounted a period for 56 months for that contingency. We agree with him that in assessing special damages for loss of earnings in this case that provision be made for such a contingency; however, it seems to us that a period of 56 months that had been allowed by him is far too long. It is reasonable, we think, to find that the plaintiff would have been unemployed as a seaman for a longer period than the bosun who, as already noted, was unemployed for 12 months. In our view, a fair period to allow for the plaintiff would be 24 months. Accordingly, we assess special damages for loss of earnings at $38,000 calculated on the basis of $1,000 per month for 38 months.
Thirdly, the learned judge awarded $84,000 for loss of future earnings. To arrive at this figure, he used a set of tables, referred to by those who use them as `the annuity tables`. The computation used was $600 per month for 18 years purchase. For the defendants it was contended that this sum was excessive; for the plaintiff that it was inadequate.
Now, as regards this head of loss of future earnings, at the hearing of the appeal, we were given a copy of a telex of the decision of the Privy Council in 
 Lai Wee Lian v Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd 
 
 
 [1982-1983] SLR 93 
 which has since been published. We have, of course, read the judgment closely. In this case their Lordships examined the methods used for calculating loss of future earnings and observed that `if confusion is to be avoided, it seems desirable that a uniform practice should be followed by all courts in the same area`. We agree.
In the present appeal, at the time of the accident, the plaintiff was earning $1,200 to $1,300 a month and had a very good prospect of improving his salary. He could also work as a seaman to the age of 60. The question is what is the proper multiplicand and multiplier to use in this case. The learned judge used $600 per month as his multiplicand. It is true, as Mr Abdullah said, that in computing special damages for loss of earnings, the learned judge used the income of the plaintiff at $1,000 per month. At that time, the plaintiff was unemployed. But, as regards the future, the plaintiff must mitigate his loss. Also, it is to be noted, there is no evidence that the plaintiff will not be employed. With full employment in Singapore, there is no reason why the plaintiff should not find a job on land to earn $600 per month. He can, if he wants to, undergo training for another vocation and even earn a better salary. Thus, we are of the view that it is not wrong to use a multiplicand of $600 per month.
As for the multiplier, the plaintiff was about 35 years at the date of the trial. Even if he were to retire at 55 years, he has 20 years of working life. However, in choosing the appropriate multiplier, we have to discount for `contingencies and advance payment`. In 
 Lai Wee Lian 
 `s case the Privy Council considered 15 years as the appropriate multiplier for the appellant who had 28 years before she reached the age of 55. In the present appeal, we think that 14 years would be suitable multiplier. This would be consistent with the period taken in 
 Low Kok Tong v Teo Chan Pan 
 
 [1982-1983] SLR 346 
 and the 
 McGuinnes 
 case. So, we apply the multiplier 14 to the multiplicand of $600 to arrive at the sum of $100,800.
Finally, the defendants appealed on the award of $10,000 for the costs of the future renewal of the artificial leg. Objections were raised that it was not claimed in the statement of claim, that there was no evidence that the artificial leg would have to be changed periodically and as to the costs for replacement and repairs. The short answer is that there is the averment in the statement of claim that by reason of the negligence of the defendants the plaintiff claims damages. Under this general claim counsel for the plaintiff was entitled, which he did at the close of the case in his submission on damages, to make a claim for such costs. As for quantum, he relied on the 
 McGuinness 
 case. Roberts CJ in that case gave the plaintiff a reasonable sum for the cost of replacement of his artificial limb in future years and for necessary repairs to it from time to time. In that case the plaintiff did produce two letter from the Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Veterans` Affairs, Brisbane, Australia which referred to replacement, repairs, and the cost thereof. The learned Chief Justice however increased the sum to make allowance for stump socks and other expenses such as travel and subsistence, involved in visits for repairs. He awarded B$18,144.
We are of the opinion that a judge can take judicial notice that an artificial leg would have to be repaired and replaced from time to time. As for the quantum, the learned Judge was guided by the decision in Brunei. He came to the conclusion that a reasonable sum for the costs of future renewal was $10,000. We agree with him.
For the reasons we have given, the appeal of the defendants is dismissed. The cross-appeal is allowed. We increase the special damages for loss of earnings to $38,000 and the future loss of earnings to $100,800. There will be costs to the plaintiff on the appeal and cross-appeal.

On 21 September 1981 the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), a registered political party in Singapore, held its inauguration at the Singapore Conference Hall auditorium starting at 6.30pm. To this inauguration was invited the plaintiff who was at that time and still is, the secretary-general of the Workers` Party (WP), another registered political party in Singapore. At the time when the plaintiff was invited he intimated to Chiam See Tong, secretary-general of the SDP, that he (the plaintiff) had a dinner engagement on the same evening as the inauguration and would therefore have to leave after his speech, and this was acceptable to the SDP.
The plaintiff and the chairman of the WP, Wong Hong Toy, attended the SDP`s inauguration, and as a guest speaker the plaintiff took his seat at the rostrum in the company of the leaders of the SDP, whilst his chairman sat with the audience. The plaintiff was the first main speaker after words of welcome from the leaders of the SDP, adoption of the SDP`s constitution and the swearing-in ceremony of the office bearers of the SDP. The plaintiff was the only guest speaker and was the most popular man that evening; he received rounds of applause even before he spoke and he made a fairly long speech. After his speech he left the meeting and at that time or immediately following his departure a large section of the audience also left. In fact, from that time onwards, people began to trickle out of the hall, presumably because the meeting was quite prolonged; it did not really conclude until 10.30pm or thereabout.
On the following day the popularity of the plaintiff at the SDP`s inauguration was reported in the 
 Business Times 
as follows: 
 
If applause were considered a good measure of popular support, Mr JB Jeyaretnam, secretary-general of the Workers` Party, was definitely the most popular person at the Conference Hall last night.
 
 
 
Ironically, the occasion was the inauguration of the Singapore Democratic Party. Mr Jeyaratnam, the guest speaker received four rounds of loud hand claps - before he uttered his first words - as he was introduced.
Several of the some 300-strong audience even walked out after his speech ...
On 14 October 1981 a writ was issued for a Parliamentary by-election for the constituency of Anson, and the nomination day for candidates for the by-election was fixed for 21 October 1981 and the by-election was to be held on 31 October 1981. On 20 October 1981, on the eve of the nomination day, the following report appeared in the then afternoon newspaper, 
 New Nation 
under the heading, `Chiam, Jeya keep mum`: 
 
Today is the eve of Nomination Day for the Anson by-election but the Workers` Party and the Singapore Democratic Party are still keeping mum.
 
 
 
Mr JB Jeyaretnam, secretary-general of the Workers` Party, said party members will meet today but declined to elaborate.
Mr Chiam See Tong, secretary-general of SDP, said last week that his party chairman, Mr Fok Tai Loy, is a likely candidate for the by-elections. But this morning, he would not confirm this. However, he maintained that the party will be contesting.
The United People`s Front secretary-general, Mr Harbans Singh, has said that he will be contesting.
The PAP has named Mr Pang Kim Hin as its candidate for the by-election on 31 October.
On the nomination day, the People`s Action Party (PAP) nominated Pang Kim Hin, as their candidate and the WP nominated the plaintiff as their candidate for the by-election. The SDP on seeing that the plaintiff was nominated did not field a candidate to contest the by-election.
The defendant is the Minister for Defence and Second Minister for Health in the government. He was appointed the first organising secretary of the PAP on 17 April 1979 and has continued to hold that post. As such he was responsible for, inter alia
 , 
 the party`s election activities. He was therefore most concerned at securing the return of the PAP`s candidate at the by-election. On 26 October 1981 he held a press conference at Blair Plain at which representatives of the media, such as the press and Singapore Broadcasting Corp, were present. At that conference the defendant spoke, among other things, the following words: 
 
SDP had their inaugural 
 (sic)
earlier this month. Mr Jeyaretnam attended. After Mr Jeyaretnam had spoken, he left the hall, and when he left the hall 200 participants left with him. I believe the exodus was engineered. I don`t think it was a spontaneous exodus. If it was, it did not speak well for the SDP. It shows that the crowd, the limited crowd still look towards Mr Jeyaretnam, for the time being, as a leader of the opposition. But I am inclined to believe that the exodus was contrived by the leader of the Workers Party to show who is boss at this stage. And surely Mr Chiam cannot take that trick lightly.
 
 
 
These are the words complained of by the plaintiff as defamatory of him and the present proceedings were initiated by the plaintiff against the Defendant claiming damages and injunction. The plaintiff claims that the words complained of in their natural and ordinary meaning were defamatory of him: they meant and were understood to mean that the `plaintiff was an opportunist, a man of base and dishonourable motives, seeking only to promote himself, to gain power for himself, and had shown by his conduct that he was not genuinely sincere in building up a credible and constructive opposition in Parliament but out solely to seek his own glory and was accordingly unfit to hold the office of a Member of Parliament. He further claims that the words were calculated to injure him in his office as leader of a political party and in aspiring to be a Member of Parliament. By this further plea the plaintiff is in effect invoking s 5 of the Defamation Act (Cap 32), to which I shall revert later. The defendant denies that the said words in their natural and ordinary meaning were defamatory of the plaintiff as alleged or at all and that they were calculated to disparage the plaintiff in his office as the secretary-general of the WP. The defendant further raises two other defences, namely: first, the said words were fair comment spoken without malice upon a matter of public interest, namely, the conduct of leaders of the opposition parties, including the plaintiff, and the conduct of members of the public prior to the Parliamentary by-election, and secondly, the occasion in which the said words were uttered was one of qualified privilege. The plaintiff joins issue with the Defendant on the latter`s defences and alleges that the defendant was actuated by malice when he said those words. There are therefore five issues before me:
 
 
(i) whether the words in their natural and ordinary meaning were defamatory of the plaintiff; 
 
(ii) if they were, whether they were calculated to disparage him in his office as the secretary-general of the WP and hence are actionable without proof of special damage under s 5 of the Defamation Act (Cap 32); 
 
(iii) whether the words complained of were fair comment on a matter of public interest; 
 
(iv) whether the occasion in which the words were spoken was one of qualified privilege, and 
 
(v) whether the defendant was actuated by any malice in uttering the words complained of.
  
 
 
The first issue is one purely of construction of the words complained of, and the approach to such a construction is to consider the meaning such words would convey to ordinary reasonable persons using their general knowledge and common sense; it is not confined to strict literal meaning of the words but extend to any reference or implication from which persons can reasonably draw. As said by Lord Morris in 
 Jones v 
 
 Skelton 
[1963] 3 All ER 952 at p 958: 
 
The ordinary and natural meaning of words may be either the literal meaning or it may be an implied or inferred or an indirect meaning: any meaning that does not require the support of extrinsic facts passing beyond general knowledge but is a meaning which is capable of being detected in the language used can be a part of the ordinary and natural meaning of words (see 
 Lewis v
 
 Daily Telegraph Ltd
[1963] 2 All ER 151). The ordinary and natural meaning may therefore include any implication or inference which a reasonable reader, guided not by any special but only by general knowledge and not fettered by any strict legal rules of construction, would draw from the words. The test of reasonableness guides and directs the court in its function of deciding whether it is open to a jury in any particular case to hold that reasonable persons would understand the words complained of in a defamatory sense.
 
 
 
Together with the ascertainment of the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of to be considered is the question whether they were defamatory of the plaintiff. The test here is whether the words were calculated to expose him to hatred, ridicule or contempt in the mind of a reasonable man or would `tend to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally` (perLord Atkin in 
 Sim v 
 
 Stretch 
) [1936] 2 All ER 1237.
The crucial point in this issue is this: did the words complained of in their natural and ordinary meaning impute to the plaintiff any dishonourable or discreditable conduct or motives or a lack of integrity on his part? If they did, then inescapably they were defamatory of the plaintiff. It seems to me that in considering this issue one must bear in mind the following salient facts. First, the event to which the words made reference was the inauguration of the SDP - undoubtedly a great and important event to the SDP. Secondly, at the inauguration the plaintiff in his position as the secretary-general of the WP was accorded an unusually high honour in being invited to speak. He was the only guest speaker and the first main speaker taking precedence over the speeches of all the leaders of the SDP. From the reports and according to representatives of the press media, who were present at the meeting, the plaintiff was the most popular man that evening receiving rounds and rounds of applause even before he spoke and during his speech. Lastly, though much has been sought to be made out by the defendant and his counsel that the WP and SDP were rival political parties, which was not borne out by evidence, at the material time at any rate the relations between the two political parties were friendly. In those circumstances the words, in my opinion, were capable of a defamatory meaning and were defamatory of the plaintiff. The sting lay in the suggestion or implication that the plaintiff took advantage of a gesture of goodwill from the SDP - a party with which the WP had good relations - on the occasion of the SDP`s inauguration for a purely selfish and self-serving purpose and engineered or contrived an exodus of a large section of the audience at the inauguration so as to project himself as the `boss` and leader of the opposition parties to the party in power. The words imputed to the plaintiff dishonourable or discreditable conduct or motive or a lack of integrity and such an i mputation in my opinion was defamatory of the plaintiff.
Mr Grimberg on behalf of the defendant argued, first, that the words complained of must be looked at in the whole context in which they were spoken: `the bane and antidote must be taken together` (
 per 
 Alderson B in 
 Chalmers v 
 
 Payne 
 150 ER 67 at p 68). Secondly, these words were spoken of the plaintiff as a politician at a campaign for a Parliamentary by-election and were part of an attempt by the defendant to analyse the manoeuvring of the two political parties in opposition, namely, the WP and the SDP. Viewed in that context and in those circumstances the words, he said, could not be defamatory. I agree that the words must be considered in the context of the whole speech made by the defendant and in those circumstances. But I do not agree that considered in the context and in those circumstances they were not defamatory of the plaintiff. Indeed, there is nothing in the contextual material of the defendant`s speech or the circumstances in which the words were spoken which could eliminate or ameliorate the asperities of the sting. Mr Grimberg next argued that the tolerance level of right-thinking persons at election time rose and a remark which might be defamatory passed `as a common coin at election time,` and further that the words were spoken to representatives of the press media and their esteem of a politician would not be likely to be reduced `by a purely political dig` at election time. In my view, neither of these arguments is sufficiently cogent. First, the meaning of the words in which they were understood by the listeners is irrelevant for the purpose of deciding the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. Secondly, the words which by their natural and ordinary meaning are defamatory of a person remain as such even if they do not really lower him in the estimation of those to whom the words were uttered.
Mr Grimberg in the course of his lengthy submission on this point postulated an example of similar words spoken of an academic, who addressed a large symposium and left immediately thereafter followed by an exodus of a substantial part of the audience, and conceded that in such circumstances such words might be defamatory of the speaker. I have no doubt at all that in such circumstances the words if said of such a speaker would be defamatory of him. In this case I have no doubt also that the words complained of were defamatory of the plaintiff, notwithstanding that they were said of the plaintiff as a politician and in the circumstances as suggested by Mr Grimberg.
I now turn to the next issue whether the words though defamatory of the plaintiff are actionable. This is an action for slander and the plaintiff has not averred or proved any special damage suffered by him. He can only succeed if he can show that the defamatory words fall within s 5 of the Defamation Act (Cap 32), which provides as follows: 
 
5 In an action for slander in respect of words calculated to disparage the plaintiff in any office, profession, calling, trade or business held or carried on by him at the time of publication, it shall not be necessary to allege or prove special damage whether or not the words are spoken of the plaintiff in the way of his office, profession, calling, trade or business.
 
 
 
The only office which is relevant to this issue is the office of secretary-general of the WP which the plaintiff held at the time the defamatory words were spoken and which he still holds. The office is one of honour and not an office of profit; a fact admitted without reserve by the plaintiff. The question therefore is whether the words complained of were calculated to disparage the plaintiff in that office and the answer turns on what in law is meant by the words `calculated to disparage` a person in his office, and such words as laid down by decided cases have certain signification in relation to an office of honour, as distinguished from an office of profit.
Section 5 of our Defamation Act is in pari materia with s 2 of the Defamation Act 1952 of England. At common law prior to the passing of the Act of 1952 in order to maintain an action for slander by words spoken of a person concerning his office, where such office was one of honour and not of profit and where no special damage was proved, two requirements must be fulfilled:
 
 
(i) the words must impute to that person want of integrity or corrupt or dishonest conduct or other misconduct in the discharge of his office, and 
 
(ii) they must be said in the way of that office.
  
 
 
Since the passing of the Act it is no longer necessary to satisfy the second requirement but the first requirement remains. In other words, in order to be actionable per sewithout proof of special damage, the slanderous words which are said to be calculated to disparage a person in his office, where such office is one of honour, must impute some want of integrity or corrupt or dishonest conduct or other misconduct in the discharge of that office. In the case of 
 Robinson v Ward 
(1958) 108 LJ 491, in an action for slander, where the plaintiff had alleged that the defendant used words which meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff was not a fit and proper person to be a perceptor of a masonic lodge, Diplock J (as he then was) held that in an action for slander for words alleged to have been spoken of a plaintiff touching his office, where such office was one of honour and not of profit and no special damage was proved, it was necessary in order to show that the words were calculated to disparage the plaintiff in his office within s 2 of the Defamation Act 1952 to establish, in accordance with decisions prior to that Act, that the words imputed to the plaintiff some want of integrity or corrupt or dishonest conduct in the discharge of his office. That decision has stood the test of time for more than 25 years and has been quoted with acceptance by learned text book writers to be correct: see 28 
 Halsbury`s 
 Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) para 55 and 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (8th Ed) para 174. I respectfully agree with the view of the law as laid down in 
 Robinson v 
 
 Ward. 
In my judgment the words though defamatory of the plaintiff were not calculated to disparage him in his office as the secretary-general of the WP. They did not impute any want of integrity or corrupt or dishonest conduct or any other misconduct in the discharge of that office. On this issue the plaintiff fails.
My decision on the second issue is sufficient to dispose of this action. However, in view of the matters pleaded and the arguments addressed by both the Plaintiff and Mr Grimberg, I feel I should decide also the remaining three issues.
On the third issue, there are four elements which the defendant must establish in order to succeed on his plea of fair comment:
 
 
(i) the words complained of are comment, though it may consist of or include inference of facts; 
 
(ii) the comment is on a matter of public interest; 
 
(iii) the comment is based on facts, and 
 
(iv) the comment is one which a fair-minded person can honestly make on the facts proved.
  
 
 
On the first element it is useful to set out in greater detail the relevant passage of the defendant`s speech from which the words complained of were extracted. He said: 
 
I believe, reading the press reports, that SDP told the press that he was going in to contest the Anson by-election, but as it turned out, he never did. A party that purports to be serious-minded must not mislead members of the press and the public. It is not a tactical measure to fool the PAP. The PAP has announced its candidate. Then who is the SDP trying to pull the wool over the eyes? Not the PAP. I think there is a game going on between the SDP and the Workers Party - who is the leader of the opposition or whd WW be the leader of the opposition parties in the years to come. SDP had their inaugural earlier this month. Mr Jeyaretnam attended. After Mr Jeyaretnam had spoken, he left the hall, and when he left the hall 200 participants left with him. I believe the exodus was engineered. I don`t think it was a spontaneous exodus. If it was, it did not speak well for the SDP. It shows that the crowd, the limited crowd still look towards Mr Jeyaretnam, for the time being, as a leader of the opposition. But I am inclined to believe that the exodus was contrived by the leader of the Workers Party to show who is boss at this stage. And surely Mr Chiam cannot take that trick lightly.
 
 
 
Looking at the passage as a whole it seems to me clear that the defendant at that time first addressed himself to certain facts, which he gathered from the press or of which he was informed by DW 2, namely:
 
 
(a) the vacillating attitude of the SDP as regards contesting the by-election; 
 
(b) the inauguration of the SDP at which the plaintiff spoke as a guest speaker; 
 
(c) the departure of the plaintiff immediately after his speech, and 
 
(d) the exodus of a large section of the audience, about 200 persons, at about the same time of the plaintiff`s departure or immediately thereafter.
  
 
 
The defendant then drew his own inference from these facts that the exodus was engineered or contrived by the plaintiff to show who was the `boss` at that stage. It is this inference which is the thrust of the complaint of the plaintiff. To my mind this was a comment and not a bare or naked statement of facts. It contained the defendant`s belief or his conclusion based on or drawn from certain facts.
On the second element, I do not think that there can be any doubt that the subject matter of the comment was one of public interest. The comment was made on an event that took place at the inauguration of the SDP and the conduct or behaviour of a candidate for a Parliamentary by-election. Such matters are clearly of public interest, and I do not think that this point merits any further discussion.
The third and the fourth elements should be considered together. At this stage I would like to dispose of a point raised by the plaintiff. In his written submission the plaintiff drew my attention to the discrepancy between what the defendant said at the press conference and what he pleaded in his defence. At the press conference the defendant, antecedent to his uttering the defamatory words, mentioned or made reference to only the following facts:
 
 
(a) that the SDP had an inauguration; 
 
(b) that the plaintiff attended and spoke; 
 
(c) that after the plaintiff had spoken, he left, and 
 
(d) that some 200 participants left with him.
  
 
 
In his defence, however, the defendant set out a number of other facts in support of his plea of fair comment. It is not clear to me precisely what the plaintiff sought to make out by picking on this discrepancy. The plaintiff then dealt with only those facts mentioned by the defendant at the press conference and sought to demonstrate that the facts were not correctly stated by the Defendant and therefore maintained that the defence of fair comment was not available. The plaintiff, however, ignored all other facts pleaded by the defendant as the basis on which the plea of fair comment is founded. On this line of argument I have two observations. First, to sustain a defence of fair comment it is not necessary that all the facts, which form the basis of the comment, should be referred to in the defamatory words; what is required is a sufficient substratum of facts referred to or implied from the defamatory words. Lord Oaksey in 
 Kemsley v Foot 
[1952] AC 345
, 358, 360-361 put the matter as follows: 
 
The forms in which a comment on a matter of public importance may be framed are almost inflately various and in my opinion, it is unnecessary that all the facts on which the comment is based should be stated in the libel in order to admit the defence of fair comment. It is not, in my opinion, a matter of importance that the reader should be able to see exactly the grounds of the comment. It is sufficient if the subject which 
 ex hypothesi
 is of public importance is sufficiently and not incorrectly or untruthfully stated.
 
 
 
Secondly, for a defence of fair comment to succeed it is not necessary to prove each of the facts pleaded in support; all that is needed is to prove such of the facts as are sufficient to form the basis of a fair comment. Lord Porter in 
 Kemsley v 
 
 Foot 
said, at p 358: 
 
In the present case, for instance, the substratum of fact upon which comment is based is that Lord Kemsley is the active proprietor of and responsible for the Kemsley Press. The criticism is that that press is a low one. As I hold, any facts sufficient to justify that statement would entitle the defendants to succeed in a plea of fair comment. Twenty facts might be given in the particulars and only one justified, yet if that one fact were sufficient to support the comment so as to make it fair, a failure to prove the other nineteen would not of necessity defeat the defendants` plea. The protection of the plaintiff in such a case would, in my opinion, be, as it often is in cases of the like kind, the effect which an allegation of a number of facts which cannot be substantiated would have upon the minds of a jury who would be unlikely to believe that the comment was made upon the one fact or was honestly founded upon it and accordingly would find it unfair.
 
 
 
I now turn to examine what facts have been proved by the defendant in support of his plea of fair comment. On the evidence the defendant has proved the following facts:
 
 
(a) The inauguration of the SDP was held on 21 September 1981 at the Singapore Conference Hall auditorium. 
 
(b) The plaintiff was invited as the secretary-general of the WP to speak at the inauguration and he was the only guest speaker and was the first speaker after the leaders of the SDP had delivered words of welcome and the office bearers had been sworn in. 
 
(c) There were about 300 participants at the inauguration. 
 
(d) The plaintiff was the most popular man that evening at the auditorium, receiving rounds of applause even before he spoke, and this was reported in the issue of the 
 Business Times 
on 22 September 1980. 
 
(e) He spoke at great length and was also applauded while he was speaking, and immediately after his speech he picked up his papers and left the hall: see evidence of DW 3. 
 
(f) His departure was unexplained. 
 
(g) At that time or immediately thereafter there was a large section of the audience - some 200 people - who also left the meeting. At the end of the meeting there were about 100 people remaining in the hall. 
 
(h) On 14 October 1981 a writ was issued for the Anson by-election. 
 
(i) As from that day to the nomination day there was no indication to the public of any electoral alliance between the WP and SDP. 
 
(j) On 20 October 1981 a report appeared in the then 
 New Nation 
that both Chiam See Tong and the plaintiff were keeping `mum` and that one week before Chiam had said that his party chairman, Fok Tai Loy, would be a likely candidate but Chiam refused to confirm. 
 
(k) On 22 October 1981 it was reported in 
 The Straits Times 
that when Chiam See Tong arrived at the nomination centre on the polling day, he said: `Yes, we are going in`; that subsequently Chiam See Tong, Fok Tai Loy and the plaintiff `were seen huddled together inside the hall`, and that the chairman of the SDP was reported to have said that the `two parties did not really come to terms over the candidacy for Anson until they met inside the hall`. 
 
(l) It was also reported in the said issue of 
 The Straits Times 
 that after the close of nomination Chiam read a statement stating, among other things, that the SDP on learning that the plaintiff was contesting the by-election had graciously withdrawn their candidate, thus implying that if another person had been nominated by the WP, the SDP would field their candidate for the by-election.
  
 
 
The next question is whether on all these facts a fair-minded person could honestly have come to the conclusion as the defendant did: that the exodus of 200 participants at the SDP`s inauguration was engineered or contrived by the plaintiff to show that he was the `boss` at that stage, and there was no unity between the WP and the SDP. The test is an objective one. In 
 Merivale v 
 
 Carson 
(1888) LR 20 QBD 275, 280, 281. Lord Esher, MR said, at pp 280-281: 
 
What is the meaning of a `fair comment`? I think the meaning is this: is the article in the opinion of the jury beyond that which any fair man, however prejudiced or however strong his opinion may be, would say of the work in question? Every latitude must be given to opinion and to prejudice, and then an ordinary set of men with ordinary judgment must say whether any fair man would have made such a comment on the work. It is very easy to say what would be clearly beyond that limit; if, for instance, the writer attacked the private character of the author. But it is much more difficult to say what is within the limit. That must depend upon the circumstances of the particular case. I think the right question was really left by Field J to the jury in the present case. No doubt you can find in the course of his summing-up some phrases which, if taken alone, may seem to limit too much the question put to the jury. But, when you look at the summing-up as a whole, I think it comes in substance to the final question which was put by the judge to the jury: `If it is no more than fair, honest, independent, bold, even exaggerated, criticism, then your verdict will be for the defendants.` He gives a very wide limit, and, I think, rightly. Mere exaggeration, or even gross exaggeration, would not make the comment unfair. However wrong the opinion expressed may be in point of truth, or however prejudiced the writer, it may still be within that prescribed limit. The question which the jury must consider is this - would any fair man, however prejudiced he may be, however exaggerated or obstinate his views, have said that which this criticism has said of the work which is criticised? If it goes beyond that, then you must find for the plaintiff; If you are not satisfied that it does, then it falls within the allowed limit, and there is no libel at all.
 
 
 
To the same effect were words said by Diplock J (as he then was) in his direction to the jury, in 
 Silkin v 
 
 Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd 
[1958] 2 All ER 516, 520: 
 
The matter which you have got to decide, and I emphasise this again, because it is so important, is not whether you any of you, agree with that comment. You may all of you disagree with it, feel that it is comment that is not correct; but that is not the test. I will remind you of the test once more. Could a fair-minded man, holding a strong view, holding perhaps an obstinate view, holding perhaps a prejudiced view - could a fair-minded man have been capable of writing this? That is a totally different question from the question: Do you agree with what he said?
 
 
 
So in considering this case, members of the jury, do not apply the test of whether you agree with it. If juries did that, freedom of speech, the right of the crank to say what he likes, would go. Would a fair-minded man holding strong view, obstinate views, prejudiced views, have been capable of making this comment? If the answer to that is yes, then your verdict in this case should be a verdict for the defendants. Such a verdict does not mean that you agree with the comment. All it means is that you think that a man might honestly hold those views on those facts. But it is for you, the jury, not for me, the judge, to answer that question, and the answers which juries have given in cases of this kind to that question have formed the law which lies at the basis of freedom of speech in this country.
Applying the objective test as laid down in the pronouncements I have just quoted at great length and on the basis of those facts as proved before me, in my judgment a fair-minded person could at that time have honestly arrived at the conclusion as the defendant did. It is significant that the defendant in arriving at this conclusion did consider the alternative conclusion, iethat the exodus from the SDP`s inauguration was spontaneous but in such a case it did not reflect too well on the SDP, and he ruled out this alternative. Now the conclusion which the defendant arrived at may not be impartial; obviously it cannot be so. That conclusion may be biased, may be prejudiced, may be grossly exaggerated or may even be wrong; it may be a conclusion I cannot and do not agree. But it is one which falls within the allowed limit of fair comment: it is a conclusion which a fair-minded person on the basis of those facts could have honestly arrived at. In my judgment the defendant has succeeded in establishing the four elements necessary to found his defence of fair comment.
I now turn to the fourth issue: whether the words complained of were uttered on an occasion of qualified privilege. Mr Grimberg referred to the categories of qualified privilege as set out in para 14.01 of 
 Duncan & Neil 
 (2nd Ed) on p 92 and feebly argued that the defendant`s statement fell within category (a) thereof, ie statement made in pursuance of a legal, social or moral duty to a person who has a corresponding duty or interest to receive them, and cited 
 Stuart v 
 
 Bell 
 
[1891] 2 QB 341
 in support. He sought to found the defence of qualified privilege on the fact that at the material time there was a by-election and that the defendant as a politician had a social duty to inform representatives of the media his assessment of the political opponents and that such representatives had a corresponding duty or interest to receive it. Such an argument I am unable to accept; it is really stretching the limits of the occasion of qualified privilege and extravagantly attributing to the defendant a social duty to make the statement complained of and to the representatives of the media a corresponding duty or interest to receive it. Assuming that the defendant, being at the material time `the principal PAP strategist for the Anson by-election` (as Mr Grimberg very attractively put it), had a social duty to make that statement to the representatives of the media, it is difficult to see how the latter had a corresponding duty or interest to receive it. Clearly they do not have: see 
 Hebditch v 
 
 MacIlwaine 
 
[1894] 2 QB 54
. In that case the plaintiff was elected to the office of the guardian of the poor for a certain parish. The defendants who were rate-payers and entitled to vote at the election sent to the board of guardians a letter containing defamatory words of the plaintiff. Lord Esher MR said, at p 59: 
 
Such being the facts of the case, what was the judge called upon to consider in dealing with the question whether the occasion was privileged? He had first to consider whether the defendants, who published the defamatory matter, had any interest or duty in connection with the subject which they thus brought before the board of guardians. I am not prepared to say that they had not an interest or duty. On the contrary, I am inclined to think that they had an interest in the matter. They were electors, and had an interest in having the office filled by a person properly elected. Then the position of the board of guardians, to whom the defamatory matter was published, had to be considered. They had no interest in the matter, as it seems to me, and, as I have already said, they had no duty or power to take any action upon the communication made to them. Under these circumstances I think it clear that the occasion was not privileged.
 
 
 
I therefore reject the defence of qualified privilege raised by the defendant.
I now turn to the last issue: whether in uttering the words complained of the Defendant was at that time actuated by malice. Malice means any ill-will, spite or improper motive. The burden of proving malice rests with the plaintiff. The plaintiff here is relying on the following:
 
 
(a) The words were uttered by the defendant more than a month after the event which took place. 
 
(b) The defendant was directing or actively assisting in the campaign to secure the election of the PAP`s candidate in a by-election and was keenly interested in the result of the election. 
 
(c) The words uttered were a deliberate attack on the personal character and integrity of the plaintiff. 
 
(d) The defendant published the words knowing them to be untrue and/or recklessly not caring whether they are true or false or without any honest belief.
  
 
 
It will be convenient to deal with the allegations in sub-paras (a) and (b) together. It is true that the defendant uttered the words complained of about one month after the event. But that by itself is not evidence of malice; nor does it give rise to any inference of malice on the part of the defendant. There was a by-election and as organizing secretary the defendant was very much concerned at securing the election of the PAP`s candidate. As part of PAP`s campaign he called for a press conference at which he sought to analyse and assess his political opponents and show that there was no real unity between the WP and the SDP. Hence he referred to the unusual event at the SDP`s inauguration, the vacillating attitude of the SDP, the agreement reached between the SDP and WP at the eleventh hour just before close of the nomination at the nomination centre and proceeded to draw his inferences. It is true that the defendant wanted the PAP`s candidate to win the by-election and, of course, he was keenly interested in the results of the by-election. True also it is, that all the words and statements made at the press conference were directed towards demolishing the plaintiff as a political candidate and diminishing his chances of success at the by-election. There is nothing improper about that (apart from uttering the defamatory words on which I have decided) and such an exercise does not give rise to any inference of malice on the part of the defendant. As for the allegation in sub-para (c) relied upon by the plaintiff, there is no evidence, nor can it be inferred, that the defendant was making a personal attack on the plaintiff. On the contrary, he took pains to clarify this at the conference when he said: 
 
I want to make clear that any statements of mine this afternoon about the opposition parties and about their leaders are not about them as individuals but about them as politicians. In other words, I do not cast any aspersions on them as individuals. I only challenge their credentials as politicians, as people who aspire to be MPs.
 
 
 
With regard to the last allegation in sub-para (d) that the defendant uttered the words knowing them to be untrue or recklessly not caring whether they are true or false, I find there is no basis for such an allegation. As I said before, there were facts on which the defendant could honestly make his comment.
The defendant was subject to a prolonged cross-examination in which he gave his evidence with candour. Nothing has emerged therefrom or elicited from him which cast any doubt or suspicion on the bona fides of his belief that the conclusion he came to was true. I find no ground for disbelieving him that the belief he entertained was a genuine and honest one. In considering this issue I find most pertinent the following passage from the judgment of Lord Diplock in 
 Horrocks v 
 
 Lowe 
 
[1975] AC 135
, 150 notwithstanding that the words complained of were uttered by the defendant in the course of an analysis of his political opponents: 
 
Apart from those exceptional cases, what is required on the part of the defamer to entitle him to the protection of the privilege is positive belief in the truth of what he published or, as it is generally though tautologously termed, `honest belief`. If he publishes untrue defamatory matter recklessly, without considering or caring whether it be true or not, he is in this, as in other branches of the law, treated as if he knew it to be false. But indifference to the truth of what he publishes is not to be equated with carelessness, impulsiveness or irrationality in arriving at a positive belief that it is true. The freedom of speech protected by the law of qualified privilege may be availed of by all sorts and conditions of men. In affording to them immunity from suit if they have acted in good faith in compliance with a legal or moral duty or in protection of a legitimate interest the law must take them as it finds them. In ordinary life it is rare indeed for people to form their beliefs by a process of logical deduction from facts ascertained by a rigorous search for all available evidence and a judicious assessment of its probative value. In greater or in less degree according to their temperaments, their training, their intelligence, they are swayed by prejudice, rely on intuition instead of reasoning, leap to conclusions on inadequate evidence and fail to recognise the cogency of material which might cast doubt on the validity of the conclusions they reach. But despite the imperfection of the mental process by which the belief is arrived at it may still be `honest`, that is, a positive belief that the conclusions they have reached are true. The law demands no more.
 
 
 
Lord Diplock in that case was dealing with the question of malice affecting the defence of qualified privilege but what was said there equally applies to malice affecting the defence of fair comment. In conclusion, I find that the plaintiff has failed to discharge his burden of proving that the defendant was actuated by malice when he uttered the words complained of.
Accordingly, this action is dismissed with costs.

The first plaintiff, an infant, is bringing this action by his mother, the second plaintiff, for damages for personal injuries sustained by him as a result of a road traffic accident on West Coast Road, Singapore on 4 August 1979. At that time the plaintiffs were staying, and are still staying, at Apartment Block 512, West Coast Drive. On that day, at about 12.00 o`clock noon the first plaintiff, then nine years old, was asked by the second plaintiff to go to the shops on the opposite side of West Coast Road to buy some things. Accordingly, he walked along to West Coast Road and at a point near the bus-stop he proceeded to cross the road and while doing so was knocked down by a car driven by the Defendant from the direction of Jurong towards Pasir Panjang Road. The stretch of road where the accident occurred is straight and is a dual carriageway but is rather narrow with a white line in the middle. At the time of the accident it was drizzling, and the road was wet.
The first plaintiff said that before he crossed the road he stopped at the side of the road and looked towards the right. He saw the defendant`s car at some distance away - the distance he estimated was roughly about 35 ft - and then crossed the road presumably thinking that it was safe to do so. He was knocked down by the car near the centre of the road. The defendant said he was driving the car at a speed of about 35 mph and following a truck which was about nine car lengths ahead. He did not see the first plaintiff at the left side of the road and the first time he saw the first plaintiff was when the latter was knocked down by his car. After the collision the car stopped a few metres away, and realizing that it might be obstructing traffic he drove his car forward to the left side of the road. There was a passenger in the car sitting next to the defendant. But his evidence does not throw any light on how the accident occurred. He also said that he did not see the first plaintiff before the accident and the first time he saw the first plaintiff was at the time of impact.
I find the defendant`s evidence that he did not see the first plaintiff until the time of the impact very surprising. The stretch of road is straight, and there was at that time nothing on the left side of the road which would obstruct his vision. According to him there was a truck ahead of him but it was nine car lengths away. A distance of nine car lengths is at least about 80 to 100 ft. With this distance separating the two cars the defendant ought to have seen the first plaintiff either at the side of the road or as he was about to cross the road, and if he had, he ought to have slowed down. The defendant said he was driving at a speed of about 35 mph. That probably was not a fast speed in normal circumstances, though he exceeded the legal limit for traffic along the road. But the road is rather narrow and at that time it was drizzling and the road was wet; there were puddles of water at isolated spots. Traffic on both sides of the road was moderate and there was a truck in front - about nine car lengths ahead. On the evidence I find that the defendant was negligent: he was driving his car too fast in the circumstances; he failed to keep a proper look out and failed to see the first plaintiff at the side of the road or just as he was about to cross the road.
It was urged by Mr Chng on behalf of the defendant that there was contributory negligence on the part of the first plaintiff: he should have seen the defendant`s car and should not have crossed the road in the face of an oncoming car. I think that the first plaintiff must have seen the defendant`s car, but a boy at the age of nine years could hardly be expected to judge accurately the speed and distance of an oncoming car. He cannot be expected to exercise the same degree of care or caution as an adult. I do not give much credence to his estimate of the distance of the car away from him when he first saw it before he crossed the road. He estimated roughly a distance of 35 feet; obviously he has no idea of distance. Nor would he have realized that as it was drizzling and the road was wet it would take a longer time for a car to stop. I therefore find that the first plaintiff was not to blame for the accident.
I now turn to the question of damages. There is no doubt that the first plaintiff had suffered brain damage. After the accident he was admitted to Alexandra Hospital and later transferred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. He was unconscious for three days, and was unable to speak for one week. He sustained a fracture of the right maxilla and a laceration of the right cheek. A right periorbital haematoma was noted as well as a swelling over the right maxillary region. He was discharged from hospital on 29 August 1979. He was examined by Dr Michael HL Yap, a neurologist, in August 1981 and his opinion as given in his report dated 13 August 1981 is as follows: 
 
In view of the history and as it was already two years after the accident, I concluded that it was possible that the patient had sustained a very severe post-concussional damage to the brain which may not have been detected on the computer x-ray of the brain but which could be concluded from his lower level of performance compared to previously.
 
 
 
An EEG examination was performed, which showed definite asymmetry in the brain activity ie there was beta activity clearly seen over the right frontal region, and poorly seen over the left frontal region where intermittent beta activity occurred. If these EEG changes began since the time of the accident, then this would indicate that the patient still had quite severe brain dysfunction despite the fact that no gross structural changes could be demonstrated on the computer scan x-ray.
 
 
 
At that time he concluded as follows: 
 
it is difficult to prognosticate how well he would improve in the future as there is such marked individual variability in ability, intelligence and motivation, however, I can state firmly that there is no doubt that he has had severe brain dysfunction due to the head injury.
 
 
 
Dr Yap also gave evidence and his conclusion was that after a lapse of about five years since the accident his improvement, if any, would not be significant.
The first plaintiff was also examined by Dr Nei I-Ping, a consultant neurologist, who was nominated by the defendant`s solicitors, and his neurological examination revealed defects in memory and in mental arithmetic. His conclusion is this: 
 
There is no doubt that he had deteriorated in his school performance. The severity of his head injury could be sufficient to explain this deterioration, as there was a significant period of post traumatic stupor of more than 24 hours consistent with severe brain concussion. The absence of abnormality on CT scan does not exclude severe concussion.
 
 
 
Although there is still possibility for improvement this is likely to be minimal in view of the time lapse.
 
 
 
On the basis of the evidence and in view of the nature and extent of injuries suffered by the first plaintiff I award a sum of $38,500 for pain and suffering and loss of amenities, being $35,000 for the permanent brain injury and $3,500 for the fractured maxilla and laceration of the right cheek.
As for the claim for loss of future earnings, that is an area filled with uncertainties. Prior to the accident the first plaintiff was performing satisfactorily in school, but after his accident there was a marked regression in his performance. This is clearly evident from his school report: see exh P1. He is presently in extended Primary 8. But for the accident and the injuries suffered, he would, in normal circumstances, be in Secondary II. As there is hardly any prospect of his improvement, it is extremely remote that the first plaintfff would be able to complete his secondary education. Tertiary education is completely ruled out in his case. Nor is it likely that he would be able to join any technical school or institution and be trained to acquire any technical skill. When he is 18 years old he will have to join national service, which will take up a period of two to three years, and he will only be able to start working at the age of 21 years or thereabouts. The question therefore is at that time what work he will do or will be capable of doing. In view of his limited ability and capability he would not be able to perform any skilled work or assume any responsible position. Dr Yap said he could cope with simple work and I would expect that at that time it would not be difficult to obtain work of such nature. It is difficult at this moment to forecast what wages or salary he would earn as an unskilled worker at that time and also what he would earn if he were a skilled worker or a professional. On the basis of current trend and standards the disparity between the salary of a skilled worker or a professional and that of an unskilled worker is very substantial. It would however be unfair to take an amount representing such disparity and apply it to a multiplier of 18 to 20 years, which would then result in an astronomical sum. Obviously there are various contingencies which must be taken into account including the possibility that the first plaintiff, even if he had not suffered such injuries, might stil l not be able to make the grade of a skilled worker or a professional. In the circumstances I have to take a reasonably moderate figure and taking all the factors into account, I consider that a figure of $200 per month is the appropriate multiplicand and that 20 years is the appropriate multiplier and on the basis of these figures I arrive at a sum of $48,000.
For completeness, I should add that in assessing the said sums of $35,000, $3,500 and $48,000 as general damages for the respective items I have of course taken into account the fact that these sums are awarded together and each is slightly lower than what I would otherwise assess in isolation. There will be judgment for the first plaintiff for the sum of $86,500, being the total amount of general damages. As for special damages to the second plaintiff, the amount has been agreed at $200 and accordingly, there will be judgment in the said sum for the second plaintiff. The defendant will have to pay the costs of this action.
 Order accordingly.",1984-12-19 00:00:00,SG High Court

In this application made by the Official Receiver, the liquidator of Kie Hock Shipping (1971) Pte Ltd (the Company), in Summons in Chambers No 5125 of 1981, the issue is whether the second respondent, Tay Beng Chuan, the executive director of the company, has been guilty of misfeasance or breach of duty under s 305 of the Companies Act (Cap 185) (the Act).
At an earlier hearing of the summons in chambers before the learned Chief Justice, the first respondent, Tay Hock Gwan, the managing director of the company having through his counsel admitted liability, an order was made against him in terms of the application. It was declared that the first respondent `has been guilty of misfeasance or breach of duty in relation to the said Company in failing between 30 December 1977 and 26 May 1978 to cause action to be taken by the said Company to recover debts owed to it by twelve companies mentioned in the said Summons which companies were incorporated in the Republic of Panama and further in allowing the said debts to accumulate such that by 26 May 1978 they totalled $11,551,000`; it was ordered that the first respondent pay the liquidator `the sum of $11,551,000 being the total amount of the said unrecovered debts and interest thereon at 8% per annum from 26 May 1978 until payment`; and it was further ordered that he pay the costs of the application.
The company was wound up on 26 May 1978 in Companies Winding-Up No 56 of 1978 on a petition presented by Eastern Lloyd Trading Pte Ltd and the Official Receiver was appointed its liquidator. Then nine creditors of the company sent a petition to the Minister for Finance. On 19 April 1979, the Minister appointed Mr Chan Sek Keong, an advocate and solicitor, and Mr Wong Siong Poon, a public accountant, as inspectors under ss 195 and 196 of the Act to investigate into the affairs of the company.
There was a very lengthy investigation into the affairs of the company by the inspectors. A certified copy of their report was tendered at the hearing of this application. The inspectors investigated, among various matters, the debts due to the company from the 12 Panamanian companies mentioned in the summons. The Inspectors found that `The ""loss"" of the Panamanian accounts was the single most important factor which accounted for the sorry state of the Company`s financial affairs`.
Based on the report of the inspectors, the Attorney General instituted criminal proceedings against the two respondents, Tay Hock Gwan and Tay Beng Chuan. There were six charges against the second respondent, Tay Beng Chuan. On 29 September 1981 he pleaded guilty to five of the charges and consented to the sixth charge to be taken into consideration in assessing sentence. For the purpose of this application only the first charge is relevant. The amended first charge reads as follows: 
 
You, Tay Beng Chuan are charged that you, between the 30 December 1977 and 26 May 1978, being a Director of Kie Hock Shipping (1971) Pte Ltd did commit a breach of your duty under s 132(1) of the Companies Act, Cap 185 to at all times use reasonable diligence in the discharge of your duties, to wit, by failing to cause action to be taken by the said Kie Hock Shipping (1971) Pte Ltd to recover debts owed to Kie Hock Shipping (1971) Pte Ltd by twelve companies incorporated in the Republic of Panama viz:
 
 
 
Compania Naviera Thompson SA
Africa Shipping Co Ltd Inc 
Gammewah Enterprises Ltd SA 
Tali Shipping Co Ltd SA 
Compania De Navegacia Laiton SA 
Holley Shipping Co Ltd SA 
Karingo Shipping Co Ltd SA 
Kadima Shipping Co Ltd SA 
Benteng Enterprises Co Ltd SA 
Sahaka Enterprises 
Salama Shipping Ltd SA 
Gambela Enterprises Ltd SA
 
 
 
which on the 30 December 1977 amounted to $10,291,000 and which were allowed to accumulate in the accounts of Kie Hock Shipping (1971) Pte Ltd such that by the 26 May 1978, these debts totalled $11,551,000 and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 132(3)(b) of the Companies Act, Cap 185.
 
 
 
On this amended charge the second respondent was fined $1,500 and in default two months` imprisonment. Following the convictions of the two respondents, the Official Receiver as liquidator of the company took out this application.
Having introduced the facts that led to this application, I now proceed to summarize the facts relevant to the application.
The company was incorporated on 27 November 1970 with its registered office at 48-A Cecil Street, Singapore. The nominal capital of the company was $2m divided into 2m shares of $1 each. The amount of capital paid up or credited as paid up was $1m.
The first respondent, Tay Hock Gwan, was at all material times the managing director and the major shareholder of the company. At the date of the winding of the company he was holding 98% of the issued share capital of the company. He was also at all material times the managing director and had sole control of 12 companies he incorporated in the Republic of Panama (the Panamanian companies).
The second respondent, Tay Beng Chuan, is the nephew of the first respondent, Tay Hock Gwan. He was at all material times the executive director of the company. He was also a shareholder of the company, he owned 2% of the issued share capital of the company at the date of the winding-up order.
The company commenced trading on 1 January 1971 by taking over the shipping operations and the assets and liabilities of its predecessor company, Kie Hock Shipping Co (Pte) Ltd. The company was engaged in operating and chartering its own vessels, hiring of its motor launches, operating a workshop to service and repair its vessels and acting as agent for vessels owned by its related and affiliated companies.
During the years 1971 to 1974, the company did well. The profits from operating its vessels alone increased from $275,000 in 1971 to $9,616,000 in 1974. After 1974, however, freight income began to drop but operating expenses continued to rise. In 1977, the operations of the company`s ships alone resulted in a loss of $3.7m.
The Panamanian companies were among the affiliated companies which had dealings with the company. Each of the Panamanian companies owned one or more ships and the company was the Singapore agent for all the Panamanian ships. As at 1 January 1975, 39 Panamanian ships were noted in the records of the company. However, information derived from the books of account of the company showed that the Company did not always operate the Panamanian ships for the accounts of their respective registered owners.
As agents of the Panamanian companies, all disbursements and advances made by the company in respect of the Panamanian ships were debited to the accounts of the Panamanian companies kept by the company, and all freight earnings and other income of the ships were credited to the same accounts. However, in addition to the normal disbursements incurred by the ships, various other expenses which could not be satisfactorily accounted for were similarly debited to these accounts. There were also other private expenses incurred by the first respondent, Tay Hock Gwan, and his family which were debited to these accounts. The combined debts of the Panamanian companies amounted to $6,446,000 in 1975 and $10,291,000 in 1976.
During 1976 and 1977, a number of large claims were made against the company by both foreign and local creditors. Among the company`s creditors who were pressing for payment at that time were:
 
 
(a) Berger Paints (S) Pte Ltd 
 
(b) Caltex (Asia) Ltd 
 
(c) Castrol (Far East) Pte Ltd 
 
(d) Jurong Shipyard Ltd 
 
(e) Keppel Shipyard Ltd 
 
(f) Port of Singapore Authority 
 
(g) Sembawang Shipyard Ltd 
 
(h) Van Der Horst (Asia) Pte Ltd and 
 
(i) Sin Chiao Shipping Pte Ltd
  
 
 
The total claims of these nine creditors alone were in excess of $5m.
By 1977 the company was in critical financial difficulties. The debts of the Panamanian companies were by now $10,774,000. But both the respondents, Tay Hock Gwan, and Tay Beng Chuan, as managing director and executive director respectively of the company, took no action whatsoever to recover the enormous debts owed to it from the Panamanian companies. Instead, the first respondent, Tay Hock Gwan, was at about that time actively disposing of the ships belonging to the Panamanian companies to his relatives and other affiliated companies. The second respondent, Tay Beng Chuan, was aware of this. No proceeds of the disposal of the ships were credited to the accounts of the Panamanian companies kept by the company. To aggravate matters, both the respondents further allowed the debts of the Panamanian companies to accumulate such that by 26 May 1978, at the date of the winding-up of the Company, they totalled $11,551,000.
The ships were the only assets of the Panamanian companies. By disposing of them without payment to the company, the first respondent, Tay Hock Gwan, effectively deprived the company of all possibility of recovering the debts owing by the Panamanian companies. In the statement of affairs filed by the second respondent, Tay Beng Chuan, all the Panamanian debts due to the company were classified by him as irrecoverable on the basis that the Panamanian companies had no assets to which the company could have recourse.
There is no doubt that the loss of $11,551,000 suffered by the company as a result of the irrecoverability of the Panamanian debts was the single most important factor which accounted for the hopeless state of the Company`s insolvency. At the date of the hearing of the application, the claims filed by the company`s creditors in this winding-up was about $24.3m.
The facts that I have outlined are not in dispute. In his affidavit for leave to defend these proceedings, the second defendant refers to some other facts. There is also annexed to the affidavit a copy of a lengthy letter his solicitors wrote to the Attorney General making representations on his behalf for the withdrawal of the charges brought against him under the Act. The plea was rejected.
The second respondent states that the first respondent, Tay Hock Gwan is his paternal uncle. It was his uncle who had sole control in the management of the Kie Hock Group of Companies. His uncle was also the beneficial owner of most of the shares in the Kie Hock Group of Companies. He was given 2% shares in the company by his uncle as a mere token. He never complained about this small shareholding, though he thought he should have received more shares because his father, Tay Kie Hock, was the founder of the company. But he did not raise the question with his uncle as he had always considered him as `a father`. His own father had passed away in 1942 when he was three years old and his mother had returned to China. He was left in the care of his uncle and his second wife. On account of this and also, because his uncle was a very strict and stern man he carried out whatever he was required to do by his uncle without questioning.
On the Panamanian companies owned by his uncle, the second respondent says in his affidavit that not being a director or shareholder he had no control whatsoever of them. And he adds that as his uncle had complete control of the company and the other companies in the group, he was in no position to initiate any action by the company against the Panamanian companies on his own.
The second respondent`s case is that throughout his tenure as executive director of the company, he was totally powerless. Not having resigned from the positions he held in the company, he realises now that he may be regarded as having condoned the defaults or the breaches of duties of his uncle, but at that time he was torn between his filial duties and self-protection. He also had faith that his uncle would eventually pull the Kie Hock Group of Companies out of its crisis. Furthermore, knowing that the shipping business is cyclical he had at all times expected the business to turn around and the group of companies to survive as a whole.
The first observation I made on the claims of the second respondent is that whilst he considered his uncle `the overall boss` of the company, there is irrefutable evidence that after 1976 it was the second respondent who as executive director of the company was mainly responsible for the management of the company. On this the Inspectors have noted in para 27 of the report under the heading `reasons for the Collapse of the Company`: 
 
According to Tay Beng Chuan, Tay Hock Gwan became indifferent to the business of the Company in 1976.
 
 
 
... According to himself, Tay Hock Gwan left the management of the Company to the other directors after 1976.
 
 
 
Secondly, though the second respondent was not a director or shareholder in any one of the Panamanian companies, as executive director in charge of operations of the company, he had full and effective control of all the Panamanian ships managed by the company. That this was so is borne out in the evidence of the uncle to the inspectors. 
 
Q Since you owned the ships and the Panamanian companies lost money can it be regarded as you losing your money?
A Yes, but I have not taken any money from the Panamanian companies. There is also no accounts, so I didn`t know. 
Q But all the ships were yours? A Yes, but I still had no knowledge of the Panamanian companies` accounts. 
Q But you were the MD you should know. 
A Yes, I was the MD but I trusted others to manage the companies` affairs. They were educated in UK and so I trusted them and depended on them.
 
 
 
Thirdly, the transaction I am about to refer to shows that the second respondent had not acted honestly in the management of the company. At about the time the company was insolvent, there was a transfer of five Panamanian ships to a company called Uni-Ocean to set off certain loans. But the books of the company showed that the Panamanian companies which owed these debts did not owe any money to Uni-Ocean. These facts were known to the second respondent for he was at that time not only the executive director of the company but also the managing director of Uni-Ocean. In his evidence to the Inspectors, he admitted that by Uni-Ocean accepting the ships, he had created a wrong impression to the public.
In my opinion the foregoing facts and observations amply refute the plea of the second respondent that he was under the control of his uncle and that as executive director he was totally powerless.
There is also the claim made by the second respondent that because he had only 2% of the Company`s shares, he had no influence in the company. Not only is this claim not supported on the facts, it is also untenable in law as the powers of a director of a company are not dependent on the number of shares he holds in the company. In any event, Miss Yap for the Official Receiver has drawn my attention to the fact that the articles of association of the company do not require directors to hold any qualification shares.
I also agree with Miss Yap that the second respondent cannot in this application be heard to say that he had no power to prevent the breaches of duties by his uncle. This is because he pleaded guilty to the first amended charge for breach of his own duty under s 132(1) of the Act. In that criminal trial, when the summary of facts were read to him, he admitted that by 1977 the company was in great financial difficulties; that at that time he knew that his uncle was actively disposing of the Panamanian ships to relatives and to other companies owned by him; that his uncle did it to deprive the company from having recourse to the only assets owned by the Panamanian companies; that as executive director of the company, he took no action whatsoever to recover the debts owed to the company by the Panamanian companies; and that he had failed to use reasonable diligence in the discharge of his office as a director of the Company.
For reasons I shall give later, I am of the view that there is no difference in kind between the breach of duty referred to in s 132 and s 305(1) of the Act. Therefore, the plea of guilty of the second respondent on the amended first charge and the admissions made by him in the criminal trial are both relevant and admissible in these proceedings. If not for the fact that there are other arguments that I have to consider, in my judgment, on this ground alone, the applicant is entitled to an order in terms of the application.
Another submission for the second respondent was that there is no causal connection between the alleged breaches of the second respondent and the losses suffered by the company. The Panamanian debts, it was said, were accumulated by the company over a number of years in the course of trading and these debts reflected part of the accumulated losses sustained by the Kie Hock Group of Companies in those years. The proximate cause of these losses was the failure of the group as a whole as a result of recession, bad management and the accumulation of these debts.
To consider this submission, I have to expand on the facts outlined earlier. In App E of the Report of the Inspectors, there is in tabulated form the `Panamanian Companies` Current Account Balance in Kie Hock`s Books as at 31 December` for the year 1971 to 1977 and, for the year 1978 up to 26 May 1978, the date of the winding-up order of the company. The Appendix shows that in the years 1971 to 1974 the Panamanian companies had credit balances with Kie Hock. In 1974 the credit balance was $996,000. But in 1975, there was a sudden deficit of $6,448,000; thereafter, in 1976 the deficit was $10,254,000, in 1977 it was $10,711,000, and on 26 May 1978 it was $11,509,000.
I have already said the second respondent does not dispute that when the Panamanian debts were accumulated, he was in charge of operating the Panamanian vessels. On this evidence, Miss Yap has rightly said that had the second respondent exercised reasonable care and diligence, he would not have continued operating those vessels when the debts due from the Panamanian companies in 1975 amounted to a staggering sum of $6,446,000. He, however, did worse things. He stood by and allowed his uncle to dispose of the Panamanian vessels. After that, the debts remaining unpaid and unsecured, he gave further credits to the Panamanian companies so that by the time of the winding up of the company, there was $11.5m owed by the Panamanian companies. The second respondent has declared in the statement of affairs that the whole amount of $11.5m owed by the companies was uncollectable. When the Inspectors asked him why he made that declaration he replied that as all the Panamanian ships had been sold there were no other assets left.
On these facts, there can be no doubt that the second respondent as executive director was grossly negligent in the management of the affairs of the company. His failure to collect the Panamanian debts was, as the Inspectors said, `the single most important factor` that caused the company to be wound up. It was therefore futile to argue that there is no causal connection between the breaches of duties committed by the second respondent and the losses suffered by the Company.
On the topic of causal connection, Mr Netto has asked a rhetoric question as to what sort of action is it alleged that the second respondent could have or should have taken. Miss Yap for the applicant has given the avenues that were open to the second respondent. He could have called a meeting of directors, have his views or protest recorded, and a vote taken on the question whether action should be taken to recover the debts from the Panamanian companies. As executive director in charge of operations, he could have given instructions that the company stop acting as agents for the Panamanian ships. He could also have instructed the company`s solicitors to sue the Panamanian companies. As the Panamanian ships were under his control, he could have caused writs in rem to be issued against them and have them arrested. This would have prevented the claims of the company being defeated by the transfer of the ships. He could also have reported or threatened to report to the Registrar of Companies the breaches of duty of his co-director. In any event, he could have resigned from his office as director. He could then, on his own motion, have applied to the High Court for relief under s 354(2) of the Act.
There remains for me to consider the legal argument raised by Mr Netto for the second respondent. He has submitted that the summary jurisdiction conferred by s 305(1) of the Act invoked against the second respondent is misconceived because the claim of the applicant is outside the scope of the section. In other words, the argument is that there was no misconduct on the part of the second respondent of the kind contemplated by s 305 of the Act that he should be made liable thereunder.
The relevant part of s 305(1) of the Act reads as follows: 
 
If in the course of winding up it appears that any...officer has...been guilty of any misfeasance or breach of trust or duty in relation to the company, the Court may on the application of the liquidator ... examine into the conduct of such officer and compel him to repay...the money...or any part thereof with interest at such rate as the Court thinks just, or to contribute such sum to the assets of the company by way of compensation in respect of the...misfeasance or breach of trust or duty as the Court thinks just.
 
 
 
The wording of this subsection is similar to s 267(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 174 of the 1955 Revised Edition) except that the words `or duty` after `breach of trust` were not there in the old section. When the old Ordinance was repealed and the Companies Act 1967 enacted by Act No 42 of 1967, the words `or duty` appeared in s 305(1) of that Act and is in the present Reprint of s 305(1) of the Act. It is true to say that s 305(1) of the Act is based on s 333 of the UK Companies Act 1948, but again the words `or duty` are not included in the UK Act. They were taken from Australia: see s 305 of the Companies Act 1961 of the State of Victoria.
As regards s 333 of the UK Act, it is settled law in England that the section does not create any new rights but only provides a summary mode of enforcing rights which apart from the section would have to be enforced by an ordinary action in the courts. So, if a company or its liquidator has a right of action against a director, the section can be employed in the winding up as a cheaper and effective summary method of enforcing the right: see 1 
 Palmer`s 
 
 Company Law 
 62-27 at p 698. It was said by Maugham J in 
 Re Etic Ltd 
 [1928] Ch 861, 875, that the procedure under this section `is not applicable to all cases in which the company has a right of action against an officer of the company. It is limited to cases where there has been something in the nature of a breach of duty by an officer of the company as such which has caused pecuniary loss to the company. Breach of duty of course would include a misfeasance or a breach of trust in the stricter sense, and the section will apply to a true case of misapplication of money or property of the company....` Thus, it has been evolved by the courts in England that even though the words `breach of duty` are not found in s 333, a director who commits a breach of his duty towards his company is, in a winding-up of the company, prima facie liable under the said section.
As to what are the duties of directors, there are the often quoted remarks of Romer J in 
 Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co 
 [1925] Ch 407, 427. He said that to ascertain the duties of a director of a company, it is necessary to consider the nature of the company`s business and the manner in which the work of the company is, reasonably in the circumstances and consistently with the articles of association, distributed between the directors and the other officials of the company. In discharging those duties, amongst other duties, a director must act honestly and must exercise such degree of skill and diligence as would amount to the reasonable care which an ordinary man might be expected to take, in the circumstances, on his own behalf. In England, a breach of any of the duties by a director towards the company would give rise to an ordinary action by the company, and in a winding up to proceedings under s 333.
The position in Singapore is that what is required of directors by case law in England is provided by statute in s 132 of the Act. The relevant subsections of s 132 are these: 
 
(1) A director shall at all times act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office ...
(3) An officer or agent who commits a breach of any of the provisions of this section shall be -
 
 
 
(a) liable to the company for any profit made by him or for any damage suffered by the company as a result of the breach of any of those provisions; and
 
 
 
(b) guilty of an offence under this Act and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars.
(4) This section is in addition to and not in derogation of any other written law or rule of law relating to the duty or liability of directors or officers of a company.
 
 
 
In the context of this application, every director owes a duty to his company to use reasonable diligence in the discharge of his duties. Failure by a director to do so would be a breach of duty of his office. That breach of duty would give rise to an action by the company against the director for damages suffered by the company. The commission of that breach of duty by the director would also be a criminal offence.
Then there is s 305(1) of the Act. It gives power to a court, in the winding-up of a company, to assess damages against, amongst other persons, a delinquent director of the company. One of the defaults referred to in s 305(1) of the Act, which I have set out above, is `breach of duty` of a director `in relation to the company`. It is plain to me that the `breach of duty` referred to here embraces all of the duties of a director referred in s 132(1) and (4) of the Act. Thus, when a company is wound up, its director can be proceeded against under s 305 of the Act for the duty owed by him to his company to use reasonable diligence in the performance of his duties. I therefore reject the argument that the breach of duty contemplated by s 305 of the Act is different from that provided in s 132 of the Act, and for that matter, the argument that the admission made by the second respondent in the criminal case of failure to use reasonable diligence in the discharge of duties is not a breach of duty actionable under s 305 of the Act. In my view, these arguments ignore the clear language of s 305 of the Act and completely ignore s 132 of the Act.
Finally, Mr Netto in his submission maximized on the observation of the inspectors that they appreciated the inability of the second respondent to influence his uncle, the first respondent, in the management of the company. But the inspectors also said that the second respondent had not tried hard enough. The inspectors were of the view that the second respondent should have stopped the first respondent from or resisted him in transferring the Panamanian ships. They were also of the view that the second respondent should have taken steps to sell the Panamanian ships, at least those which were no longer profitable and collected the proceeds to reduce the Panamanian debts to the company. On a review of the evidence, I have said that after the first respondent went to Hong Kong sometime in 1976, it was the second respondent who was left in charge of the management of the company. As executive director in charge of operations, he had in his hands the reins of the company. But he failed to discharge the duties and obligations required of him as such director of the company.
At the conclusion of the hearing, I held that he was liable for dereliction of his duties as director of the company. Though s 305 of the Act gives the court a very wide discretion covering the amount and the rate of interest the second respondent should be required to pay, having regard to the conduct of the second respondent in the management of the affairs of the company which led to his conviction, I was of the view that he should be jointly and severally liable with the first respondent. As the second respondent had not acted honestly and reasonably in the discharge of his duties as director, I concluded that he ought not to be excused under s 354 of the Act. For all these reasons, I made an order in terms of the application.

s 183 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113)
 
At the conclusion of the hearing of two magistrate`s appeals last Friday, which were heard together as they were both concerned with the ambit of s 183 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113), I allowed both appeals, varied the orders of two learned district judges and directed that the discharges in both the appeals amounted to acquittals. In addition to discharging my duty to do so, I am setting out my grounds in deference to since I found myself at variance with the written grounds of decisions of both the learned district judges who have had much experience in the administration of criminal justice in the subordinate courts.
The two appeals arose in this way. In MA 78/84, Arnold Ah Chak, a detective sergeant of the Singapore Police Force, faced two charges that he on two different days in June 1983 did corruptly obtain for himself from two prostitutes gratification in the form of sexual intercourse as inducements to return them their passports and not putting them on the blacklist for immigration purposes. He was alleged to have committed offences under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 104). When the case was called on for hearing on 26 March 1984, the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor applied for the accused to be discharged not amounting to an acquittal in respect of the two charges as the prosecution could not go on due to the fact that the two prostitutes, as principal witnesses for the prosecution, were not available.
Learned counsel for the accused applied to the learned district judge to direct a discharge amounting to an acquittal under s 183(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code but the latter declined to do so. Instead, he ordered that the accused be discharged not amounting to an acquittal on the two charges. His sole and only ground may be summarised in this way. The prosecution in the case was unable to proceed because of the unavailability of the two witnesses. Since it was not withdrawing the charges, the prosecution had not informed the court that `(it) will not further prosecute the (accused) upon the charge(s)` within the meaning of that phrase (as substituted) in s 183(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. He accordingly held that `there was nothing (in the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code) which could empower me to discharge the accused amounting to an acquittal`. With the greatest of respect to the learned district judge, I am of the view that he has misconstrued the meaning of the phrase in s 183(1) of the Code which I have quoted. I must now recite s 183 of the Code which is in the following terms: 
 
(1) At any stage of any summary trial before judgment has been delivered, the Public Prosecutor may, if he thinks fit, inform the court that he will not further prosecute the defendant upon the charge and thereupon all proceedings on the charge against the defendant shall be stayed and he shall be discharged from and of the same.
(2) Such discharge shall not amount to an acquittal unless the court to directs except in cases coming under s 176.
 
 
 
What then must the Public Prosecutor inform the court before the consequences of a stay of the proceedings and a discharge of a defendant can arise and take place? In other words, what is the meaning of the phrase `he (the Public Prosecutor) will not further prosecute the defendant upon the charge?` To my mind, there are two possible meanings. The first is the Public Prosecutor informing the court that for some reason, such as the unavailability of a prosecution witness, he will not at the stage when the case has come on for hearing go on with the prosecution of the defendant upon the charge. In other words, he informs the court that he has decided that he will not take the prosecution beyond what has gone on up to that stage. The other meaning is the Public Prosecutor informing the court that he will not ever prosecute the defendant on the charge. The learned district judge had interpreted the phrase to bear the second meaning. In doing so, I am of the view that he had fallen into error. If the word `further` may properly be read as `ever` in s 183(1) of the Code, which would give the condition precedent in the subsection a narrow and restrictive scope, then it seems to me that the ensuing provisions in sub-s (1), which set out the consequences of a stay of the proceedings and the discharge of the defendant, are too convoluted or tortuous. If the Public Prosecutor were withdrawing the charge to the intent that he will not ever resurrect the charge against the defendant, the ensuing provisions setting out the consequence should, and only could, be that the defendant shall be discharged from and of the same and that such discharge shall amount to an acquittal. The elaborate procedure for a stay and a discharge and the court`s power to direct an acquittal would have been unnecessary.
If the phrase is construed as bearing the first meaning, no such difficulties arise at all. Indeed, the ensuing provisions in sub-s (1) and the provisions of sub-s (2) will work very well. When the prosecution under sub-s 183(1) of the Code informs the court that he will not go on with the prosecution, all proceedings on the charge against the defendant shall be stayed and the defendant shall be discharged from and of the same. Section 183(2) begins with the proposition of law that such discharge shall not amount to an acquittal, followed by the crucial words `unless the court so directs...`. I need not refer to the cases coming within s 176 of the Code as they are irrelevant for present purposes. These crucial words plainly confer on the court the discretionary power to direct an acquittal and the power arises the moment the prosecution informs the court that it is not going on with the prosecution of the defendant upon the charge, whether or not the prosecution has decided forever to withdraw the charge.
If an accused applies for a discharge amounting to an acquittal, a court must bear in mind that the legislature has in the opening words of s 183(2) set down the principle that the discharge `shall not` amount to an acquittal. There must be circumstances in the proceedings so far on record or the accused must show sufficient reasons to displace the principle that the discharge shall not amount to an acquittal. In exercising its power under s 183(2) of the Code, a court must bear in mind and give due regard to the dot of the prosecution to proceed at a later stage:

 . On the other hand, there is ample persuasive authority for the proposition that unless some good ground is shown it would not be right to leave an individual saddled with a charge in which proceedings are stayed for an indeterminate period: see

[1968] 1 MLJ 166
 , 167 by Ong Hock Sim J (as he then was). It is not desirable to set down any principle which a court must follow when acting under s 183(2) of the Code as if it is writ in stone and thereby fetter the discretion of the court which has to be judicially exercised. Circumstances do vary from case to case. Each case has to be dealt with on its merits, with the court bearing in mind the public interest and the right of the individual to which I have alluded.
Seeing that the learned district judge had misdirected himself, in that he had proceeded on the erroneous basis that he had no power to direct an acquittal because the prosecution had not informed the court that it will never ever prefer the same charges against the appellant, I had for myself at the hearing of this appeal to decide whether in all the circumstances of the case I would direct that the discharge shall amount to an acquittal.
The learned district judge was informed that two principal prosecution witnesses were not available. On that basis the learned deputy public prosecutor applied that the appellant be discharged not amounting to an acquittal. Obviously, the prosecution indicated that it was not going on, indeed was unable to go on, with the prosecution but there was no indication that it will never ever prefer the same charges against the appellant. It was equally obvious that in applying for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal, the prosecution was acting under s 183(1) of the Code. In the course of the appeal, it was disclosed to me and it was not challenged by the learned deputy public prosecutor, who had not appeared before the learned district judge, that one of the two witnesses had died and that the other, a foreigner, was unavailable and likely to remain unavailable for an indefinite period. I was further told that the appellant had been reinstated in the Singapore Police Force after he had faced certain disciplinary proceedings and had emerged unscathed. Through his counsel, he asked that he be afforded the opportunity of a trial to clear his name and indicated that he was prepared to stand trial if the prosecution could indicate if it was able to proceed. The learned deputy prosecutor was unable to give the court any such indication. I was accordingly persuaded that it would be unfair to subject him to any further agony and I directed that the discharge should amount to an acquittal.
I now turn to the other appeal K Abdul Rasheed s/o Assainar was charged with the offence of having in May 1982 with two named persons and in furtherance of their common intention committed theft of two sums of cash under s 380 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 103). When the case came on for hearing on 16 February 1984 before the learned district judge, the prosecuting officer applied for an order that the accused be given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal. Counsel for the accused objected and asked for an acquittal as the prosecution, he alleged, did not wish to proceed. It is not clear from the records of appeal if he was saying that the prosecution was forever not prosecuting the accused on the same charge. The case was stood down. At the resumption of the case in the afternoon, the learned district judge understood the prosecution to say that it was not withdrawing the charge, although the records show that the prosecution had merely renewed its application for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal. Beyond that, the prosecution did not inform the court of the reason or reasons why it was not going on with the prosecution beyond that stage.
Looking at the grounds of decision of the learned district judge, the sole ground was that the court should not deny the prosecution the right to proceed with its case subsequently and reliance was placed on 
 Kuppusamy 
 
 v 
 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1948] MLJ 25
 . There was no consideration given at all to the question whether or not it was unfair to subject the accused to a charge hanging over his head for an indefinite period. As I read the grounds of decision of the learned district judge, it was implicit that the practice of the court was to order a discharge not amounting to an acquittal if the prosecution indicated that it was not withdrawing the charge. If this was the practice, as I think it was, I have to say that it was clearly wrong. For the reasons I had given in the earlier appeal, a court has to act judicially and consider both the public interest and any unfairness to an accused person. A consideration of one aspect without the consideration of the other was not a proper exercise of the power of the court under s 183(2) of the Code. I had therefore to consider all the circumstances, but my task was considerably lightened as the learned deputy prosecutor indicated to me that he was not resisting the appeal. I accordingly made the order I did.

In these proceedings, the plaintiffs are claiming against the defendant damages and an injunction to restrain him from further repeating or publishing certain rather serious libellous statements concerning them. I do not propose repeating the libellous statements in these grounds of decision because I do not think that I should unwittingly or unnecessarily cause any further hurt to any person. The matters complained of were contained in a letter of the defendant dated 7 February 1984 and addressed to the Clerk of Parliament in response to the invitation of Parliament for written representations from the public on the Companies (Amendment) Bill.
In November last year, the defendant by a summons-in-chambers applied for an order that the amended statement of claim be struck out on the ground that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. In an application on this ground, no evidence, including affidavit evidence, is admissible. A court will only look at the pleading under question and will assume that the facts pleaded are true and undisputed: see O 18 rule 19(2) of the Rules of Supreme Court 1970 and 
 The Hsing An 
 
 
 
[1974] 1 MLJ 45
 , 48 per FA Chua J. After the application was canvassed before the learned assistant registrar, he dismissed the defendant`s application with costs. Being dissatisfied with the decision of the learned assistant registrar, the defendant brought an appeal which came up before me. At the conclusion of the adjourned hearings of the appeal in May this year, I dismissed the appeal with costs. Although there is no appeal against my decision in this interlocutory matter, I now give my reasons for doing so.
The summary procedure to strike out a pleading will only be used in cases which are plain and obvious or where the case is clear beyond doubt. Accordingly, as long as a statement of claim discloses some question fit to be tried, even if it is a question of law, the mere fact that the case is weak or may not be likely to succeed at the trial is not sufficient ground for striking out the statement of claim as disclosing `no` reasonable cause of action: see vol 37 
 Halsbury`s 
 
 Laws of England 
 , 4th Ed para 432 and the cases cited in note 10. It was on this basis that I viewed the submissions canvassed by counsel on both sides.
Counsel for the defendant argued that the written representations submitted to the Clerk of Parliament were part and parcel of `proceedings in Parliament` within the meaning of that expression in s 4 of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act (Cap 49) (the Act) and that, accordingly, they were not `to be impeached or questioned in any Court ... or any other place whatsoever out of Parliament`. Section 4 is substantially similar to art 9 of the English Bill of Rights (1688). In other words, the written representations were made on an occasion of absolute privilege. The defendant relied greatly on the decision in 
 Lake v King 
 1 Wms, Saund 131; 85 ER 137. A Committee in Parliament in England had been formed to look into grievances of the populace. The defendant published a petition to the Committee and parts of the petition were alleged by the plaintiff to be defamatory of the plaintiff. It was held in that case that the printing of a false and scandalous petition to a Committee of the House of Commons and delivering copies thereof to members of the Committee was justifiable because it was in the order and course of proceedings in Parliament of which the courts should take judicial notice.
It was pointed out that the written representations in this case were published to the Clerk of Parliament, who received them on behalf of the Select Committee, and thereafter they came within the control and direction of the Select Committee which under Standing O 98(13) `may at its discretion ... reject any irrelevant representation`.
I now turn to the submissions made on behalf of the plaintiffs. Counsel for the plaintiffs conceded that the privilege of Parliament in respect of its own proceedings extended to its Select Committee and that all the actions of the Committee members were absolutely privileged. But in the case of a member of the public who was not a Member of Parliament, counsel for the plaintiffs contended that he could not claim the protection of absolute privilege in respect of proceedings before a Select Committee unless (1) he had appeared before the tribunal as a witness; and (2) the Select Committee and the enquiry with which it enquires or adjudicates upon is acting in a judicial capacity in a manner similar to Courts of Justice.
 Lake v King (supra) 
 was distinguished on the ground that defendant/petitioner in that case had appeared as a witness and that the Committee, unlike the Select Committee in this case, was quasi-judicial in character.
For support of the first part of these submissions, my attention was drawn to s 17(1) of the Act under which it is provided that, subject to two provisoes which are irrelevant for present purposes, no person who gives evidence before Parliament or any committee shall be liable to any civil or criminal proceedings or damages by reason of anything which he may have said in such evidence. This subsection incorporates the rule of law as enunciated in 
 Goffin v Donnelly 
 
(1881) 6 QBD 307
.
In support of the second part of these submissions, reliance was placed on what appeared to be the raison d`etre in the case of 
 Goffin v Donnelly (supra) 
 . In that case, the House of Commons ordered a Select Committee to be appointed to inquire into and report on the circumstances relating to the suspension of a certificate by the Science and Art Department of the plaintiff who was a school master. The Select Committee in that case has power to send for persons, papers and records just as the Select Committee has in this case under Standing Order No 98(2). In the course of the enquiry the Committee summoned the defendant in that case as a witness, administered an oath and heard his evidence. The words complained of were extracts from his evidence. Although it was held that the statements were absolutely privileged, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that those statements were similar to the statements of witnesses made in a Court of Justice to which absolute privilege attaches. Counsel appears to submit that absolute parliamentary privilege attaches only if the Select Committee is judicial or quasi-judicial in character.
I had reservations about the soundness of these submissions, which though I considered weak I was not prepared to dismiss out of hand without a trial in the course of which the court may like to call for the appearance of the learned Attorney General as amicus curiae, seeing that this case touches on parliamentary privilege and, perhaps, in view of s 3(1) of the Act, materials on the privileges of the United Kingdom Parliament bearing on this case may be made available.
The statement of claim in this case has raised an arguable, difficult and important point of law. For this reason also, the pleading as a matter of practice should not be struck out: see vol 37 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 , 4th ed para 432 (
 supra 
).
There is no direct authority bearing on the issue of law raised in this case. The arguably similar case is 
 Rivlin v Bilainkin 
 
[1953] 1 QB 485
. Dr Lilian Rivlin started proceedings against the defendant, Mr George Bilainkin, her former husband, for alleged defamation against her. An interim injunction was granted against the defendant. The defendant, ignoring or in defiance of the injunction, went to the House of Commons and handed to the messenger of the House five communications for delivery to named Members of Parliament. The communications repeated the matters complained of in the slander proceedings. The defendant, it appeared, wanted a Select Committee to consider his grievance. But it was equally apparent that the document was initiated by him and it was not in response to any invitation from the House of Commons. The plaintiff applied to the judge in chambers for an order of committal against the defendant on whose behalf it was argued that it was a privilege of Parliament that all members were entitled to be approached in the House of Parliament by anyone desiring parliamentary action and that anyone who impeded such approach was in breach of parliamentary privilege.
Not unexpectedly, McNair J (as he then was) ruled that no question of parliamentary privilege arose. He said at p 488: `... and particularly, I rely on the fact that the publication was not connected in any way with any proceedings in that House.` It seemed to me that drawing on the implications of this decision, much could be said that written representations to a Select Committee in response to an invitation of Parliament would constitute them as a part of proceedings in Parliament.
Notwithstanding what I had set out earlier in these grounds of decision, I should perhaps indicate the view of the law which I tentatively hold at this interlocutory stage, although what follows hereafter should be subject to full arguments, including submissions from the learned Attorney General at the trial.
A consideration of the term `proceedings in Parliament` must include a reference to Erskine May`s 
 Parliamentary Practice 
 (20th Ed) in which the following passage appears at p 92: 
 
The primary meaning, as a technical parliamentary term, of `proceedings` (which it had at least as early as the seventeenth century) is some formal action, usually a decision taken by the House in its collective capacity. This is naturally extended to the forms of business in which the House takes action, and the whole process, the principal part of which is debate, by which it reaches its decision.
 
 
 
Although in the following two pages of 
 Erskine May 
 it is stated that `the meaning of the term `proceedings in Parliament` has not been expressly defined by the courts` in the United Kingdom, it seems to me that any matter which has a close relationship with the affairs of Parliament or its decision-making process attracts the doctrine of absolute parliamentary privilege.
In my opinion, the absolute privilege of `proceedings in Parliament` within the meaning of that expression under s 4 of the Act attaches to the written representations submitted to the Clerk of Parliament by a member of the public in response to an invitation of a Select Committee of Parliament. This may be garnered by implication from 
 Rivlin v Bilainkin (supra) 
 . I hasten to add that the absolute privilege is not a privilege to be malicious, but a privilege granted so that such written representations should be exempt from any inquiry whether they were prompted by malice or not, it being for the public interest that such written representations, be they true or false, should be made to Parliament or a Select Committee of Parliament without any apprehension of subsequent legal proceedings. If they are false, it is for Parliament or the Select Committee, as the case may be, to reject or otherwise deal with the false representations.

In this action, the plaintiff`s claim is for damages for personal injuries and for consequential loss suffered by him as a result of an accident which occurred on 27 May 1979 in the course of his employment by the defendants on board a motor launch `Sea Supply`. It is not in dispute that during the course of loading three oil drums from `Sea Supply` onto a larger vessel `14 Ramadhan` one drum fell and the plaintiff was injured.
At the material time `Sea Supply` and `14 Ramadhan` were somewhere near the Eastern Anchorage, about two miles away from the last of the vessels anchored at this Anchorage. On this evidence the vessels were somewhere close to international waters. Captain Hong who gave evidence for the defendants as an expert witness when asked on this topic said that the vessels were outside Port Limits and were in waters used by foreign going ships which did not intend to enter the Port of Singapore.
Before I deal with the accident, I should say a few words on `Sea Supply`. It is one of the vessels owned by the defendants, a ship chandling company. It is a motor launch with a hatch in the hull which extends over most of the space below the deck of the vessel. Nearer the stem of the launch is the wheelhouse. As the name it bears, the launch is used for the supply of stores and other things required by ships that come into Singapore. The crew of `Sea Supply` consists of a serang, an engine driver and two deckhands who have been described by the managing director of the defendants as hatch coolies.
On the material day `Sea Supply` went to `14 Ramadhan` to deliver 21 drums of lubricating oil. The plaintiff said that as `Sea Supply` approached `14 Ramadhan`, the latter was making way through the water. As `14 Ramadhan` was going faster than `Sea Supply`, on instructions from the serang, the plaintiff contacted `Sea Supply` over the radio telephone and requested it to slow down. In due course `Sea Supply` came alongside `14 Ramadhan`. The plaintiff said that `Sea Supply` was secured to `14 Ramadhan` at the bow and stern.
There is an issue of fact whether `14 Ramadhan` was making way through the water when `Sea Supply` came alongside. Chan, the other hatch coolie, who gave evidence for the defendants said that `14 Ramadhan` was anchored. He said that when they were approaching `14 Ramadhan`, he did not see any waves caused by the propeller of that vessel. He therefore viewed that the vessel was anchored.
On the subject of mooring, Chan said that `Sea Supply` was moored to `14 Ramadhan` by the bow mooring line only. In cross-examination, however, Chan was not sure whether the `Sea Supply` was also secured to `14 Ramadhan` at the aft. He said he did not see it because as soon as he had tied `Sea Supply` to `14 Ramadhan` at the bow he went down into the hatch to prepare for the unloading of the drums.
I find as a fact that `14 Ramadhan` was making way outside the Eastern Anchorage when `Sea Supply` came alongside and made fast to it as described by the plaintiff. I reject the evidence of Chan, for there is other evidence that it does not follow because he did not see any waves in the rear of `14 Ramadhan` that `14 Ramadhan` was not making way through the water. As regards the mooring of `Sea Supply`, it is inconceivable that Chan who was on a small vessel did not see `Sea Supply` fastened to `14 Ramadhan` at the stem. Here I recall the evidence of Captain Bird, the expert witness for the plaintiff, who said that even if `14 Ramadhan` had been anchored it would be extremely hazardous for cargo to be transferred from `Sea Supply` to `14 Ramadhan` without having mooring lines fore and aft. Also, on the evidence, I accept the submission of Mr Abdullah for the plaintiff that it is not altogether unusual for a vessel to load whilst it is making way.
Next, on the topic of loading of the drums from `Sea Supply` onto `14 Ramadhan`, it is not in dispute that Chan was in the hatch deck of `Sea Supply`. A derrick line came down from `14 Ramadhan` with a hook at the end of the line. Chan used drum hooks, also described as can hooks, and fastened three drums. Earlier, Chan had put the ring hook which is at one end of the can hooks onto the hook of the derrick line. Chan then signalled to the plaintiff who was on the deck of `Sea Supply` that the drums were ready to be hoisted. The plaintiff in turn signalled a deckhand on the deck of `14 Ramadhan` that `Sea Supply` was ready to have the drums lifted. It is to be inferred, as there is no direct evidence, that the deckhand on `14 Ramadhan` then signalled his winch operator to start the winch for the three drums to be lifted from `Sea Supply`. The evidence is the drums were lifted to about 18 to 20 ft above the deck of `Sea Supply`. At that height, the drums were at about the deck level of `14 Ramadhan`.
As to what happened then, there are two versions. The plaintiff said that when the drums were above `Sea Supply`, the serang gave instructions to release or cut the bow line. He said the instructions were not directed to Chan or himself. He said he went forward from the area of the wheelhouse where he was standing and was proceeding towards the bow when suddenly he was knocked down and became unconscious. According to him, the reason why the serang had given those instructions was because `14 Ramadhan` was by now moving faster than `Sea Supply`.
On the other hand, for the defendants, Chan said that when the drums were above `Sea Supply`, he came out of the hatch. He heard the instructions of the serang, to loosen the bow line. According to him the instructions were given by the serang because the three drums on the derrick line were suspended over `Sea Supply`. He inferred that the serang considered that to be a danger and wanted the bow line loosened so that `Sea Supply` would be away from the overhanging drums.
In considering the two versions, I have reviewed the evidence of the plaintiff and Chan. I have already, for reasons given, found as a fact that `14 Ramadhan` was making way through the water when `Sea Supply` came alongside. In deciding that issue, I accepted the evidence of the plaintiff. Here too I prefer the evidence of the plaintiff to that of Chan. It was the plaintiff and not Chan who went forward to the bow of the ship to cut the mooring line. At that time, one drum fell on the plaintiff and he was injured. I do not accept the evidence of Chan that there was a lapse of five minutes when the drums were suspended above `Sea Supply`. As I view the evidence, I do not think it would have been as long as that. Even the experts cannot say for sure what went wrong that day, but this much is clear. When the drums were at the deck level of `14 Ramadhan`, for some reason, the derrick could not swing the drums onto the deck of `14 Ramadhan`. In the suspended situation, due to the relative movement of the two vessels and other strains, one drum fell down.
The main issue is whether the defendants had provided a safe system of work. The question is: Was the use of can hooks a safe system of work for the loading of drums from the `Sea Supply` onto `14 Ramadhan` that day? Two expert witnesses have given evidence on this issue. The managing director of the defendants also sought to give such evidence. I have heard submissions on the expert evidence. I do not propose to go into the details. There are the reports of Captain Bird and Captain Hong. In arriving at my decision, it is sufficient to say that I accept the firm view of Captain Bird. I quote from his report: 
 
The use of `Can Hooks` ashore, and on board vessels in port, in quiet, protected waters is certainly accepted internationally. However, to use such equipment in the open sea, when the supply vessel and the recipient vessel may well, in fact probably will move vertically up and down relative to each other, the use of such equipment could be hazardous.
 
 
 
Further it would appear that the two vessels were underway and making way through the water. This would increase the possibility of such relative movement. With the probable, relative movement, and the fact that the `hooks` must be held in position, until the strain is taken on the lifting chains, extremely good co-ordination between the persons putting the hooks in position, and the winch operator is absolutely essential. In this case, the deckhand on the `Sea Supply` had to signal somebody on the `l4 Ramadhan`, who in turn would have to signal the winch operator. Not only does such a situation allow for the strain to be taken, released, and taken again, due to the relative movement of the two vessels, but obviously increases the possibility of an accident occurring such as crushed fingers or hands, or a drum slipping out of the hooks as it is lifted.
 
 
 
The gist of Captain Hong`s evidence is that the use of can hooks was a safe method for the operation that day. It is enough that I refer only to one aspect of his evidence. He is of the view that if the vessel was making way, can hooks would be of help during the operation of loading drums because the vessel will be either moving at a very slow speed or stemming the tide, meaning, keeping enough speed for steerage way against the oncoming tidal stream. With due respect to him, I cannot agree with him. It is contrary to the specific instructions that were given to him when he was with Neptune Orient Lines, that masters of vessels of the company were not to collect stores or other things whilst the vessels were making way outside Port Limits. It seems to me that this in itself was considered unsafe by the company.
On a consideration of the whole of the evidence, the conclusion I come to is that it is not a safe system of work to use can hooks to load oil drums outside quiet waters. It is because can hooks were used that the accident occurred. What should have been used that day to load the drums was a net sling.
Miss Loke for the defendants seeks to put the blame on the crew of `14 Ramadhan`. She submits that it was the negligence of the crew of `14 Ramadhan` that was the proximate cause of the accident. Leaving aside that there is no evidence as to what went wrong, why the three drums were suspended above `Sea Supply`, how when held together by can hooks, one of the drums fell down, even if one of the crew of `14 Ramadhan` was negligent in handling the derrick, it does not absolve the defendants from blame. In my view, it is the duty of the defendants, as employers, to take all reasonable steps to ensure the safety of their employees. The defendants should have foreseen that there was a likelihood of mishandling and therefore there was the danger that a drum or drums may fall. In this context, it should also be borne in mind, as Mr Abdullah said, the employees of the defendants were working in a confined space on the deck of `Sea Supply`. If an oil drum was to fall, as it did fall, there was really very little space for the crew on board `Sea Supply` to move away from the danger. The result was that the plaintiff suffered very serious injuries. For these reasons, I find that the defendants are wholly to blame and accordingly I give judgment for the plaintiff on liability.
On damages, I will deal with them in the order in which submissions have been made.
First there is general damages. I will not go through the medical reports on the plaintiff. It is sufficient to say that the plaintiff has suffered tragic injuries. He is now a quadriplegic. He is totally incapable of taking care of himself. As Mr Mohamed bin Abdullah rightly says the plaintiff is completely dependent on others for all his personal needs. Even if a fly were to sit on his nose, he is utterly helpless. It is beyond dispute that his condition will get worse in the near future.
Mr Mohamed bin Abdullah has shown me a table of facts and figures where in England, speaking broadly, damages for quadriplegic are about double that of paraplegics. Reported cases show, says Mr Abdullah that damages for paraplegics are in the region of $90,000 to $100,000. In Suit No 3541 of 1982 Abdul Wahab Ghows J gave a plaintiff who was paralysed from the waist down general damages of $100,000. There is, however, the case of 
 Soh Kheng Seng v Leong Chee Hoong & Anor 
 
 
 [1980] 2 MLJ 
 xcix where Rajah J in 1982 gave the plaintiff, a quadriplegic, $110,000 for loss of amenities, pain and suffering. Mr Mohamed bin Abdullah submits that is on the low side. I accept that submission. In this case, I award for general damages, that is to say, for pain and suffering, and loss of amenities, $180,000.
On the second head, for loss of expectation of life, counsel are agreed on the quantum of $6,500.
The third is costs for future nursing care. At present the plaintiff is in the Chronic Sick Unit of Woodbridge Hospital. There is evidence that when the plaintiff receives his compensation, he will be discharged from Woodbridge Hospital. Having regard to his disabilities, I am satisfied that he will have to be taken care of in a private nursing home. Such a home is available. Mr Jagjit Singh has given evidence that he runs a home for patients like the plaintiff. He is prepared to take the plaintiff. He has given evidence of expenses the plaintiff will have to defray to stay in the nursing home. Mr Mohamed bin Abdullah submits that the plaintiff`s expectation of life would be about nine years. This is something which is very difficult to decide. Even doctors cannot say. Miss Loke for the defendants has, I think, side-stepped the issue by saying that the plaintiff be given a lump sum of $10,000. It is totally unacceptable to me. I must be reasonable and do the best I can. I will give the plaintiff six years and put the cost of nursing in the monthly sum of $1,200. That works out to $122,400.
The fourth is for loss of future earnings. Again, as for expectation of life, I will use the multiplier of six, and having considered the earning capacity and the depressed conditions prevailing in the shipping world, I will use the multiplicand of $350 per month. It gives the sum of $25,200.
As for the last head, actual loss of earnings, I accept the figure of $270 per month. Counsel are agreed that it is for six years. The amount is $19,440.
There is an agreed sum on other special damages of $6,973.
So, there will be judgment for the plaintiff for $360,513 and costs. I make no order for interest; in doing so I follow the decision cited to me of FA Chua J -

s 62(2) Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113)
 
This is an application for an order that the execution of the Warrant to Search No 0172 dated 3 November 1984 (the warrant) be declared invalid and the goods seized pursuant to the warrant be returned to the applicant on the ground that the warrant was not in force on the date of execution. The warrant was issued by the magistrate on that day upon a complaint made to him that an offence under s 3(1) of the Copyright (Gramophone Records and Government Broadcasting) Act (Cap 188) had been committed and the warrant authorized and required the officer named therein to search for articles specified therein at the premises of the applicant, namely, Lucky Music Centre, #B1-59, Lucky Plaza, Singapore 0923 and if found, to produce the same forthwith before the magistrate`s court. The warrant was executed on 8 November 1984 by Detective/Corporal D Rajoo of the Commercial Crime Division accompanied by representatives of the IFPI (South East Asia) Ltd.
Mr Wee on behalf of the applicant submits that under s 62(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113) every warrant to search shall remain in force for a reasonable number of days to be specified in the warrant. In the instant case the warrant did not specify the period in which it was to remain in force. Accordingly, the warrant was in force only on the day it was issued, 3 November 1984 and not subsequently, and hence the execution of the warrant on 8 November 1984 some six days later, was unlawful. He further submits that all the goods seized and taken by the police in the unlawful execution of the warrant should be ordered to be returned to the applicant.
Initially, I felt persuaded by this argument. However, on a careful perusal of the said s 62(2) and on further reflection I find it difficult to sustain such an argument upon a true construction of s 62(2). A warrant duly issued under s 60 or 61 (as the case may be) of the Criminal Procedure Code and in compliance with s 62(1) thereof comes into force upon its issue. And under s 62(2) thereof the warrant is to remain in force for a reasonable number of days to be specified therein. The said s 62(2) is in the following terms: 
 
Every such warrant shall remain in force for a reasonable number of days to be specified in the warrant.
 
 
 
It is significant to note that the subsection does not provide that a warrant shall specify a reasonable number of days in which it is to remain in force. What it provides essentially is the continuation in force of a warrant after its issue, subject only to one limitation: the period therein to be specified in which it is to remain in force must be reasonable. That is the essence of the subsection. As to what number of days is considered to be reasonable must inevitably depend on the circumstances, such as the area in which the search is to be conducted, the articles or goods to be searched and the offence alleged to be committed. The legislature has deemed fit to leave it to the court issuing the warrant to specify, as an administrative act, the number of days in which the warrant is to remain in force. Whatever may be the number of days specified therein, it must meet the test of reasonableness; and the test is an objective one. On a true construction of sub-s (2) of s 62 the requirement to specify the number of days in a warrant is directory and not mandatory, and a failure to comply with such requirement is not fatal to the continuation in force of the warrant after its use.
In the instant case the failure to specify in the warrant the number of days in which the warrant was to remain in force did not render the warrant invalid immediately after the date of its issue. The warrant was valid when it was issued and remained valid for a reasonable number of days, notwithstanding that such number of days was not stated therein. In my view, in the circumstances of this case a period of five to seven days after its issue was undoubtedly reasonable. Accordingly, I hold that the warrant was in force at the date of its execution, namely, 8 November 1984.
At any rate, even if I am persuaded to hold that the warrant was invalid at the date of its execution, I would, nevertheless, not be disposed to make an order for the return of the goods seized to the applicant. The applicant has been charged in the magistrate`s court for offences under s 3(1) of the Copyright (Gramophone Records and Government Broadcasting) Act (Cap 188) and the hearing of such charges is pending. The goods seized are obviously material exhibits for the purpose of the hearing before the magistrate`s court. In these circumstances, I would be disposed to make an order that the exhibits remain where they are.
I therefore dismiss this application.

s 184 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113)
 
This is an application for an order that the two cases, DAC 4151 and 4152 of 1983, presently pending in the subordinate court be transferred to the High Court pursuant to s 184 of the Criminal Procedure Code. In the two cases the applicants are respectively charged for having committed an offence under s 199 read with s 193 of the Penal Code (Cap 103). In each case the charge is as follows: 
 
You, ... are charged that you on or about 3 August 1982 at Singapore made a false statement in a declaration which was by law receivable as evidence before Daljit Singh a Commissioner for Oaths when they stated that
 
 
 
(a) Receipts and Payment Account for the period 1 January 1982 to 16 June 1982,
(b) Income and Expenditure Account for the period 1 January 1982 to 16 June 1982, 
(c) Balance Sheet as at 16 June 1982
 
 
 
drawn up by A Balakrishnan, the Treasurer of the Workers` Party and affirmed by him in an affidavit dated 6 July 1982, exhibited a true and fair view of the transactions and results for the period specified therein and of the state of affairs of the Workers` Party as at the date specified;
 
 
 
which, you did not believe to be true touching a point material to the object for which the declaration was made namely the verification of the Accounts of the Workers` Party and had thereby committed an offence punishable under s 199 read with s 193 of the Penal Code (Ch 103). (Particulars.)
 
 
 
The applicants were first tried on the said charges before the learned senior district judge and at the conclusion of the prosecution`s case were acquitted and discharged. The learned district judge ruled that the declaration jointly made by them on 3 August 1982 was not a declaration which a court of justice was bound or authorised by law to receive as evidence of any fact because it did not contain the following statutory wording: `and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true, and by virtue of the provisions of the Statutory Declarations Act 1835`, which is found in the Schedule to the Statutory Declarations Act (Cap 13). Against that decision the Public Prosecutor appealed, and the appeal was heard before the learned Chief Justice. He held that the declaration was not made in the form prescribed in the Schedule to the Statutory Declarations Act and therefore was not a statutory declaration under the Statutory Declarations Act 1835 of United Kingdom (which is deemed by s 2 of the Singapore Statutory Declarations Act to be in force in Singapore), but nevertheless was a declaration within the meaning of s 199 of the Penal Code, and his ground for so holding is this. On 1 June 1982, the High Court, upon an application by way of execution proceedings made by one Tay Boon Too to recover his costs awarded to him some years ago, by an order appointed the Official Receiver as the receiver to receive the assets of the Workers` Party. Under O 30 of the Rules of the Supreme Court, a receiver so appointed by court is required to submit accounts to the court and each account submitted must be accompanied by an affidavit verifying it, and under O 41 r 5(2) an affidavit sworn for the purpose of interlocutory proceedings may contain statements of information or belief with sources and grounds thereof.
Accordingly, in compliance with O 30, the receiver submitted his accounts to the court for the purpose of passing them verified by his affidavit to which was annexed the declaration jointly made by the applicants as permitted under O 41 r 5(2). As the declaration formed part of the receiver`s affidavit, it was a declaration which the court was authorized by the Rules of the Supreme Court to receive as evidence in the receivership proceedings and was therefore a declaration within the meaning of s 199 of the Penal Code. The learned Chief Judge allowed the appeal by the Public Prosecutor and ordered a fresh joint trial of the applicants before another district judge.
The first ground advanced on behalf of the applicants in support of the application is that it is not open to them to plead before the subordinate court that the declaration was not a declaration within the meaning of s 199 of the Penal Code inasmuch as the subordinate court would be bound by this ruling made by the learned Chief Justice. The High Court, however, would not be so bound and would be in position to entertain a challenge to this ruling. In view of this, the applicants, so they contended, would not have a fair trial before the subordinate court.
In my opinion this ground clearly cannot be sustained. First, plainly the applicants cannot raise the same issue again in the subordinate court. It had been raised and argued before the subordinate court which gave its decision thereon. It then went on appeal to the High Court and was further argued before the learned Chief Justice; he held that the subordinate court erred in law and he ruled that the declaration was a declaration within the meaning of s 199 of the Penal Code. The issue, insofar as the two cases, DAC 4151 and 4152 of 1983, are concerned, had been fully argued and had been decided upon, and such a decision is binding on the applicants; surely the applicants cannot reopen this issue. To say that because of this ruling the applicants would not have a fair trial in the subordinate court is an argument totally untenable and is a misconceived argument. Secondly, in seeking to transfer the two cases to the High Court with a view to raising the same issue again, which had been decided upon after full argument, is, in my view, tantamount to an abuse of court process.
Next, it was argued on behalf of the applicants that the two cases would involve some questions of law of unusual difficulties and on that ground they should be transferred to the High Court. This ground has not been made out to my satisfaction. I am unable to discern any question of law of unusual difficulty which is likely to arise in these cases. Initially, the question, namely, whether the document signed by them jointly was a declaration within the meaning of s 199 of the Penal Code might have posed some difficulty, but that has now been resolved by the decision of the learned Chief Justice.
Lastly, the applicants relied on the fact that they are Chairman and Secretary General respectively of a political party in opposition to the party in power and it is expedient for the ends of justice that they should be tried in the High Court. The fact that they hold such positions in a political party is irrelevant, and again it has not been made out to my satisfaction that an order for transfer ought to be made on that ground.

The appellant, Oliver Hennedige, a dental surgeon and the sole proprietor of Oliver Dental Surgery, was convicted by District Court No 16 of having used the premises at 294 Tanjong Katong Road, Singapore (the premises) as an unregistered factory contrary to and punishable under s 9(1) of the Factories Act 1973 (the Act). He was sentenced to a fine of $1,000 or, in default, one month`s imprisonment. Being dissatisfied with the decision of the learned district judge, the appellant brought this appeal before the High Court.
The sole question canvassed before me was whether the two dental technicians employed on the premises in the manufacture, principally of dentures, were `employed in manual labour` within the meaning of that expression in s 6(1) of the Act. Save and except the sole question in issue in this appeal, the appellant has at all material times conceded that the prosecution had made out all the ingredients of a `factory` so far as the premises were concerned. It was therefore conceded that the prosecution had proved (a) that the two denial technicians were employed; (b) that they were employed in the making of an `article` designated in s 6(1)(a) of the Act; (c) that the work carried on in the premises was carried on by way of trade or for the purposes of gain; and (d) that the premises were premises to or over which the appellant as the employer of the two dental technicians had the right of access or control.
It was also undisputed at the trial that by virtue of s 88(2) of the Act the burden was on the appellant to prove that the premises were not a factory and that the standard of proof required of the appellant was no higher than proving on a balance of probabilities.
At the trial both the prosecution and the defence very properly and sensibly took advantage of the procedure laid down in s 370 of the Criminal Procedure Code and accordingly adduced a large part of the evidence by way of written statements of witnesses, subject to the right of each side to cross-examine the other`s witnesses on their statements. In this way, the prosecution tendered seven statements and the defendant three.
According to the evidence of Mr Soh Hon Poh, a technical officer attached to the Factory Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour who inspected the premises on two occasions, the premises consisted of four surgery rooms and one workroom. The premises had a waiting area which began from the entrance of the surgery, abutting the four surgery rooms and the workroom. The appellant and three other dental surgeons under his employment, including Mr K Kunaratnam, worked in the four surgery rooms. The workroom, which was air-conditioned, was used to make acrylic dentures. The appellant employed two dental technicians, Ang Seng Hock and Kong Chein, a deaf mute, to fabricate dentures.
Inside the workroom were found two Bunsen burners, two electrically powered dental lathes for polishing and grinding, two electrically powered and hand-held trimmers, a bottle of acrylic monomer liquid, a bottle of acrylic polymer powder, a manual press, some handpieces, a couple of wax sheets, plaster models, dentures, flasks and boxes of false teeth. At the back of the premises were found two air receivers. Air lines were connected from the air receivers to the surgery rooms. Several photographs of the premises and of the equipment were tendered in evidence.
Mr K Kunaratnam was one of the dental surgeons working for the appellant at the premises, having joined him in January 1979. In his statement, he stated that when patients required dentures he would obtain the impression using stock trays and the alignment specifications. He would then pass to the dental technician, Ang Seng Hock, the impression model and would also give him instructions on how to work on it. With the models made by Ang, he would fit them on patients. After each fitting, he would also instruct Ang on any changes that had to be made. It appeared that in the case of a partial denture there would be a further fitting using a wax tray.
In his cross-examination, it was elicited that a dental technician would apply his knowledge of non-clinical prosthetic dentistry which is a part of the art and science of designing and fitting artificial substitutes for teeth. It is knowledge which a dental surgeon himself might have to apply if he did not employ a technician and preferred not to send his denture work to an outside laboratory. It also emerged in cross-examination that a dental technician is obliged to cater for a patient`s needs in their functional, aesthetic and even on emotional aspects. But as regards the aesthetic and emotional factors, it has to be stated that from the evidence it is fairly evident that, in those areas, the role of the dental surgeon is unquestionably pivotal. It is the dental surgeon who sees the patient, carries out the trial fittings, orders the changes (if any) and finally gives his professional stamp of approval to the dentures.
For the purposes of interpreting the law in question, it is necessary to describe in greater detail the nature of the work of the dental technicians and the relationship of their work to that of the dentists. Both groups are engaged in that aspect of dentistry (which of course covers a much wider field) which deals with the replacement of missing teeth and tissues in the mouth. It is called `prosthetic dentistry` and is divided into fixed prosthesis and removable prosthesis; the former involves artificial teeth which are fitted on a permanent basis in the mouth, such as inlays, crowns and bridges and the latter involves the designing and fixing of dentures which could be either partial or full.
Additionally, there are two aspects to prosthetic dentistry: clinical and non-clinical. The dental technician, I understand, is only concerned with the latter, although, as I had said earlier, his work must be seen and evaluated in the context of prosthetic dentistry.
Broadly speaking, clinical prosthetics, which is done by the dentist, concerns the preparation of the patient`s teeth for the taking of the necessary impressions and bite registrations. The non-clinical or laboratory aspects follow and, in a sense, respond or adjust to the needs of the earlier stage.
I will now take a closer look at the work of the dental technicians and may conveniently begin with the work involved in the making of partial dentures, that is, dentures in cases where not all teeth are missing. In writing this part of the judgment, I find the descriptions of the appellant`s counsel too apt not to follow the narrative closely. To begin with, the dentist must take a positive impression of the patient`s mouth in plaster of paris. The model, in which the protrusions represent the teeth, is given to the technician together with the dentist`s instructions on the shade of the teeth. For the shape and size of the teeth, the technician has the model protrusions as a guide. Where the partial dentures are substantial, or where there are very few teeth on the model, the technician will design the denture teeth on the basis of the sex of the patient. It appears that male teeth are generally sharper and bigger while female teeth are smaller and dainty.
A dentist has a substantial stock of false teeth manufactured out of plastic or porcelain. In designing a denture, the technician selects a corresponding shape, size and shade out of the stock and if the shade does not match he will mix powder and liquid to obtain the proper shade.
The next step is for the technician to set up the selected and, where necessary, modified teeth on a base of wax. This is a temporary base as the final base is made of acrylic. After adjusting and positioning the teeth on wax, he then puts the model (teeth and all) onto an `articulator` - that is, a model jaw. At this stage of his work, the technician wants to achieve the best `centric` and `accentric` relationships for the dentures - that is, the teeth must bite properly and must not protrude into the cheek area.
The model is thereafter handed to the dentist who will fit and test the model for (a) aesthetics, whether the dentures blend or merge with the teeth; (b) centric and accentric relationships; and (c) overall appearance and compactibility as one cannot have, for example, a petite patient wearing oversized artificial teeth.
Once both patient and dentist are satisfied, the wax model is sent back to the technician with instructions, specific or otherwise, on the questions of `retention` or the method to be used to retain the dentures in the patient`s mouth. The simplest method of retaining the teeth is to clasp the false teeth to the existing teeth by the use of wires. Having found the right clasp, the technician has to ascertain `the correct path of insertion` for the partial dentures. The next step is for the technician to `flask` the model. It is a mechanical process involving acrylic, at the end of which is a semi-finished denture. Excess acrylic is then trimmed by means of the dental motor, smoothened and polished to a fine shine. The polishing is done by using the polisher/lathe and pumice (volcanic ash).
I now turn to the making of full dentures by the technicians. The dentist takes an impression of the patient`s mouth, which is in this case toothless, by the method and material similar to those employed in the case of a partial denture. This `primary impression` gives the dentist and the technician a rough guide of the shape of the patient`s mouth and musculature. The dentist also gives the technician a set of instructions. With the impression and the instructions, the technician has to design a special tray which is then inserted into the patient`s mouth for fitting. Once it fits, an impression mixture is poured into the tray which is inserted once again. The resulting impression (the secondary impression) represents more accurately the patient`s cheek area and the region between the cheek and the gums.
The technician takes this negative impression and, with the use of plaster of paris, obtains a positive impression. From this, a wax base with a bite rim is designed to fit the ridge and/or the palate. The patient is then called in and the dentist registers certain indications on the bite rim that the technician can interpret and translate into reality.
To obtain the bite registration, the dentist has to do the following:
 
 
(a) he trims the upper and lower bite rims so that the original relationships (centric and accentric) are obtained; 
 
(b) he examines the patient`s pupils to ascertain the space between one canine tooth and the other; 
 
(c) he indicates on the rim the number of teeth that should be exposed, bearing in mind that normal persons have, at least, 1 to 15.5 millimetres of teeth expoures; and 
 
(d) he notes down the patient`s preference on (c) above, and the size, shape and shade characteristics which he passes on to the technician.
  
 
 
On receipt of the wax base with bite rim, the technician puts it into the articulator and makes the necessary adjustments. He studies the shape of the jaw - V-shaped, U-shaped or curved - and makes the necessary adjustments. Secondly, he studies the shape of the ridge and palate and ascertains how high or low it is and makes the necessary adjustments.
The technician then sets the teeth into place. The setting of the teeth will depend on the configuration of the upper and lower jaw which, in turn, determines the patient`s bite. The next stage involves curing the teeth so that they blend with the jaw - both in its movements frontwards and backwards and in its side to side movements. Once that is accomplished, the technician has to tackle the question of retention. Most full dentures are placed either a bit forward of or inside the ridge so that it is comfortable to the patient. The technician has to use the articulator again.
In setting the teeth and balancing the retention of the full dentures in a patient`s mouth, the technician has to assist the dentist in achieving the three-fold objectives of aesthetics, function and balance.
Before I leave the description of the work of the technicians, I should mention two other matters. The learned district judge in considering the work of the technicians had summarized the description of the technician, Ang Seng Hock. One gets the perception of the technician so far as the nature of his work is concerned. I have taken almost entirely the description of the processes of the appellant`s counsel in his submission made below. I have done so because it is difficult to improve upon counsel`s description and also because we will now have two descriptions and, I think, in that way one has a fuller picture of the kind of work of the technicians that was carried out in the premises. The second matter I would like to refer to is that there was some separation in the tasks of the two technicians in the premises. Most of the polishing, grinding, trimming, boiling, spreading of powder and paste was done by the deaf mute, Kong Chein. According to Ang Seng Hock, Kong Chein would occasionally make under his supervision simple partial dentures involving a few teeth. Full dentures or difficult partial dentures were made by Ang Seng Hock. It is clear that Kong Chein`s work was more rudimentary. I mention this and also the photographs taken of the premises to convey the fullest possible picture of the premises and the type and different tasks of the two technicians. Perhaps, it is convenient to underline the fact that even Ang Seng Hock had to work under the supervision of the appellant and his dentists and that the more difficult tasks of making crowns, bridges and inlays were farmed out to commercial laboratories.
I now return to the sole question for my determination whether the two technicians were `employed in manual labour` within the meaning of that expression in s 6(1) of the Act. Its English equivalent is in s 175 of the English Factories Act 1961. The meaning of `manual labour` has been discussed in many English cases. They are all looked by the House of Lords in 
 J and F Stone Lighting and Radio 
 
 v 
 
 Haygarth 
 
[1968] AC 157
 (
 Stone`s 
 case). In 
 Stone`s 
 case, the engineer who diagnosed faults in radio and television sets in the circumstances of that case was by a majority of three Law Lords held to be employed in manual labour. It was held that the engineer was employed to do the work with his hands albeit it was work of a nature that required the application of knowledge and therefore some intellectual effort in its performance but it did not involve the exercise of a creative or artistic faculty, nor could it be said that the work involved mental qualities.
 Stone`s 
 case, like the case I have to consider, have given rise to problems of interpretation because they are cases where the work which a person has been employed to do is partly work to be done with the hands and partly work not to be done with the hands. Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in 
 Stone`s 
 case suggested the answer at p 176E. He said in his speech: 
 
There is, I think, a clear and unbroken line of authority to the effect that in such a situation regard must be had to what is the main substantial work which a person is employed to do.
 
 
 
At p 177F in 
 Stone`s 
 case, his Lordship went on to explain further the test so laid down. He said: 
 
If someone is employed partly in manual labour and partly in non-manual labour it will often become necessary to consider whether one part of the employment is merely subsidiary or incidental to another part which is the main or substantial part. There will be questions of fact. They will often be questions which are borderline and difficult to resolve. There are few employments which do not in some way involve some use of the hands in the performance of duties involved. Those who in various capacities are employed to evolve policies, to reach decisions, to direct affairs or to guide and supervise others may all at certain moments need the use of their hands. Yet in so many cases the use of the hands would be of so incidental and subsidiary a nature that on a common sense approach a decision could readily be reached that there was no employment `in manual labour`.
 
 
 
Further light may be shed on the question before me if one looks at the contrasts between manual and non-manual labour which Branson J brought into sharp focus in 
 Appeal of Gardner; Re Maschek 
; 
 Re Tyrrell 
 [1938] 1 All ER 20. The question which arose for consideration in that case was whether under the English Unemployment Insurance Act 1935 the employment of certain modellers was `employment otherwise than by way of manual labour`. Although the statutory words under consideration in that case were differently cast, the core concept of manual labour was not different in principle and therefore the pronouncements of Branson J, which were approved by the majority in 
 Stone 
`s case in a context similar to that in this case, are, in my view, most helpful for our guidance. The work of the modellers was to mould clay into ornaments and other objects according to their employer`s instructions. They were given photographs and working drawings which they were to follow. Branson J held that the substantial nature of their employment was by way of manual labour. He focused on the difference between employments which are substantially for manual labour (whether or not involving heavy physical exertion) and employments of a different nature in which some manual labour is included.
Branson J would not have regarded the employment as one `by way of manual labour` if one finds `a man employed because he has the artistic faculties which will enable him to produce something wanted in the shape of a creation of his own, then obviously, although it involves a good deal of manual labour, he is employed in order that the employer may get the benefit of his creative faculty`.
On the other hand, the learned judge has regarded the employment as `by way of manual labour` the case of one employed because he had the manual dexterity necessary to make him `a suitable tool in his employer`s hand to produce something which (the employer) has in his mind, and which he wants created, and which if he had the manual dexterity and the time, he would create himself`.
Applying these pointers of construction gathered together in 
 Stone`s 
 case, I am of the view that on the facts as found by the learned district judge it is tolerably clear that the two dental technicians in this case were employed in manual labour and, accordingly, the premises where they had worked was a factory. I am in agreement with the learned district judge in his view that the dental technicians had not created any full or partial dentures as creations of their own and that they had produced, albeit with great manual dexterity, such dentures from the impressions made and the instructions given by the dental surgeons who, together with the patients, always had the final say as to the aesthetic, functional and emotional acceptabilities of the dentures.
I have given anxious consideration to the expert evidence given by Professor John Alfred Jansen on the nature of the work of dental technicians. I accept all he has said about the artistic skills and aesthetic qualities required in nonclinical prosthetic dentistry. But what is `manual labour` is a question of law and, in approaching the construction of the words in the Act, it is neither helpful to be emotional nor permissible to allow ourselves to be a prisoner of the colloquial usage and meaning of the words `manual labour`. Dr Kunaratnam`s idea that manual labour connotes someone who uses a shovel is an example of a piece of colloquialism. To hold that the dental technicians were employed in manual labour for the purposes of a piece of social legislation does not, in my view, detract from the skilfullness of the technicians. The application of the Act is not limited to unskilled manual labour. Skilled manual labour is not exempted. As has been seen, in law` an engineering technician has been regarded as employed in manual labour.
Perhaps, it is not inappropriate to remind ourselves that the Act is a piece of social legislation designed to ensure the health, safety and satisfactory conditions of work for our workers. In this context the words of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in 
 Stone`s 
 case at p 179E-180B/C are particularly apposite: 
 
In legislation in relation to those employed in manual labour it would seem reasonable to suppose that the legislature was contemplating those whose work involved to a substantial extent the use of their hands. If manual labour denotes working with the hands I can find nothing in the Act which requires that the work must be heavy work which demands great strength. Some manual labour may require much strength: other manual labour may require but little. Similarly there may be manual labour which requires much knowledge: other manual labour may require but little. Some knowledge may be generally possessed by most people: some knowledge may be specially possessed by a few. Furthermore that which yesterday was the special knowledge of the few may tomorrow be the commonplace knowledge of all. The Act neither prescribes nor defines any varieties of manual labour. If, therefore, someone is employed to work with his hands so that in a realistic way it can be said that such work with his hands forms his main or predominant activity (as opposed to work with his hands which is merely incidental to or accessory to work which is not so done), then he would be employed in manual labour. He would still be so employed even if his work required knowledge or skill or ability. The Act is not limited to unskilled manual labour. There is no exemption for skilled manual labour. Were it so the Act might cease to operate in some of the very places for which its provisions would seem to be appropriate.
 
 
 
For all the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed.

Accused charged with 41 offences involving $3.9m
  –

  – 
Whether amount of bail should be reduced
 
In this application for reduction of bail fixed at $1m in two sureties, the applicant, Low Chit Bah, has 41 charges for abetment of conspiracy to cheat, offences punishable under ss 420 and 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 103). The charges allege that the applicant conspired with others to cheat seven off-shore and merchant banks in Singapore of a sum totalling $3,933,533.20.
Counsel for the applicant submitted that the bail be reduced to $500,000 in two sureties on the ground that there was difficulty in obtaining instructions from the applicant whilst he was in custody.
The application was opposed. There was affidavit evidence that the applicant, a Singapore citizen, had travelled on a Philippines passport, No 0058318, under the name of John L Santo and had successfully entered Singapore on three occasions. This passport has since been confirmed by Interpol to be forged.
The applicant also holds a third passport. This one is a valid passport issued by the Republic of China.
On another aspect, it is affirmed by Mr Vinod Kumar Dube, one of the solicitors for the applicant, that the applicant `is a businessman for the last 20 odd years and is of hitherto unblemished character`. One would have thought that in those circumstances the applicant would have no difficulty in finding persons of good character with sufficient funds to stand bail for him.
On the subject of funds, the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor said that the applicant has recently transferred monies into Singapore from abroad - HK$40,375.55, HK$155.86, and a third transfer of S$1,421.43. Whatever they may be for, the monies are certainly insufficient for bail.
There is always some difficulty in obtaining instructions from an accused person in prison. In this case, it would be that there would be more difficulty. This is, however, only one of the considerations in determining bail and the quantum for the bail. On the facts before me the overriding consideration is that there is every likelihood that the applicant would abscond from Singapore to evade trial if bail is reduced. On this ground alone his application must be refused. In any event, having regard to the serious charges and the amounts involved, I was of the opinion that the bail of $1m in two sureties was not excessive. Accordingly, I dismissed the application.

Whether employers were in breach of statutory duty to take reasonable care for safety of workman
 
The plaintiff is the widow of Sylvester Jasper Monteiro, deceased. She brings this action on behalf of herself and her child as dependants of the deceased under the provisions of the Civil Law Act (Cap 30).
The deceased was employed by the defendants as a project supervisor at their shipyard at Jalan Samulan, Jurong.
The deceased met his death during the course of his employment by the defendants on 5 October 1976. The plaintiff alleged that the deceased`s death was caused by the negligence of the defendants, their servants or agents and/or by breach by the defendants as employers of the deceased to take reasonable care for the safety of the deceased as their servant and/or by breach by the defendants of their statutory duty under the Factories Act 1973.
The facts are these. On 4 October 1976, Barge 222 was brought to the defendants` shipyard for a survey of the damage. The barge had been chartered and handed back to the owner, Prentis Davis. The deceased was assigned to the barge as project supervisor and was in charge of the actual repair work. Abdullah bin Abdul Wahid, the assistant shipyard manager, was in charge of the estimation of the costs of the repair of Barge 222. On 4 October Abdullah surveyed the outside of the barge and did an estimate of the repairs to be done. Davis wanted to have the bottom plate of the barge renewed. Inside the barge where the plate was to be renewed was a tank - Centre Tank No 5.
Abdullah handed the estimate to Davis on 5 October. In the estimate was included an item of costs to the inside of the barge which Abdullah assumed had to be repaired. Davis disputed the estimate and requested a full internal inspection as well. That would involve the inspection of Centre Tank No 5. The idea was that Abdullah and the deceased were to do this together in due course.
Centre Tank No 5 was located in a compartment of the accommodation part (called the portacamp) of the barge. The floorboard of the compartment had to be removed in order to expose the manhole.
According to Davis (DW1) it was in the afternoon of 5 October that the manhole of Centre Tank No 5 was ultimately found. He entered the compartment, in the afternoon. There was work going on in the compartment. There were men with tools preparing to open the manhole. The deceased was there directing the worker in their work. After the manhole was opened Davis and the deceased looked into the tank. The deceased lowered an electric light into the tank and Davis observed that there was a bit of water at the bottom, and there was sign of rusting. Davis asked the deceased, `Where is the blower?` A powered blower is a fan worked by an electric motor and there is a duct in the fan which you can push into the tank to circulate air into the tank to ventilate it. The deceased did not reply and Davis left the compartment to see if there was anyone around with a powered blower. Davis said that when he left the compartment there was no one in the compartment with the deceased. Deceased was alone. Davis went outside the compartment and stood about three metres from the compartment expecting someone to come with the powered blower. Davis heard a yell and he returned to the compartment. He looked down into the tank and saw the deceased lying inside the tank.
Abdullah bin Abdul Wahid (PW4) said in evidence that he knew nothing until 5.30pm on 5 October when he came to know that the manhole cover of Centre Tank No 5 had been removed and that there had been an accident. He went to the barge. He looked into the Centre Tank No 5 and saw the deceased lying at the bottom of the tank. He then went with a charge hand to the workshop to get the powered blower and brought it to the barge. At this stage he looked into the tank again and saw two more bodies. He put on the oxygen tank and mask to try to get down into the tank through the manhole. He found it difficult to get down because of one beam. He then went down a rung or two of the ladder leading to the bottom of the tank and the oxygen tank and mask were lowered to him and he strapped the oxygen tank on his back, put on the mask and went down the ladder. Even before he reached the bottom he felt that the oxygen supply was being cut off. He managed to climb up the ladder four or five steps and he was hauled up and he lost consciousness.
Lee Yew Wah (DW2), an electrician employed by the defendants, said that he reported for duty on 5 October 1976, at 3.45pm. On instructions he went to Barge 222 to install a lamp switch board and a powered blower. He went to the compartment where Centre Tank No 5 was located. There he saw the deceased, Davis, carpenters and fitters. The carpenters were cutting open the board covering the tank and the fitters were waiting to unscrew the manhole. The deceased was directing the carpenters. After he had installed four lights in the compartment he told the deceased that he needed two men to assist him to bring the powered blower from the electrical department to the barge. The deceased said `OK` and he left. When he left the compartment the manhole was yet to be opened. He went back to the electrical department to prepare the powered blower and to wait for the two men. While he was waiting he heard the siren and saw many people rushing towards Barge 222 and he learnt that someone had fallen into the tank.
In all four persons had entered Centre Tank No 5 and collapsed. Three of them died and the fourth person was hospitalized.
At 9pm on 5 October 1976, at the request of the police Phang Sing Eng, Chief Port Chemist, boarded Barge 222 to test the atmosphere of Centre Tank No 5. There was about six to eight inches of water at the bottom of the tank. There was extensive rusting on the surface of the metal plates inside the tank. The chemist tested the atmosphere of the tank for oxygen content and for toxic gases. The oxygen content inside the tank varied from 8% at the bottom of the tank to 9% at the upper part of the tank. No toxic gases were detected. From the results obtained the chemist was of the opinion that `the accident was caused by the gross deficiency of oxygen content inside the tank in the rusting process in which the oxygen combined with the steel to form iron oxide (rust).`
An autopsy was performed on the body of the deceased. There was an abrasion on the deceased`s right forehead 2 x 3 cm and a bruise on the right mid-shin 11/2 x 1 cm. The doctor who performed the autopsy reported that the cause of death was asphyxia and said that the external injuries were consistent with a fall from a low height.
The deceased joined the defendants` shipyard in August 1969, as an Assistant Bench Fitter. He was promoted to Trainee Technician in March 1971, and a Technician on 1 January 1972.
The evidence of Abdullah (PW 4) is that the work of a technician is the same as that of a project supervisor. He is given training on his job and all aspects of safety including the entry into a confined space, the use of oxygen mask, the wearing of safety belts and the proper use of safety equipment and ventilation. He is also told that he is not to go into a tank unless he gets a safety report from the safety promoter.
When a vessel arrives at the yard for repair a project supervisor is assigned to the vessel. He is the person in sole and complete charge of the repair of the vessel. He makes all the decisions including when to enter a confined space. He would liaise with the heads of the various departments regarding the repair jobs that have to be done.
If the work entails entry into a tank or confined space he would, after he had issued the work orders, personally go to the machinery department to get the fitters to open the manhole first. Then he would go to the electrical department to arrange for lighting and powered blower. He will tell them which is the place to be ventilated and where to put up the lights. Then he would go to the safety promoter assigned to the vessel and ask him to check the tanks for gases. The safety promoter would check the tank and submit a report to the project supervisor. The report will state whether the tanks are gas free or not and the ventilation to be provided.
In this instance the gas detection report of the safety promoter (AB14) was addressed to the deceased and signed by Abu Bakar bin Omar, one of the persons who collapsed in Centre Tank No 5 and who subsequently died. The report stated that four tanks port, four tanks starboard and one tank centre were examined and found to be gas-free. The one tank centre that was examined was not Centre Tank No 5 but Centre Tank No 6 and the examination was made on 4 October 1976. The safety promoter expressed the view that the tanks examined were free from flammable vapours and he made the remarks: `confirmed fit for hot works, adequate ventilation should be provided during process.`
The evidence of Abdullah (PW 4) as to the remarks of the safety promoter in AB14 is this: 
 
It means it is safe for workers to do hot works in the tank provided ventilation is provided during the process, `Hot works` means involve use of fire, acetylene torch, etc. If no hot works is to be done it would be safe to go into the tank. If no hot works is to be done you don`t require ventilation, according to this report. Before such a report is issued the safety promoter, as a matter of procedure, would inspect the tank for gas free and ventilating and when he is satisfied then such a report would be issued. ...
 
 
 
This report is really a clearance from the safety promoter that it was safe to enter the tank. This was the procedure in the yard. A project supervisor would not enter a tank without such a report. To my knowledge no project supervisor had entered into a tank without such a report.`
The last person to see the deceased alive was Davis. It is clear that the deceased could not have fallen into the tank accidentally. The deceased must have entered the tank by himself. The other persons who collapsed in the tank had entered the tank later in an attempt to rescue the deceased.
The deceased was a very experienced project supervisor. The deceased knew that he needed the clearance of the safety promoter, that a powered blower was necessary to ventilate the tank and he knew that a powered blower was coming, yet he wilfully entered the tank alone with no one present in the compartment ignoring all the safety procedures adopted by the defendants in connection with entering a freshly opened tank which contained water and where extensive rusting had taken place.
As to the allegation that the employers were in breach of statutory duty, I find on the facts of this case that there is no substance in any of the complaints. Even if there is any substance in any of them there is no evidence that the breach caused or materially contributed to the death of the deceased. (See 
 Bonnington Castings Ltd v 
 
 Wardlaw 
[1956] AC 613

This accident was caused solely by the negligence of the deceased. The claim of the plaintiff is dismissed with costs.

Whether employers were in breach of Factories Act 1973
 
The plaintiff`s claim is for damages for personal injuries and consequential loss suffered by him and caused during the course of his employment by the defendants as a mechanic on the 3 July 1975, by the negligence of the defendants, their servants or agents and/or by breach by the defendants of their duty to the plaintiff as employers of the plaintiff to take reasonable care for the safety of the plaintiff as their servant and/or by breach by the defendants of statutory duty under the Factories Act 1973.
The particulars of breach of statutory duty are: 
 
(a) Failing to provide sufficient training or instructions in the process of work undertaken to the plaintiff ... thereby exposing him to the dangers likely to arise in connection therewith contrary to s 28(1)(a) of the said Act.
(b) Failing to provide adequate supervision by a person who has a thorough knowledge and experience of the said lifting equipment contrary to s 28(1)(b) of the said Act.
 
 
 
The plaintiff was employed as a mechanic by the defendants. The defendants are dealing in mechanical forklifts, their maintenance and repairs. On 3 July 1975 the plaintiff and one Lim Hee Kian, another employee of the defendants, were instructed to repair an electric forklift at the premises of Philips Singapore Pte Ltd at Toa Payoh, Singapore. The repair job was to replace an oil seal of the lifting cylinder.
The lifting equipment consists mainly of three cylinders fitting into one another and by a hydraulic system these cylinders could be extended in a telescopic fashion. At one end of this system is a pin at the top of the second or middle cylinder which fits into an aperture at the lower surface of the upper cross bar of the mast unit called `the third layer` and they are secured by means of a nut. The other end of this system is the lower end of the third or innermost cylinder which is second to the lower cross bar of the mast unit called `the second layer`. These mast units provide the right frame to give structural support in the lifting operation. The first or outermost cylinder in this hydraulic system may be moved up and down along the second cylinder.
At the material time the oil seal situated at the top of the first cylinder was leaking. According to the plaintiff, to replace the oil seal, the nut at the top of the first cylinder has first to be unscrewed and slipped out of the second cylinder, thus exposing the oil seal which then has to be similarly slipped out of the second cylinder. Therefore it is necessary to free the top end of the second cylinder removing the nut from the upper cross bar of `the third layer`. To do this `the third layer` has to be lifted to a certain height in order to have sufficient slack in the hydraulic system to allow the second cylinder to slip out of the aperture of the upper cross bar of `the third layer` and to have sufficient space to allow the nut end of the oil seal to be slipped out. A wooden block is placed between the lower cross bar of `the second layer` and the lower end of `the third layer` to prevent `the third layer` from dropping down when the oil seal is removed.
The plaintiff says that on that day he placed a wooden block and inserted it between `the second and third layers` adjusting `the third layer` to a required height. As a precaution he also inserted a piece of waterpipe in between the upper cross bars of `the second and third layers`. As there was not sufficient space to allow the removal of the oil seal he then raised `the second and third layers`. He then proceeded to replace the oil seal. Having removed the oil seal from the cylinder, he saw the whole hydraulic unit falling away from him. He reached out to retrieve the said unit when suddenly the upper cross bar of `the third layer` dropped and crushed his arms against the upper cross bar of the `second layer` thereby causing him injury.
The particulars of the defendants` negligence are enumerated in the statement of claim and can be summarized into three main heads:
 
 
(1) failing to provide a safe system of work; 
 
(2) failing to provide adequate appliances to enable the plaintiff to carry out the work; 
 
(3) failing to provide any or adequate supervision.
  
 
 
The defendants have set out in their defence the procedure to be followed to effect changes to the oil seal in the lifting cylinder of the forklift truck as follows:
 
 
(1) The carriage of the machine is first raised approximately 25 cm by working the hydraulic system of the truck. 
 
(2) A wooden block is then placed under the carriage. 
 
(3) The pressure from the truck`s hydraulic system is released whereupon the carriage descends and rests on the wooden block. 
 
(4) The chain of the machine is released. 
 
(5) The inner mast of the truck is then raised approximately 25 cm again using the truck`s hydraulic system. 
 
(6) Another wooden block is then placed in the inner side of the immoveable part of the mast to support the raised portion. 
 
(7) Two rollers on the machine are released. 
 
(8) The bolt on top of the machine is then released. This ought to be performed by the employee standing on the lower body of the machine, or from any raised platform or support on the ground. 
 
(9) The cylinder is then lowered by the truck`s own hydraulic system. 
 
(10) Access can now be gained to the oil seal for the necessary changes to be effected on it.
  
 
 
The defendants have put the blame on the plaintiff for the accident. They say that the plaintiff had been fully trained by them to effect changes to the oil seal in the lifting cylinder of the forklift truck and had been instructed to adhere strictly to the procedures and also had relevant experience in the procedures himself. The plaintiff instead of adhering to step (6) of the procedure went against instructions and wedged a piece of piping in between the upper cross bars of the `second and third layers` to substitute the function of support which would otherwise have been provided by the wooden block placed in the inner side of the immoveable part of the mast to support the raised portion. The metal pipe, being an insecure support, slipped, causing the mast to descend onto the hands of the plaintiff while he was working on the changing of the seal. Furthermore the plaintiff did not adhere to step (8) of the operation, whereby the bolt on top of the machine should have been released by the plaintiff from the floor area in front of the forklift. The plaintiff instead climbed on to the overhead guard above the driver`s seat which is behind the carriage, to effect the change of the oil seal.
The plaintiff says that there were two groups of mechanics dealing with forklifts, one dealing with electric forklifts and the other dealing with diesel forklifts. He was in the diesel section and he had never handled an electric forklift except the one in question which caused the injuries to him. The diesel forklift has two layers whereas an electric forklift has three layers. He had not been trained to handle an electric forklift. The plaintiff called Krishnasamy, PW5, to support his contention that he was not trained in handling an electric forklift.
I want to say at the outset that I find the plaintiff and Krishnasamy very unreliable witnesses and that they would lie when it suited them.
The plaintiff had alleged that there are differences between a diesel forklift and an electric forklift and a two-layer forklift and a three-layer forklift. There is, however, ample evidence adduced by the defendants to show (1) that the only difference between a diesel forklift and an electric forklift is only the means of power supply to drive the forklift from point A to point B. In the diesel forklift power is provided by a diesel engine. In an electric forklift power is produced by battery and electric motor; (2) that the hydraulic system in the diesel and electric forklifts is the same; (3) that in replacing an oil seal the operation is the same with a two-layer forklift and a three-layer forklift, and (4) that the plaintiff was trained to repair and maintain either a diesel or an electric forklift.
The defendants have sufficiently established that using a block of wood to support the third layer is a safe method of work and it is a method of work which is accepted in the repairs of forklifts.
The plaintiff knew that the wooden block had to be used to support the third layer and he knew how it was to be used. There is no doubt that if he had done so this accident would not have happened. Instead of which he chose to use his own method of supporting the third layer by using the water pipe. If the plaintiff had been working in front of the forklift, as he had been trained to do, when the third layer was dislodged, his hands would not have been caught by the cross bar of third layer.
Then it is said that the defendants did not supply adequate equipment and appliances. The defendants have adduced ample evidence to show that the defendants provided sufficient equipment. The changing of the oil seal is a simple operation and all mechanics in the defendant company knew how to carry out the operation.
There is no doubt that the cause of the accident was the plaintiff`s total disregard in complying with the system of work devised by the defendants for the oil seal changing operation.
The plaintiff`s claim is dismissed with costs.

s 188 (1) Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113)
 
At Court No 12 of the Subordinate Courts of Singapore on 3 August 1981, 4 August 1981 and 19 August 1981 one Abdul Ghani Mohd Mustapha was charged, inter alia, as follows: 
 
You, Abdul Ghani Mohd Mustapha, are charged that you, on or about 25 November 1977, in Pulau Bukom, Singapore, being an agent, namely, a Civil Supervisor in the employ of Shell Eastern Petroleum (Pte) Ltd Pulau Bukom, Singapore, did corruptly accept from one Tong Fatt Chong, the Managing Director of Tong Brothers Construction (Pte) Ltd for yourself, a gratification of a sum of Five Hundred Dollars ($500) as an inducement for showing favour in relation to your principal`s affairs, by being lenient in your supervision of the works done by Tong Brothers Construction (Pte) Ltd in respect of the Sewerage Treatment Plant`s Project, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(a) of the Prevention on Corruption Act (Cap 104).
 
 
 
You, Abdul Ghani Mohd Mustapha, are charged that you, on or about 5 September 1979 in Pulau Bukom, Singapore, being an agent, namely, a Civil Supervisor in the employ of Shell Eastern Petroleum (Pte) Ltd Pulau Bukom, Singapore, did corruptly accept from one Tong Fatt Chong, the Managing Director of Tong Brothers Construction (Pte) Ltd for yourself, a gratification of a sum of two thousand dollars ($2,000) as an inducement for showing favour in relation to your principal`s affairs, by being lenient in your supervision of the works done by Tong Brothers Construction (Pte) Ltd in respect of the Hydrocracker Control Room Project, and you have hereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Ch 104).
At the conclusion of the trial on 19 August 1981 the said Abdul Ghani Mohd Mustapha was acquitted on all charges.
Following the acquittal the Public Prosecutor appealed to the High Court and at the hearing of the appeal (MA 161/81) before FA Chua J the Public Prosecutor contended, inter alia,that the district judge was wrong in that:
 
 
(a) the learned district judge erred in law and in fact in failing to consider or adequately consider that the evidence adduced by the prosecution at the close of its case had established each essential element in the charge; that applying the test laid down by Lord Diplock in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
`scase ( 
 
 [1980-1981] SLR 73 
), a prima facie case had been established and therefore the respondent`s defence ought to have been called. 
 
(b) that the learned district judge erred in law: 
 
(i) in not calling upon the respondent for his defence when he had not found any of the essential elements of the charge lacking in the prosecution`s case; 
 
(ii) in disregarding and ignoring the principle laid down in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
`scase that, a judge as a decider of facts must keep an open mind as to the accuracy of any of the prosecution`s witnesses until the defence has tendered such evidence. 
 
(c) that the learned district judge erred in law in holding that 
 Ong Kiang Kek 
`scase (
 
 
[1970] 2 MLJ 283
 ) continues to be binding on him when that case has been overruled by 
 Haw Tua Tau 
,which was a decision of the Privy Council, and in so doing, he has ignored the doctrine of stare decisis.
  
 
 
FA Chua J accepted the submissions of counsel for the appellant and held the view that the Privy Council`s interpretation of s 188(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code in 
 Haw Tua Tau v 
 
 PP 
 is not obiter dicta and that the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Ong Kiang Kek 
 has been overruled. FA Chua J decided that the district judge was bound by what the Privy Council had laid down in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 and that he should have called the defence of the respondent on the two charges.
FA Chua J accordingly allowed the appeal and reserved the following two questions for the decision of this court:
 
 
(a) Whether the degree of proof required at the close of the prosecution case by Lord Diplock (in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
) is obiter dicta or ratio decidendi. 
 
(b) Whether the judicial construction given to s 172(f) (
 sic 
) of the Criminal Procedure Code in 
 Ong Kiang Kek v 
 
 PP 
by the Court of Criminal Appeal by virtue of the legislature having repeated them without alteration in the subsequent statute, ie Act 10, is deemed to have been approved by the legislature thereby precluding the Privy Council from giving a different interpretation.
  
 
 
 
 
 Question (a) 
 
 
 
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council dealt with three appeals in their judgment. The three appeals were 
 Haw Tua Tau v 
 
 PP, Tan Ah Tee v 
 
 PP 
and 
 Low Heng Seng v 
 
 PP. 
In these appeals the Board gave special leave to appeal to enable the appellants to raise the question of the inconsistency of the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act 1976 (Act No 10 of 1976) with art 9(1) of the Constitution of Singapore which provides that `No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law`.
The only question argued before the Board was the contention, common to all three appellants, that the amendments made to the Criminal Procedure Code by Act No 10 of 1976 were inconsistent with art 9(1) of the Constitution and, being inconsistent, were rendered void by art 4. The whole foundation of the argument on which that contention was based was the interpretation that the Board had placed on the expression `law` in the context of art 9(1) in the case of 
 Ong Ah Chuan v PP 
 
 
 [1980-1981] SLR 48 
. The Board rejected that contention and gave their reasons in a judgment delivered by Lord Diplock.
The passage in the Board`s judgment relied upon by the three appellants reads: 
 
In a Constitution founded on the Westminster model and particularly in that part it that purports to assure to all individual citizens the continued enjoyment of fundamental liberties or rights, references to `law` in such contexts as `in accordance with law`, `equality before the law`, `protection of the law` and the like, in their Lordships` view, refer to a system of law which incorporates those fundamental rules of natural justice that had formed part and parcel of the common law of England that was in operation in Singapore at the commencement of the Constitution. It would have been taken for granted by the makers of the Constitution that the `law` to which citizens could have recourse for the protection of fundamental liberties assured to them by the Constitution would be a system of law that did not flout those fundamental rules. If it were otherwise it would be misuse of language to speak of law as something which affords `protection` for the individual in the enjoyment of his fundamental liberties and the purported entrenchment (by art 5) of art 9(1) and 12(1) would be little better than a mockery.`
 
 
 
Lord Diplock in the Board`s judgment in the case of 
 Haw Tua Tau 
after quoting the above passage said: 
 
The subsequent paragraphs of the judgment made clear their Lordships` view that neither art 9(1) nor 12(1) called for the perpetuation of the rules of criminal procedure or of evidence as they existed in Singapore when the Constitution came into force on 16 September 1963. So no amendment to the Constitution is needed to empower the legislature of Singapore (the President and Parliament) to enact whatever laws it thinks appropriate to regulate the procedure to be followed at the trial of criminal offences by courts in Singapore; subject only to limitation that so long as art 9(1) remains unamended such procedure does not offend against some fundamental rule of natural justice. It must not be obviously unfair. So the question for their Lordships is not whether Act No 10 of 1976 made a significant alteration to the disadvantage of accused persons in the procedure previously followed in criminal trials in Singapore (as indisputably it does), but whether the consequence of the alteration is a procedure for the trial of criminal offences that is contrary to some fundamental rule of natural justice.
 
 
 
... The only rule alleged to be the fundamental rule of natural justice, against which the appellants claim Act No 10 of 1976 offends, is the so-called privilege against self incrimination as expressed in the Latin maxim 
 nemo debet se ipsum prodere. 
It was submitted by the appellants that s 188(2) read with s 188(1) had the practical effect of compelling the appellants when called upon to enter their defence, to give evidence on oath or affirmation and thus be subject to hostile cross-examination by the prosecution so that the procedure prescribed by s 188(2) infringes a fundamental rule of natural justice. Section 188(1) and (2) reads: 
 
(1) When the case for the prosecution is concluded the court, if it finds that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction, shall record an order of acquittal or, if it does not so find, shall call on the accused to enter on his defence.
 
 
 
 
(2) Before any evidence is called for the defence, the court shall tell the accused that he will be called upon by the court to give evidence in his own defence and shall tell him in ordinary language what the effect will be if, when so called upon, he refuses to be sworn or affirmed, and thereupon the court shall call upon the accused to give evidence.
  
 
 
The submission was based on the argument that trial judges relying on the case of 
 Ong Kiang Kek v 
 
 PP, 
have generally interpreted s 188(1) to mean that the trial court, at the close of the case of the prosecution, has to determine whether or not the prosecution`s evidence, if unrebutted, has established the case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and if, at that stage, it has not been so established, the trial court must acquit the accused.
Lord Diplock, to meet this argument, considered ss 188(1) and (2) and 189(1) to (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, of which ss 188(2) and 195(1) to (3) were inserted by Act No 10 of 1976. First, he dealt with the interpretation of s 188(1) at length: 
 
... because in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Singapore in the case of 
 Ong Kiang Kek v
 
 PP
there are certain passages that seem, upon a literal reading, to suggest that unless at the end of the prosecution`s case the evidence adduced has already satisfied the judge beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty, the judge must order his acquittal. But this can hardly have been what that court intended, for it ignores the presence in the section of the crucial words `if unrebutted`, to which in other passages the court refers, and it converts the hypothetical question of law which the judge has to ask himself at that stage of the proceeding: `If I were to accept the prosecution`s evidence as accurate would it establish the case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt?` Into an actual and quite different question of fact: `Has the prosecution`s evidence already done so?` For the reasons already discussed their Lordships consider this to be an incorrect statement of the effect of s 188(1).
 
 
 
The reasons which the Board gave for its opinion that if one gives a literal reading to certain passages in the judgment in the 
 Ong Kiang Kek 
case then those passages certainly are incorrect statement of the effect of s 188(1) are set out in the following passages in Lord Diplock`s judgment (at pp 51-52): 
 
Section 188(1) states the conditions precedent to the right and duty of the judge of trial to call on the accused to enter on his defence. It takes the form of a double negative: if the court does not find that no case against the accused has been made out which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. For reasons that are inherent in the adversarial character of criminal trials under the common law system, it does not place upon the court a positive obligation to make up its mind at that stage of the proceedings whether the evidence adduced by the prosecution has by then already satisfied it beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty. Indeed it would run counter to the concept of what is a fair trial under that system to require the court to do so.
 
 
 
The crucial words in s 188(1) are the words `if unrebutted`, which make the question that the court has to ask itself a purely hypothetical one. The prosecution makes out a case against the accused by adducing evidence of primary facts. It is to such evidence that the words `if unrebutted` refer. What they mean is that for the purpose of reaching the decision called for by s 188(1) the court must act on the presumptions (a) that all such evidence of primary fact is true, unless it is inherently so incredible that no reasonable person would accept it as being true: and (b) that there will be nothing to displace those inferences as to further facts or to the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation. Whoever has the function of deciding facts on the trial of a criminal offence should keep an open mind about the veracity and accuracy of recollection of any individual witness, whether called for the prosecution or the defence, until after all the evidence to be tendered in the case on behalf of either side has been heard and it is possible to assess to what extent (if any) that witness`s evidence has been confirmed explained or contradicted by the evidence of other witnesses.
The proper attitude of mind that the decider of fact ought to adopt towards the prosecution`s evidence at the conclusion of the prosecution`s case is most easily identified by considering a criminal trial before a judge and jury, such as occurs in England and occurred in Singapore until its final abolition in capital cases in 1969. Here the decision-making function is divided: questions of law are for the judge, questions of fact are for the jury. It is well established that in a jury trial at the conclusion of the prosecution`s case it is the judge`s function to decide for himself whether evidence has been adduced which, if it were to be accepted by the jury as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence: for what are the essential elements in any criminal offence is a question of law. If there is no evidence (or only evidence that is so inherently incredible that no reasonable person could accept it as being true) to prove any one or more of those essential elements, it is the judge`s duty to direct an acquittal, for it is only upon evidence that juries are entitled to convict; but, if there is some evidence, the judge must let the case go on. It is not the function of the jurors, as sole deciders of fact, to make up their minds at that stage of the trial whether they are so convinced of the accuracy of the only evidence that is then before them that they have no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. If this were indeed their function, since any decision that they reach must be a collective one, it would be necessary for them to retire, consult together and bring in what in effect would be a conditional verdict of guilty before the accused had an opportunity of putting before them any evidence in his defence. On the question of the accuracy of the evidence of any witness jurors would be instructed that it was their duty to suspend judgment until all the evidence of fact that either party wished to put before the court had been present ed. Then and then only should they direct their minds to the question whether the guilt of the accused had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.
In their Lordships` view the same principle applies to criminal trials where the combined roles of decider of law and decider of fact are vested in a single judge (or in two judges trying capital cases). At the conclusion of the prosecution`s case what has to be decided remains a question of law only. As decider of law, the judge must consider whether there is some evidence (not inherently incredible) which, if he were to accept it as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence. If such evidence as respects any of those essential elements is lacking, then, and then only, is he justified in finding `that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction`, within the meaning of s 188(1). Where he has not so found, he must call upon the accused to enter upon his defence, and as decider of fact must keep an open mind as to the accuracy of any of the prosecution`s witnesses until the defence has tendered such evidence if any, by the accused or other witnesses as it may want to call and counsel on both sides have addressed to the judge such arguments and comments on the evidence as they may wish to advance.
Lord Diplock then considered the argument of the three appellants based on the contention that the procedure for which s 188(2) provides, of calling on the accused at the conclusion of the prosecution`s case to give evidence and informing him of the consequences of a refusal to do so, has the practical effect of putting the accused under a compulsion to give evidence no less than if he were compelled by law to do so, despite his being told in the course of the standard allocution that he is not. The argument was that fundamental rules of natural justice are concerned with the practical effect upon the defendant of the procedure followed, not with its legal technicalities; and if the maxim 
 nemo debet se ipsum prodere 
 enshrines a fundamental rule of natural justice, the procedure prescribed by s 188(2) infringes it. The Board found no substance in the appellants` argument in the following passage (at p 53): 
 
There is, however, in their Lordships` view, no substance in the appellants` argument. The accused is not compelled in law to give evidence on his own behalf. Section 195(3) says so, and s 188(2) requires that the accused be told so. Even before s 195(1) withdrew the former option to make an unsworn statement, instead of going into the witness box to give evidence, the accused, if he were properly advised by counsel, would be aware that adverse inferences might well be drawn if he failed to go into the witness box; the strength of those inferences depending upon the nature of the evidence that had been adduced against him in the particular case. This in itself would be a strong inducement to an accused to give evidence, particularly if he were innocent. The only added inducement consequent on the removal of the option is the withdrawal of the hope that he can get away with a story the truth of which cannot be tested by cross-examination. The inferences that the court may draw from his failure to testify are not enlarged by the amendments to the Code; they are limited, as they have always been, to such inferences as appear to the decider of fact to be proper in the particular case having regard to all its circumstances.
 
 
 
From the passages (which we have set out) in the judgment delivered by Lord Diplock we are of the opinion that the interpretation of s 188(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code was necessary for the decision of the case of 
 Haw Tua Tau v 
 
 PP. 
 Question (b) 
In the case of 
 Ong Kiang Kek v 
 
 PP 
the question before the Court of Criminal Appeal involved the interpretation of s 177C of the Criminal Procedure Code which is materially similar to s 172(f), now renumbered s 179(f). Section 177C was renumbered s 179(f). Section 177C was renumbered s 181 in the Criminal Procedure Code, Ch 113 at vol III of the 1970 Revised Edition of the Statutes of the Republic of Singapore which came into force on 15 April 1971. By Act 10 of 1976, it was again renumbered as s 188(1) and it so appears in the present Reprint of the Criminal Procedure Code which was published on 31 July 1980.
We answered Question (b) in the negative because, in our opinion, the re-enactment of s 177C did not preclude the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council from giving an interpretation which is different from the interpretation given by the Court of Appeal in 
 Ong Kiang Kek`s 
 case (see 
 R v

The appeal arises from a claim of Mohamed bin Yeanikutty (the appellant) against Far East Truck Incorporated Manufacturing (Pte) Ltd (the respondents) for damages for personal injuries and consequential loss suffered by him and caused during the course of his employment by the respondents as a mechanic on 3 July 1975 through the negligence of the respondents, their servants or agents and/or breach by the respondents of their duty to the appellant as employers of the appellant to take reasonable care for the safety of the appellant as their servant and/or breach by the Respondents of statutory duty under the Factories Act 1973.
The particulars of breach of statutory duty are:
 
 
(a) failing to provide sufficient training or instructions in the process of work undertaken to the appellant ... thereby exposing him to the dangers likely to arise in connection therewith contrary to s 28(1)(a) of the said Act; 
 
(b) failing to provide adequate supervision by a person who has a thorough knowledge and experience of the said lifting equipment contrary to s 28(1)(b) of the said Act.
  
 
 
The appellant was employed as a mechanic by the respondents. The respondents were dealing in mechanical forklifts, their maintenance and repairs. On 3 July 1975, the appellant and one Lim Hee Kian (Lim) another employee of the respondents, were instructed to repair an electric forklift at the premises of Philips Singapore Pte Ltd at Toa Payoh Singapore. The repair job was to replace an oil seal of the lifting cylinder.
According to the appellant, Lim was supposed to do the repairs and he was to assist him. He said that he had no experience with electric forklifts which has three layers, whereas the diesel forklifts which he usually handled had two layers. As stated in the statement of claim and supported by the evidence, the lifting equipment of an electric forklift consists mainly of three cylinders fitting into one another and by a hydraulic system these cylinders could be extended in a telescopic fashion. At the end of this system a pin at the top of the second or middle cylinder which fits into an aperture at the lower surface of the upper cross bar of the mast unit called `the third layer` and they are secured by means of a nut. The other end of this system is the lower end of the third or innermost cylinder which is secured to the lower cross bar of the mast unit called `the second layer`. These mast units provide the right frame to give structural support in the lifting operation. The first or outermost cylinder in this hydraulic system may be moved up and down along the second cylinder.
At the material time the oil seal situated at the top of the first cylinder was leaking. According to the appellant, to replace the oil seal, the nut at the top of the first cylinder has first to be unscrewed and slipped out of the second cylinder, thus exposing the oil seal which then has to be similarly slipped out of the second cylinder. Therefore it is necessary to free the top end of the second cylinder by removing the nut from the upper cross bar of `the third layer`. To do this, `the third layer` has to be lifted to a certain height in order to have sufficient slack in the hydraulic system to allow the second cylinder to slip out of the aperture of the upper cross bar of `the third layer` and to have sufficient space to allow the nut end of the oil seal to be slipped out. A wooden block is placed between the lower cross bar of `the second layer` and the lower end of `the third layer` to prevent `the third layer` from dropping down when the oil seal is removed.
The appellant said that on that day after placing the wooden block he lowered the third layer so that it rested on the block of wood. Then Lim asked him to go on top of the driver`s seat to remove the nut at the top layer. While he was on top of the forklift Lim removed the chains of the machine and loosened a nut by using the handle of a hammer. Then Lim handed to him a screw driver, a special spanner and an iron pipe. The appellant then unscrewed the nut at the top with the special spanner after which he wedged the iron pipe between the second and third layers to prevent the third layer from falling down in case the block of wood as the bottom gave way. After that the appellant removed the nut completely.
The appellant then described how he proceeded to replace the oil seal. Having removed the oil seal from the cylinder he saw the whole hydraulic unit falling away from him. He reached out to retrieve the said unit when suddenly the upper cross bar of the third layer dropped and crushed his arms against the upper cross bar of the second layer thereby causing him injury.
The particulars of the respondents` negligence as set out in the statement of claim may be summarized as follows:
 
 
(1) failing to provide a safe system of work; 
 
(2) failing to provide adequate appliances to enable the appellant to carry out the work; and 
 
(3) failing to provide any or adequate supervision.
  
 
 
In their defence, the respondents set out the procedure to be followed to effect changes to the oil seal which can be found in para 7 of the Amended Defence.
The respondents put the blame on the appellant for the accident. They said that the Appellant had been fully trained by them to effect changes to the oil seal in the lifting cylinder of the forklift truck and had been instructed to adhere strictly to the procedures and also had the relevant experience in the procedures himself. The appellant instead of adhering to step (6) of the procedure went against instructions and wedged a piece of piping in between the upper cross bars of the `second and third layers` to substitute the function of support which would otherwise have been provided by the wooden block placed in the inner side of the immovable part of the mast to support the raised portion. The iron pipe being an insecure support, slipped causing the mast to descend onto the hands of the appellant while he was changing the oil seal. Furthermore, according to the respondents, the appellant did not adhere to step (8) of the operation, whereby the bolt on top of the machine should have been released by the appellant from the floor area in front of the forklift. The appellant instead climbed on to the overhead guard above the driver`s seat behind the carriage, to effect the change of the oil seal.
The appellant denied knowledge of the procedures enumerated by the respondents in para 7 of their amended defence. The learned trial judge said that he found the Appellant was an unreliable witness and would lie when it suited him. He said that there was ample evidence adduced by the respondents to show that the appellant was trained to repair and maintain either a diesel or an electric forklift. We accept the trial judge`s findings of fact in this connection.
Lim did not give evidence in this case. But, according to para 6 of the amended defence, as the appellant had only one wooden block with him, Lim instructed the appellant not to proceed accordingly. The appellant disregarded these instructions and went on nevertheless to attempt to change the oil seal. Where did the respondents get this story from? This was not what Lim told Mr Tan Chin Seng, respondents` solicitor, on 3 July 1975. Mr Tan`s report which is marked AB1 is as follows: 
 
On the morning of 3 July 1975 at about 10am Mohammed Bin Yeanikutty and Lim Hee Kian, mechanics in the employ of Fetim (Pte) Ltd visited the Philips factory at Lorong 1, Toa Payoh, Singapore, for the purpose of repairing a forklift truck supplied by their employers, Fetim (Pte) Ltd.
 
 
 
The visit by the abovementioned employees was in answer to a request by Philips Pte Ltd to effect relevant repairs on the truck. On this occasion, both the above employees were attempting to change an oil seal in a cylinder of the forklift truck.
In order to effect the operation, Mohammed Bin Yeanikutty climbed onto the overhead guard of the forklift truck whereby he would be in a position to uplift what was described as the `mask` of the machine. The forklift truck was then in the normal upright position.
On lifting the `mask` the cylinder located within the housing in the centre of the forklift would then be raised thereby exposing the oil seal.
The elevated mask and cylinder were then supported in their temporary positions by two wooden blocks placed at the base of the machine.
Mohammed bin Yeanikutty from his position on the overhead guard, then placed his hands on the relevant part of the cylinder below the mask in order to change the oil seal.
Some time at this stage, the makeshift wooden supports at the bottom of the forklift truck slipped or gave way and the mask descended onto the hands of Mohammed bin Yeanikutty.
It is believed at this stage that the hands of the above employee were almost completely severed. He had to be extricated from the machine and sent to Toa Payoh General Hospital where he is presently warded. The exact extent of his injuries was not revealed at the time of this report.
The above account was given by Mr Lim Hee Kian, the other employee of Fetim (Pte) Ltd who was working jointly on the machine at the relevant time. Mr Lim states that he was the only eye-witness to the incident and that he was at the base of the machine at the time the accident occurred.
This account of the accident was told to and recorded by Mr Tan Chin Seng, solicitor acting on behalf of Fetim (Pte) Ltd on 3 July 1975.
Lim, in the statement, was reported to have said that two wooden blocks were placed at the base of the machine. Even the respondents did not believe this. If two wooden blocks had been used this accident would not have happened. We are of the view that Lim was lying to avoid responsibility for the mishap. We are satisfied that Lim was not just standing around while the appellant was repairing the forklift alone and unaided. They went there together and were repairing the machine together and if the appellant was negligent, as the respondents averred, then Lim was just as negligent, if not more so, in view of Lim`s familiarity with electric forklifts.
Lim was not called by the respondents to give evidence although he had been subpoenaed by them. Apart from the appellant, Lim was the only other person who could have assisted the court to determine what actually happened. We are satisfied that the respondents did not call Lim to give evidence because they knew that his testimony would not help their case. If Lim was negligent the respondents would be vicariously liable for his negligence because Lim was the respondents` servant and his negligence in the course of his employment caused injuries to his fellow workman. The learned trial judge plainly failed to apply his mind to these matters. He did not consider the part played by Lim in the repair job at all.
In 
 Williams v 
 
 Port of Liverpool Stevedoring Co Ltd & Anor 
 
[1956] 1 WLR 551
, the plaintiff who was a member of a gang of six workmen employed by a firm of master stevedores, sustained injuries when a number of bags of sodium carbonate, which formed the cargo of a barge being unloaded by the gang, fell upon him. The collapse of the bags was due to their instability arising from the method of unstowing adopted by the gang contrary to the express and repeated instructions of the hatch foreman in charge and others. The plaintiff, who was of equal status with his fellow workmen in the gang, was himself expressly instructed to deal with the cause of the instability of the bags and warned of the danger they presented; but he ignored the instructions and he and the other members of the gang continued, in the absence of the hatch foreman, to unstow the cargo by their own method instead of in the manner in which they were instructed. It was held in this case that there was a duty owed to the plaintiff by each member of the gang to take reasonable care in the actual work of unstowing and in the method of work employed, and accordingly, even though the plaintiff tacitly consented to the method of unstowing contrary to instructions, the employers were liable vicariously for the negligence of his fellow workmen.
In the present case we find the respondents vicariously liable for the negligence of Lim, another employee of theirs participating in this repair job. We also find that the Appellant was contributorily negligent and his share of the responsibility for the accident was one-half. Accordingly the appeal is allowed with costs here and in the court below. As the sum of $85,000 was agreed for special and general damages on a 100% basis, the damages recoverable by the Appellant would be $42,500.

s 44(1) Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 15)
 
This was an appeal against the refusal of the learned Chief Justice to reserve for the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal some nine questions said to be questions of law of public interest which arose in the course of six magistrate`s appeals which were determined by the Chief Justice. The appeal turned on the statutory construction of s 44(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 15) (the Act) under which it was contended on behalf of the Public Prosecutor that we had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal on the ground that the learned Chief Justice in refusing to reserve the questions of law under s 60(1) of the Act was exercising the appellate criminal jurisdiction of the High Court or that such a decision of refusing to reserve the questions of law was not `
 a decision made by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction 
` (emphasis is added) within the meaning of that critical expression in s 44(1) of the Act. At the conclusion of arguments on this preliminary point of law, which had to be dealt with before, if at all, the hearing of the merits could be embarked upon, we were unanimously of the view that we had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal which we accordingly dismissed. We now give our reasons.
The facts and the course of the prosecution, trials and convictions of the appellants before and by the district court and by the High Court in exercise of its appellate criminal jurisdiction may be stated within a reasonably brief compass. Central to the proceedings were (a) the appointment on 1 June 1982 by the High Court of a receiver to receive the assets of the Workers` Party, a political party of which the appellants were respectively the Chairman and the Secretary General, which was an execution proceeding invoked by a judgment creditor to recover the costs then owed by the Workers` Party; and (b) the appellants` disposal of the proceeds of three cheques for the sums of $2,000, $200 and $400 which were all drawn in favour of the Workers` Party as the payee in the six months preceding the appointment of the receiver but which, though the property of the Workers` Party, were not paid into the bank account of the Workers` Party but were either endorsed over or altered in one case by the drawer in circumstances in which the Workers` Party did not receive any consideration for the proceeds nor were the transactions reflected in the accounts of the Workers` Party.
In the course of the receivership, the receiver submitted his accounts to the High Court for the purpose of passing them. To his affidavit in support was annexed a declaration jointly made by the appellants as permitted by O 41 r 5(2) of the Rules of Supreme Court 1970. But the declaration was not made in the form prescribed in the Schedule to the Statutory Declaration Act 1835 which by s 2 of the Singapore Statutory Declarations Act was deemed to be in force in Singapore. Briefly summarized for present purposes, the appellants` joint declaration stated that the receipts and payment account and the income and expenditure account both for the periods between 1 January 1982 and 16 June 1982 and the balance sheet as at 16 June 1982 of the Workers` Party, which were drawn up by the Treasurer of the Workers` Party and exhibited in the High Court, reflected `a true and fair view of the transactions and results for the period specified therein and of the state of affairs of the Workers` Party as at the date specified`.
The $2,000 cheque, as endorsed, was delivered by the first appellant to a firm of solicitors in February 1982 and its proceeds were utilized to pay a judgment debt, not of the Workers` Party, but of one Mdm Chiew, who was the mother of the second appellant`s election agent in the December 1980 General Elections. The $200 cheque, as endorsed, was paid by the first appellant into his personal account with the Bank of America. The $400 cheque, as altered by the drawer, was encashed by an unknown person. The fact of the receipts of these cheques did not appear in any of the accounting records of the Workers` Party nor were they referred to in the aforesaid accounts prepared by the Treasurer of the Workers` Party.
In the event, the appellants were arraigned before the district court in a joint trial to answer to five charges. In two charges, they were separately charged for having knowingly made a false statement in a declaration which was by law receivable as evidence and punishable under s 199 read with s 193 of the Penal Code. In the other three charges, at the heart of which were the proceeds of the three cheques, the appellants were jointly charged that in furtherance of a common intention of them both they had fraudulently delivered without adequate consideration to third parties the property of the Workers` Party in the three cheques knowing it to be likely that they would thereby prevent the distribution of the property amongst the creditors of the Workers` Party, which were offences punishable under s 421 read with s 34 of the Penal Code.
At the conclusion of the trial in the district court, the learned senior district judge acquitted and discharged both appellants on the false declaration charges and the two charges relating to the $2,000 cheque and the $200 cheque. But the learned district judge convicted the appellants on the charge relating to the $400 cheque and sentenced each to pay a fine of $1,000.
The Public Prosecutor in five magistrate appeals appealed to the High Court against the acquittals and the sentences. Both the appellants appealed to the High Court against their convictions. The appeals were heard by the learned Chief Justice who (a) ordered a new trial before another district judge in respect of the charges relating to the false declaration; (b) found the appellants guilty in respect of the charges relating to the $2,000 cheque and the $200 cheque and sentenced each of them to pay a fine of $1,000 in respect of each charge and in default to serve imprisonment for a period of three weeks; and (c) dismissed the appeal of the Public Prosecutor against the inadequacy of the fines imposed. In doing so, the learned Chief Justice set out his reasons in a long judgment.
In late April this year, the appellants by Criminal Motion No 23 of 1985 moved the High Court `for an order that the decisions of the High Court on the question(s) of law particularised in the affidavit in support be reserved for the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 60 of the Act`. The material paragraph of the second appellant`s affidavit set out the questions of law in the following terms: 
 
(i) Magistrate`s Appeals Nos 8 and 9 of 1984
 
 
 
 
(a) Whether the declaration by the respondents was a declaration within the scope and meaning of s 199 of the Penal Code; 
 
(b) Whether Mr Daljit Singh was authorised by law to receive the said declaration from the respondents.
  
 
 
(ii) Magistrate`s Appeals Nos 11 and 13 of 1984
(a) Whether the property in the cheques for $2,000 and $200 was in the Workers` Party before the cheques were negotiated; 
(b) On whom was the onus to prove the property of the cheques in the Workers` Party and whether such onus was discharged by the party on whom it lay on the whole of the evidence adduced before the court; 
(c) Whether the said onus shifted at any time from one party to the other, alternatively, whether there was any onus on the respondents at any stage of the trial to prove that the property in the said cheques was not in the Workers` Party; 
(d) Whether on the whole of the evidence adduced before the court the Prosecution had discharged the onus on it to satisfy the court that the respondents fraudulently transferred the property in the said cheques assuming the property in the said cheques was in the Workers` Party; 
(e) Whether the High Court was right and justified on well established principles of law in disturbing the very careful findings of fact made by the trial judge before acquitting the respondents on the charges.
 
 
 
(iii) Magistrate`s Appeals Nos 14 and 15 of 1984
(a) Whether the property in the cheque for $400 remained with the Workers` Party after the end of May 1982 and in particular was it so on 2 July 1982 when the proceeds on the cheque were realised; 
(b) Whether the whole of the evidence adduced before the court was capable in law to support the finding of a common intention between the appellants.
 
 
 
As required by the terms of s 60(1) of the Act, the appellants` application was heard before the learned Chief Justice who, at the conclusion of the hearing of the criminal motion, dismissed it. The learned Chief Justice expressed the opinion that none of the questions set out were questions of law and that, in any event, on the assumption that they were questions of law he was of the opinion that none of them were questions of `public interest` within the meaning of that expression in s 60(1) of the Act.
The issue in this appeal is whether the decision of the learned Chief Justice in refusing to reserve the questions of law is appealable or is final. This question turns on the true meaning of 15 words, namely, `any decision made by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction` in s 44(1) of the Act which sets out our jurisdiction as the Court of Criminal Appeal and which has been in its present terms since the enactment of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Act (No 58 of 1973) which came into operation on 11 February 1974: see 
 Gazette 
No S41 of 1974. The true meaning of the critical 15 words can be gleaned only by an analysis of the statutory enactments relating to the constitution and criminal jurisdictions of the superior courts of judicature and of the subordinate courts of Singapore. Such an analysis requires a study of the Act, the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 14) and the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113).
The Act, as stated in the preamble, was enacted to consolidate the law relating to the constitution and powers of the superior courts of judicature in Singapore. By s 3 it is provided that `there shall be a Supreme Court in Singapore` with `such powers as is conferred by this Act`. The Supreme Court consists of the High Court which, inter alia, `shall exercise original and appellate criminal jurisdiction`, the Court of Appeal having power over civil appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeal `which shall exercise appellate criminal jurisdiction`: see s 7. We turn now to s 15 which provides that the High Court shall have jurisdiction to try `all offences` committed within Singapore, on the high seas on board any ship or aircraft registered in Singapore or committed by any citizen of Singapore on the high seas or any aircraft or by certain other `persons` as defined therein. Section 15 is preceded by the words `Original Jurisdiction`. Section 19 of the Act sets out the appellate criminal jurisdiction of the High Court. It is empowered to hear appeals from the district or magistrate`s courts or to hear and determine points of law reserved by these subordinate courts according to the law of criminal procedure. Under s 184 of the Criminal Procedure Code the High Court in certain circumstances may order that a particular criminal case be transferred to and tried before the High Court.
Part V of the Act provides for the constitution and jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal which shall be duly constituted `if it consists of not less than three Judges or any greater uneven number of Judges`: see s 43 under this Part.
Before we turn to s 44 under Pt V of the Act, we have to say that although the High Court has jurisdiction to try `all offences` as stated in s 15 of the Act, not all of them are tried in the High Court. By s 6 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113), it is provided that the courts for the administration of criminal justice shall be the High Court, the district courts and the magistrate`s courts. The criminal jurisdictions of the last two named subordinate courts are set out in the Criminal Procedure Code: see ss 50 and 51 of the Subordinate Courts Act. Generally, under s 7 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the district court has jurisdiction to try all offences for which the maximum term of imprisonment provided by law does not exceed seven years or which are punishable with fine only. Under the next section in the Criminal Procedure Code, the magistrate`s court has jurisdiction, amongst others not relevant for present purposes, to try offences for which the maximum term of imprisonment provided by law does not exceed three years or which are punishable with fine only. In respect of offences under the Penal Code, which provide for the bulk of criminal offences in Singapore, it is provided by s 9 of the Criminal Procedure Code that they may be tried, besides the High Court, by any other court by which the offence is shown to be triable in the eighth column of Sch A to the Criminal Procedure Code. Apart from trying offences under the Penal Code for which the maximum sentences prescribed are seven years or three years respectively, the district court and the magistrate`s court are also given jurisdiction by other laws to hear and determine proceedings in which the sentences of imprisonment prescribed do exceed the period of seven years: for example s 30 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973.
As we had stated earlier, appeals from the district court or magistrate`s court lie to the High Court which is conferred `the appellate criminal jurisdiction` by s 19 of the Act. The procedure for such appeals is provided within Chapter XXVIII and Pt VII of the Criminal Procedure Code. The type of criminal appeals which lie from the High Court to the Court of Criminal Appeal depends on the scope of s 44(1) of the Act to which we must now return.
We set out below the entire s 44 of the Act: 
 
(1) The Court of Criminal Appeal shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any appeal against any decision made by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction, subject nevertheless to the provisions of this or any other written law regulating the terms and conditions upon which such appeals may be brought.
 
 
 
 
(2) An appeal by a person convicted shall be either against the sentence or against both:
  
 
 
`Provided that where an accused person has pleaded guilty and been convicted on such plea there shall be no appeal except as to the extent or legality of the sentence.`
 
 
 
(3) An appeal by the Public Prosecutor shall be either against the acquittal of an accused person or against the sentence imposed upon an accused person by the High Court.
(4) An appeal may lie on a question of fact or a question of law or on a question of mixed fact and law. 
(5) The Court of Criminal Appeal shall also have jurisdiction to hear and determine matters brought before it in accordance with the provisions of s 59 or 60 of this Act.
 
 
 
In our view, the decision of the learned Chief Justice in refusing to reserve the questions of law was not a `decision made by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction` within the meaning of that expression in s 44(1) of the Act. We are of the view that the Court of Criminal Appeal is a creature of the Act and it has no powers other than those conferred upon it by the Act. The decision was made after the conclusion of an appeal to the High Court in exercise of its appellate criminal jurisdiction and on the application of the appellants. To say that the learned Chief Justice was exercising the original criminal jurisdiction of the High Court when he refused to reserve the questions of law is to extend the meaning and scope of the `original criminal jurisdiction` of the High Court to an extent quite out of line with the statutory framework for the administration of appellate criminal justice in Singapore. The all-embracing original criminal jurisdiction of the High Court under s 15 of the Act is not in all cases exercised by the High Court but the administration of criminal justice in respect of what we may call the less serious criminal cases, generally those cases not involving the sentence of death or life imprisonment, is entrusted to the subordinate courts. The exercise of the original criminal jurisdiction of the High Court involves generally the more serious criminal cases or such less serious criminal cases as may be transferred from the subordinate courts to the High Court.
We see that s 60(4) of the Act provides that the Court of Criminal Appeal shall hear and determine the question reserved by the High Court but is silent and makes no provision for any appeal by any party aggrieved by any decision of the High Court refusing to reserve any question of law of public interest.
We have not been referred to any decision in Singapore bearing on the meaning of the critical 15 words in the subsection. The dearth of authority reflects in part the long accepted view of the legal profession that appeals from the subordinate courts end in the High Court and that a decision not to reserve any question of law was part and parcel of the exercise of the appellate criminal jurisdiction of the High Court. We were, however, referred to four Malaysian cases for their highly persuasive authority. We found that the first two decisions of the Malaysian Federal Court were directly helpful. The first case, 
 Gurbachan Singh v 
 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1967] 2 MLJ 220
  turned on the interpretation of sub-s 50(1) of the Malaysian Courts of Judicature Act 1964 which conferred on the Malaysian Federal Court jurisdiction `to hear and determine an appeal by a person convicted by any High Court in exercise of its original jurisdiction`, and which in terms was equivalent to the predecessor of sub-s 44(1) of the Act. The second case, 
 Kulasingam v PP 
 
 
[1978] 2 MLJ 243
  dealt with the interpretation of the same subsection in the Malaysian legislation but which, as amended by Act A328, was substantially equivalent to s 44(1) of the Act. Azmi CJ (Malaya) (as he then was) in the first case said at p 221 F/G that the Federal Court had `jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal from the decision of a lower court in a criminal matter only when the matter (was) sent up to (the Federal Court) by an order of the High Court. The right of appeal under the (Malaysian) Constitution (was) a creature of statute and unless there (was) a special provision there would be no inherent right`. This proposition harked back to what was said by the English Court of Appeal in 
 R 
 
 v Jefferies 
 
[1969] 1 QB 120
; also see vol 11, 
 Halsbury`s 
 
 Laws of England 
, 4th Ed, para 611 and notes 4 and 11.
In the second case, the former LP of Malaysia, Suffian LP, after setting out s 50(1) of the Malaysian Courts of Judicature Act 1964 as amended by Act A328, said: 
 
By no stretch of the imagination can it be said that the accused`s application comes within the above, seeing that what he is dissatisfied with is a refusal by the learned High Court judge to grant a certificate under s 66 of the Courts of Judicature Act.
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellants made two submissions and, if we understood him correctly, they were as follows. First, he referred to the amendment of s 44(1) of the Act which was effected on 11 February 1974 and argued that the deletion of the words in the previous s 44(1) of the Act, namely, `any appeal by a person convicted` and its substitution by the words `
 any 
 appeal against 
 any 
 decision made` (emphases were counsel`s), had widened the scope of the subsection to include a refusal of the High Court to reserve the questions of law under s 60(1) of the Act. Secondly, counsel contended that the learned Chief Justice in making the decision he did was exercising the `original criminal jurisdiction` of the High Court. Counsel for the appellants did not draw our attention to any authority. In support of his arguments, he only tendered to us for our consideration copies of two orders made by the Malaysian Federal Court, both of which, as it subsequently became apparent, were in fact orders made in the third Malaysian case of 
 Yap Ee Kong v PP 
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 144
  which was cited to us by the learned DPP. In that case, the High Court had refused the application to reserve questions of law of public interest which had arisen in the course of the appeal. According to the headnotes of that case, though this was not apparent in the judgment of the Federal Court, an application was then made by way of criminal reference to the Federal Court which heard the application and dealt with the matter as an appeal. Neither 
 Gurbachan`s 
case nor
 Kulasingam`s 
case was referred to in the judgment. The Federal Court decided to hear the case as an appeal and cited three cases which on examination appear not to have dealt with the appealability of a decision of the High Court in refusing to reserve a question of law but rather they considered and dilated on the powers of the Federal Court in the fi rst two cases and those of the House of Lords in the third case to review the entire case after and beyond answering the questions of law reserved for their decision by the lower courts. We would add in passing that s 66(1) of the Malaysian Courts of Judicature Act 1964 as amended by Act A530 with effect from 23 February 1982 has conferred powers (both discretionary and mandatory as the case may be) on the Malaysian Federal Court to grant leave for determination by itself of any question of law of public interest. We accordingly do not think that 
 Yap Ee Kong`s 
 case is of any assistance to the appellants.
Finally, we must refer to 
 PP v Lim Joo Soon 
 
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 107
  cited to us by the learned DPP admittedly more for completeness than relevance and merely to make the point that the Malaysian Public Prosecutor had in that case in effect applied to the Federal Court for a mandatory order that the High Court do reserve the questions of law, contending that he as the Public Prosecutor was statutorily entitled ex debito justitiae to the order from the High Court. The fact that this matter went by way of an application for a mandatory order rather than by way of an appeal underscores the recognition that there was a problem about the lack of jurisdiction.
For these reasons, we dismissed the appeal.

In mid-January 1974 the defendants were excavating their site enclosed within a cofferdam for three basement floors. They were in the course of erecting a 13-storey building. During this period, the owners of buildings in the neighbourhood complained that cracks had appeared in their buildings. Some of the cracks were quite severe. Among the neighbours were the plaintiffs whose building suffered extensive cracks and who now claim damages for loss of support, nuisance as well as negligence against the defendants.
Central to the causes of action is the plaintiffs` allegation that by reason of the excavations, the bottom of the hole thereby formed heaved upwards and the ground upon the sides of the cofferdam moved downwards and laterally towards the excavation hole, having passed underneath the sheet piles surrounding the defendants` land, with the consequence that the surface ground in the immediate vicinity subsided and the buildings standing on them therefore suffered cracks. In short, the plaintiffs alleged that some sort of base heave had occurred at the excavation site which, if proved on a balance of probabilities, must mean that the defendants were liable in law for the withdrawal of support, nuisance and negligence. If negligence is made out, the third party who was the consulting engineer, would be the party primarily responsible and he would have been liable to indemnify the defendants.
On the other hand, the defence of both the defendants and the third party is that the damage caused to the plaintiffs` buildings was attributable to differential consolidation settlement brought about by dewatering of their soil had this settlement was accentuated by the effect of the mixed foundation of the plaintiffs` building and the abnormal `King Tide` which occurred on 9 February 1974. Throughout the trial, the defendants contended and admitted that ground de-watering of the plaintiffs` soil had been caused by the excavation works. But the defendants and the third party maintained that such dewatering, that is the flow of water from the plaintiffs` soil into the excavation hole through indeterminate or undefined channels, was due to the forces of nature and the forces of gravity, and was neither avoidable, given the state of engineering at all material times, nor was it due to any positive acts done by the defendants, their servants or agents. The damage to the Plaintiffs` building, the defendants contended, was therefore 
 damnum sine injuria 
 or damage without legal injury.
Before I turn to the evidence led during the trial which lasted 36 days bearing on the fundamental question of fact as to what had caused the subsidence to the plaintiffs` land, I need to set out the common law position in Singapore concerning the liability of a landowner for the flow of the subterranean water from his neighbour`s land through undefined channels into his land as a result of an excavation.
It seems to me important to dwell on this particular aspect of the common law which affects neighbouring landowners in Singapore in view of the growing incidence of underground civil engineering works, and, in view of the fact that, as far as I am aware, no judgment has been written in Singapore bearing on this branch of the law.
The position at common law in England was first adumbrated in 
 Acton v 
 
 Blundell 
 (1843) 152 ER 1223. The plaintiff was the owner of a cotton mill. Water supply for the mill was drawn from a well in his property. The defendant in opening a colliery nearby sank two coal pits. Underground water in the plaintiff`s land was drawn through undefined channels to the coal pits, causing the plaintiff`s well to run dry. The learned trial judge directed the jury that the plaintiff had no claim in law against the defendant. On an appeal to the Exchequer Chamber, Tindal CJ confirmed the trial judge`s direction to the jury and said at p 1235: 
 
(this case) falls within (the) principle, which gives to the owner of the soil all that lies beneath his surface; that the land immediately below his property, whether it is solid rock, or porous ground, or venous earth, or part soil, part water; that the person who owns the surface may dig therein, and apply all that is there found to his own purposes at his free will and pleasure; and that, if in the exercise of such right, he intercepts or drains off the water collected from underground springs in his neighbour`s well, this inconvenience to his neighbour falls within the description of
 damnum absque injuria,
 which cannot become the ground of an action.
 
 
 
Since this was the first declaration in England of the legal rights and liabilities of and between neighbours inter se where there has been an abstraction of subterranean water, it is useful to take a closer, look at the reasoning of the court. In that case, the plaintiff sought to argue by analogy and contended that the rule of law governing surface streams ought to apply to subterranean streams. That rule provided that an owner could not diminish the quantity nor injure the quality of the water which naturally flowed through his land nor throw back the water without the licence or grant of the owner further up, although the owner had the right to the advantage of the stream flowing in its natural course and to use it for any purposes as he pleased, not inconsistent with a similar right of the owners upstream and downstream: see 
 Mason 
 
 v 
 
 Hill 
 5 B & Ad 1; 110 ER 692. This argument was rejected because the foundation and origin of the rule governing surface streams were inapplicable to underground water.
The court was very much influenced by the undesirable consequences of conferring a legal right on the plaintiff over the flow of subterranean water into his well. The recognition and enforcement of such a right would have unfairly prevented neighbouring owners from draining their land for cultivation, from mining their land for minerals of great value, and, I may add, from carrying out excavations for the construction of underground buildings and structures which is becoming increasingly necessary. The court found support for the soundness of this principle by referring to the similar position under Roman law which, though not forming part of the law of England, was recognized as the fruit of the researches of the most learned men.
I should now refer to the authority of 
 Langbrook Properties Ltd 
 
 v 
 
 Surrey County Council 
 
[1970] 1 WLR 161
 on which the defendants before me had placed great reliance. It was there alleged that by pumping out excavations on land in the vicinity of the plaintiffs` land the defendants had abstracted water percolating beneath the plaintiffs` land and the abstracting of the water had caused settlement of the plaintiffs` buildings. At the trial of a preliminary issue whether, on the facts as pleaded in the statement of claim, the plaintiffs had any cause of action, it was held by Plowman J that the plaintiffs had no cause of action since the defendants were entitled to abstract the water under their land percolating in undefined channels to whatever extent they chose, notwithstanding that this resulted in the abstraction of water percolating under the plaintiffs` land and thereby caused them injury. He held hat any damage suffered by the plaintiffs was 
 damnum sine injuria 
.
In the course of his judgment, Plowman J reviewed the past English authorities with admirable dexterity and came to the following conclusion at p 178: 
 
The authorities cited on behalf of the defendants in my judgment establish that a man may abstract the water under his land which percolates in undefined channels to whatever extent he pleases, notwithstanding that this may result in the abstraction of water percolating under the land of his neighbour and, thereby, cause him injury. In such circumstances the principle of 
 sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas
 (ieuse your own property so as not to injure that of another) does not operate and the damage is 
 damnum sine injuria
.
 
 
 
On the facts as alleged in the statement of claim, which Plowman J had to assume as proved, the question arose whether there was any room for the law of nuisance or negligence to operate. In explaining the reasons why he thought there was no room for the law of nuisance or negligence to operate, he said at p 178 and 179: 
 
In the first place, if there were, it seems to me highly probable that the courts would already have said so, and yet I have not been referred to any case in which that was done. In 
 Chasemore v
 
 Richards
 (1859) 7 HL Cas 349 the opportunity was there, since the water authority concerned was found to have had reasonable means of knowing the natural and probable consequences of their excavations, but there was no suggestion in the House of Lords that this was a relevant matter.
 
 
 
Moreover, since it is not actionable to cause damage by the abstraction of underground water, even where this is done maliciously, it would seem illogical that it should be actionable if it were done carelessly. Where there is no duty not to injure for the sake of inflicting injury, there cannot, in my judgment, be a duty to take care not to inflict the same injury.
A claim in nuisance can fare no better, since nuisance involves an unlawful interference with a man`s use or enjoyment of land (see Winfield on 
 Tort 
, 8th ed, at p 353 and cases there cited) but here the interference was not unlawful, as the authorities referred to show.
On the facts which I am required to assume (which may not be the real facts) this may be thought to be an unsatisfactory result. If indeed the defendants could have avoided damaging the plaintiffs` property by the exercise of reasonable care, it may be asked why they should not be liable for their failure to do so. But so far, at any rate, as a court of first instance is concerned, it must, I think, be taken as settled that the restrictions which the law imposes on a landowner`s freedom of action for the benefit of his neighbours are not such as to give the plaintiffs a cause of action in this case.
It has been debated before me whether the English common law relating to the abstraction of or interference with the flow of underground water as compendiously summarised by Plowman J in 
 Langbrook`s 
 case is part of the common law of our land. In this connection, I want to place on record that I am indebted to Mr CS Wu, counsel for the defendants, who, in conformity with the best traditions of the Bar, quite properly and candidly drew my attention to a string of authorities which were decided in Australia, Canada and the United States, all of which have, to a degree, departed from the common law of England.
I need only for present purposes refer to the 1977 decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in 
 Pugliese et al v 
 
 National Capital Commission 
 79 DLR (3d), 592. The defendants were engaged in the construction of a collection sewer. They had to control the ground water conditions. They did so by pumping subterranean water from the deep drainage which they had built. The pumping lowered the ground water in the vicinity which caused ground consolidation and this, in turn, caused differential settlement over the base of the plaintiffs` homes. The homes suffered cracks and faulting.
On a reference to the Ontario Court of Appeal to determine the point of law raised in the pleadings, the court made an extensive review in the law in all four jurisdictions and came to the conclusion that the law in England should not be applied without reference to the modern law of negligence and nuisance.
In my considered opinion, the English common law which was first declared in 
 Acton v 
 
 Blundell 
 is received into and is a part of the law of Singapore. Having regard to the reasons in support of the rule in 
 Acton v 
 
 Blundell 
 which I had examined and which operate with particular force and validity between neighbouring owners, whose respective rights have to be given due weight and carefully balanced, I am of the view that the Canadian case of 
 Pugliese 
 has no application to and bears a crucial distinction from the case before me. The parties before me are neighbours of such sufficient physical proximity that the reasons operative in 
 Acton v 
 
 Blundell 
 are equally compelling. In the Canadian case, the parties were not neighbours. Unlike the present defendants who were exercising their ownership rights to excavate and build on their own land, the defendant Commission in the Canadian case was carrying out a public project for the benefit of the public at large. Whether home-owners in those circumstances should go without remedy does not arise in the case before me. Also, the pronouncements in that case bearing on negligence have no relevance to the case before me, having regard to what I will be saying later on this aspect of the case.
I am also not persuaded by the argument of counsel for the plaintiffs that the provisions of s 5(2)(a) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 30) exclude from Singapore the reception of the rule in 
 Acton v Blundell 
.
Having set out the legal position, I now turn to the facts of this case and to the fundamental question as to what had caused the settlement of the plaintiffs` land and building. The plaintiffs` claim is that the settlement of their land was caused by the phenomenon known as base heave. To make good their claim, they rely on the evidence of their expert witness, Professor Chin Fung Kee, who practises as a consultant engineer on soil mechanics and foundation problems. His academic and professional qualifications are most impressive and difficult to surpass. In 1946 he was awarded a Queen`s scholarship. In 1952 he obtained the degree of Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering with First Class Honours from Belfast University. In the following year, he obtained his Masters degree. Over the ensuing years, he became a Member and later a Fellow of both the Institution of Structural Engineers, UK and the Institution of Civil Engineers, UK. In 1977 he was made the Honorary Fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers, UK. He remains the only Asian who holds this distinction.
For sometime, Professor Chin was in the academe. He obtained his professorship in Civil Engineering in 1961, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, where he was elected as the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering. In 1975, he was conferred the Honorary Doctorate of Science by the then University of Singapore. He has published more than 50 papers on soil mechanics and foundation problems in international journals.
Professor Chin was instructed in July 1974 to investigate into and report on the cause of the damage to the plaintiffs` building. He visited the site on 25 July 1974 and in his report of 31 July 1974 he expressed his opinion in the following terms: 
 
The structural damage sustained by the (plaintiffs`) building is the result of excessive settlement. This settlement is brought about by:
 
 
 
(a) The deep excavation that was carried out at the building site at the rear;
 
 
 
 
(b) Pumping and de-watering; and 
 
(c) Vibration due to pulling in an area of deep excavation.
  
 
 
The Professor then went on to describe the phenomenon known as bottom heave which he alleged had occurred on the Defendants` excavation site. He described it as follows: 
 
Saturated plastic clay such as that underlying the area concerned experience a consistent pattern of deformation as material is removed from the space between the walls of the basement excavation. Excavation for the basement reduces the load on the soil beneath the cut, whereupon the underlying soil tends to move upward. The soil in the neighbourhood surrounding the basement excavation (ie the plaintiffs` land), on the other hand, tends to sink and to move inward even at levels below that to which the cut has progressed. On account of the rise of the bottom of the basement excavation and the inward lateral and downward movement, the ground surrounding the cut subsides.
 
 
 
This opinion necessarily implies that the defendants` cofferdam designed by the third party was defective in that it had failed to prevent a bottom heave.
The Professor conducted his site inspection on 25 July 1974 and it took him about two hours. He inspected the damage to the plaintiffs` building and studied the strips of paper `tell-tales` which had been affixed over the cracks. He also inspected the backlane which separated the properties of the plaintiffs and of the defendants. He said in evidence that the depth of the defendants` excavation struck him as excessive. He also said that the level of the whole of the backlane had suffered a 4` to 6` subsidence, suggesting that this was due to the bottom heave. He also took note of a patch of white cementation shown in a photograph, exh P19, which he said was evidence of ground settlement repair. With regard to a row of defendants` sheet piles along the backlane, the Professor told the court that the mid section was lower and out of line slightly towards the backlane. The maximum misalignment was, he claimed, about four inches. To him, this was a significant movement of the sheet piles in relation to the others.
In support of his opinion that there had been sheet pile failures followed by a bottom heave, the Professor referred me to his calculations based on two formulae. The first is known as the 
 Rankine 
 formula which determines the critical depth for sheet pile failure. The second is known as the 
 Teng 
 formula which determines the critical depth at which a bottom heave would occur. On the basis of the 
 Rankine 
 formula, he expressed the opinion that the sheet piles would have failed when excavation reached the depths of between nine ft two inches and fifteen ft four inches. On the basis of the 
 Teng 
 formula, he concluded that bottom heave would have occurred at an excavation depth of between 16.8 ft to 17.7 ft.
I now turn to the evidence led by the defendants. The defendants, who are building contractors with a remarkable track record, bought the site in 1972. They erected on the land a 13-storey building which was completed towards the end of 1976. The building included three basement floors, for which extensive excavations had to be undertaken over an area of 99 ft by 77 ft. The project architects were Pan Malaysian Architects and the third party was engaged as the consultant engineer responsible for the engineering aspects of the building, including the design of the basements.
The third party designed the piling work. About 120 steel H piles were sunk to depths of 120 ft at the Cecil Street end and 130 ft at the backlane end. They were driven to set, that is to firm ground. By end of April 1973 the driving of the load bearing piles were completed.
According to Mr Lim Kong Eng, the defendants` managing director, himself an engineer, the defendants next drove sheet piles along the four sides of their site. They started driving the sheet piles on 28 August 1973 and completed this phase of the work on 12 November 1973. They were driven to 57 ft according to design. The length of the sheet piles were 60 ft. After that, excavation work commenced on 16 November 1973. The original design depths of excavation were 32 ft at the backlane end and 29 ft at the Cecil Street end. The cofferdam was braced and strutted as provided for in the design. The excavation was done simultaneously with the bracing and strutting of the sheet piles, layer by layer. The excavation was done sectionally at each layer. The first layer of struts at a depth of 6 ft were completed on 25 December 1973. By 18 January 1974 the second layer of struts at the depth of 15 ft were completed. During this period the defendants received complaints from their neighbours that cracks were appearing in their building. After the Chinese New Year holidays, excavation works resumed on 6 February 1974. On the following day, the plaintiffs lodged with them their first letter of complaint of damage to their buildings.
On 9 February 1974 a `King Tide` flood occurred in Singapore. The flood waters in the Robinson Road and Cecil Street area were over 2 ft above ground level. They overflowed into the excavation. Immediately after the flood, the Defendants received more complaints from the neighbours. The cracks worsened and the worsening suffered by the plaintiffs` building was the most severe.
Towards the end of January 1974 the defendants discussed with their architects and the third party on the possibility of reducing the depth of the excavation at the backlane end by 5 ft, so that excavation at that end would be taken down to only 28 ft, the additional half foot being for trimming the ground. By 21 February 1974 the decision was made to reduce the depth of excavation at the backlane end of the site. The architects then wrote to the Chief Planner for permission to revise the approved plans. As the plaintiffs` cross-examination on the letter was extensive, I am quoting the letter (exh D9) in full: 
 
We refer to the above planning approval under DC 227/70, the building plans of which under BP 1276B/71 was approved on 8 February 1974 by the Assistant Director. As a matter of extreme urgency we are writing to enquire whether you would permit the deletion of one basement (15 car parks) in view of the serious settlement during excavation. We would earnestly request you to have a personal inspection of the existing conditions. It is our Consulting Engineers` and our opinion that further excavation would endanger the adjoining buildings. We have now reached the level of the second basement and if the basement can now be concreted without further excavation, there will be little likelihood of further movement. On the other hand further excavation may prove to be perilous.
 
 
 
As the matter is of extremely urgent nature, we would appreciate it if you could let us have your decision soonest possible.
At the time the letter was written by the architects to the Chief Planner, the excavation at the backlane end was still at a depth of 15 ft. Permission to reduce the level was granted. By the end of March 1974 the excavation was completed to formation level down to the revised depth at the backlane end. The basement comprised the erection of a raft foundation of 5 ft thick and was reinforced. It extended across the entire floor of the basement. Before its construction, the soil was trimmed to the design level within the usual span of time and without interruption, a task which would have been impossible if the critical depth had been exceeded followed by sheet pile failures and a bottom heave, as was alleged by Professor Chin. A layer of lean concrete blinding was then laid on the trimmed surface. The lean concrete was 3` thick it was then left to harden, after which it provided a clean working surface. On top of this lean layer was laid the 5 ft thick raft foundation.
According to Mr Lim Kong Eng, the defendants did not encounter any extraordinary difficulty and work had progressed in the usual way. The raft foundation was completed by the end of May 1974. After the raft foundation was completed, the defendants erected the four basement walls to replace the struts and bracings. The third level of waters at the backlane end had to be cast in and left within the raft. As a result, the wall there was thicker between the raft and the second basement.
By November 1974 the construction reached ground floor level. Superstructure work then began and the 13-storey building with the three basement floors were successfully completed in November 1976.
I now set out my evaluation of the expert and other evidence produced by the parties before me which bear on the question as to the operative cause or causes of the settlement of the plaintiffs` land.
The conflicting experts` evidence given before me were received under s 47 of the Evidence Act (Cap 5). My approach in evaluating the conflicting experts` evidence is to examine the scientific grounds and bases, on which they rely, in connection with (a) the permeability of the first stratum of the soil in the vicinity; (b) the applicability of the 
 Rankine 
 formula and 
 Teng 
 formula relating to sheet pile failure and the occurrence of base heave; (c) the behaviour of underground water in the dewatering process; and (d) the nature of the plaintiffs` building and foundation and the effect on them of any ground settlement. Where the opinion of an expert is based on reports of facts and empirical observations, I have endeavoured to satisfy myself, on a balance of probabilities, whether those facts did in truth exist and whether any inference or inferences drawn from those facts, taken individually and collectively, were sound or not. In this context, what had in fact happened in the course of the defendants` excavations and its effect on the ground in the immediate neighbourhood were vital matters of fact upon which I have to make my findings.
Professor Chin`s opinion that bottom heave had occurred was based on (1) his conclusion that the soil in the area and underneath the land of the plaintiffs and the defendants, being a natural deposit of clay, was impermeable to water so that consolidation settlement due to ground dewatering was, and must necessarily be excluded; (2) his investigations; and (3) his calculations according to the two formulae which I had mentioned earlier in my judgment. The Professor had assumed that the first stratum of soil was impermeable. He said in evidence that the clay from 3 ft to 20 ft was a natural deposit and was not fill material. He was confronted with the soil investigations reports which had described the first stratum as fill material. He stoutly replied that the statement was inaccurate. When asked about the presence of gravel in the first stratum, he said it was placed on top of the clay which trickled downwards over geological time. The Professor in cross-examination was shown the Singapore 1843 Shoreline in exh D13 which showed the area at that period as lying within a part of the sea. He was then asked to estimate the estimated depth of the fill and he suggested a depth of only 5 ft.
The Professor also rejected two pieces of evidence which showed that the first stratum of the soil down to about 20 ft was fill material, having been reclaimed. He rejected the estimated water table given as 6 ft below ground. He said that there was no question of a water table since the soil was all clay. Numerous photographs were produced showing the difference between the fill stratum and the marine clay stratum of the soil in the area. He did not accept the differences which were quite apparent.
It would appear that the Professor was not himself totally convinced that the first stratum of the soil was impervious to water. In his written opinion, he had attributed the settlement in part to `pumping and dewatering`. But he said he did not intend by the phrase to refer to underground dewatering. His explanation that by the expression he meant the vibrations caused by the process of pumping was unacceptable to me.
In establishing the permeability of the first stratum of the soil in the area, the defendants tendered a formidable body of evidence. They called Mr John Thomas Stevens, a consultant civil engineer. In the course of his work, he too had acquired an extensive experience in foundation works. He prepared for this court a paper bearing the title: `The effect of water on soil behaviour.` In foundation engineering, he asserted, and I accept, that fill material is generally assumed to be permeable to water despite the fact that it may contain a significant proportion of clay: see also 
 Terzaghi & Peck 
 at p 156. He explained that when excavation is to a depth say 30 ft below the water table, three things would happen, namely: (1) the soil within the excavation pit, laden with water in its pores, is removed; (2) the ground water level outside the cofferdam (if there is such a construction) becomes progressively higher than the level of water within the cofferdam, as water accumulation within the cofferdam is removed by pumping; and (3) the soil load outside the cofferdam is progressively increased as excavation within the cofferdam deepens. He goes on to explain as follows: 
 
17 The combination of these matters activates the hydraulic forces of the soil water content outside the cofferdam in the stratum between the ground water level and the level of the excavation (the Piezometric level) causing the soil water content in this stratum to seep through the clutches of the sheet piles (which cannot be regarded as watertight) and into the excavation pit. The deeper the excavation, the greater the activation of the hydraulic forces.
 
 
 
 
(18) The water seepage is routed along undefined channels in the ground provided by soil components of greater permeability. Where clay is encountered, its `blocking` effect (on account of its low permeability) causes the water to re-route and seek other and more permeable channels towards the excavation.
  
 
 
The following passage from 
 Terzaghi & Peck 
 at p 581 explains with great clarity the relationship between deep excavation and ground settlement: 
 
ART 59 Settlement due to Lowering the Water Table Causes of Settlement.
 
 
 
Whenever a large open excavation is to be made below the water table by any process other than dredging or the sinking of a caisson by the compressed-air method, the water table must be temporarily lowered by pumping. By lowering the water table the effective load on the subsoil is increased by an amount equal to the difference between the drained weight (solid and soil moisture combined) and the submerged weight of the entire mass of soil located between the original and the lowered water table. The increase of the effective overburden pressure causes additional compression. This, in turn, produces a settlement that at every point is roughly proportional to the descent of the piezometric level at that point. For a given descent the settlement depends on the compressibility of the sub-soil.
 
 
 
I understand this part of the evidence to describe in layman terms, shorn of all the technicalities the process in which water in the soil will find its way to its lowest level through undefined channels as a result of which the soil from which it had flowed would settle and consolidate.
The second soil report, exh P1, disclosed that all five samples taken of the first stratum of the soil were not susceptible to the usual soil tests because their disturbed state `was due to the high percentage of gravels and stones in this fill`. The plaintiffs` engineer, Mr Ho Hweng Sheng, who was called in to study the cause of the cracks and to recommend remedial works, had in two reports in writing in February 1974 attributed the settlement to ground dewatering. In addition, Mr Lim Kong Eng and the third party, who were regularly at the excavation site, testified that after the excavation had proceeded below the water table level of 6 ft they had observed constant seepage of water between the clutches of the sheet piles. Their evidence, which I accept, showed that water seepage had occurred and I accordingly find that the first stratum of soil was not natural deposits of clay but was fill material which was permeable.
I must now refer to the observations of Professor Chin made during his inspection and examine if his inferences were valid. The Professor concluded that the misalignment of the middle section of the sheet piles at the backlane end of the excavation were `significant movements` and evidence of sheet pile failure. Both Mr Lim Kong Eng and the third party had explained that the kind of misalignment observed by the Professor was unavoidable and perfectly normal. It was apparent, even before any excavation work had begun: see exh TP 15 (ER2). Moreover, the Professor in forming his opinion failed to make a study of the cofferdam design nor carry out an enquiry into the design considerations of the third party. Accordingly, his inference that there was a sheet pile failure was, in my view, too tenuous.
The Professor also claimed that the cementatious white patch at the backlane, represented ground settlement repairs. Both Mr Lim Kong Eng and the third party told the court that the patch was the cement used to cover the pipes which were laid for the worker`s lavatory. The Professor`s riposte was that `the width need not have been so wide`.
The way the plaintiffs led a piece of evidence, which they inconclusively abandoned when they encountered heavy weather, must now be referred to. The evidence related to the depth of the excavation at the backlane end and actually carried out by the defendants. In the cross-examination of the Professor, it was pointedly suggested to him that if bottom heave had occurred at the depth of excavation of around 16-17 ft, the defendants could not have excavated successfully down to the reduced level of 28 ft. In the closing stages of his re-examination, the Professor made the surprising claim that the defendants` excavation at the backlane end had in fact gone down to a level of only 22.18 ft and not 28 ft as the Defendants had claimed. He even drew a sketch to illustrate his claim. I was therefore constrained to order a joint basement inspection at the end of which I found that the excavated level was in truth and in fact 28 ft and that it was a wholly unnecessary diversion.
The plaintiffs were stubbornly undeterred and, on their application, I gave leave to them to conduct a survey to establish the as built levels of the basements. The survey was carried out by a registered surveyor. But counsel for the plaintiffs at the close of the defendants` case informed me that he would not lead any evidence on the survey nor produce the survey drawings. I am therefore irresistibly drawn to the conclusion that the excavation level at the backlane end did go down to 28 ft and that there was no evidence whatsoever from the comprehensive survey to suggest that there was any significant sheet pile movement.
The Professor explained that his study of one of the plans submitted to the Chief Planner showed that the basement details were totally omitted. But the relevant plans contained the words `To engineers` details`. I am afraid that the Professor was again too quick to jump to conclusions.
The defendants and the third party produced evidence to show that Professor Chin had misapplied the 
 Rankine 
 formula in connection with sheet pile failure and the 
 Teng 
 formula as regards the occurrence of bottom heave. The third party called Mr Eric Rawcliffe, a civil engineer, as his expert. Mr Rawcliffe expressed the firm view that the 
 Rankine 
 formula was not applicable to a braced cofferdam. In 
 Teng`s 
 chapter on braced cofferdam, it is even stated that the 
 Rankine 
 formula could not be applied to a braced cofferdam. Mr Stevens supported this view. I am convinced by the materials they produced and I accept their opinion. If the 
 Rankine 
 formula were applicable, then the sheet piles on all four sides of the cofferdam would have failed from end to end, as the defendants and third party, had submitted, well before the excavation had reached its design levels. I find as a fact that none of the classic signs of sheet pile failure had occurred within and without the cofferdam. The patch of white cementation, one of the empirical observations on which the Professor relied, had nothing to do with any sheet pile failure. Mr Rawcliffe had calculated that the sheet piles were of sufficient capacity and that all strutting members were satisfactory.
With regard to the applicability of 
 Teng 
 formula, I am also driven by the mass of evidence to find that no bottom heave of any kind had occurred. I accept the evidence of both Mr Lim Kong Eng and the third party that they did not encounter any ground swell inside the cofferdam during the excavation. The process of excavation had proceeded apace free from any difficulty. The steel members of the cofferdam remained intact. The joint report of the third party and plaintiffs` engineer, Mr Ho Hweng Sheng, confirmed that the settlement of the plaintiffs` land and building was arrested by pressure grouting. This suggested that bottom heave had not occurred. If it had, grouting would have aggravated the position and not relieved it.
I must mention that Mr Rawcliffe`s calculations confirmed that the cofferdam was designed with a factor of safety of 1.81 against bottom failure at full excavation depth. At the depth of 20 ft it was demonstrated that the factor of safety was as high as 2.6. Mr Rawcliffe had duly considered the hold-down force produced by the presence of the 120 load-bearing piles which were driven to firm ground. Professor Chin had totally disregarded the effect of these piles in his consideration. To the third party, this was a prime design consideration. This aspect of Mr Rawcliffe`s evidence was not challenged. The fundamental fact remains that the excavation had proceeded apace without interruption and without any incident. If bottom heave had occurred, the evidence of bottom heave damage and the attendant delay would have been all too obvious.
At the end of the day, counsel for the plaintiffs was driven, almost in desperation, if I may say so, to make a song and dance about the contents of the letter (exh D9) which the defendants, architects had written to the Chief Planner to obtain permission to revise and reduce the design depth of the basement at the backlane end by 5 ft to 28 ft. He strenuously contended that the letter strongly indicated or suggested an admission that base heave had occurred. Neither the context in which, nor the purpose for which, the letter was written bear out the view taken of this letter by the plaintiffs. The defendants were most anxious to complete the basement works within the shortest possible time, in view of the worsening damage the ground settlement was causing to the neighbouring buildings. The revision contemplated the deletion of 15 car parking lots, which was frowned upon by the authorities. So, I am not at all surprised if the architects were somewhat hyperbolic in their language. The Defendants` and their professionals` sole concern was to minimize the damage to the neighbours, whatever the view of the legal position was. This is the sort of attitude of a good neighbour which I would heartily approve.
Reference must now be made to the evidence of Mr Rawcliffe and Mr Stevens on the renovated nature of the plaintiffs` building and its mixed foundation. The building was of pre-war construction, having been built in the early 1930s. It originally comprised two buildings, each built on strip foundations, supported by bakau piles which was then the usual foundation for that type of buildings. As a result of renovations carried out in 1966, it became one building. The centre party wall separating the two original buildings was removed and replaced by steel beams and columns. The structure consisted essentially of load bearing brick walls. The upper floors were of 3` x 9` timber floor joists at 1` 9` centres which spanned approximately 20 ft between each load bearing brick wall and a steel joist at the centre of the building. There was a monolithic concrete structure at the rear of the building, comprising a strong room and staircase. It was founded on a simple RC raft which was 27-inch thick. It was the opinion of Mr Rawcliffe that, upon the reconstruction of the two buildings of other owners on either side of the plaintiffs` building, and the removal of the plaintiffs` middle party wall, the rear wall of their building had become more vulnerable to any changes which might be brought about by any ground settlement. In all fairness to Mr Ho Hweng Sheng, who was responsible for the renovation of the plaintiffs` building, this is not to be taken as any criticism of his design.
Like Mr Rawcliffe, Mr Stevens also described the plaintiffs` foundation as a mixed foundation. Both of them expressed the opinion that such a mixed foundation had a bearing on the likelihood of a differential settlement. Mr Stevens testified that the main cracks on the two sides of the plaintiffs` building at the rear had cracked in the base regions and had broadened near the roof. He said that the nature of these cracks, broadening upwards as they did, implied that the building had moved in a convex curve, settling at the backlane. I was persuaded by him that these types of fractures would not be consistent with those caused by a ground heave because a settlement caused by dewatering would be along the phriatic curve, taking a downward tilt towards the cofferdam. I also accept the substantial evidence before me that the cracks had worsened after the freak tide.
Finally, I turn to the particulars of negligence which the Plaintiffs have asserted against the defendants. These may be dealt with shortly. I do not propose to deal with those particulars which bear a relation to sheet pile failures or ground heave. These are not at all made out in view of my rejection of the Plaintiffs` evidence on sheet pile failure and bottom heave and in view of my finding that in fact the damage to the plaintiffs` building was caused by differential consolidation settlement brought about by dewatering and this settlement was accentuated by the effect of the mixed foundation of the plaintiffs` building and the abnormal `King Tide`. The settlement at the backlane, which the Professor had observed, was in part similarly caused and in part by the heavy vehicular traffic at the backlane.
However, for completeness, I must refer to the other alleged particulars of negligence. It was alleged that the defendants had failed to use care in carrying out pumping and dewatering operations. No evidence was led at all. Next, the plaintiffs complained that the defendants had failed to provide any vertical or lateral support for the plaintiffs` building prior to the excavation. Assuming that there was a duty to do so, of which I am not persuaded as the law stands, I am unable to see the efficacy of any such shoring supports. As Mr Stevens had explained, the props and the building would have moved together when the ground settled. The plaintiffs also sought to blame the defendants for putting in shallow and insufficient grouting which was part of the remedial works carried out on the joint recommendation of Mr Ho Hweng Sheng, the plaintiffs` engineer, and the third party. At any rate, it was established that the grouting had effectively arrested the ground settlement. The final complaint was that the defendants had failed to take any precaution to prevent movements, shocks and vibrations in the said building during the pile driving operations. The damage, in my judgment, had no causal link at all with the piling which was completed some three months earlier.
In all the circumstances, the plaintiffs` claims are dismissed with costs. As the justice of the case requires, I also order the Plaintiffs to pay the costs of the third party.

I find the defendant entirely to blame for the accident.
On 23 August 1979 at about 6.30pm Foo Moo Say, the deceased, was riding his motorcycle AV4134 along Mandai Road in the direction of Sembawang Road to see his friend. According to his brother, who saw the deceased before he left home at about 6pm that evening, and whose evidence I accept, he appeared normal and was not in any way affected by alcohol. He had ridden from his home in Marsiling Drive for some 10-12 km when he met with the fatal accident. I find that DW1 and DW2, who were military personnel in the army, had attempted to push-start jeep No 1307 from the grass verge where it was parked onto the road. It is to be emphasized that according to AB7, a photograph of the scene of the accident taken shortly after the event, the grass verge was on higher ground, some six inches or so higher than the road surface of Mandai road. The road was also sloping towards the direction of Sembawang. I am satisfied after hearing the evidence that the defendants in push-starting the jeep had created a sudden danger in the way of the deceased.
According to Corporal Neo Choon Teow (DW1), the commander of the jeep and the driver, Neo Aik Chian (DW2), they had completed their road block duties that evening at Mandai Road, 18 km milestone. The road block was to enable the soldiers to cross the road. At about 6.30pm they started to push-start the jeep which had a weak battery. The jeep was parked on the grass verge. The driver pushed the jeep from the nearside, near the driver`s seat with one hand manipulating the steering wheel and the other hand pushing the jeep. Corporal Neo Choon Teow pushed the jeep from the rear. The hazard lights of the jeep were switched on. The jeep was manoeuvred onto the road by a sharper turn than usual to the driver`s right because there was a tree in front of the jeep and there was a depression on the grass verge in front of the jeep. When the front portion of the jeep and the two front wheels were on the road, the jeep stopped according to them. The driver got into the jeep. The corporal began to push the jeep. He heard the approaching roar of the motorcycle, he turned and waved down the deceased. He then heard a screech, shortly followed by the collision.
I do not accept their evidence that the jeep had been pushed slowly onto the road. I also do not accept that the jeep had stopped. The jeep was parked on the grass verge, which was a slope with a level of some six inches higher than the road at the edge of the road. Its descent onto the road from a higher level must have been at a speed faster than that of a jeep pushed from level ground. Its sharp right turn onto the road must have taken place within the briefest time frame, at the end of which, the jeep`s front nearside was very near the middle broken white lines. During that briefest of moments, the deceased was approaching them, riding his motorcycle along Mandai Road down the slope. The deceased was, I find, at a distance of about 30 m away when the sudden danger was created. That was the distance, I find, when he first saw the vehicle coming onto the road. Having regard to the police sketch plan, it is significant to note that the deceased had jammed the brakes of his motorcycle for some 15 m and the motorcycle had remained on course. The deceased did not lose control of the motorcycle for some 15 m. Having regard to this piece of hard evidence, I am satisfied that the deceased was able to control his motorcycle in a most difficult situation. I appreciate that the distance of 15 m was not the entire braking distance, which was broken by the impact with the jeep. I am also not unmindful that this was a straight stretch of road, that visibility was good, but I find that the defendants had created a sudden danger by coming onto the road suddenly and blocking virtually the entire path of the deceased. It was no good to say he should have swerved to his right. His attempt to stop by braking to avoid the collision was an act of evasion that was a decision made in the agony of the moment and was reasonable in all the circumstances. I must also say that I did not accept DW1`s evidence that he had warned the deceased of the danger by waving his hands at him. I do not accept the evidence of DW1 and DW2 that the hazard lights were on. It was an improbable story, seeing that the battery was weak. In any event, it would have been better if DW2, the driver of the jeep, had instead given his right hand indicator when moving from the grass verge. Anyway, this aspect of the case is not material as I find that sudden danger was created when the deceased was some 30 m from the jeep and any signal would have been too late. I have come to this conclusion having regard to the topography of the grass verge, the reaction time the deceased must have taken and the braking distance, which was, however, broken as gathered from the police sketch plan, and what the sketch plan has shown as the consequence of the impact.
It was proved by the defendants that the blood sample of the deceased revealed that it contained 62 mg ethanol per 100 ml of blood. The learned State Counsel also referred to the evidence of the brother of the deceased that the deceased would go red by drinking just a glass of beer, suggesting that the deceased was markedly affected by alcohol. Estimating that 62 mg ethanol could be the result of having consumed some four glasses of beer, the learned State Counsel contended that the deceased`s ability to keep a proper look-out must have been adversely affected. Relying on findings from traffic authorities in Singapore and in England, the learned State Counsel pointed out that the level of 62 mg ethanol per 100 ml blood in a road user poses a danger to other road users.
I would have given more weight to this submission, as I do discourage any level of alcoholism in a road user, but for the piece of hard evidence in this case. The deceased`s ability to keep a proper look-out must have been, and I find that it was, unimpaired. On seeing the sudden danger created by the jeep coming onto the road suddenly, he took the usual reaction time, followed by the jamming of his brakes. The most significant point which impressed me was that the deceased was able to retain control of his motorcycle and stayed on course. If the alcohol had any effect on him such that his look-out was affected, he could not have, in my opinion, retained the control and balance of his motorcycle. I was also influenced by the evidence of the brother of the deceased and by the fact that the deceased had ridden his motorcycle for some 12 km from his home without any evidence of being affected by the alcohol content in his blood until the fatal accident.
As damages were agreed, there will be judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $89,600 with costs to be taxed. I also grant the usual consequential orders. There is also liberty to apply with regard to the apportionment of the judgment sum.
 Order accordingly.",1984-08-07 00:00:00,SG High Court

The defendants are the partners of Messrs Foo & Quek, a firm of solicitors. The plaintiffs, on 5 March 1974 exercised an option to purchase, subject to contract, premises known as 37, Telok Ayer Street, Singapore (the property) from City Developments Ltd (the vendors) for whom the defendants were acting.
After the exercise of the option, the plaintiffs instructed the defendants` firm to act for them also in their proposed purchase of the property. As the plaintiffs` solicitors the defendants` firm wrote to the Urban Renewal Department of the Housing and Development Board on 5 March 1974 to inquire whether the property was in an area earmarked for urban renewal. On 14 March 1974 that department replied stating the property was in an area `under study for comprehensive development`. The defendants did not inform the plaintiffs of the contents of the Urban Renewal Department`s letter of 14 March 1974 nor did they advise the plaintiffs as to the implications of that letter and the likelihood that all or part of the property would be compulsorily acquired in the near future. The plaintiffs allege that in failing to so advise them the defendants were in breach of duty and as a consequence the plaintiffs have suffered damage. The defendants` firm asked for an interpretation of that term and in reply that department stated: `Based on our Department`s policy our reply of 14 March 1974 stands`. Although that reply was dated 29 March 1974 it was not received by the defendants` firm until 3 April 1974. That reply was also not made known to the plaintiffs by the defendants.
Before that reply was received the defendants proceeded to arrange for the plaintiffs to exchange contracts with the vendors on or before 3 April 1974 for the purchase of the property. The terms, (so far as material) of the contract were:
Clause 2 which so far as material reads: 
 
The purchase price of $2,700,000 shall be paid by the Purchaser to the vendor in the following manner:
 
 
 
(a) Immediately on signing of this Agreement a sum of $270,000.
(b) On or before 30 June 1974 $270,000. 
(c) On or before 30 June 1975 $432,000. 
(d) On or before 30 June 1976 $432,000. 
(e) On or before 30 June 1977 $432,000. 
(f) On or before 30 June 1978 $432,000, 
(g) On or before 30 June 1979 $432,000.
 
 
 
PROVIDED the Purchaser may pay any sum in excess of the yearly instalments referred to in (c) to (g) above and any such payments shall be adjusted accordingly from the last instalment.
 
 
 
AND PROVIDED ALSO the payments stipulated above shall not prejudice any rights which the vendor may have under any subsequent clauses of this Agreement in case of non-payment of any of the instalments aforesaid.
 
 
 
Clause 13 reads: 
 
Without limiting or restricting cl 11 herein it is hereby declared the property is sold subject to any Notices of intended acquisition or acquisition by the Government or other Competent Authority and in the event the Government or other Competent Authority acquiring the property or part thereof after the date of this Agreement but before the actual date of completion the Purchaser shall not be entitled to rescind this Agreement.
 
 
 
Clause 14 reads: 
 
Notwithstanding cl 2 herein should the property be acquired by the Government or other Competent Authority the Purchaser shall forthwith complete the purchase.
 
 
 
The plaintiffs, pursuant to the contract, entered into possession and paid to the vendors the instalments due and also affected improvements and alterations to the property.
On 15 November 1975 the vovernment by a 
 Gazette 
notification gave notice under s 5 of the Land Acquisition Act of the intended compulsory acquisition of the property. Subsequently the government acquired the property and the Collector made his award on 18 June 1977 of $1,261,000. On appeal, the award was increased by $620,610.96.
The facts outlined were pleaded in the amended statement of claim endorsed in the amended writ of summons taken out by the plaintiffs against the defendants on 19 June 1982. Their cause of action was in tort - the tort of negligence. The defendants now apply to strike out the amended statement of claim on the grounds that it discloses no reasonable cause of action against them, or alternatively, is frivolous or vexatious, or, alternatively is otherwise an abuse of the process of the court. For the purposes of this application the allegations made by the plaintiffs have to be assumed to be correct. The defendants` contend that the claim is statute-barred, the writ having been issued more than six years after the cause of action arose. It is not in dispute that to establish a cause of action the plaintiffs must establish not only a breach of duty, but that that breach of duty occasioned them damage. It is common ground that in an action in tort, time will not begin to run until the damage occurs.
It is also common ground that the critical question I have to decide is, when did the damage occur. The defendants rely on 
 Pirelli General Cable Works Ltd v 
 
 Oscar Faber & Partners (a firm) 
 (1983) 1 All ER 65. In that case the defendants, a firm of consulting engineers in March 1969 advised the plaintiffs in the design and erection of a boiler chimney. They were found negligent in the design of the chimney. It was found that damage in the form of cracks at the top of the chimney could not have occurred later than April 1970. The writ was issued in October 1978. The House of Lords held that the plaintiff`s claim was timebarred because the cause of action accrued in April 1970, when damage, in the form of cracks, must have come into existence. Lord Fraser who delivered the leading opinion said at p 72: 
 
Counsel for the defendants submitted fault of his clients in advising on the design of the chimney was analogous to that of a solicitor who gives negligent advice on law, which results in the client suffering damage and a right of action accruing when the client acts on the advice (see 
 Howell v
 
 Young
(1826) 5 B & C 259, [1824-34] All ER Rep 377 and 
 Forster v
 
 Outred & Co
[1982] 2 All ER 753, 
[1982] 1 WLR 86
). It is not necessary for the present purpose to decide whether that submission is well founded, but as at present advised, I do not think it is. It seems to me that perhaps where the advice of an architect or consulting engineer leads to the erection of a building which is so defective as to be doomed from the start, the cause of action accrues only when physical damage occurs to the building.
 
 
 
The defendants also rely on 
 Re Robinson`s; Robinson & Co Ltd & Anor v 
 
 Collector of Land Revenue 
 
 [1980-1981] SLR 1 
, in particular, the following passage (at p 257) in the opinion of the Privy Council which reads: 
 
Once the machinery for acquisition has started to operate, which it has under s 5, then, subject to the power to withdraw, the owner of the land who, it is important to observe, has no right to object to the acquisition, has an interest only in compensation. To accept this earlier stage as that from which acquisition is to start, accords with the policy of s 33, and presents the lesser difficulties in practical operation. Their Lordships are, on this point, in favour of the respondent, being of opinion that the operation of s 5 is the critical date.
 
 
 
They argue that the plaintiffs effectively suffered damage when the s 5 notification was gazetted in November 1975. They say that from that date the process or machinery of acquisition of the property had started and from that date the plaintiffs could not deal with the property and thereby suffered damage. It was a loss which was a quantifiable loss.
The plaintiffs` answer to that argument is that it was not self-evident that the plaintiffs suffered some damage when the s 5 notification was gazetted in November 1975. They had not alleged in their pleadings that the market value of the property at the date of the notification was less than the agreed purchase price. They submit that this must depend on the evidence that will be led at the trial. Their contention is that damage occurred when the Collector of Land Revenue made his award on 18 June 1977 and rely on 
 UBAF Ltd v 
 
 European American Banking Ltd 
 
[1984] QB 713
. In that case Ackner LJ who delivered the judgment of the court said: 
 
The plaintiffs are suing in tort - the tort of negligence. To establish a cause of action they must establish not only a breach of duty, but that that the breach of duty occasioned them damage. This is axiomatic. It is possible, although it may be improbable, that, at the date when the plaintiffs advanced their money, the value of the chose in action which they then acquired was, in fact, not less than the sum which the plaintiffs lent, or indeed even exceeded it.
 
 
 
This must depend on the evidence. The mere fact that the innocent but negligent misrepresentations caused the plaintiffs to enter into a contract which they otherwise would not have entered into, does not inevitably mean that they had suffered damage by merely entering into the contract. To take and somewhat modify an example canvassed during the course of argument: A tells B that he wishes to sell his vintage Bentley which he innocently but negligently represents is a blue label long chassis. it is, in fact, a red label short chassis. If A had known, he would not have agreed to buy the Bentley, because he only collects blue label long chassis Bentleys. Assume, however, that the red label short chassis Bentleys were at all material times significantly the more valuable cars so that he was able to resell at a profit. He has then no cause of action.
In my opinion as soon as the s 5 notification was gazetted it was self-evident that the plaintiffs had suffered some damage, The value of the property to the plaintiffs was at that date reduced because it was property under compulsory acquisition.
If I am wrong, I have to consider another point raised by the plaintiffs in answer to the defendants` plea under the Limitation Act (Cap 10). The plaintiffs rely on s 29 which so far as material, reads: 
 
Where in the case of any action for which a period of limitation is prescribed by this Act, either - (b) the right of action is concealed by the fraud of (the defendant); ...
 
 
 
the period of limitation shall not run until the plaintiff has discovered the fraud ... or could by reasonable diligence have discovered it.
 
 
 
The plaintiffs` allegation in para 5 of the statement of claim is that the Urban Renewal Department`s reply of 29 March 1974 was not disclosed to them by the defendants` firm.
The argument is that this letter should have been passed on to the plaintiffs with, the advice that if the plaintiffs proceeded with their proposed purchase of the property there was a substantial risk that the property would be compulsorily acquired. They submit that this non-disclosure is significant enough to enable them to rely on s 29 and is an arguable point for the case to go to trial in an application to strike out the writ on the ground that the action is statute-barred. They submit that this is non-disclosure which amounts to `fraud` within the meaning of s 29. They rely on a passage in the judgment of Lord Evershed MR in
 Kitchen v 
 
 Royal Air Forces Association 
 [1958] 2 All ER 563. 
 
A necessary consequence of the concealment was, as they must, if they had given any thought to the matter at all, have realized, was a concealment also from the plaintiff of the real effect of their having thrown away - and I use that word deliberately - any case which she might have possessed under the Fatal Accidents Acts in the previous May. Does, however, that concealment amount to fraud? I repeat that there is no finding and no justification for any finding of dishonesty as that word is ordinarily understood. But it is now clear that the word `fraud` in the section which I have read, is by no means limited to common law fraud or deceit. Equally, it is clear, having regard to the decision in 
 Beaman v
 
 ARTS Ltd
that no degree of moral attitude is necessary to establish fraud within the section. What is covered by equitable fraud is a matter which Lord Hardwicke did not attempt to define 200 years ago, and I certainly shall not attempt to do so now, but it is, I think, clear that the phrase covers conduct which, having regard to some special relationship between the two parties concerned, is an unconscionable thing for the one to do towards the other.
 
 
 
The defendants submit the non-disclosure relied on by the plaintiffs cannot amount to conduct which is unconscionable.
In my view, it is arguable that a necessary consequence of the defendants` failure to disclose to the plaintiffs the contents of the reply by the Urban Renewal Department, which they received before the plaintiffs had contracted to purchase the property, was, as they must have realized if they had given the matter any thought at all, a concealment from the plaintiffs of the real likelihood that the property would be compulsorily acquired in the near future.
Accordingly, the application is dismissed with costs in any event.

The plaintiff claimed damages against the two defendants for negligence and defamation. Before this action came on for hearing the second defendant, Dr BK Sen, settled with the plaintiff by paying $15,000 damages and the plaintiff withdrew his action against Dr Sen.
The short facts are these. In 1978 the plaintiff, then a student, applied to the Canadian High Commission in Singapore for a student visa to study psychology at Brandon University, Manitoba, Canada. He was given a panel of doctors to see for a medical examination. He went to Dr Sen, on 29 April 1978. Dr Sen sent him to the first defendants, the Medical Laboratory (Pte) Ltd (the Medical Lab) for a VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) blood test to be carried out on the plaintiff. Two types of tests were carried out on 29 April - VDRL and FTA/ABS (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody-Absorption). The Medical Lab submitted a report dated 2 May 1978 (PB 1) to Dr Sen. The results were: `VDRL - Reactive (two units) and FTA/ABS - Reactive`. The report was signed by Dr Tan Kheng Khoo.
The plaintiff was called and he went to see Dr Sen on 5 May. Dr Sen said that he had received the results of the blood test from the Medical Lab and that the plaintiff`s blood was syphilitic. The plaintiff was stunned as he knew for a fact that he did not have syphilis and he told Dr Sen this. Dr Sen then told him to go to the AM Laboratory with a letter. The plaintiff went there the same afternoon. AM Laboratory conducted a blood test VDRL (RPR). On the same day AM Laboratory handed the plaintiff their report (PB 5). The result was negative.
The plaintiff brought the report PB 5 immediately to Dr Sen who told the plaintiff that The Medical Lab would be asked to do another test. Dr Sen wrote to Dr Tan Kheng Khoo on May 8 (PB 2) to `... repeat his VDRL and FTA if necessary and confirm with SGH`. The plaintiff went to the Medical Lab with his father, Fileman Salaysay. A sample of blood was taken from the plaintiff. The VDRL test and the FTA/ABS test were repeated that afternoon. That same afternoon half of the plaintiff`s blood was sent to the Department of Pathology. The Medical Lab forwarded their report to Dr Sen on 9 May after doing another test on May 9 (PB 3). The results were: `VDRL: Reactive (two units); FTA/ABS: Reactive`. The report PB 3 was sent to Dr Sen before the receipt of the report from the Department of Pathology which was given on the May 11 (PB 4). The results were: `VDRL - weakly reactive (without dilution); FTA/ABS - Borderline`.
The plaintiff was again called to see Dr Sen who told him that the results of the second blood tests done by the Medical Lab were again positive and that he was obliged to forward the report of the Medical Lab to the Canadian High Commission.
The plaintiff immediately went back to the AM Lab on 17 May and told them of the conflicting results of the blood tests. AM Lab did two tests. The results were: `RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) - Non-Reactive; FTA/ABS - Non-Reactive` (PB 6).
The blood sample of the plaintiff was also sent to the Department of Pathology by AM Lab for confirmation of the results. On 18 May, the Department of Pathology reported: `NRT - Non-Reactive; FTA - Non-Reactive` (PB 7).
On 17 May the plaintiff then went and informed Dr Sen of the results of the tests carried out by AM Lab. The plaintiff was then informed that Dr Sen had already sent the Preliminary Medical Examination form duly filled to the Canadian High Commission (D1). The findings of the Medical Lab were attached. In the column `Conclusions or Diagnosis` Dr Sen wrote `Has evidence of Syphilis - Serological`.
The plaintiff then telephoned the Canadian High Commission and was told that his visa had not yet been approved. On another occasion he was informed that the visa would not be issued until his medical examination was satisfactory. He then received a copy of a letter dated 1 June 1978, addressed to Dr Sen from the Canadian High Commission (exh P1). In that letter Dr Sen was requested to supply additional information that was required by the Commission`s Medical Service in Singapore.
The plaintiff then went to consult solicitors who said that they would get in touch with Dr Sen and the Canadian High Commission. During this period the plaintiff went for further blood test of his own accord.
He went to the Singapore Blood Transfusion Service to donate blood. At his request the Senior Haematologist of the Blood Transfusion Service gave him the results of the blood test carried out (PB 8). The letter dated 17 June 1978, stated `results of all the investigations are normal. You may if you wish donate blood again`.
At the request of Dr Sen the plaintiff went to the Middle Road Hospital on 21 June for a serological test for syphilis. The report dated 28 June was: `VDRL-Non-Reactive; FTA/ABS - Non-Reactive` (PB 9).
On 29 June 1978, armed with a letter from his solicitors (AB 3) he went to see the First Secretary in the Canadian High Commission and asked for the visa to be issued to enable him to leave for Canada immediately. He was told that the visa would be issued if he was certified cured of syphilis.
A week later Dr Sen requested the plaintiff to go for a further blood test at the Department of Pathology. The report dated 7 July was: `VDRL - Non-Reactive; FTA/ABS - Non-Reactive` (PB 10).
The visa was finally granted on 18 July 1978, and the plaintiff left for Canada on 12 August 1978.
The plaintiff pleaded that the Medical Lab was negligent in that (a) they failed `to conduct, on two separate occasions, a proper blood test on the plaintiff`; (b) they failed `to take, on two separate occasions, all reasonable and effective measures whether by independent examination, confirmation or otherwise, to ensure that there would be no risk of a false report`; (c) they made `the report and conveying the same to the Second Defendants on two separate occasions when they knew or ought to have known that the results would be passed on to the Canadian High Commission who, in the First Defendants` reasonable contemplation, would place reliance upon its correctness in making their decision with respect to the Plaintiff`s visa application`.
The plaintiff further pleaded that (a) the Medical Lab falsely and negligently wrote and published of the plaintiff the following words in their laboratory reports dated 2 May 1978, and 9 May 1978, (PB 1 and PB 3): 
 
Tests Results
 
 
 
VDRL Reactive (two units)
 
 
 
FTA/ABS Reactive;
 
 
 
(b) these findings were sent to Dr Sen who in turn reported the same to the Canadian High Commission; (c) the Medical Lab again reported falsely and negligently that the plaintiff`s blood was reactive; (d) by those words (in the reports) the Medical Lab and Dr Sen meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff`s blood was syphilitic and which same words impute that the plaintiff at the material time is suffering from venereal disease and the contents of the report was subsequently also conveyed to the Canadian High Commission; (e) by reason of the said publication, the plaintiff encountered undue difficulties in obtaining the student visa, sustained pain and suffering in having to undergo six blood tests, suffered anguish and has been injured in his reputation.
In their defence the Medical Lab pleaded that each of the occasions of publication alleged was an occasion of qualified privilege.
In his reply the plaintiff alleged that in publishing the words set out in their reports of 2 May and 9 May the first defendants, the Medical Lab, were actuated by express malice in that the first defendants published the words complained of recklessly and that they had no honest belief in the truth of the said words.
The plaintiff maintains that the findings of the blood tests by the Medical Lab were wrong.
In the first test the laboratory technician drew the blood and did the VDRL test and the FTA/ABS test was carried out by the biochemist. On 8 May the same laboratory technician repeated the VDRL test and the biochemist repeated the FTA/ABS test. Having obtained the same results Dr Tan Kheng Khoo together with the laboratory technician and the biochemist went through these two respective tests on 9 May on the same serum. That was the third time that these tests were done. The same results were obtained.
Dr Tan Kheng Khoo is a well qualified person. He is a Consultant Pathologist to the Department of Pathology, his qualifications are - AM; MBBS; DCP; Dip Path; FAC Path; FRC Path; FRCPA; FRCP. Before buying the Medical Lab in 1971, he was for 13 years working in the Department of Pathology and became the Head of the Department.
Dr Tan Kheng Khoo never saw the plaintiff after the 8 May nor did he see the reports PB 5 to PB 10. He was not even aware of these reports except that he was told of PB 5 (the report of AM Lab of 5 May) by the plaintiff`s father on 8 May. It was the plaintiff`s father who asked Dr Tan why was it that the Medical Lab found that the plaintiff`s blood was syphilitic whereas AM Lab found otherwise. Both the plaintiff and his father agreed that Dr Tan did not tell them that the plaintiff was syphilitic. The plaintiff said that it was Dr Sen who told him that and that the first time he heard the word `syphilis` from Dr Sen.
The plaintiff contracted chicken pox in April 1978. The plaintiff said he told Dr Sen of this. The plaintiff said that his father asked Dr Tan whether chicken pox would affect the result of the test and `Dr Tan did not say categorically whether yes or no`.
Dr Tan said that he did not discuss with the plaintiff his medical history. It was not his duty. He was not told by Dr Sen that the plaintiff had had chicken pox. Dr Sen in the Preliminary Medical Examination Form (exh D1), which was returned to the Canadian High Commission, did not mention that the plaintiff had just recovered from chicken pox. Dr Seet Ai Mee, who was a partner in AM Lab in 1978, said that she did not recall the plaintiff mentioning chicken pox otherwise she would have been alerted for possible BFP (biological false positive). Dr Jimmy Sng, Head of Serological Laboratory, Department of Pathology, did not remember if the plaintiff told him that he had had chicken pox but he heard it from Dr Sen just before Dr Sen sent the plaintiff to see him on 7 July 1978. It seems to me that the probabilities were that the plaintiff did not mention to Dr Tan that he had had chicken pox in April 1978.
The Medical Lab used the Wellcome Laboratories` way of reporting. It has not been suggested that the Wellcome Laboratories` reporting system is a wrong or improper way. The Department of Pathology adopted a different way of reporting. Dr Jimmy Sng said that he knew the Wellcome Laboratories` system, it was a different system to the one used by the Department of Pathology which used a system that was an internationally agreed way. In 1979 the Wellcome Laboratories switched to the internationally agreed system of reporting, the one used by the Department of Pathology in 1978. Dr Tan said that if he had to report the result which he found in 1978 now his result would be the same as the result of the Department of Pathology and Dr Jimmy Sng said that it would be compatible.
The AM Lab did only the VDRL (RPR) test on 5 May (PB 5). The Medical Lab did both VDRL and FTA/ABS tests on 29 April. Dr Roger Pang Heng Mun, who was the Medical Officer at Middle Road Hospital from 1973 to 1980 and now in private practice, said that RPR test and VDRL test were similar tests and that RPR test was considered more sensitive than VDRL test in picking up syphilis. In cross-examination Dr Roger Pang was asked: 
 
V: first report of Med Lab was on 2 May 78, the second report of Med Lab was 9 May 1978, when the second test specimen was sent to GH and their test shows FTA/ABS Borderline, what would be the likely result of FTA/ABS if done by AM Lab on May 5?
 
 
 
and he answered 
 
Assuming that the patient is either syphilitic or showing a BFP the result could have been borderline or reactive.
 
 
 
V: The plaintiff suffered from chicken pox three weeks to a month before the first test done by Med Lab, also the plaintiff is not certain if he went for small pox inoculation sometime around that period. What would be the result of the test carried out after the chicken pox or small pox vaccination?
 
 
 
His answer was: 
 
The test would either be non-reactive or showing BFP.
 
 
 
Dr Jimmy Sng was asked this question by counsel for the plaintiff: 
 
K: PB 4 and PB 5, there are three test reports in these two pages. The difference in time in the collection of the blood specimen between PB 4 and PB 5 is three days. Yet these three tests had different reports. Would you say that there is something wrong with one of the tests?
 
 
 
His answer was: 
 
I would point out that VDRL test and the RPR test are different tests and I am not surprised at differences in results.
 
 
 
Counsel for the Medical Lab referred Dr Jimmy Sng to the report of the Medical Lab `FTA/ABS: Reactive; VDRL: Reactive: two units` and to the Department of Pathology`s report of 11 May 1978 `VDRL: Weakly reactive (without dilution; FTA/ABS: Borderline` (PB 4) and the doctor replied: 
 
Looking at these results it showed there is some reactivity. I would say that the serum is behaving in an abnormal way; not the patient.
 
 
 
Counsel for the Medical Lab referred the doctor to AM Lab report (PB 5) of 5 May `VDRL (RPR) Negative` and asked this question: 
 
V: This test done six days after the test done by Med Lab and five days the test done by GH (PB 4 bottom half). If AM Lab had carried out FTA/ABS test on 5 May would have given a borderline reading or reactive reading.
 
 
 
His answer was: 
 
I would have expected something of a borderline reading.
 
 
 
The plaintiff called a number of medical witnesses. It is clear from their evidence that something was wrong with the plaintiff`s blood during the period 29 April and 11 May 1978. The Medical Lab was merely asked to do the blood test and report on it as they found it and do nothing more. If a repeat test is required this again is done at the request of the referring doctor. In this case three tests in all were carried out by the Medical Lab and also a confirmatory test by the Department of Pathology. Four tests in all were done in a period of ten days.
The Medical Lab`s findings PB 3 had been confirmed by the Department of Pathology (PB 4).
The medical witnesses agreed that the interpretation of the results of the blood tests done by the laboratory is to be done by the referring doctor. In this case it was the duty of the referring doctor Dr Sen to diagnose whether it was syphilis or a BFP reading after all the clinical assessments had been done. This duty did not extend to the Medical Lab at all. Dr Tan Kheng Khoo never used the word `syphilis` to the plaintiff or his father.
The plaintiff has failed to substantiate his allegation that the findings of the Medical Lab were wrong.
It was suggested by counsel for the plaintiff that the Medical Lab did not send the report of the Department of Pathology PB 4 to Dr Sen and that the Medical Lab was negligent in the manner in which they reported the test results to Dr Sen. There is no substance at all in this allegation.
The plaintiff also alleged that the Medical Lab`s actions in preparing the reports PB 1 and PB 3, which were subsequently conveyed to the Canadian High Commission, whereby they falsely and negligently wrote and published the words complained of were actuated by express malice in that they published the words complained of recklessly and that they had no honest belief in the truth of the said words nor had they withdrawn the said words complained of nor had they given or offered any apology or correction or explanation.
Each and everyone of the medical witnesses have said that, as the reports PB 1, PB 3 and PB 4 stood, it would be impossible to say whether the plaintiff was suffering from syphilis or was it a case of BFP. How then can an ordinary person draw any meaning let alone the natural meaning of the words complained of?
On the question of republication which is exh D1, the report by Dr Sen to the Canadian High Commission at p 2 under `Conclusions or Diagnosis`, Dr Sen had written `Has evidence of syphilis - serological`. The reports PB 1, PB 3, PB 4 submitted by the Medical Lab to Dr Sen, no where in these reports was the word `syphilis` used. The publication to the Canadian High Commission was not publication of what the Medical Lab said but rather the conclusions or diagnosis of Dr Sen and the use of the word `syphilis`. If there was any defamatory matter of the plaintiff which was published it was done by Dr Sen to the Canadian High Commission and not from the Medical Lab to the Canadian High Commission.
It was Dr Tan Kheng Khoo who suggested to Dr Sen that if he had the same results he would like to send the serum to the Department of Pathology for another test and that was why Dr Sen wrote the letter PB 2. Dr Tan Kheng Khoo took all the steps that were possible to confirm his own results and the Department of Pathology confirmed the findings of Dr Tan that there was something wrong with the plaintiff`s blood.
There was neither recklessness nor malice which would defeat the defence of qualified privilege.
It would appear that the plaintiff would go to any length to meet the defence of qualified privilege. It was reckless of the plaintiff to have alleged malice on the part of the Medical Lab when there is no iota of evidence to substantiate it.
The plaintiff`s claim against the Medical Lab is dismissed with costs.

The only ground upon which leave to appeal is sought in the present case is in order to challenge the constitutionality of ss 121(6) and (7) and s 122(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code of Singapore.
Section 121(6) requires a person charged with an offence, or officially informed that he may be prosecuted for it, to be given a notice in writing advising him that if there is any fact which he intends to rely upon in his defence in court he should mention it then and warning him that, if he holds it back until he goes to court, his evidence may be less likely to be believed. Section 122(1) provides that at his trial the court may draw such inferences as appear proper from his failure to mention, in response to such a warning, a fact on which he has sought to rely.
So far from mentioning any exculpatory facts, the petitioner in the instant case, in response to the warning given to him under s 121(6), embarked upon a full confession, the accuracy of which was corroborated by real evidence discovered at the place where he had said that it would be found.
The petition in the instant case was lodged before this Board (in 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP 
 
 [1980-1981] SLR 73 
) had given its reasons for rejecting a similar challenge to the constitutionality of s 188(2) and ss 195(1) and (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code which relate to the allocution to be addressed to the defendant when calling on him to enter on his defence and warning him that the court may draw such inferences as appear proper from his failure to give evidence on oath, if he should decide not to do so.
The reasons given by this Board for dismissing the appeal in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
, mutatis mutandis, to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code which the petitioner would seek to challenge if leave to appeal were granted. Their Lordships are of the opinion that these provisions plainly do not contravene the Constitution.
Leave to appeal is accordingly refused.

At about 1pm on 23 May 1977 five customs officers led by Assistant Superintendent of Customs Cheong Wah Yong (ASC Cheong) were in a customs staff car travelling along Beach Road towards Customs House in Maxwell Road. When they approached the Golden Mile Shopping Complex, they spotted a Volvo car, No E 2237U parked on the left hand side of the road in front of the complex. As they had information concerning this car, they stopped their car about 20 metres behind the Volvo car and kept observation of it. The appellant was in the driver`s seat. He was alone.
About 15 minutes later, a Fiat car, No EA 6282Z, came and stopped immediately behind the Volvo car. The driver of the car was Koh Hoon Seng (Koh). The appellant alighted from his car and walked towards the Fiat car. He was carrying a rolled up white plastic bag. He walked up to Koh and handed the white plastic bag through the front driver`s window. He then returned to his car and drove off.
Koh then drove his car another 50 metres and stopped in front of the Golden Theatre. The customs party in turn drove forward, parked their car a little ahead of the Fiat car and continued their observation. Koh got out of the car. He went to the lobby of the Golden Theatre and bought some cinema tickets. He then returned to his car and got into the driver`s seat. Before he could drive off, ASC Cheong and his men closed in on him.
ASC Cheong identified himself. Koh was ordered to get into the rear seat of the car. ASC Cheong searched the car. Under the front driver`s seat he recovered the white plastic bag. When asked about the bag, Koh said that it contained `peh hoon` meaning `white powder` which is how heroin is described in Chinese by drug takers and drug traffickers. ASC Cheong found in the plastic bag two small parcels. In them were altogether twenty-six plastic packets filled with brownish substance. Koh was arrested, and he and his car were taken to Customs House.
Subsequently, the 26 packets of brownish substance were analysed by the senior scientific officer of the Department of Scientific Services and found to contain 111.96g of diamorphine, a controlled drug, under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 (the Act).
On these facts the trial judges held that as it was the appellant who gave the plastic bag containing the diamorphine to Koh, and, having regard to the definition of `traffic` in s 2 of the Act, a prima facie case had been made out against him on the charge of not being authorised by the Act or the regulations made thereunder, he did traffic in a controlled drug, an offence punishable under s 3(a) of the Act.
Moreover, the trial judges accepted the voluntary statement the appellant gave to ASC Cheong on the night of his arrest. The statement was taken down in writing by ASC Cheong under s 121(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (the Code). The complaint is that the trial judges had erred in law in admitting as evidence that voluntary statement.
Put shortly, the submission for the appellant was that as an officer of customs is not a police officer, ASC Cheong had no power to record the statement from the appellant under the provisions of the Code. In the context of this proposition, counsel for the appellant referred us to the powers given to an officer of customs in ss 21 to 23 of the Act which read as follows: 
 
21(1) An officer of the Bureau, a police officer not below the rank of assistant superintendent of police or any police officer authorized by him or any senior officer of customs may at any time -
 
 
 
 
(a) without a warrant enter and search any place or premises in which he reasonably suspects that there is to be found a controlled drug or article liable to seizure;
  
 
 
 
(b) search any person found in such place or premises; and
  
 
 
 
(c) seize and detain any controlled drug found in such place or premises, or any article liable to seizure.
  
 
 
 
(2) For the purpose of exercising his power under this section an officer may, with such assistance as he deems necessary, break open any door, window, lock, fastener, floor, wall, ceiling, compartment, box, container or any other thing.
  
 
 
 
(22) (1) An officer of the Bureau, a police officer, an officer of customs, or any special police officer or member of the vigilante corps authorised in writing by a police officer not below the rank of assistant superintendent of police, may arrest without a warrant any person who has committed or whom he reasonably suspects to have committed an offence under this Act.
  
 
 
 
(2) Any person so arrested shall, together with any article which is liable to seizure, be taken to the Central Narcotics Bureau, a police station or a customs station and may be searched.
  
 
 
 
(3) No female shall be searched under this Act except by a female officer.
  
 
 
 
(4) An officer making an arrest under this section may seize and detain any article liable to seizure.
  
 
 
 
(23) (1) An officer of the bureau, a police officer or an officer of customs may -
  
 
 
 
(a) stop, board and search any ship, hovercraft, aircraft, vehicle or train if he has reason to suspect that there is therein any controlled drug in contravention of this Act or any article liable to seizure;
  
 
 
 
(b) search any person in such ship, hovercraft, aircraft, vehicle or train; and
  
 
 
 
(c) search any person arriving in Singapore or about to depart from Singapore.
  
 
 
 
(2) An officer may seize and detain any controlled drug or article liable to seizure as a result of any search under this section, and may seize and detain any ship, hovercraft, aircraft, vehicle or train which has been used in the commission of or in connection with an offence under this Act.
  
 
 
It was submitted that these sections show that the power given to an officer of customs under the Act limit such an officer when he arrests a person for an offence under the Act to hand the person over to a police office or to a narcotics officer of the central narcotics bureau. It follows, and so the submission was, that an officer of customs has no power to carry out any investigations relating to drug offences or to charge a person for any such offence under the Act. Alternatively, it was submitted that an officer of customs may charge a person for an offence under the Act, but that he had no power to record a statement under the provisions of the Code. It was therefore contended that ASC Cheong had illegally recorded the statement which should not have been admitted in evidence.
In considering that submission, it is of assistance to look at the law before the enactment of the Act. The starting point is Ordinance No IV of 1870, an Ordinance `for collecting a Revenue of Excise on Spirituous Liquors and Intoxicating Drugs` (See 
 Harwoods 
Vol 1, Acts and Ordinances of the Colony of the Straits Settlements p 146.) At that time, in the dim history of modern Singapore, the farming of opium was legal, and a person given that privilege was known as an `Opium Farmer`. The ordinance made provisions, inter alia, for the chandu and opium, and penal provisions for dealing in contraband. Revenue officers, the present day customs officers, were appointed to enforce the ordinance and police officers were given the powers of revenue officers.
Then came `The Opium Ordinance 1906` which repealed and consolidated a number of previous Ordinances. It made no material changes to the law for the collection of revenue of excise on opium. What is of interest in this appeal is that it was in this ordinance that revenue and police officers were given powers similar to those provided in ss 21 to 23 of the Act (see ss 51 to 53 of the Ordinance).
Then in 1909, the Chandu Revenue Ordinance repealed the Ordinance of 1906 and gave `the Government the exclusive right to prepare and sell chandu`. Under the Ordinance, the farming of opium ceased and opium farmers made over to the superintendent of chandu at market value all opium and chandu in their possession, and all other things used by them in the manufacture and preparation of chandu. The powers vested in revenue officers under the Ordinance of 1906 were re-enacted (see Cap 223 of the 1936 Edition of the Laws of the Straits Settlement).
It was not till after the second world war that the Opium and Chandu Proclamation (No 43 of 1946) issued by the British Military Administration prohibited the sale and purchase of opium and chandu. In 1951 the proclamation was replaced and in its place there was enacted the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance (No 7 of 1951) which was in the statute book as Cap 137 of the 1955 Edition of the Laws of the Colony of Singapore, and then as Cap 151 of the 1970 revised edition of our statutes, of which the Act is the successor. For our purpose, it is sufficient to note that in Pt VI of each of these ordinances are provisions giving officers of customs powers that were vested in them in the previous ordinances and are identical to those in ss 21 to 23 of the Act.
So then, for over a hundred years, revenue officers (later officers of customs) together with police officers have administered the laws relating to dangerous drugs. Under the powers given to them, officers of customs arrested and investigated into offences against those laws; and they also prosecuted offenders (as they do today in our subordinate courts) for the customs department. If what is submitted for the appellant is correct, everything that officers of customs have been doing for the many decades has been unlawful.
In our judgment, the submission is without substance. It altogether ignores the power given to an officer of customs who arrests a person without a warrant to take the person, together with any article seized, to a customs station. At the station the person and the article may be searched. It follows therefore that an officer of customs has a duty to investigate into the facts leading to the arrest and seizure. If, after investigation, the facts so warrant he must charge the person in court for an offence under the Act, for arrest is the first strp in the administration of justice. On the other hand, if there is no sufficient case for detaining the person, the officer of customs must release him immediately. (See 
 Wiltshire v Barrett 
[1966] 1 QBD 312, 325 per Lord Denning MR at p 325.)
The powers given to officers of customs to arrest, search, seize and detain under the old ordinances, and in the Act, are similar to the powers given to police officers under the Criminal Procedure Code, and are not dissimilar from those exercised by a `constable` in England in effecting arrest of a person suspected of committing a felony. In the case of 
 Dallison v Caffery 
[1965] 1 QBD 348, 367 Lord Denning MR at p 367 said: 
 
When a constable has taken into custody a person reasonably suspected of felony, he can do what is reasonable to investigate the matter, and to see whether the suspicions are supported or not by further evidence. He can, for instance, take the person suspected to his own house to see whether any of the stolen property is there; else it may be removed and valuable evidence lost. He can take the person suspected to the place where he says he was working, for there he may find persons to confirm or refute his alibi. The constable can put him up on an identification parade to see if he is picked out by the witnesses. So long as such measures are taken reasonably, they are an important adjunct to the administration of justice. By which I mean, of course, justice not only to the man himself but also to the community at large. The measures must, however, be reasonable.
 
 
 
These are some of the measures that officers of customs have been executing historically in accordance with the law. Now under the Act, in addition to officers of customs and police officers, there are narcotics officers and a new law enforcement agency, the Central Narcotics Bureau. But the Act has not derogated from any of the powers of officers of customs or deprived the customs department of the powers of enforcing the Act.
Next, given that an officer of customs has a duty to investigate and charge offenders under the Act, in our judgment, ASC Cheong was empowered under s 121(6) read with s 121(8) of the Code to record a statement from him. The trial judges having held that it was a voluntary statement admitted it in evidence.
Finally, there was another submission that a Scientific Officer is not a `Government chemist`, and a certificate given by the former is not a valid certificate under s 14 of the Act that prima facie the 26 packets contained 111.96g of diamorphine. The short answer is the Senior Scientific Officer gave evidence at the trial, and the totality of his evidence was not challenged by the appellant who was represented by counsel. Therefore, to come to this court and taken an objection to the admissibility of the report tendered at the trial, referred to in s 14 of the Act as `a certificate`, is, in our judgment, devoid of merit. However, to put the matter beyond doubt, even if the senior scientific officer had not given evidence, we are satisfied that a certificate purporting to be signed by him complies with s 14 of the Act. As regards a certificate of a scientific officer, it must on the face of it show that the scientific officer is a chemist in the service of Government as a scientific officer can be a qualified officer other than a chemist (see 
 Gazette 
Notification No S46 of 1977).

This was an appeal against the decision of the High Court (see 
 
 [1978-1979] SLR 574 
). At the conclusion of the appeal, Wee Chong Jin CJ, delivering oral judgment of the court, reversed the findings of fact of the trial court as to how the logs rolled off the lorry. The Court of Appeal accepted the defendant`s version as to why the logs rolled off the lorry, that it was the plaintiff who knocked off the last wedge in the lorry, causing the logs to roll off.
Their Lordships also found that the system of work adopted by the defendant/appellant company was not safe, since it involved the human agency to knock off the wedges. It was the view of their Lordships that since persons were required to knock off the wedges, an accident may happen if the persons involved in knocking off the wedges were careless or negligent. In the premise, their Lordships found both the respondent and the appellant equally to blame for the accident and consequently, damages for the respondent were reduced by half and the respondent was ordered to pay the costs of the appeal to the appellant.

The appellant, Richard Charles Tarling, was convicted by the High Court on the following five charges: 
 
First charge:
 
 
 
That you, Richard Charles Tarling, together with Donald Edgar Ogilvy Watson and Ian Keith Tamblyn, on or about 19 April 1973, being directors of Haw Par Brothers International Ltd wilfully failed to comply with the provisions of s 169(6)(o) of the Companies Act (Cap 185), in that in the report by the directors of the said company with respect to the profit of the said company for the financial year ended 31 December 1972 and state of the company`s affairs as at the end of the said year you failed to state with appropriate details that you were aware of circumstances not otherwise dealt with in the said report or the accounts which rendered the amount of profit stated in the accounts misleading and failed to give particulars of the sale of Grey Securities Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the said company, on 28 June 1972 to Legis Ltd, the trustee of the Melbourne unit trust, and of the creation of the said Trust and the profits of Grey Securities Ltd and of Cobra Investments Ltd, which were not reflected in the said accounts which were circumstances rendering the amount stated as aforesaid misleading and that you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 171(1) and (4) of the said Act.
 
 
 
Second charge:
 
 
 
That you, Richard Charles Tarling, together with Donald Edgar Ogilvy Watson and Ian Keith Tamblyn, on or about 19 April 1973, being directors of Haw Par Brothers International Ltd, wilfully failed to comply with the provisions of s 169(6)(p) of the Companies Act, Cap 185, in that in the report by the directors of the said company with respect to the profit of the said company for the financial year ended 31 December 1972 and the state of the company`s affairs as to the end of the said year you wilfully failed to state with appropriate details that the results of the said company`s operations during the financial year were, in the opinion of the directors, substantially affected by a transaction of a material and unusual nature, namely, the sale at a cost valuation of Grey Securities Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the said company, on 28 June 1972 to Legis Ltd, the trustee of the Melbourne unit trust, with very substantial profits realised by the said subsidiary prior to the said sale, and failed to give particulars of the said sale and the effect thereof, which were known or reasonably ascertainable, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 171(1) and (4) of the said Act.

Fifth charge:
 
 
 
That you, Richard Charles Tarling, together with Donald Edgar Ogilvy Watson and Ian Keith Tamblyn, on or about the month of May 1974 being directors of Haw Par Brothers International Ltd, wilfully failed to take all reasonable steps to secure compliance with s 169(4) of the Companies Act (Cap 185), in that the profit and loss account for the company aforesaid for the financial year ended 31 December 1973 laid before the said company at its annual general meeting failed to give a true and fair view of the profit of the said company for the said financial year as shown in the accounting and other records of the said company by wilfully failing to secure that the said account disclosed the existence and structure of the Melbourne unit trust and the extent to which the said profit arose from profits made by Grey Securities Ltd, and Cobra Investments Ltd, prior to the said financial year and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 171(1) and (4) of the said Act.
 
 
 
He was sentenced to six months` imprisonment on each of the first three charges and to one day`s imprisonment on each of the other two charges, the sentences to run concurrently. He now appeals against the convictions and sentences.
The undisputed prosecution evidence can be briefly summarised. In June 1971 Slater Walker Securities Ltd of the United Kingdom, a big financial conglomerate with a large number of subsidiaries and engaged in a variety of businesses like banking, property and insurance extended their sphere of activities to Singapore and the Far East by acquiring a near fifty percent interest in Haw Par Brothers International Ltd (HPBIL), a Singapore company. In Hong Kong HPBIL had a wholly owned subsidiary called Haw Par Brothers Hong Kong Ltd (HPBHK). On this acquisition the appellant who was a director of Slater Walker Securities Ltd along with four other Slater Walker executives were appointed to the Board of HPBIL. Watson, whose name appears in all the five charges was one of the Slater Walker executives so appointed. Executives of Slater Walker Securities Ltd were also appointed to the Board of HPBHK. Those executives were paid by Slater Walker Singapore Ltd (SWS), a wholly owned subsidiary of Slater Walker Securities Ltd. SWS charged a management fee for their services. Thus SWS and Slater Walker Securities Ltd had a de facto influence in and control of the day to day administration of HPBIL and HPBHK.
On 29 February 1972 HPBIL acquired seven million shares representing 70% of the issued share capital of HK$1 each in a Hong Kong company called Kwan Loong & Co (Hong Kong) Ltd (KL), a public company quoted on the Far East Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. The purchase price was HK$1.20 per share. The total cost was met by the allocation to the vendors of 1,066,330 shares in HPBIL which were issued for the purpose of this transaction. Those seven million KL shares were transferred by HPBIL to its Hong Kong subsidiary HPBHK, a dealing company for HK$27,929,226 as evidenced by a debit entry in the books of HPBHK. In September 1971 before this transaction, the appellant, on the death of Mr Aw, the then chairman of HPBIL, was appointed chairman and in December 1971 Watson was appointed managing director of HPBIL.
On 8 March 1972 HPBHK bought 6,663,000 shares in another Hong Kong public company quoted on the Far East Stock Exchange of Hong Kong called Kung Fung Development Ltd (KF) for HK$2.85 per share. The total price of HK$18,989,550 was paid in cash.
At the time the KL and KF shares were acquired the share markets in Singapore and Hong Kong were experiencing boom conditions and prices of most stocks and shares were continually rising. Soon after their acquisition the prices of KL and KF shares started to move up rapidly. At the end of March 1972 KL shares were quoted at HK$6.50 and KF shares at HK$4.80. By the end of April 1972 their prices had risen to HK$7.40 and HK$6.40 respectively and by the end of May 1972 their prices had soared even higher to HK$16 and HK$7.80 respectively. From 17 March 1972 HPBHK started selling its holding of KF shares in small lots and began making large profits and by the end of May 1972 when it had sold all its KF shares the total profits amounted to HK$24.8m. After March 1972 HPBHK also started selling its KL shares in small lots and by 28 June 1972 had sold a significant portion of its seven million KL shares with total profits amounting to HK$17.6m. As a result of these sales the profit and loss account of HPBHK for the period 1 January 1972 to 28 June 1972 showed it had made HK$35.4m as realised pre-tax profits. Out of these realised profits an interim dividend of HK$7m due to HPBIL was paid on 28 June 1972 by HPBHK which had on 16 June 1972 been re-named Grey Securities Ltd (Grey). As at 28 June 1972 HPBHK (now Grey) had unrealised profits amounting to HK$24m.
Sometime in April 1972 there was a discussion in Hong Kong between Watson, Johnson-Hill, another SWS executive and Moore, a Hong Kong solicitor on how to avoid having to disclose the huge profits for 1972 for HPBIL arising from the purchase and subsequent dealings in the KL and KF shares by its wholly owned subsidiary HPBHK. It was apparently suggested by Moore that this could be achieved by the creation and use of a unit trust in that whereas profits made by HPBHK would require to be disclosed in the consolidated profit and loss account of HPBIL, the profits of a unit trust would not.
In May 1972 Watson discussed this suggestion with Scothorne, a chartered accountant who had joined HPBIL in January 1972 and became its financial controller but was paid by SWS. According to Scothome, whose evidence was accepted by the trial judge, Watson was the most senior Slater Walker Securities Ltd executive. Although Watson was the executive head of HPBIL he would consult the appellant, who was based in London, on all important matters and there were frequent telex communications between them and before any major decision was taken Watson would always speak to the appellant over the telephone, such telephone conversations taking place about once every fortnight in 1972 and 1973.
The telex messages produced at the trial showed, as found by the trial judge, that although the appellant was only very infrequently in Singapore during the relevant years, he kept in close touch with the activities of HPBIL and directed all major moves and no important step was taken without his prior approval. The trial judge also found that the appellant knew and approved of the purchase of the KL and KF shares, was well aware of the large profits that HPBHK was making from the sales of KF shares in April and May 1972 and was just as keen as Watson was to see that these profits were not disclosed in HPBIL`s mid-year and end year consolidated accounts. The trial judge also found that the appellant was fully aware of the proposal to set up a unit trust to circumvent disclosure of these profits in HPBIL consolidated accounts and actively supported and approved of the setting up of the unit trust called Melbourne Unit Trust (MUT). We accept these findings.
It is convenient at this stage to relate the moves involved in the formation of MUT. Once the idea of setting up a unit trust to avoid consolidating HPBHK accounts with that of HPBIL was accepted towards the end of May 1972 the mechanics of getting the scheme working had to be completed before 20 June 1972. This was to avoid the huge realised profits from HPBHK`s dealings in the KL and KF shares having to be disclosed in the mid-year consolidated accounts of HPBIL. In this way the management of HPBIL had these profits in reserve which could be brought in as profits, as and when necessary, of the group to show a pattern of steady growth over the years.
The appellant, in his chairman`s speech attached to the annual report for the year 1971 when commenting on the results of the group for that year, had claimed that in the second half of the year under the new management (i.e. the SWS executives) the group profits showed a 190% improvement over the first half of the year. With the huge profits from the KL and KF transactions undisclosed as profits and kept in reserve, the SWS executives could, whenever it was necessary to do so, avail themselves of these reserves in future years to show a continuing steady growth of profits of the group under their stewardship. Thus their reputation for management expertise would be enhanced which would not otherwise be if all these profits were disclosed in the 1972 consolidated accounts of the group.
Accordingly, on 2 June 1972 two wholly owned subsidiaries of HPBIL were incorporated in Hong Kong called Adder Investments Ltd (Adder) and Haw Par High Income Ltd (HPHI). Then on 16 June 1972 Adder changed its name to Haw Par Hongkong Ltd (HPHK) and HPBHK changed its name to Grey Securities Ltd (Grey). On 27 June 1972 a trust deed was executed whereby a unit trust called Melbourne unit trust (MUT) was formed. Under the trust deed the trustee of MUT was a trustee company called Legis Ltd which was wholly owned by a Hong Kong solicitors firm Deacons and the managers of the trust were Melbourne Investment Management Ltd (MIM), a wholly owned subsidiary of Stater Walker Hongkong Ltd [SW (HK)].
On 28 June 1972 HPHK and HPHI (the two new wholly owned subsidiaries of HPBIL which were incorporated on 2 June 1972) each subscribed HK$5.999m in cash and were each issued 5,999 units in MUT, each unit costing HK$1,000. SW (HK) and another company called Ida Enterprise Ltd each subscribed for and were each issued one unit in MUT. In the result HPBIL were the beneficiaries of any profits made by MUT.
To complete the implementation of the scheme the following steps were then taken:
 
 
(i) Grey (formerly HPBHK) which owed HPBIL HK$27,929,228 for its purchase of the KL shares, repaid this inter-company debt by paying HK$13,919,228 to HPHK and HK$14,010,000 to HPHI and also paid to HPHK the interim dividend of HK$7m due to HPBIL.
  
 
 
 
(ii) Grey sold 3 million KL shares to HPHI at the base rate of HK$1.20 per share.
  
 
 
 
(iii) HPBIL sold Grey to HPHK at Grey`s book value of HK$10.8m.
  
 
 
 
(iv) HPHK then sold Grey to Legis for HK$10.8m.
  
 
 
The effect of these transactions was to capitalise the exceptionally high and, in a financial sense, adventitious short-term profits of HPBHK (now Grey) by transferring them to the two wholly owned subsidiaries of HPBIL, ie HPHK and HPHI, and paying as dividend HK$7m which had accrued prior to 30 June 1972. Thereafter the activities of Grey (formerly HPBHK), which had enormous realised and unrealised profits, were carried on `below the trust` and thus would not appear in the consolidated accounts of HPBIL. The profits earned, however, would be paid to MUT, who in turn could declare them as dividends in such measures as was considered appropriate or expedient to HPHK and HPHI and thus ultimately to HPBIL.
As shown earlier, Grey before it went `below the trust` on 29 June 1972 had retained realised profits of approximately HK$29m as well as another HK$24m as unrealised profits. By 31 December 1972 the profit and loss account of Grey as a result of its dealing activities, showed that it had for the year ended 31 December 1972 made realised pre-tax profits of HK$42.2m and undistributed profits after tax of HK$27.25m.
The accounts of HPBIL and the consolidated accounts of HPBIL and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 1972 were laid before the company at its annual general meeting held on 18 May 1973. Annexed to those accounts were the chairman`s statement signed by the appellant, the statutory directors` report and the statutory statement of the directors both of which were signed by Watson and Tamblyn on behalf of the directors.
The undisputed evidence was that in those accounts (or in the notes to those accounts which notes are an integral part of the accounts) there was no disclosure of the sale of Grey to Legis the trustee of MUT which resulted in Grey going under the trust. There was also no disclosure of the phenomenal realised profits made by Grey. In the directors` report there was also no mention of these facts and of the formation of MUT or any particulars of MUT.
The chairman`s statement referred to the consolidated pre-tax profits and the consolidate balance sheet assets as compared with the pre-tax profits and assets for the previous year. The directors` report referred to the `Results for the Financial Year` of `The Group` and `The Company`. In their report under the heading `Other Statutory Information` the directors stated: 
 
At the date of this report:
 
 
 
(5) The directors are not aware of any circumstances not otherwise dealt with in the report or accounts which would render any amount stated in the accounts misleading.
 
 
 
In our judgment, from all the facts that we have briefly outlined the conclusion is inescapable that the non-disclosure in the directors` report of the sale of Grey which resulted in its `going under the trust`, the non-disclosure of the creation of MUT and the non-disclosure of the profits of Grey rendered the amount of profits stated in the consolidated accounts misleading.
Also, in our judgment, the sale of Grey at a cost valuation to MUT was a transaction of a material and unusual nature which substantially affected the results of the group`s operations during the financial year 1972 and particulars of which and the effect thereof should have been disclosed in the Directors` Report.
Furthermore, in our judgment, the profit and loss account of the group for the financial year 1972 failed to give a true and fair view of the profit of the group as shown in the accounting and other records of the group because of the non-disclosure in the profit and loss account of the realised profits made by Grey prior to its sale to Legis, the trustee of MUT and of particulars of that sale.
We deal now with the appellant`s submission on the charges. The first submission is based on the words of the charges which stated the offences with which the appellant was charged and stated the particulars of the manner in which the alleged offences were committed. It is pointed out that in all the five charges the appellant in his capacity as a director of Haw Par Brothers International Ltd (HPBIL) was alleged to have wilfully failed to comply with the provisions of s 169 of the Companies Act (Cap 185) in relation to the profit and loss accounts or the balance sheets of HPBIL for the financial years 1972 and 1973. The submission is that since all the prosecution evidence at the trial was directed to prove that the appellant had wilfully failed to comply with the provisions of section 169 in relation to the profit and loss accounts or the balance sheets of HPBIL and its subsidiaries (i.e. of the consolidated accounts of the group) for the financial years 1972 and 1973 and since there was no evidence in relation to the accounts of HPBIL, the holding company, the convictions were wrong in law.
It is plain that there was an error in each of the five charges. The trial judge dealt with the error at p 39 of his judgment as follows: 
 
Though the charges refer to the profit and loss account of the Company (HPBIL) nevertheless from the particulars stated in the charges it is beyond doubt that all these charges referred to the consolidated profit and loss account of the Company and its subsidiaries. The first, second and fourth charges concerned non-disclosures in the directors` report on the consolidated profit and loss account, while the third and fifth charges complain that the consolidated profit and loss account failed to give a true and fair view of the profits of the Company and its subsidiaries by not disclosing the full extent of the profits made by Grey and the particulars of the sale of Grey to MUT.
 
 
 
Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides as follows: 
 
No error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated in the charge and no omission to state the offence or those particulars shall be regarded at any stage of the case as material unless the accused was in fact misled by that error or omission.
 
 
 
Illustrations
 
 
 
(d) Ais charged with the murder of John Smith on 6 June 1891. In fact the murdered person`s name was James Smith and the date of the murder was 5 June 1891. Awas never charged with any murder but one and had heard the inquiry before the Magistrate which referred exclusively to the case of James Smith. The court may infer from these facts that 
 A
was not misled and that the error in the charge was immaterial.
 
 
 
Throughout the very lengthy trial all the evidence and cross-examination of the witnesses called on behalf of the prosecution and of the defence were directed to the consolidated accounts of the group, to the state of affairs of the group and to the manner in which the profits of a Hongkong subsidiary HPBHK were manipulated.
In our judgment s 395 of the Criminal Procedure Code applies. It reads: 
 
Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained no finding, sentence or order passed or made by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered on account of -
 
 
 
(a) any error, omission or irregularity in the complaint, summons, warrant, charge, judgment or other proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other proceeding under this Code;
 
 
 
unless such error, omission, improper admission or rejection of evidence, irregularity or want has occasioned a failure of justice.
 
 
 
It has never been submitted on behalf of the appellant that he has been misled, prejudiced or embarrassed by the error in the charges and in our judgment it is plain beyond doubt that the error relied on by the appellant has not occasioned a failure of justice.
The next submission relates to the allegations in the first, second and fourth charges of non-disclosures in the directors` reports in respect of the profits of HPBIL and all its subsidiaries for the financial years ended 31 December 1972 and 31 December 1973. The submission is that the obligation imposed on the directors of a holding company by s 169(5) to make a report to its share-holders is limited to reporting on the state of affairs of the group and no obligation is imposed on the directors to report on the profit or loss or the results of the group`s operations.
Section 169(5) as first enacted reads as follows: 
 
The directors of a company shall cause to be attached to every balance-sheet made out pursuant to this section a report signed by or on behalf of the directors with respect to the state of the company`s affairs and if the company is a holding company, also a report with respect to the state of affairs of the holding company and all its subsidiaries.
 
 
 
It was amended with effect from 1 October 1971 to read: 
 
The directors of a company shall cause to be attached to every balance-sheet made out under sub-s (3) of this section a report made in accordance with a resolution of the directors and signed by not less than two of the directors with respect to the profit or loss of the company for the financial year and the state of the company`s affairs as at the end of the financial year.
 
 
 
It was re-amended with effect from 5 October 1973 to read: 
 
The directors of a company shall cause to be attached to every balance-sheet made out under sub-s (3) of this section a report made in accordance with a resolution of the directors and signed by not less than two of the directors with respect to the profit or loss of the company for the financial year and the state of the company`s affairs as at the end of the financial year and if the company is a holding company also a report with respect to the state of affairs of the holding company and all its subsidiaries.
 
 
 
We accept the correctness of the submission. Simply as a matter of construction, s 169(5) in its original, amended or re-amended form, does not require the directors of a holding company to report to its share-holders on the profit or loss of the holding company and all its subsidiaries. However, it is pointed out on behalf of the Public Prosecutor that the directors` reports for the financial years ended 31 December 1972 and 31 December 1973 did in fact report not only on the accounts of HPBIL as laid before the share-holders at the annual general meeting but also on the consolidated accounts (the consolidated profit and loss account and the consolidated balance sheet) of HPBIL and all its subsidiaries. Accordingly, it is contended that the directors were obliged to comply with the provisions of s 169(6)(o) and (p) in their reports for the years 1972 and 1973.
We agree with this contention. Although s 169(5) does not impose an obligation on the directors of a holding company to report on the profit or loss of the holding company and all its subsidiaries, the provisions of paras (o) and (p) of s 169(6) must be complied with if the directors, pursuant to s 169(5), attach to the balance sheet a report with respect to the profit or loss of the holding company and all its subsidiaries.
In our opinion, having regard to the provisions of the whole of s 169, directors of any company, including a holding company, are under a statutory duty to draw the attention of the share-holders, in relation to all accounts laid before its share-holders at an annual general meeting, any circumstance not disclosed in the report or the accounts which would render any amount stated in the accounts misleading and to draw the attention of its share-holders to any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature which substantially affected the results of the company`s operations during the financial year.
Another submission in respect of the first, second and fourth charges is that the trial judge was wrong in finding that the appellant`s failure to comply with the provisions of s 169(6)(o) and (p) was wilful. It is pointed out that the appellant was not present at the meetings of the board of directors which approved the reports for the years ended 31 December 1972 and 31 December 1973. The trial judge`s finding was that even though he was not present it was incumbent upon him to see that the directors` report contained the necessary disclosures as required by the Act as he `had taken steps to set in train the MUT scheme which would ensure that the profits made by Grey in 1972 was not disclosed in the consolidated profit and loss account`. We accept this finding as there was ample evidence before the trial judge to support it. It is also urged on the appellant`s behalf that as he relied on a professional accountant Arthur Young who prepared the directors` report, the appellant`s failure to comply could not be wilful. We disagree. On the evidence and on the findings of fact by the trial judge the non-disclosures were not only not unintentional, but in our judgment, were deliberate.
In respect of the third and fifth charges which allege wilful failure to take all reasonable steps to secure compliance with s 169(14) of the Act the submission is that as consolidated accounts were prepared by accountants the appellant had reasonable grounds to believe that the consolidated profit and loss account so prepared would in fact give a true and fair view of the profit of the group and in these circumstances he had taken all reasonable steps to secure compliance with the requirements of the Act. The trial judge rejected this submission and so do we having regard to all the facts as found by the trial judge.
Lastly, it is submitted that the sentences were manifestly excessive. It is common ground that these offences caused no loss to the share-holders of HPBIL and that the appellant derived no personal gain or benefit from his acts or omissions in relation to the offences. Nevertheless, in respect of all the five charges, the finding of the trial judge, with which we agree, was that all the offences were committed wilfully. In our judgment, on all the facts and circumstances and having regard to s 171 of the Act, it cannot be said that the sentences imposed by the trial judge of six months` imprisonment on each of the first three charges and of one day`s imprisonment on each of the other two charges were manifestly excessive. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

The appellant Mathew Bohman occupies premises No 3811D Jalan Bukit Merah, Redhill Industrial Estate, Singapore as tenant of the Jurong Town Corp, the respondents in this appeal. The said premises are a factory unit within a flatted factory block known as Redhill Industrial Estate Block No 1. There are 35 such units in this block. The appellant`s unit is on the second floor of the building. He manufactures festive decorations and craft accessories. There is a loading platform floor or loading bay for the common use of the tenants of the factory block. This platform floor is raised a few feet from the road level so that when a lorry is backed against it, the floor boards of the lorry matches the level of the platform and this facilitates the loading of goods off and on the lorry. There is a short flight of steps at one end leading up to the platform floor.
On 21 June 1976, the appellant was standing on the edge of the platform, in a position immediately adjacent to the steps, and supervising the loading of goods into a lorry which had backed against the platform when he inadvertently stepped back on to the flight of steps which lead up to the platform. He suffered a fall and sustained injuries. He claimed damages for personal injuries on the following grounds:
 
 
(a) Breach of statutory duty on the part of the respondents.
  
 
 
 
(b) Alternatively, negligence of the respondents, their servants and agents.
  
 
 
 
(c) Alternatively, breach of contract.
  
 
 
At the hearing of the claim before the District Court, special damages were agreed at $144 and general damages at $6,000. Evidence was called by both parties on the issue of liability. The District Judge dismissed the appellant`s claim with costs.
The appellant appealed to the High Court but was unsuccessful. He now appeals against the decision of the High Court. He raises two grounds. First, it is submitted that on the evidence the trial judge and the High Court ought to have found that the respondents, by failing to fence off the edge of the platform adjacent to the steps into which he fell down, were in breach of their duty to persons who have a contractual right to use the platform to ensure that the platform is safe for their use. In our judgment, on the evidence, this ground is without substance.
The other round is that the High Court was wrong in failing to hold that the respondents were in breach of s 33(2) of the Factories Act 1973. It was conceded before the High Court that the platform is a factory within the meaning of the Factories Act 1973. Section 33(2) reads: 
 
All openings in floors shall be securely fenced, except in so far as the nature of the work renders such fencing impracticable.
 
 
 
The submission is that the appellant fell down an opening in the platform floor and that therefore s 33(2) must be applied. It is clear from the photograph exhibits which are included in the Record of Appeal that the appellant fell over the edge of the platform and not down an opening in the platform. Section 33(2) says, in effect that if you have a floor in a factory you must not have an open hole in it down which someone can fall and you must have it securely fenced unless to do so renders this impracticable having regard to the nature of the work carried out on that floor. The words used in sub-s (2) are `All openings in floors` and in our opinion the unfenced edges of a platform are not openings in a floor within the contemplation of the section. If a person walks off a platform he does not fall down a hole or opening in the platform; he falls over the edge of the platform [perSingleton LJ obiter In 
 Street v 
 
 British Electricity Authority 
 (1952) 1 TLR 799, 805].
In our judgment, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.

This is an appeal on the quantum of damages given by Choor Singh J in a defamation action. The appellant, CS Wu, is a practising advocate and solicitor of over 20 years` standing. He is one of the senior partners of Donaldson & Burkinshaw. The first and second respondents were at the material time journalists, and the third respondents are and were at the material time publishers of the 
 New Nation 
, the only afternoon English newspaper published in Singapore.
 Choor Singh J 
This is a defamation action brought by Mr CS Wu an advocate and solicitor, arising out of a news report published in the 
 New Nation 
of 12 November 1975.
The facts are these. The plaintiff is and has been for many years an advocate and solicitor practising such profession in Singapore as a partner in the law firm of Donaldson & Burkinshaw. The first and second defendants were at the material time journalists and the third defendants are and were at the material time publishers of the 
 New Nation 
, a newspaper having a large circulation in Singapore.
On 12 November 1975 the first and second defendants wrote and caused to be printed and the third defendants printed on the front page of the issue of the 
 New Nation 
dated that day of and concerning the plaintiff in the way of the said profession the words following: 
 
Big probe on lawyers
 
 
 
By Francis Rozario and Wang, Look Fung.
 
 
 
The Mr Wee Chong Jin CJ, has ordered the Law Society to conduct an inquiry into the professional conduct of lawyer Foo See Juan over the disposal of at least $2m worth of assets of a property development company.
 
 
 
This follows an originating summons taken out by Mr Tay Ben Swee, chairman and managing director of the company, Sin New Realty Pte Ltd heard in chambers before the Chief Justice on 24 October.
A similar summons taken out by Mr Tay against another lawyer, Mr CS Wu of Donaldson & Burkinshaw, is scheduled to be heard in chambers at a later date.
This is the first time in legal history that a member of the public has taken out such a summons against the Law Society of Singapore.
Mr Tay had originally made a complaint against the two lawyers to the Law Society in April last year, which later informed him that there `was no substance in the complaint.`
In its reply to Mr Tay`s complaint, the Council of the Law Society said: `The inquiry committee has received a number of complaints arising out of what is clearly a dispute between the directors of a company known as Sin Chew Realty Pte Ltd.
It appears to the inquiry committee that some of these complaints have almost certainly been made not primarily with a view to the institution of disciplinary proceedings but with a view to the enforcement of the civil rights of the parties without the necessity of their resorting to court.
So far as the complaint of Mr Tay Beng Swee against Mr CS Wu and Mr Foo See Juan are concerned, the inquiry committee can find nothing of substance which could in any way justify disciplinary proceedings although the facts do disclose a number of possible claims`.
The plaintiff alleges that the said publication was false and malicious and that the words in their material and ordinary meaning meant and were understood to mean
 
 
(1) that the plaintiff in the exercise of his profession had been guilty of such conduct as to necessitate an inquiry with a view to his being struck off or suspended;
  
 
 
 
(2) that the plaintiff similarly to Mr Foh See Juan, another lawyer, had conducted himself unprofessionally in the wrongful disposal of at least $2m worth of assets of a property development company.
  
 
 
The headlines of the article complained of namely `Big Probe on Lawyers` were in letters approximately 3/42 to 12 in height at the front page of the issue and there also appeared immediately below the said headlines one photograph only, namely a photograph of the plaintiff measuring 62 `; 22 with the name `Mr Wu` thereunder.
The plaintiff alleges that the juxtaposition of his photograph immediately under the said headlines was such as to bear the innuendo
 
 
(1) that there was on foot an investigation into the professional conduct of the plaintiff;
  
 
 
 
(2) that such investigation related to a serious or grave matter;
  
 
 
 
(3) that the plaintiff`s conduct merited such investigation;
  
 
 
 
(4) that the plaintiff was the principal subject of the probe.
  
 
 
The plaintiff alleges that by reason of the premises he has been injured in his credit and professional reputation and has been brought into public scandal, odium and contempt.
The plaintiff further alleges that the third defendants published the said words and photograph calculated thereby to increase the circulation of the said newspaper with a view to making a profit from the sale of the said newspaper and of advertising space therein.
Lastly, it is alleged that the defendants and each of them knew or ought to have known that the policy of the law and common justice required that there should be no publication of the fact of any inquiry into the professional conduct of an advocate and solicitor until, if at all, the matter reached a hearing in open court. And the plaintiff claims damages on the footing of aggravated damages.
The defendants in their statement of defence deny that the said words bore or were understood to bear or were capable of bearing any of the meanings alleged by the plaintiff or any other meaning defamatory of the plaintiff. The defendants further say that the words complained of were inserted in the said newspaper without actual malice and without gross negligence and that before the commencement of these proceedings the defendants inserted in the said newspaper a full apology. The defendants also rely upon the provisions of s 10 of the Defamation Act, 1965.
On seeing the offending report in the 
 New Nation 
of 12 November 1975 the plaintiff wrote on the same day to the Secretary of the Law Society of Singapore drawing the Society`s attention to the article bearing the heading `Big Probe on Lawyers` and urged the Society to take positive action. The Society in turn wrote to the third defendants who published the Law Society`s letter on the front page of the 
 New Nation 
of 21 November 1975 under the heading `Law Society Reply`: 
 
I am directed by the Council of the Law Society to refer to your front page article headlined `Big Probe on Lawyers` in the 
 New Nation
 of 12 November 1975.
 
 
 
The headline suggests a probe on lawyers generally when all the article does is to report on two matters brought before the Chief Justice by Mr Tay Beng Swee involving two lawyers, namely Mr Foo See Juan and Mr CS Wu.
It is not the intention of the Council to comment on matters that are sub-judice but the grossly misleading headline is decidedly objectionable and does grave injustice to the legal profession as a whole.
Both the cases arose out of a complaint by Mr Tay Beng Swee to the Law Society on the professional conduct of Mr Foo and Mr Wu. These were dealt with by the inquiry committee of the Law Society under the provisions of the Legal Profession Act and, in both cases, it as found that a formal investigation was not necessary within the terms of s 88 of the Act.
Mr Tay Beng Swee the complainant, being dissatisfied with the decision, made an application under s 96 of the Act under which the judge hearing the application could affirm the decision of the Council or direct the Society to apply for the appointment of a disciplinary committee.
The so-called apology which the defendants claim to be a full apology appeared on page 4 of the paper of the same date under the heading, `Editor`s reply`: 
 
It is surprising that the Law Society should assume that our readers could conceive of a probe on all the members of an honourable profession.
 
 
 
Our report was factually accurate and emphasised the Law Society`s views and findings. ... `So far as the complaint of Mr Tay Beng Swee against Mr CS Wu and Mr Foo See Juan are concerned, the inquiry committee can find nothing of substance which could in any way justify disciplinary proceedings ...`
We repeat what we made clear in our report: there is no probe on Mr CS Wu There is an application by Mr Tay Beng Swee to the High Court for an order that the Law Society should request the Chief Justice to appoint a disciplinary committee to consider Mr CS Wu`s conduct.
This application of Mr Tay Beng Swee has not been heard. There is no reflection on Mr Wu and we apologise for any distress we may have inadvertently caused.
On 12 August 1976 the third defendants published in their paper `
 New Nation 
` of that date another news report concerning the plaintiff:
 Application against lawyer is dismissed 
 
 
The High Court has dismissed an application by Mr Tay Beng Swee chairman and managing director of Sin Chew Realty Pte Ltd for an order that the Law Society should apply for the appointment of a disciplinary committee to investigate his complaint against a lawyer, Mr CS Wu.
 
 
 
On 12 November 1975 
 New Nation 
 reported Mr Tay`s application to the High Court.
On 12 November 1975 in reply to a letter from the Law Society, 
 New Nation 
 stated what was made clear in the first report, that there was no investigation on Mr Wu. The 
 New Nation 
 had also stated: `There is no reflection on Mr Wu and we apologise for any distress we may have inadvertently caused.`
Mr Wu, a partner of the legal firm of Donaldson & Burkinshaw, is taking legal action against 
 New Nation 
.
Alongside this report the third defendants published a 42 [yen ] 22 photograph of the plaintiff with the words `Mr Wu` underneath it. It must be noted that this news report was published two months after the plaintiff had commenced these proceedings against the defendants.
There was yet another report concerning the plaintiff published by the third defendants in the 
 New Nation 
of 27 August 1979. Under a photograph of the plaintiff measuring 32 [yen ] 22 published on the front page of that issue there appeared the following:
 Mr CS Wu and New Nation 
 
 
In the issue of the 
 New Nation
 on 12 November 1975 there was a report headlined `Big probe on lawyers`, which referred to a complaint against two lawyers. The report was accompanied by a photograph of Mr CS Wu, a lawyer.
 
 
 
We wish to withdraw any imputation to the effect that there was an investigation or probe into the professional conduct of Mr Wu, or that his conduct in any way merited such investigation.
In amplification, of earlier apologies, we hereby apologise unreservedly to Mr Wu for any inconvenience or embarrassment which may have been caused to him as a result of the report.
It will be seen that there were in all four news reports published by the third defendants concerning the plaintiff on the following dates:
First report 12 November 1975
Second report
21 November 1975
Third report
12 August 1976
Fourth report
27 August 1979.
The first and second defendants were parties to the first report only and that is the report which is the subject-matter of this action.
The plaintiff`s evidence is that Sin Chew Realty Pte Ltd had been a client of his firm for many years. His firm did their conveyancing. Neither his firm nor he was involved in anyway in the disposal of two million worth of assets of Sin Chew Realty Pte Ltd. He was not involved in the disposal of any property alleged to have belonged to Tay Beng Swee either as shareholder or as a Director. He has never acted for that gentleman and he did not think that he had ever met him. `No similar summons` involving the disposal of two million dollars was ever taken out against him by Mr Tay or anyone else. He was not aware of any big probe on him by anybody in November 1975.
The plaintiff states that on reading the first report he felt he was being crucified for no good reason. His immediate reaction was one of utter disbelief and shock mixed with humiliation and a sense of outrage. He claims that he was depressed for several days afterwards over the publication of this article. He felt that it had ruined his professional integrity.
The plaintiff was in Bangkok on 21 November 1975 when the second report appeared in the 
 New Nation 
. His office telexed to him the contents of that report. When he read the editor`s reply it never occurred to him that that reply was intended as an apology directed to him. He read it as the editor`s reply prompted by the letter received from the Law Society. There were three passages in the reply to which he took offence. The first paragraph he thought was arrogant and deliberately sarcastic. The very next line reading `our report was factually accurate` to his mind represented reaffirmation of the earlier libel. In the next paragraph (third paragraph) the statement `We repeat that we made clear in our report: There is no probe on Mr CS Wu` he felt was an assertion made in bad faith. The plaintiff says that this is so because the first report, reading the contents in conjunction with the headline and his photograph appearing with it clearly asserts that there was a big probe or investigation conducted on him and to deny what was so obviously stated in the first paragraph could not have been a denial made in good faith. The plaintiff also takes exception to the final sentence referring to the distress the newspaper may have inadvertently caused him. It is the word `inadvertently` that be quarrels with. He says that he could not believe that a front page banner headline of a newspaper could have been inadvertently composed. He contends that it was obviously a deliberately worded headline to stir maximum sensationalism.
As regards the third report which appeared on 12 August 1976 the plaintiff says that the statement in the second column reading `On 21 November 1975, in the reply from a letter from the Law Society, 
 New Nation 
stated what was made clear in the first report that there was no investigation on Mr Wu` was an assertion he felt again made in bad faith for the reasons he has explained.
The plaintiff says that when the first report was published, his intention was to resort to defamation proceedings only as a last resort. His own preference was to obtain from the newspaper a full and frank apology and a retraction and the payment of a nominal sum to a charity of his choice. He instructed his solicitors to pursue such a course. It was not to seek damages against a newspaper in an action for damages. He failed to obtain what he wanted and as a result he was compelled to commence these proceedings to clear his name.
The plaintiff`s attention was drawn to the following letter written by the third defendants to the plaintiff`s solicitors: 
 
We have your letter of 15 November
 
 
 
Your client will no doubt have seen the front page report in our issue of 21 November 1975.
There is no question of malice on our part towards your client. Our report was factual in respect of a matter of public interest. If there is any inaccuracy in it which your client would wish to correct, please let us hear from you.
The plaintiff says that there was clearly legal malice in this instance on the part of the defendants. Secondly, he disputes that the report was factual. Thirdly, he disputes that the report related to a matter of public interest. In his view the complaint to the Law Society against a member of the Bar before it is referred to the High Court for a show cause hearing is highly confidential and cannot be a matter of public interest. Fourthly, the last sentence in the letter reading `if there is any inaccuracy etc ` is not appropriate in the case of a defamatory article. That practice generally applies to errors made in reports which warrant subsequent corrections.
As regards the fourth and last publication by the defendants made on 27 August 1979 the plaintiff says that when he read this report he inferred from it that the newspaper was admitting, for the first time almost after four years after the first article that it had libelled him.
The defendants did not call any evidence and the submissions made by their counsel were entirely on the issue of damages.
It is now conceded by the defendants that they libelled the plaintiff. The only issue now before me is the quantum of damages.
Counsel for the defendants submits that the plaintiff is entitled to compensatory damages and not entitled to punitive damages. He submits that the plaintiff should be compensated by this court but the court should not punish the defendants by awarding the plaintiff punitive damages. I accept this submission. There is no question of this court punishing the defendants.
The law on the assessment of compensatory damages is set out in 
 Galley on Libel and Slander 
(7th Ed) in paras 1358 and 1360 and it is unnecessary to set out those paragraphs in this judgment.
The plaintiff claims aggravated damages on the ground of malice. It is submitted that the defendants knew that their report was false; that they had no genuine belief in its truth and that that is conclusive evidence of malice.
In my opinion the plaintiff has failed to make out a case for aggravated damages. To succeed in his claim for aggravated damages, the plaintiff must prove that the defendants had not acted honestly but were actuated by some indirect or ulterior motive eg malice in the proper acceptation of that term. The words complained of were published in a report of a judicial proceeding and the mere proof that they are false is not evidence of malice. The fact that the defendants had no reasonable grounds for believing in their truth is again not, by itself, evidence of malice. At the highest, there is evidence of negligence or carelessness but that again is insufficient to warrant the award of aggravated damages. The question raised is really as to the state of mind of the defendants when they published the alleged libel, the question being whether they published it in the spirit of malice. In my judgment there is no evidence of dishonesty, personal spite, ill will or any wrong or improper motive on the part of the defendants and the words complained of are therefore not coloured by malice. Accordingly, the claim for aggravated damages fails.
Counsel for the plaintiff has cited as comparables the damages awarded to the Prime Minister in six defamation cases which arose out of speeches made at election rallies of political parties during the 1976 Parliamentary General Elections held in Singapore. In my opinion those cases are of a different class altogether. They arose out of political attacks on the integrity of the holder of the highest office in the land and are therefore not suitable comparables.
Counsel for the defendants relies on two English cases. The first one is 
 Manson 
 v Associated Newspapers Ltd 
[1965] 1 WLR 1038
. In this case a newspaper published an article about a woman whom it stated was wanted by the police for criminal offences, and containing the plaintiff`s name and she brought an action for damages for libel. Compensatory damages in the sum of Â£1,500 were awarded. The second case is 
 McCarey v Associated Newspapers Ltd & Ors (No 2) 
[1965] 
[1965] 2 QB 86
. The four defendant newspapers published reports of an inquest tending to suggest that the plaintiff, a doctor, had attempted to shift the blame for the death of a patient, who had died after an accidental injection by the plaintiff of surgical spirit instead of saline, on to someone else and that he had been rebuked by the coroner for so doing. The plaintiff brought an action for damages for libel against each of the newspapers, the actions subsequently being consolidated. The jury found for the plaintiff and awarded him Â£9,000 pound damages. On appeal the award was set aside and a new trial ordered on the ground that the amount awarded was `much too large`.
Counsel for the defendants suggests that in the light of these two cases, the amount to be awarded to the plaintiff should not exceed $15,000 and that to go beyond that figure `would open the Pandora Box`.
In my opinion English cases on quantum are of little assistance, since almost all cases involving prominent persons are settled out of court. Where an action goes to trial the amount of the award is determined by a jury which hears no evidence as to awards in other cases. Consequently there is no scale and no logic in English awards of damages for defamation.
In my opinion each case must be judged on its own particular facts and on its own merits. In the present case a very serious libel has been perpetrated on the plaintiff. It was obviously perpetrated for financial gain, not caring what distress it would cause to the plaintiff and what harm it would inflict on the personal and professional reputation of a very successful advocate and solicitor who is well-known in the business world as one of the senior partners of Donaldson & Burkinshaw. He is a man of some standing. The plaintiff is named. His firm is named and his photograph is published. One must look at the original copy of the 
 New Nation 
of 12 November 1975 to appreciate the impact of the libellous matter on readers of the 
 New Nation 
. The banner headline informs the readers of the 
 New Nation 
that there is on foot an investigation into the professional conduct of the plaintiff. There is also a hint of dishonesty. The readers of the 
 New Nation 
are told that the plaintiff, similarly to Mr Foo See Juan, another lawyer, has conducted himself unprofessionally in the wrongful disposal of at least two million dollars worth of assets of a property development company. The juxtaposition of the plaintiff`s large photograph immediately under the banner headline would give readers of the 
 New Nation 
the clear impression that the plaintiff was the principal subject of the probe.
Bearing in mind the principles applicable in the assessment of compensatory damages and having regard to the whole conduct of the defendants, in particular their several efforts towards mitigation of damages, and allowing `for the sad truth that no apology, retraction or withdrawal can ever be guaranteed completely to undo the harm it has done or the hurt it has caused` (per Lord Radcliffe in 
 Associated Newspapers 
 v Dingle 
[1964] AC at p 399). I award the plaintiff $25,000 as compensatory damages.
 From the above judgment the plaintiff appealed to the CoEMPHASISf Appeal 
On 12 November 1975 there appeared on the front page of the 
 New Nation 
a report, the material parts of which are as follows: 
 
Big probe on lawyers
 
 
 
By Francis Rozario and Wang Look Fung.
 
 
 
The Mr Wee Chong Jin CJ, has ordered the Law Society to conduct an inquiry into the professional conduct of lawyer Foo See Juan over the disposal of at least $2m worth of assets of a property development company.
 
 
 
This follows an originating summons taken out by Mr Tay Beng Swee, chairman and managing director of the company Sin Chew Realty Pte Ltd heard in chambers before the Chief Justice on 24 October.
A similar summons taken out by Mr Tay against another lawyer, Mr CS Wu of Donaldson & Burkinshaw, is scheduled to be heard in chambers at a later date.
This is the first time in legal history that a member of the public has taken out such a summons against the Law Society of Singapore.
Mr Tay had originally made a complaint against the two lawyers to the Law Society in April last year, which later informed him that there `was no substance in the complaint.`
In its reply to Mr Tay`s complaint, the Council of the Law Society said: `The inquiry committee has received a number of complaints arising out of what is clearly a dispute between the directors of a company known as Sin Chew Realty Pte Ltd.
It appears to the inquiry committee that some of these complaints have almost certainly been made not primarily with a view to the institution of disciplinary proceedings but with a view to the enforcement of the civil rights of the parties without the necessity of their resorting to court.
So far as the complaint of Mr Tay Beng Swee against Mr CS Wu and Mr Foo See Juan are concerned, the inquiry committee can find nothing of substance which could in any way justify disciplinary proceedings although the facts do disclose a number of possible claims.
The headlines `Big probe on lawyers` are in bold large letters approximately -2 to 12 in height, and immediately below the headlines is a photograph of the appellant measuring 62 [yen ] 22 with the name Mr Wu under it.
At the trial, the respondents by their counsel having admitted the libel, the only issue was the quantum of damages. At the end of the hearing, having reserved judgment, Choor Singh J for the reasons that follow awarded the appellant $25,000 as compensatory damages. The learned judge said: 
 
In my opinion each case must be judged on its own particular facts and on its own merits. In the present case a very serious libel has been perpetrated on the plaintiff. It was obviously perpetrated for financial gain, not caring what distress it would cause to the plaintiff and what harm it would inflict on the personal and professional reputation of a very successful advocate and solicitor who is well known in the business world as one of the senior partners of Donaldson & Burkinshaw.

The juxtaposition of the plaintiff`s large photograph immediately under the banner headline would give readers of the

 the clear impression that the plaintiff was the principal subject of the probe.
 
 
 
Bearing in mind the principles applicable in the assessment of compensatory damages and having regard to the whole conduct of the defendants, in particular their several efforts towards mitigation of damages and allowing `for the sad truth that no apology, retraction or withdrawal can ever be guaranteed completely to undo the harm it has done or the hurt it has caused` (
 per 
 Lord Radcliffe in 
 Associated Newspapers v Dingle 
, [1964] AC at page 399) I award the plaintiff S25,000 as compensatory damages.
At the hearing before us, it was submitted for the appellant that the trial judge had erred in law and fact in not awarding the appellant aggravated damages on the ground of malice.
As regards the facts, it was submitted that on the evidence the trial judge ought to have found that the respondents knew when they published the report that it was false, for it was urged upon us that they knew then there was no probe into the professional conduct of the appellant. That by itself, it was said, was evidence of malice on the part of the respondents. The submission was not a new one. A similar submission made to the trial judge was rejected by him. This is what he said: 
 
The plaintiff claims aggravated damages on the ground of malice. It is submitted that the defendants knew that their report was false; that they had no genuine belief in its truth and that that is conclusive evidence of malice.
 
 
 
In my opinion the plaintiff has failed to make out a case for aggravated damages. To succeed in his claim for aggravated damages, the plaintiff must prove that the defendants had not acted honestly but were actuated by some indirect or ulterior motive e.g. malice in the proper acceptation of that term. The words complained of were published in a report of a judicial proceeding and the mere proof that they are false is not evidence of malice. The fact that the defendants had no reasonable grounds for believing in their truth is again not, by itself, evidence of malice. At the highest, there is evidence of negligence or carelessness but that again is insufficient to warrant the award of aggravated damages. The question raised is really as to the state of mind of the defendants when they published the alleged libel, the question being whether they published it in the spirit of malice. In my judgment there is no evidence of dishonesty, personal spite, ill will or any wrong or improper motive on the part of the defendants and the words complained of are therefore not coloured by malice. Accordingly, the claim for aggravated damages fails. The plaintiff is entitled to only compensatory damages.
We too are satisfied, on a review of the evidence, that there is no malice on the part of the respondents. Except for the use of the word `probe` in the headlines, and the publication of the appellant`s photograph beneath the headlines which are the gravamen in the libel, there is nothing in the contents of the report of 12 November 1975 which can be considered to even hint of malice on the part of the respondents. The fact is on that day there was an application pending before the Honourable Chief Justice by Tay Beng Swee, a member of the public, against the Law Society for an order for the Society to conduct an inquiry into the professional conduct of the appellant. In these circumstances, taking the report as a whole, we agree with the trial judge that at the highest there is only evidence of negligence on the part of the respondents.
Then again, on the topic of malice, we have considered the subsequent conduct of the third respondents, of the three publications in the 
 New Nation 
 November 1975, 12 August 1976 and 27 August 1979 respectively in which are included apologies. The view we take of these three publications is that they rebut any malice on the part of the respondents in respect of the offending publication.
Next, counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge had erred in law in making, the distinction between `aggravated damages` and `compensatory damages`, the argument being that as a result he had applied wrong principles in the assessment of the damages awarded to the appellant.
The submission is founded on the statement of the trial judge where at the end of the passage referred to above he said: `Accordingly, the claim for aggravated damages fails. The plaintiff is entitled to only compensatory damages`. We reject the submission as it altogether ignores the whole passage where the trial judge at the beginning pointedly says that he is dealing with the topic of `aggravated damages on the ground of malice`. He explains the meaning of malice in the law of libel, he describes the quantum of proof of malice required for aggravated damages, and he finds as a fact no evidence of malice. He then says: `Accordingly, the claim for aggravated damages fails.` The reference here is clearly to aggravated damages on the ground of malice. He concludes: `The plaintiff is entitled only to compensatory damages.` In the context it can only mean that in determining the compensatory damages the appellant is not entitled to anything on the ground of malice.
Finally, whilst it was conceded for the appellant that the trial judge had properly taken all material factors into account which entitled the appellant to aggravated damages, he had not awarded the appellant an adequate amount as he had erroneously believed that only malice qualified for aggravated damages and not the other material factors. For the reasons we have given we find that there is no merit in the submission. We are satisfied that the trial judge had properly directed himself, and there is no reason for us to interfere with the award that he has made.
The appeal is dismissed with costs.

Question of fact
 
In this passing-off action and for infringement of copyright, the plaintiffs, Clairol Incorporated, a company incorporated in the United States of America, are manufacturers of a herbal essence shampoo under the trade name `Clairol`. Since November 1972, through their sister company, Bristol-Myers (Singapore) Pte Ltd, they have been marketing Clairol in Singapore.
The shampoo is packed in transparent plastic bottles of different sizes and have three different formulations which are distinguished by different caps on the bottles. The colours of the caps are white, green or yellow. The exh P157 tendered in court is a bottle, one of the three sizes, with a green cap.
The bottles have white labels, and the one on the bottle, P157, has a green border. From the photographs in the agreed bundle, it is seen that the colours of the borders of labels differ for the different formulations. The trade name `Clairol` is on the label, and there are descriptive words on it. On the label also is a trade mark, a graphic design of a young woman in a pool surrounded by green leaves and coloured flowers.
The defendant, Too Dit Co, is a sole proprietorship. Ho Yen Sen registered it under the Business Names Act in 1973. It manufactures shampoo under a trade name `Backer` and a trade mark which Ho Yen Sen registered, in his own name, under the Trade Marks Act as early as 1963. In 1976 the defendant went into herbal essence shampoo. The shampoo is sold in bottles with green caps which are of the same size and shape as the bottle, P157, of the plaintiffs. The label on the defendant`s bottle, P158, is similar in form and colour to the label on P157. So are the descriptive words on it. But the trade name on the bottle is `Backer`. And instead of a young girl in a pool of water, the defendant`s label has the trade mark, a yellow circle and in it the device of a bent arm holding an arrow. There are leaves and flowers surrounding the circle about alike but different in size to those on P157.
In the statement of claim the plaintiffs took objection to the entire get-up of the defendant`s product. At the hearing, however, it emerged in the evidence of the product manager that the plaintiffs` complaint is `narrowed down to the label` of the defendant`s product. He agreed, however, that the distinction between the two labels are Clairol and Backer. Another distinction is the distinctive trade marks on the labels I have described.
The plaintiffs` action is not for infringement of trade mark. It was not appreciated by counsel for the defendant that a passing-off action, an action in common law, is altogether different from the former. The law relating to passing-off is simple to state but often difficult to apply. What it is and why it can be difficult was explained by Wee Chong Jin J (as he then was) in his dissenting judgment in 
 Asian Organisation Ltd v White Hudson & Co 
 
 
[1962] MLJ 139
  @ 140-141 which was approved by the Privy Council in 
 White Hudson & Co v Asian Organisation Ltd 
 
 [1965] 1 MLJ 18 
, 189. The learned judge said: 
 
The fundamental and indeed the only principle of law involved in such an action is this, that nobody has any right to represent his goods as the goods of somebody else. From this cardinal principle it has been laid down that for a plaintiff in a passing-off action to succeed he must establish first, that the particular get-up which he has been using has become associated exclusively with his goods. i.e. he must establish reputation and secondly, that the defendant`s get-up is such as is likely to deceive or cause confusion. Therefore, whether a defendant has violated this principle or not is a question purely of fact.
 
 
 
So then, the first issue is whether the get-up of Clairol was known to the public as distinctively theirs. Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that I should, notwithstanding the evidence of the product manager, consider the whole of the get-up of the plaintiffs` product. It is said for the plaintiffs that they were the first to introduce herbal essence shampoo in Singapore. That, of course, does not give them any monopoly of it. But it is also said that at that time there was no other shampoo in the market of a similar get-up. The reference to get-up is the general appearance of the plaintiffs` product, that is to say the cap, size and shape of the bottle, its transparency, the form of the label and its format.
Now, that submission for the plaintiffs was the very kind of submission that was put before the Court of Appeal in England eighty years ago in the case of 
 Payton & Co Ltd v 
 Snelling, Lampard & Co Ltd 
(1990) 17 RPC 48. See 
[1901] AC 308
. The facts also were analogous to the facts before me. I extract them from the head-note to the case. The plaintiffs sold coffee in circular tins with paper labels. The predominant colour of the label for one quality was red, for another blue, and for the third green. There were three sizes of the tins of each colour. The plaintiffs subsequently adopted enamelled tins in red and blue displaying a reproduction of the labels for the two larger sizes of the two higher qualities. The smaller tins of these qualities and all of the lowest quality were still used with paper labels. The brand `Royal` appeared on the back and front of all the plaintiffs` tins. The defendants sold coffee in circular red, blue, and green tins, all of which were enamelled, resembling in general appearance, but differing in details from the plaintiffs` tins. The brand `Flag` appeared upon the back and front of all the defendants` tins, and their trade mark `Flag` in tricolour was on the front of each tin. The trial court held that the plaintiffs were entitled to an injunction to restrain the use of the tins complained of. The Court of Appeal reversed the decision and gave judgment for the defendants. One reason is that given by Romer LJ in his judgment at page 55. He said: 
 
The plaintiffs` goods have been put comparatively recently on the market in their present get-up. This is not the case where a peculiar get-up of goods has been for a long time, for many years, on the market so as to become identified in course of time with the plaintiffs` goods and with no others, so that that get-up almost of necessity is identified in the market or amongst the public as representing the plaintiffs` goods. That is not this case.
 
 
 
The same factual situation exists in the present case that I adopt the words of Romer LJ.
Another reason why the plaintiffs` get-up cannot be known to the public as distinctively theirs is because there is nothing distinctive or novel about their get-up. One has only to walk into any supermarket to see, and I name a few, like drinks, cereals, detergents or insecticides of different brands sold in bottles, boxes or canisters of not dissimilar sizes and shapes. In this context, I adopt mutatis mutandis the words of Lindley MR in 
 Payton & Co Ltd v Titus Ward & Co Ltd 
(1900) 17 RPC 58 @ 64 another case Payton & Co Ltd brought, this time against the defendants alleging passing-off of `Palais Royal` coffee sold in tins and labels similar to the plaintiffs. The learned Master of the Rolls said: 
 
Let us see what the defendants have done and look at what the plaintiffs are seeking to restrain them from doing. Let us take the chocolate tins of the defendants. It seems to me to be quite out of the question to say that these chocolate tins infringe any rights of the plaintiffs. No doubt they are enamelled tins, and no doubt there is a certain resemblance to the plaintiffs. Of course there always is. But why? Because the resemblance consists in what is common to everybody ... When you come to look at the chocolate tins it appears to me that the plaintiffs have no case whatever.
 
 
 
In the case before me too the plaintiffs have no case whatever as regards the bottles or the caps.
I turn to the labels. In considering them, the two ingredients which the plaintiffs must prove, of reputation and deception or confusion become inseparable. As was said by Cozens-Hardy MR in the case of 
 JB Williams Company 
 v R Bronnley & Co Ltd 
(1909) 26 RPC 765 @ 771: 
 
It seems to me that in the first place [the plaintiff] must, in order to succeed, establish that he has selected a peculiar - a novel - design as a distinguishing feature of his goods, and that his goods are known in the market, and have acquired a reputation in the market, by reason of that distinguishing feature, and that unless he establishes that, the very foundation of his case fails. If he takes a colour and a shape which are common to the trade the only distinctive feature is that which he has added to the common colour and the common shape, and unless he can establish that there is in the added matter such a similarity as is calculated to deceive, I think he must fail.
 
 
 
The plaintiffs claim much had gone in the preparation of the get-up of their label. The question is: what is there that is distinctive about the plaintiffs` label? There are two things. One is the trade name `Clairol`, and the other is the trade mark, the graphic design, of a young girl in a pool surrounded by leaves and coloured flowers. The reputation of the plaintiffs` product must be in respect of them. It is in respect of the catch word `Clairol` and the catch to the eye of the graphic design that considerable sums of money are expended in marketing the plaintiffs` product by way of advertisements over the radio, on TV and other visual media. But what of the defendant`s label? It bears the trade name `Backer` and the trade mark is of the device of a bent arm holding an arrow. I come to the conclusion that the two labels unquestionably do not resemble each other.
The facts of the case are different from the 
 White Hudson 
case, to which reference has been made. That was a passing-off action between Hacks and Pecto medicated cough sweets. The wrappers of the respective sweets bore the respective trade names, but the wrappers were of similar colour. The sweets were displayed by retailers in glass jars and sold in loose form. Some retailers kept both Hacks and Pecto sweets in the same glass jars. And there was a finding by the learned trial judge, Tan Ah Tah J that customers asked for the sweets in Chinese by reference to the colour of the wrappers. Those brief facts explain the difference between that case and the one for decision. In the context of the present facts, I refer to the words of Lindley MR in the 
 Titus Ward 
. At page 64, he said: 
 
When you come to look at what the plaintiffs have put on the common features to distinguish their goods, that which they have put on has not been taken by the defendants. On the contrary, the defendants are using that which they have used for the last twenty-two years, and it is an attempt under the cover of a monopoly, which the plaintiffs are not entitled to, to deprive the defendants of the use of a mark which they have been using honestly, so far as I can see, long before the plaintiffs began to use theirs at all.
 
 
 
In the case before me, too, the sole proprietor of the defendant has used the registered trade mark since 1963, nine years before the plaintiffs came into the market. It is conceded for the plaintiffs that they cannot object to the use by the defendant of his registered trade mark, but it is in relation to the get-up of the label that reference has been made to it. In my judgment the defendant is properly entitled to use its trade name and trade mark. I come to the conclusion that it is the different trade names and trade marks of the two products that distinguish each of them. The rest of the get-up are matters which the plaintiffs cannot probably object to as they are matters common to the trade. And, as I shall come to observe in dealing with costs, there is no evidence, other than that the defendant has acted honestly in using its trade name and trade mark. For these reasons, I hold that the plaintiffs have not made out a case of reputation in the get-up of their product.
In case I am wrong, I now deal with the second issue, whether the use by the defendant of the get-up in Backer was similar to that of the plaintiffs` Clairol, that it has deceived or confused the public between the product of the plaintiffs and that of the defendant. To prove their claim the plaintiffs produced a witness, a private investigator who in April 1976 conducted `a market inquiry to see if any of the herbal essence shampoo that was being sold was similar to Clairol`. He tendered his report which is in the agreed bundle.
A point the witness sought to make, of confusion in the consumer market, is his evidence that in some of the retailers he visited he saw Clairol and Backer shampoo displayed together. On this evidence, the product manager said that neither the plaintiffs nor the defendant has any control over retailers in how they display their goods. It cannot therefore, as a matter of inference even, be said that the defendant had by his conduct brought about that circumstance. (See: 
 Boh Plantations Sdn Bhd 
 v Gui Nee Chuan & Ors 
 
 
[1975] 2 MLJ 213
  @ 15. There is another observation, I make on the evidence. I have counted the number of visits made by the witness to retailers which are in his report. Of the fifty-four places he went to, only in six did he see Clairol and Backer displayed together. Not only is it a negligible percentage, in my judgment, it is not evidence to support the submission for the plaintiffs that confusion arises when the defendant`s product is placed together with the plaintiffs` product. To the contrary, the fact that the witness saw them displayed together and knew the difference is per se evidence that he was not confused. In this context, I will have more to say later on the probative value of witnesses in a passing-off action.
The material evidence of the private investigator is that he gave to two of his assistant investigators, and three, it would appear, members of the public, each a bottle of shampoo of either Clairol or Backer, and told them to go to certain retailers and buy a similar bottle. Again, I have reckoned the exercise carried out from the facts in the Agreed Bundle. On twenty-four occasions when they went with a bottle of Clairol, they returned with twenty Clairol and four Backer. But on twenty-one occasions when they went to buy Backer, they returned with thirteen Backer and eight Clairol. Given the bona fide of the exercise, to my mind, it does not demonstrate that there was deception or confusion to the prejudice of Clairol. If at all, it was to the prejudice of Backer.
I now want to say a few words on the investigations carried out by the plaintiffs to bring this action for passing-off and the kind of witnesses that, were produced in court to prove deception or confusion. I rely on what Romer LJ at page 57 in the 
 Snelling 
: 
 
It seems to be a sort of popular notion of some witnesses that in considering whether customers are likely to be deceived, you are to consider the case of an ignorant customer who knows nothing about, or very little about the subject of the action. That is a great mistake. The kind of customer that the Courts ought to think of in these cases is the customer who knows the distinguishing characteristics of the plaintiff`s goods, those characteristics which distinguish his goods from other goods on the market so far as relates to general characteristics. The customer must be one who, knowing what is fairly common to the trade, knows of the plaintiff`s goods by reason of these distinguishing characteristics. If he does not know that he is not a customer whose views can properly, or will be, regarded by this Court.
 
 
 
Finally, still on the second issue, I attach `very great importance`, as did the Court of Appeal in the 
 Snelling 
case, to the price difference between the two products that there cannot be confusion or deception between them. It is in the agreed bundle that the plaintiffs` bottle of Clairol, like P157, is sold for $4.20. The defendant`s Backer, however, is sold at a price range which varies from $3.50 to as low as $2.30. In the competitive consumer market today if there is anything that customers would take notice of at all, the one thing that they would notice is the price they have to pay for a product.
What I have said is sufficient to dismiss the action. But there is another claim of the plaintiffs, that of infringement of copyright, the law in which is complicated. In the defence, the defendant put the plaintiffs to prove the copyright and its infringement. In the way the action was fought out, the claim for infringement was a subsidiary one. It is sufficient to say that neither the copyright, and far less, the infringement of it was proved. That claim also fails.
As regards costs, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that if the plaintiffs fail in this action there should be no order as to costs. In considering the matter, it is relevant to refer to the background of this action. On 7 July 1976 the plaintiffs` solicitors wrote to the defendant alleging passing-off. The defendant, without admission of liability, made some changes (as I see them, they are minor changes (see exh D2)) to the label of Backer and were willing to give an undertaking not to use the label which the plaintiffs complained of. It seems to me therefore that the defendant had at all times acted honestly. But the plaintiffs were not satisfied. They wanted the defendant to indemnify them in respect of all expenses they had incurred up to then which they quantified in the sum of $6,796. The defendant refused to pay. It was then that the plaintiffs commenced this action. The plaintiffs have exerted a monopoly which they never had and cannot have in the get-up of their product. There is no reason why costs should not follow the event. The plaintiffs` claim is dismissed with costs.

The first question to be decided in this case is, what is the plain meaning of s 213 of the Penal Code (Cap 103) which reads as follows: 
 
Whoever accepts, or agrees to accept, or attempts to obtain any gratification for himself or any other person, or any restitution of property to himself or any other person, in consideration of his concealing an offence, or of his screening any person from legal punishment for any offence, or of his not proceeding against any person for the purpose of bringing him to legal punishment, shall, if the offence is punishable with death, be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine; and if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment which may extend to ten years, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine; and if the offence is punishable with imprisonment not extending to ten years, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one-fourth part of the longest term of imprisonment provided for offence, or with fine, or with both.
 
 
 
There is no reported decision in Singapore or Malaysia but there are two cases reported in India in which this section was considered. The first case is that of 
 Hem Chandra 
 
 Mukheriee & Anor v Emperor 
 AIR 1925 Cal 85. This is a decision of the Calcutta High Court in which a divisional bench of that court (Newbould and Mukerji JJ) came to the conclusion that there must be an actual concealment of an offence, or screening of a person from legal punishment, or obstruction from proceeding criminally against a person in order to attract the application of s 213 of the Penal Code. There would be no offence if a gratification was accepted merely on a promise to conceal, screen or abstain and nothing more. Mukerji J who delivered the opinion of the court, explained the matter, thus, at p 86: 
 
... Where there has been no concealing, screening or abstention no act or omission has been done affecting public justice; the mere acceptance or attempt to obtain or agreement to accept the gratification or restitution is an offence against property. If the accused has no intention to fulfil his part of the transaction, it would amount to an offence of cheating; if he has the intention, but does not carry it out, he does not commit any offence in law, however immoral his conduct may be.
 
 
 
A very strong argument in support of this view is afforded by the language of the section itself and a comparison of it with the language of some other sections of the Code. Section 213 says in consideration of his concealing an offence or of his screening any person from legal punishment for any offence or of his not proceeding against any person for the purpose of bringing him to legal punishment` and not in consideration of his agreeing or promising to conceal, etc. That the legislature was not unaware of the distinction between the two positions is not imaginable and is further evident from the language used in the first part of the section itself. Similar language has been used in s 214 while in s 215 the words are `under pretence or on account of helping etc.`
Upon the plain words of s 213, therefore, a promise or agreement or pretence of concealing or screening is not punishable...
The second case is a decision of the Bombay High Court in 
 Biharilal Kalacharan v 
 
 Emperor, 
 AIR 1949 Bom 405 in which a divisional bench of that court (Chagla CJ and Gajendragadkar J) held that s 213 of the Penal Code does not require the actual concealment of an offence or the screening of any person from legal punishment or the actual forbearing of taking any proceedings. It was held that it is sufficient if an illegal gratification is received in consideration of a promise to conceal an offence or screen any person from legal punishment or desist from taking any proceedings. Once a person accepts a gratification and if the consideration for accepting that gratification is his concealing the offence or screening the person from legal punishment, the offence is complete. Chagla CJ who delivered the opinion of the court, explained the matter as follows, at p 406: 
 
... Mr Lulla contends that the legislature does not enact that if a person receives gratification in consideration of his agreeing or promising to conceal an offence, or screen any person from legal punishment, he would be guilty of an offence. According to Mr Lulla, if the legislature intended to punish even an agreement or promise to conceal or screen, then those words should have found a place in the section. In our opinion, there is very good reason why those words do not find a place in the section. Because if those words had been placed there by the Legislature then the consideration would have referred only to something to be done in future. It would not have covered the case of past consideration. The neutral word used by the Legislature `consideration` is wide enough to cover both cases, the case of something having been done or achieved in the past and also the case of something to be done in 
 future.
The other difficulty that arises if we were to accept the interpretation put upon the section by Mr Lulla is as to the point of time when it could be said that the offence was complete. If we accept Mr Lulla`s interpretation, then the offence would not be complete when the accused received the gratification, but it would only be complete when the offence was concealed or a person was screened from legal punishment. Therefore, if the accused took a gratification after having promised to conceal the offence or screen the person giving gratification from legal punishment if he chose to break`s promise and not stand by his agreement then no offence would be committed, although he received both the gratification and committed a breach of the agreement quae the person who gave him the money. But the offence according to Mr Lulla would only be committed if he received the gratification and further went on to keep his promise and abide by his agreement. Unless the words of the section were clear and plain and compelled us to place that interpretation upon it, we think that the interpretation suggested by Mr Lulla results in serious difficulties and anomalies and should not be accepted ...
 
 
 
The decision in 
 Chandra Mukherjee`s 
case was considered but the court declined to accept it on the ground that it was not a correct decision.
As was pointed out by Chagla CJ in 
 Kalacharan`s 
, `in law a consideration may be as much a promise as something actually done or achieved`. In my opinion when a person receives gratification in return for his promise to conceal an offence, he is clearly receiving it `in consideration of his concealing an offence` within the meaning of s 213 of the Penal Code.
In my judgment, s 213 does not require the actual concealment of an offence or the screening of any person from legal punishment or the actual forbearing of taking any proceedings. It is sufficient if an illegal gratification is received in consideration of a promise to conceal an offence or screen any person from legal punishment or desist from taking any proceedings. Chagla CJ has correctly construed s 213 of the Penal Code in 
 Kalacharan`s 
and I respectfully agree with him.
The appellant was convicted by a District Court on nine charges under s 213 of the Penal Code and fines totalling $30,000 were imposed on him.
The allegation in the first eight charges was that he had obtained restitution from one S Santhiran in consideration of his concealing offences of criminal breach of trust committed by the said Santhiran. In the ninth charge the allegation was that he attempted to obtain such restitution.
I propose to deal, first, with the first eight charges. The amount of restitution and the date on which it was received was set out in the eight charges as follows:
 Charge Date Amount of restitution 
 
 
1st Charge 4 March 1976 $39,181.31
 
 
 
2nd ` 9 March 1976 79,751.08
 
 
 
3rd ` 10 March 1976 20,877.68
 
 
 
4th ` 11 March 1976 87,146.05
 
 
 
5th ` 12 March 1976 41,000
 
 
 
6th ` 10 May 1976 8,000
 
 
 
7th ` 14 May 1976 1,000
 
 
 
8th ` 10 June 1976 21,000
 
 
 
$297,956.12
 
 
 
The appellant is an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore. He has been in practice in Singapore since 1948. He is the sole proprietor of the well-known firm of Braddell Brothers. Since the commencement of the Legal Profession Act in 1966, he has been a member of the Council of the Law Society. He was President of the Law Society in 1975 and 1976.
The charges against the appellant arose from offences of criminal breach of trust committed in the years 1972 to 1976 by one Sivagnanam Santhiran, a legal assistant employed by the appellant in his firm of Braddell Brothers. In May 1978, Santhiran was convicted in a district court, on his plea of guilty, on a charge of criminal breach of trust of $147,510.04. He also admitted four other similar charges which were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence. Santhiran was sentenced to nine months` imprisonment.
To bring home the first eight charges, the prosecution had to prove in respect of each charge:
 
 
(1) that Santhiran had committed criminal breach of trust;
  
 
 
 
(2) that the appellant had knowledge of Santhiran`s criminal breach of trust;
  
 
 
 
(3) that the appellant demanded restitution;
  
 
 
 
(4) that restitution was made by Santhiran; and
  
 
 
 
(5) that the appellant accepted restitution in consideration of his concealing Santhiran`s criminal breach of trust.
  
 
 
There was clear evidence in respect of the first four ingredients. They were admitted and were never challenged. The only contest was in respect of the fifth ingredient. The crucial issue before the learned district judge was whether or not the appellant had accepted the restitution in consideration of his concealing the offences of criminal breach of trust committed by Santhiran.
Santhiran`s evidence on this issue was as follows. When criminal breach of trust on his part was discovered, he was called by the appellant to the conference room in their office. He and the appellant were the only two persons in the room. The appellant showed him the clients` ledger and pointed out entries in specific accounts in the ledger. Six accounts were referred to. Then the appellant asked him if he had receipts for those monies paid out. He replied that the accountant had gone through the accounts; that they were in order and that there were no complaints. The appellant did not believe what he said. The appellant told him not to talk rubbish and resorted to abuse. Upon hearing further abuses thrown at him, he told the appellant that he had taken the money as `his share of profits or as arrangements with clients`. He also told the appellant that there were no complaints from clients and that all those matters had been completed. On hearing this the appellant hurled further abuse at him and became `rather incoherent`. He was `practically raving and ranting` whilst speaking to him. A lot of obscenities were uttered. He was threatened and told that he had no business to take his share of profits in that way. The appellant asked him to return immediately all the money in respect of the six accounts in the ledger pointed out to him. When the appellant demanded the return of the money, he told the appellant that he had no money. The appellant then threatened to report him to the Law Society. The moment the appellant spoke of reporting him to the Law Society he told the appellant that he would return the monies in the six accounts immediately.
The interview then ended because the appellant had to attend a meeting of the Law Society. Before leaving, the appellant told him to go through the accounts with the accounts clerk to see if there were any other defalcations and after that to add up the total amount involved and to telephone him at his house at 32 Parbury Avenue.
Santhiran telephoned the appellant at his house in the evening and told him that the figure stood as it was when he left the office. The figure was $39,181.31 which is the amount mentioned in the first charge. The appellant told him that he wanted the money on the following day.
The next day Santhiran went to the Singapura Building Society where he had made fixed deposits. He withdrew sufficient money to make the required payment of $39,181.31. Then he went to his bank, the United Commercial Bank where he purchased six manager`s cheques made payable to Braddell Brothers in the following sums: 
 
Ex 21 $ 6,597.69
 
 
 
21A 5,631.94
 
 
 
21B 1,374.28
 
 
 
21C 5,276.29
 
 
 
21D 20,184.51
 
 
 
21E 116.60
 
 
 
Total: $39,181.31
 
 
 
These six cheques represented specific repayments by Santhiran and these sums were subsequently returned to the accounts of the following six clients of Braddell Brothers: 
 
Chin Kiang Plastic & Paper Co 6,597.69 (Ex P 21)
 
 
 
Velasamy 5,631.94 (Ex P 21A)
 
 
 
Cheok Peng Ng Lee 1,374.28 (Ex P 21B)
 
 
 
Estate of Lo Lai Seng 5,276.29 (Ex P 21C)
 
 
 
Java-Singapore Trading Company 20,184.51 (Ex P 21D)
 
 
 
Thiagarajah s/o Suppiah 116.60 (Ex P 21E)
 
 
 
$39,181.31
 
 
 
Santhiran handed these cheques to the appellant. According to Santhiran, the appellant was very happy and told him to carry on with his work.
Santhiran`s defalcations must have been discovered on Wednesday, 3 March 1976 because these six cheques are all dated 4 March 1976. There`s a dispute as to when they were handed to the appellant but I do not think that date is of any material importance. They must have been purchased by Santhiran on Thursday, 4 March 1976 as claimed by him. They bear that date.
Santhiran`s evidence is that on Saturday, 6 March 1976 the appellant told him that the staff of the firm were going through the accounts and that he wanted to see Santhiran at his house in Parbury Avenue on the. Next evening at 8.30pm or 9pm Santhiran went to the appellant`s house as instructed.
The moment Santhiran stepped into the appellant`s house, the appellant produced a list showing defalcations to the extent of $395,000. The appellant asked him whether he had checked the files to ascertain the total amount involved. He told appellant that he bad done so and many files had receipts and many were without receipts. He repeated that he had taken the monies as `his share of profits or commissions from clients`. The appellant told him that he did not believe his story and that he wanted the immediate payment of $300,000 less the amount already refunded. He asked the appellant why he should repay the money. The appellant abused him and threatened him that if he did not repay the money immediately, he would report him to the Law Society. On hearing this, he realised that what he had done was unethical; that the appellant was the president of the Law Society; that the appellant was not going to acknowledge that he was entitled to profit-sharing or commission from clients and that if the matter was referred to the Law Society he would be in deep trouble. He then told the appellant that he would let him have the money; that he would try and pay back the money in the next few days and what he could not, he would pay by instalments. He told appellant that he would pay $250,000 immediately. Santhiran claims that upon hearing this the appellant made a complete about-turn and told him that he (the appellant) would know `how to handle the matter`; that he would know `how to settle the accounts` and would give him some money after the whole thing was settled. Appellant also told him that he would be getting his (Santhiran`s) practising certificate for the year 1976/77.
Because of the assurance received from the appellant, Santhiran made rapid restitution, as can be seen from the dates of the charges. Apart from the $39,181.31 already repaid on 4 March 1976 which is the subject of the first charge, Santhiran repaid on 9 March $79,751.08, on the next day 10 March another $20,877.68, on the next day 11 March another $87,146.05 and on the next day 12 March another $41,000. Two further payments were made in May 1976 and the last payment of $21,000 was made on 10 June 1976. Santhiran had refunded by 10 June 1976 the total sum of $297,956.12.
The appellant`s version is this. It was the 2 or 3 March 1976 when he was informed of Santhiran`s defalcations. He was bewildered and found it difficult to accept that a lawyer would commit breach of trust. He then sent for Santhiran. He pointed out entries in the ledger to Santhiran who remained silent. He then pointed out further entries. Santhiran still remained silent. He then raised his voice and asked Santhiran to give him an answer. He told Santhiran that if it was true that he had taken money, he had brought great shame upon himself, his family and `on us in the firm`. He did not make any mention of a threat to `report him to the Law Society in certain circumstances or not to report him to the Law Society in certain circumstances`. He did not make any promise to Santhiran that he would not `tell any authority if he repaid the money`. The appellant claimed that at the conclusion of that interview Santhiran become to become very repentant and sorry did said that he would find the monies to mitigate what he had done.
Under cross-examination, the appellant admitted scolding Santhiran but denied abusing him. The appellant admitted that he called Santhiran a liar. He admitted further that he demanded the return of all monies taken by Santhiran.
As regards the meeting in the appellant`s house at Parbury Avenue the appellant claimed that Santhiran asked him if he could have more time `to produce evidence in respect of various lists that have been shown to him from time to time in the earlier part of the week`. Santhiran was alleged to have said that he wanted to repay the monies he had taken. Appellant told him that he had been making himself a little bit of a nuisance in the office; that he had been hysterical and emotional and this had upset the staff. Appellant told him further that `until he could prove that the clients had received the money he should refund what he had taken`. Santhiran agreed but asked for time. The appellant agreed to a reasonable time. This is all that the appellant told the trial judge regarding what took place at the meeting at the appellant`s house. There is no reference at all to abuse or threat and no denial of Santhiran`s claim that he was threatened that if he did not pay up he would be reported to the Law Society.
Under cross-examination the appellant admitted scolding Santhiran at this meeting but denied abusing him. He admitted that he was not very friendly with Santhiran at this meeting. The appellant also denied promising Santhiran that if he repaid $300,000 the appellant would not report him to the Law Society.
It is contended on behalf of the appellant that the case against him was based entirely on the evidence of Santhiran; that Santhiran was not only an accomplice but also a thoroughly dishonest and unreliable witness and therefore the appellant should have been acquitted at the close of the prosecution`s case. Reliance is placed on the following passage in the judgment of Lord Hailsham in 
 Regina v 
 Kilbourne, 
[1973] AC 729
 at p 746: 
 
...Corroboration is only required or afforded if the witness requiring corroboration or giving it is otherwise credible. If his evidence is not credible, a witness`s testimony should be rejected and the accused acquitted, even if there could be found evidence capable of being corroboration in other testimony. Corroboration can only be afforded to or by a witness who is otherwise to be believed. If a witness`s testimony falls of its own inanition the question of his needing, or being capable of giving, corroboration does not arise ....
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant has however failed to take notice of the following passage which appears on the same page: 
 
They (the jury) must look at the evidence as a whole before asking themselves whether the evidence of a given witness is credible in itself and whether, if otherwise credible, it is corroborated ...
 
 
 
This is exactly what the learned district judge did at the close of the case for the prosecution. He did not consider Santhiran`s evidence in isolation. He considered it in the light of all the evidence tendered by the prosecution and he found that Santhiran was in his opinion `truthful in his evidence as regards the agreement or arrangement he had with the accused to make restitution in consideration of the accused concealing, his offence`. Having found that Santhiran`s evidence on the issue before him was credible and realising that Santhiran was an accomplice, the learned district judge then looked for corroboration of Santhiran`s evidence. The learned district judge has stated in his judgment that he `looked for supporting evidence` and found it `in abundance in the evidence of other witnesses and, above all, in the conduct of both the accused and Santhiran in this entire episode`.
Counsel for the appellant submits that the learned district judge has here misdirected himself because a witness cannot corroborate himself and that the learned district judge is clearly in error when he states that Santhiran`s evidence is corroborated by his conduct.
It is true that a witness cannot corroborate himself, much less can an accomplice, but the learned district judge was quite clearly not referring to any statement made by Santhiran as evidence providing corroboration of the alleged arrangement. He was referring to the subsequent conduct of Santhiran which in his opinion lent support to Santhiran`s assertion that there was in fact such an arrangement. The conduct of an accomplice is always relevant evidence and if it supports his evidence it can be taken into consideration. As to what weight should be given to such conduct depends entirely on the circumstances of the case.
In the present case, the fact that initially Santhiran made very rapid restitution clearly tends to support Santhiran`s claim that there was an arrangement to conceal his offences. It is submitted that Santhiran made such rapid and substantial restitutions not because of any arrangement between the parties but because he was repentant and sorry for what he had done. This contention is not borne out by the evidence. Santhiran after a while, suspected that the appellant was not going to keep his part of the bargain. Santhiran raised all sorts of difficulties. He did not give his full cooperation in the investigations that were being carried out by the staff of Braddell Brothers and later by independent accountants to ascertain the full amount of his defalcations. He was quite obviously endeavouring to keep back as much money as was possible. This is admitted by the appellant. It was clearly not the conduct of a repentant or remorseful man.
Then again, Santhiran continued to work with Braddell Brothers without any salary for ten months after the discovery of his defalcations. What was the incentive for him to do that? There could be only one incentive, the concealment of his offences from the proper authorities. So much for Santhiran`s conduct.
The appellant`s conduct lends much more support to Santhiran`s claim that there was an arrangement for the covering up of his offences.
First, the appellant did not expeditiously report Santhiran`s offences, neither to the Law Society nor to the police. He did so, only when he could no longer help it - some 13 or 14 months after the offences were discovered. The appellant explain the delay as follows: 
 
I did not report the discovery made in early March to the Law Society or the police ... because the whole thing was in an utter mess.
 
 
 
I had no idea what the extent was. I had to discover and check the full extent before reporting it.
In the early days of the discovery, I would have had nothing concrete to offer to the police or the Law Society.
All this is very far from the truth. The defalcations were discovered in the first week of March 1976 and before the month of March was out, Santhiran had not only admitted criminal breach of trust but had also made restitution of the total sum of $267,956.12. As already stated, Santhiran handed the appellant on 4 March 1976 six cheques (Exhs P21 to P21E) totalling $39,181.31. These six cheques were for sums taken from the accounts of six different clients of Braddell Brothers, and upon receipt of these cheques, the amounts were credited to the accounts of those clients. Here was not only concrete evidence of six acts of criminal breach of trust but also evidence sufficient to warrant Santhiran`s conviction. The truth of the matter is that the appellant did not wish to report Santhiran`s defalcations. By reporting him, the appellant would be breaching his bargain with Santhiran who would not only immediately stop his cooperation in the investigations that were going on but also stop making restitution. A further fear on the part of the appellant was that if he reported Santhiran to the police, they would be interested only in getting a conviction against Santhiran on the amounts already refunded and they may not carry out further investigations thoroughly and relentlessly to discover the full amount of the defalcations. The appellant admitted this fear in cross-examination. The appellant`s explanation for the delay in reporting the matter to the police was not a very honest one.
Much has been made of the fact that the appellant saw the Attorney General in connection with Santhiran`s offences. In the first place, the appellant saw the Attorney General over a year after the offences were discovered. Secondly, the Attorney General not having been called, we do not know what the appellant told the Attorney General. Solicitors often see the Attorney General in order to persuade him to drop a charge against their client or to reduce the charge to that of a lesser offence. No one ever sees the Attorney General to report a crime. The Attorney General is not a policeman. Reports of crimes must be made at a police station in compliance with the provisions of s 114 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The fact that the appellant saw the Attorney General is, in the circumstances of this case, of no help at all to the appellant.
It is submitted by counsel for the appellant that the delay in reporting the matter to the police was an error of judgment on the part of the appellant. This is not borne out by the evidence which shows that the delay was calculated, purposeful and motivated and therefore it could not be an innocent error of judgement.
The evidence shows that the appellant consciously concealed the offences committed by Santhiran. The appellant instructed his legal assistant named Thillianathan who was the first person to discover Santhiran`s defalcations, to tell all the other legal assistants `to keep the matter within themselves`.
The appellant had a suspense account opened in the firm`s ledger and the restitutions made by Santhiran were first entered in this suspense account. The appellant was the person who suggested the title of this suspense account. When questioned on this suspense account by R Subramaniam, an audit clerk from Turquand Youngs & Co who were his firm`s auditors, the appellant professed ignorance and stated that Santhiran would be the best person who would know about it.
The appellant failed to inform his auditors of Santhiran`s defalcations until he was confronted by Victor Fernandes an accountant from Turquand Youngs. Even then he put him off by saying that he would like to discuss it `in greater detail at a more convenient time`. He even suggested to Fernandes, quite improperly, that the amount in the suspense account could be treated as income for the year ending December 1976. In March 1977 when two partners of Turquand Youngs saw him regarding the suspense account, he threatened to dismiss Turquand Youngs as his auditors when they insisted on giving publicity to Santhiran`s defalcations in their report to the Law Society.
The appellant made exhortations of secrecy in respect of Santhiran`s offences to various people at various times. For example he heavily stressed to Mr Jamshed Medora, a chartered accountant in the firm of Medora & Tong whom he approached to carry out an independent investigation, that the matter must be kept from Turquand Youngs until Medora & Tong had finalised their report.
The appellant`s conduct in allowing Santhiran to continue in practice as a senior legal assistant in Braddell Brothers after the discovery of the misdeeds was yet another confirmation that the appellant had agreed not to reveal his offences which would have exposed him as a dishonest person quite unfit to continue as a member of the Bar. The appellant even obtained a practising certificate for Santhiran, to which he would not have been entitled if his offences had been disclosed to the Law Society.
When an advocate and solicitor applies for the yearly renewal of his practising certificate he has to comply with the provisions of s 29(1)(c) of the Legal Profession Act. He has to produce an accountant`s report or a certificate from the Council of the Law Society that owing to the circumstances of his case such a report is unnecessary. To obtain Santhiran`s practising certificate in late March 1976 a certificate from the Council of the Law Society was produced. I feel certain that the Council of the Law Society would not have issued their certificate if it had been reported to them that Santhiran had committed criminal breach of trust. It would appear that Santhiran`s practising certificate was obtained by deception to which the appellant was a party.
There is also the evidence of two independent and reliable witnesses which lends further support to the case against the appellant. They are N Subramaniam and Wong Siong Poon, both accountants and partners in Turquand Youngs. They heard on 9 March 1977 from one of their accountants named Fernandes who was carrying out the yearly audit of the accounts of the appellant`s firm that there was a suspense account representing monies returned by an employee of Braddell Brothers who had committed criminal breach of trust. They were concerned with the appellant`s failure to inform Turquand Youngs of the defalcations when they were discovered and they saw the appellant to discuss the suspense account. Subramaniam and Wong expressed the view that an investigation had to be carried out by Turquand Youngs before the accountant`s report, required under s 29(1)(c) of the Legal Profession Act, could be issued by them. They expressed the further view that there was a breach of the solicitors` accounts rules and that it was their responsibility, as reporting accountants, to draw the attention of the Law Society to such a breach. The appellant insisted that there was no need for an investigation on their part and that they need not refer to Santhiran`s defalcations in the accountant`s report as he himself had not committed any breach of the rules. The appellant told them that if they were unable to issue an unqualified report, he would have no alternative but to terminate their services. The evidence of Subramaniam and Wong shows quite clearly that even in March 1977 ie a year after the defalcations were discovered, the appellant was still resisting the disclosure of Santhiran`s offences. By March 1977 Santhiran had already left Braddell Brothers. He had started his own practice. He had stopped cooperating in the investigations, had made no restitution after June 1976 and yet the appellant was not prepared to have his offences disclosed to the Law Society.
The appellant had told Santhiran at the meeting at the appellant`s house in Parbury Avenue, when Santhiran told him that he would refund $250,000, that he knew `how to handle the matter` and `how to settle the accounts`. It would appear that the appellant`s scheme was that after Santhiran had made full restitution, he would request Santhiran to get himself voluntarily struck off the rolls and he would then try and persuade the Attorney General not to prosecute Santhiran on the ground that full restitution had been made and that Santhiran had been struck off the rolls on his own application. This is borne out by what he told Medora to do. The appellant requested Medora in April 1977 to inform Santhiran that if he would make restitution of a further sum of $26,290.12, or if he provided a guarantor who would make good that sum and get himself voluntarily struck off the rolls, then that would be the end of the whole matter and no report would be made to the police. This attempt to obtain $26,290.12 is the subject-matter of the ninth charge. Santhiran rejected this offer but it confirms the appellant`s very clear intention not to report to the police. When Santhiran rejected this offer, the appellant reported him to the Law Society as well as the police.
In the light of all this evidence, how can it be said that the restitution was not accepted in consideration of concealing Santhiran`s offences.
Restitution was accepted by the appellant. Santhiran`s offences were concealed by the appellant for more than a year. And Santhiran did not make restitution out of remorse. There is no evidence that he was repentent, sorry or remorseful. He made restitution out of fear of being reported to the Law Society which would have resulted in his being struck off the rolls. This fear in Santhiran was raised by the appellant at the meeting in the conference room of Braddell Brothers and again at the meeting in the appellant`s house which took place a few days later. At both meetings, only the appellant and Santhiran were present and in the circumstances corroboration of threats made by the appellant cannot be expected from an eye-witness. Corroboration can come only from inferences from the rest of the evidence in this case. The appellant admitted shouting at Santhiran, scolding him, calling him a liar and being angry, heated and rude to him. Santhiran claimed that he was abused in no uncertain terms and threatened that if he did not pay up he would be reported to the Law Society. The fact that Santhiran immediately made frantic efforts at restitution considered in the light of all the evidence already narrated leaves one in no doubt at all that the appellant must have threatened Santhiran that if he did not make restitution, his offences would be reported to the Law Society.
If an employer tells an employee who has committed criminal breach of trust of property belonging to the employer: `If you don`t make restitution I will report you` there is an implied promise that if restitution is made the employee will not be reported and the offence will be concealed. The employer may have no intention at all of keeping the underlying promise and concealing the offence but if the employer`s words and conduct lead the employee to believe that his offence will be concealed and as a result of that belief he makes restitution, the offence under s 213 of the Penal Code is made out because in those circumstances the employer is clearly accepting the restitution in consideration of concealing the employee`s offence. The evidence shows that that is exactly what happened in this case. Santhiran made frantic restitution believing that his offences would be concealed by the appellant.
It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the learned district judge did not give sufficient consideration to the evidence of Ramanujan who gave evidence for the defence. Ramanujan was an accountant employed by Medora and Tong who were carrying out an independent investigation to ascertain the full extent of Santhiran`s defalcations. Ramanujan did the investigation on behalf of his firm at Braddell Brothers in November and December 1976 and he came to know Santhiran. In January 1977 when Santhiran had already left Braddell Brothers and was practising on his own, he saw Ramanujan and requested him to find out from the appellant `that if he paid up whatever balance was due to him, would he drop the action against him?` Ramanujan saw the appellant who told Ramanujan that `it was not a question of money but of principle` and that `he could not drop any action whatsoever`. Subsequently Santhiran contacted Ramanujan on the telephone and was told what the appellant had stated. Now, the argument advanced is that if there had been any agreement or promise to conceal Santhiran`s offences in consideration of restitution, Santhiran would have complained to Ramanujan that the appellant had broken the agreement and that as Santhiran made no such complaint to Ramanujan, it proves that there was never any such agreement or promise.
In my opinion this is a completely negative argument devoid of any merit. Santhiran had no reason at all to complain to Ramanujan because Ramanujan was not the person who brought about the agreement or promise. He played no part in it and was not responsible for it in any way and therefore there were no grounds at all for Santhiran to complain to him about it or even to discuss it. I agree with the view of the learned district judge that the evidence of Ramanujan is of no significance at all. This conversation between Ramanujan and Santhiran took place in January 1977 some seven months after the last alleged offence committed by the appellant. Santhiran had left Braddell Brothers and had already by then lost faith in the appellant`s promise to conceal his offences. He was merely seeking confirmation of his belief that the appellant would soon expose his crimes and endeavouring if possible to prevent it by offering to pay the balance. Ramanujan`s evidence is of no help to the appellant. It does not prove that the appellant never made any promise to conceal Santhiran`s offences.
The learned district judge states in his judgment that he gave very anxious consideration to the evidence in this case. I have done the same and I cannot find any ground for setting aside the appellant`s convictions on the first eight charges. These convictions are confirmed.
As regards the ninth charge which alleges an attempt to obtain from Santhiran restitution through Medora of a further sum of $26,290.12 in consideration of concealing his offences, I find that this charge cannot stand. Medora admitted under cross-examination that what the appellant requested him to do was to inform Santhiran that if he would pay up $26,290.12 and voluntarily get himself struck off the rolls by admitting the breaches, then that would be the end of the matter. This was confirmed by Santhiran. In those circumstances there was no question of concealing the offences. The conviction on the ninth charge is set aside and the fine imposed is ordered to be refunded to the appellant.
I now come to the submissions made on the sentences passed on the first eight charges. These sentences are attacked on two grounds. First, it is contended that as the fines imposed on the eight charges total $28,000, the provisions of s 17 of the Criminal Procedure Code and Article 7(1) of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia (applicable to Singapore by virtue of s 6(3) of the Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965) have been breached and that the sentences are therefore illegal and should be set aside.
The appellant`s offences were committed in 1976. His trial took place in 1978. In between these two dates, s 17 of the Criminal Procedure Code was amended with effect from 1 January 1977. In 1976 ie at the date of the commission of the offences the provisions of s 17 were as follows: 
 
Where a person is convicted at one trial of any two or more distinct offences the court may sentence him for such offences to the several punishments prescribed therefor which such court is competent to inflict; such punishments when consisting of imprisonment to commence the one after the expiration of the other in such order as the court directs or to run concurrently if the court so directs, but it shall not be necessary for the court, by reason only of the aggregate punishment for the several offences being in excess of the punishment which it is competent to inflict on conviction of one single offence, to send the offender for trial before a higher court.
 
 
 
Provided that if the case is tried by a district court or magistrate`s court the aggregate punishment shall not exceed twice the amount of punishment which such Court in the exercise of its ordinary jurisdiction is competent to inflict.
In 1978 ie at the date of the trial, the proviso to s 17 reads as follows: 
 
Provided that if the case is tried by a district court or magistrate`s court the aggregate punishment of 
 imprisonment
 shall not exceed twice the amount of punishment which such Court in the exercise of its ordinary jurisdiction is competent to inflict.
 
 
 
The italicised words `of imprisonment` had been added by the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, 1976 which came into force on 1 January 1977. The amendment had removed the restrictions relating to the aggregate of fines. Prior to this amendment, a district court could not impose at one trial fines totalling more than $10,000 because the maximum fine that a district court can impose in the exercise of its ordinary jurisdiction is $5,000 (s 11(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code). After the amendment, ie as from 1 January 1977 a district court is quite clearly competent and has the lawful power to impose on a person convicted at one trial of any two or more distinct offences fines totalling, more than $10,000. There is no restriction at all as to the total fines that it can impose. Article 7(1) of the Federal Constitution reads as follows: 
 
7(1) No person shall be punished for an act or omission which was not punishable by law when it was done or made, and 
 no person shall suffer greater punishment for an offence than was prescribed by law at the time it was committed
.
 
 
 
The appellant relies on the second limb which I have emphasised. The argument is that when one reads the proviso to s 17 of the Criminal Procedure Code as it stood in 1976 when the offences were committed together with the provisions of Article 7(1) of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia, it is plain that the appellant could not be fined more than $10,000 in respect of all his nine charges.
In my judgment there is no merit at all in this submission. There is clearly some confusion on counsel`s part for he has failed to distinguish between `punishment prescribed for an offence` and `powers of a court` to impose punishment. The punishment for an offence under s 213 of the Penal Code is laid down in that section. There has been no change in the punishment prescribed in s 213 between the date of the offences and the date of the appellant`s trial. The change that has taken place is in the powers of a district court to impose fines. Whereas at the date of the appellant`s offences in 1976 a district court could not impose fines totalling more than $10,000 it could do so at the date of his trial in 1978. It is not understood how this change can affect the appellant. No ex post facto legislation has been enacted altering or increasing, the punishment under s 213 of the Penal Code. If the appellant had been tried by the High Court, he clearly could not raise the objection to the fines that he is now raising because the powers of a High Court in respect of the aggregate of fines are unlimited. How can he raise any objection to the aggregate of the fines imposed by the district court when at the date of his trial the district court`s powers were also unlimited in that respect. The submission made on behalf of the appellant amounts to this: that the district court in passing sentence on him should have restricted itself to its powers in 1976 when the offences were committed and should not have made use of the powers it had in 1978 at the date of the appellant`s trial. The submission is manifestly wrong and is rejected.
Next, it is submitted that the appellant should have been tried in 1976 and had that been done, the district court could not have imposed the fines that it imposed in 1978. The answer to that is that in 1976 the appellant could have been tried by the High Court which could have imposed the fines in question. Furthermore, an accused person has no fundamental right to pick the court or the time for his trial. In any case the appellant could not have been tried in 1976 because Santhiran`s offences were reported to the police by the appellant in 1977 and it was only thereafter that the appellant`s offences came to light. This submission is also manifestly wrong and is rejected.
The second ground is that the fines imposed are manifestly excessive having regard to all the circumstances of the case. Reliance is also placed on the provisions of s 71 of the Penal Code. Sub-s (1) of this section provides: 
 
(1) Where anything which is an offence is made up of parts, any of which parts is itself an offence, the offender shall not be punished with the punishment of more than one of such his offences, unless it be so expressly provided.
 
 
 
Illustration (a) makes the provisions of sub-s (1) very clear: 
 
(a) 
 A
gives 
 Z
fifty strokes with a stick. Here 
 A
may have committed the offence of voluntarily causing hurt to 
 Z
by the whole beating, and also by each of the blows which make up the whole beating. If 
 A
were liable to punishment for every blow, he might be imprisoned for fifty years, one for each blow. But he is liable only to one punishment for the whole beating.
 
 
 
The appellant could have been charged with one offence to the effect that between 4 March 1976 and 10 June 1976 he accepted restitution of $297,956.12 in consideration of his concealing offences of criminal breach of trust committed by Santhiran. It would have been more favourable to the appellant if the prosecution had done this but then restitutions had been accepted on separate dates, some of them far apart, and it is not wrong on the part of the prosecution to have proceeded on eight separate charges. The charges are certainly not illegal. There is however considerable merit in the submission based on s 71 of the Penal Code.
It seems to me that in passing sentence learned district judge did not give sufficient consideration to two matters favourable to the appellant. First, credit should be given to the appellant for having regularly served on the Council of the Law Society ever since its inception.
The other matter which also deserves credit is the appellant`s services to the University of Singapore, where for the last 18 years he has given his valuable time to teach at the Law Faculty of the University of Singapore. The success of the Faculty especially in the early years of its formation was in no uncertain terms due to the many practising advocates and solicitors like the appellant who volunteered to teach in their spare time or after office hours.
The fines imposed on the eight charges total $28,000 and for the reasons already given this sum appears to be manifestly excessive. Had the acceptance of restitution by the appellant been the subject of a single charge, as it could have been by reason of the provisions of s 71 of the Penal Code, the maximum fine that the district court could have imposed on that charge would have been $5,000. But then the Public Prosecutor may well have asked that the charge be tried by the High Court. In my opinion justice will be done in this case if the fines on each of the eight charges are reduced from $3,500 to $1,500. The difference is ordered to be refunded to the appellant.
Before parting with this case, I am constrained to observe that the offence of accepting restitution of one`s own property in consideration of concealing an offence should be abolished. It seems to me that it is not dishonest for a person to try and recover his own property from one who has committed criminal breach of trust in respect of it.

The appellant Mathew Bohman occupies premises No 3811D Jalan Bukit Merah Redhill Industrial Estate, Singapore as tenant of the Jurong Town Corp, the respondents in this appeal. The said premises are a factory unit within a flatted factory block known as Redhill Industrial Estate Block No 1. There are 35 such units in this block. The appellant`s unit is on the second floor of the building. He manufactures festive decorations and craft accessories. There is a common loading platform or loading bay on the ground floor of the building. This platform is raised a few feet from the ground level so that when a lorry is backed against it, the floor boards of the lorry match the level of the platform and this facilitates the loading of goods off and on the lorry. The platform has a short flight of steps at one end as shown in photograph exh AB17.
On 21 June 1976 the appellant was standing on the edge of the platform, in a position immediately adjacent to the steps, and supervising the loading of goods into a lorry which had backed against the platform when he inadvertently stepped back on to the steps as shown in photograph exh no P13. He suffered a fall and sustained injuries. He claimed damages for personal injuries on the following grounds:
 
 
(a) Breach of statutory duty on the part of the respondents.
  
 
 
 
(b) Alternatively, negligence of the respondents, their servants and agents.
  
 
 
 
(c) Alternatively, breach of contract.
  
 
 
At the hearing of the claim before the district court, special damages were agreed at $144 and general damages at $6,000. Evidence was called by both parties and the issue of liability was argued. The district judge dismissed the appellant`s claim with costs.
On appeal before me, it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the premises fell within the scope of the Factories Act and that the respondents as landlords and owners contravened ss 33(2) and (4) of the Factories Act which provide as follows: 
 
(2) All openings in floors shall be securely fenced except in so far as the nature of the work renders such fencing impracticable.
 
 
 
(4) For every staircase in a building or affording a means of exit from a building, a substantial handrail shall be provided and maintained, which, if the staircase has an open side, shall be on that side, and, in the case of a staircase having two open sides, such a handrail shall be provided and maintained on both sides. Any open side of a staircase shall also be guarded by the provision and maintenance of a lower rail or other effective means.
 
 
 
In my judgment the provisions of sub-ss (2) and (4) of s 33 on which the appellant relied, had no application to the facts of this case. The steps were not an opening in the floor nor were they a staircase within the meaning of the subsection which in my opinion clearly contemplates a flight of steps leading from one storey to another storey. Steps are normally provided to overcome different levels on the same floor and that in my opinion is the sense in which the expression is used in the Act because in sub-s 1) of s 33 both expressions, `steps` and `staircase` appear side by side and the legislature has by implication clearly ascribed different meanings to them. Accordingly `steps` cannot include or mean a `staircase`.
Next, it was submitted, that the respondents were liable because they were in breach of a duty to take care imposed by common law. It was contended that the steps were not only unsafe but also dangerous and that there should have been a kerb or handrail erected on their open side to make them safe.
In my opinion the claim in negligence was also not well founded. A landlord owes no duty to his tenant save and except to carry out repairs if he has so agreed at the time of the letting. See the decision of the House of Lords in 
 Cavalier v 
 Pope 
[1906] AC 428
 which is still good law in Singapore although it has been reversed in England by s 4(1) of the Occupiers` Liability Act 1957. The accident in this case was not due to disrepair of the common loading platform. The platform was at the time of the accident in the same state as when the premises were first let to the appellant. There was no hidden defect or concealed danger in the platform. The appellant had seen and used the platform for five years prior to this accident and if there was any danger in the use of the platform the appellant knew that danger very well. He had knowledge or notice of the existence of the so called danger through which he has suffered. `If one knows of the danger and runs the risk he has no cause of action` 
 per 
Lord Atkinson in 
 Cavalier v Pope 
, supra. In my judgment, there was no danger at all in the use of the platform because it was not in a dangerous state. The accident occurred due to a negligent act on the part of the appellant. There was no evidence of negligence on the part of the respondents. The claim in negligence failed and was rejected.
The last ground relied upon by the appellant was `breach of contract`. The appellant relied on cl 3(2) of the tenancy greement which reads: 
 
The landlord hereby covenants with the tenant as follows - To keep the exterior and roof of the building around the lift entrances corridors passages staircase lavatories water closets and other conveniences intended for the use of the tenant at all times in complete repair and in proper sanitary and clean condition and fit for comfortable use and enjoyment by the tenant.
 
 
 
I could not see anything in this clause which could be of assistance to the appellant in his claim.
The evidence showed quite clearly and it was admitted by the appellant, that the accident was due to the appellant stepping backwards without having first ascertained that it was safe to do. The plaintiff ought to have known that his presence on the loading platform in a position immediately adjacent to the steps involved a risk. The appellant knew that the steps were there. The appellant admitted under cross-examination that he did not realise that he was only a few inches from the edge. If he had looked behind to his left in the direction of the steps which he knew were there, the accident would not have occurred. In my judgment the negligence of the appellant was the sole cause of the accident and the respondents were entirely free of blame. The appeal was accordingly dismissed with costs.

This is an application by Daud bin Salleh for a writ of habeas corpus.
The affidavit filed by the applicant states that he is a Singapore citizen; that before his arrest he was staying with his father at No 20-H, Lorong Engku Aman, Singapore and that he was employed as a gardener by the Housing and Development Board.
The facts according to the applicant are that he was arrested by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau on the afternoon of 27 May 1980. He was taken to Joo Chiat Police Station where he was detained in a lock-up. The following day he was taken to the Central Narcotics Bureau at Pearl`s Hill and from there to the Sembawang Drug Rehabilitation Centre where he was detained and given the `cold turkey` treatment. He was seen by a doctor on the next two consecutive days but at no time was any sample of his urine taken for analysis. Later, he was informed that he would be detained for three years.
The applicant contended that he had been unlawfully detained. When a person who has been deprived of his liberty challenges the detention by a petition for habeas corpus, it is for the authority who has detained him to show that the person has been detained in exercise of a valid legal power. Once that is shown, it is for the detenu to show that the power has been exercised mala fide or improperly.
Counsel for the respondent relies on the provisions of ss 33(1) and 33(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 (the Act) which provide as follows: 
 
(1) The director of the Central Narcotics Bureau may require any person whom he reasonably suspects to be a drug addict to be medically examined or observed by a Government medical officer or a medical practitioner.
 
 
 
 
(2) If as a result of such examination or observation or as a result of a urine test it appears to the director of the Central Narcotics Bureau that it is necessary for any person to undergo treatment or rehabilitation or both at an approved institution, the director may make an order in writing requiring that person to be admitted for such purpose to an approved institution.
  
 
 
It is contended on behalf of the respondent that the applicant is lawfully detained under s 33(2) of the Act.
Affidavits have been filed by Mr Tee Tua Ba who was the director of the Central Narcotics Bureau, Singapore, on 22 May 1980 when the applicant was sent for medical examination and by Mr Poh Geok EK who was the Acting Director of the said Bureau on 26 May 1980 when the order was made for the detention of the applicant at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre.
Mr Tee Tua Ba states in his affidavit: 
 
... On 21 May 1980 some time between 1.30 o`clock and 3 o`clock in the afternoon, the applicant, Daud bin Salleh was arrested by officers from Joo Chiat Police Station at a vacant plot of land off Jalan Pasir, Singapore, on suspicion of being involved in drug activities. Following his arrest and from information received I had reasonable grounds to suspect that the said Daud bin Salleh was a drug addict. In exercise of the powers conferred on me under s 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1973 I issued a written request on 22 May 1980 to the Government Medical Officer of the Drug Rehabilitation Centre, Sembawang, to medically examine and observe the said applicant Daud bin Salleh ...
 
 
 
Mr Poh Geok Ek states in his affidavit: 
 
... On 26 May 1980 I received a report No P 0625/80 from Dr Ng Ban Cheong the Government Medical Officer of the Drug Rehabilitation Centre, Sembawang, which was addressed to the director of the Central Narcotics Bureau, I annex hereto the said Report which is marked as exh No `PGE 1`.
 
 
 
As a result of the findings of Dr Ng Ban Cheong as contained in his report which is referred to herein as exh No `PGE. 1`, it appeared to me to be necessary that the applicant, Daud bin Salleh should undergo treatment and rehabilitation at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre, Sembawang, which is an approved institution. Accordingly, in exercise of the powers under s 33(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1973 conferred on me by s 33(2A) of the same Act, I made an order in writing dated 26 May 1980 directing that the applicant be admitted to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre, Sembawang to undergo treatment and rehabilitation with effect from 26 May 1980 ...
 
 
 
The medical report on which Mr Poh Geok Ek the acting director of Central Narcotics Bureau acted and made the order for the detention of the applicant at the Sembawang Drug Rehabilitation Centre reads as follows: 
 
The abovenamed was admitted to the Centre on 22 May 1980. He said on 21 May 1980 about 1pm Joo Chiat Police arrested him at Jalan Pasir.
 
 
 
In the course of my examinations and observations of the subject, I found that he had definite clinical evidence of drug withdrawal syndrome consistent with heroin addicted.
 
 
 
In my opinion he is a heroin addict.
 
 
 
The order made by Mr Poh Geok Ek the acting director of the Central Narcotics Bureau, on 26 May 1980 requiring that the applicant be admitted to the Sembawang Drug Rehabilitation Centre was attacked by counsel for the applicant on two grounds. First, it was submitted that Mr Tee Tua Ba the director of the Central Narcotics Bureau had no grounds at all on 22 May 1980 to require the applicant to be medically examined. It was alleged that the affidavit of Mr Tee did not set out the evidence on which he `reasonably suspected` the applicant to be a drug addict and therefore his requirement that the applicant be medically examined was bad in law and vitiated the order made by Mr Poh Geok Ek on 26 May 1980 requiring the applicant to be admitted to the Sembawang Drug Rehabilitation Centre.
In my judgment, the condition precedent for requiring a person to be medically examined is the subjective satisfaction of the director. Section 33(1) provides that any person whom the director `reasonably suspects to be a drug addict` may be required to be medically examined. The director alone has to decide whether there is a reasonable cause to suspect a person to be a drug addict. If the director has acted in good faith, he cannot be called upon to disclose what circumstances made him to `reasonably suspect` a person to be a drug addict. It is obvious that in many cases the director will be acting on information of the most confidential character, which could not be communicated to the person concerned or disclosed to the court without the greatest risk of prejudicing the future efforts of the director in such cases. The question is one of detention justified by suspicion, not of criminal conviction which can only be justified by legal evidence. A court of law manifestly cannot pronounce upon suspicion. I may also quote the words of Lord Finlay LC in 
 R v Halliday, ex p Zadig 
[1917] AC 260
, 269. 
 
It seems obvious that no tribunal for investigating the question whether circumstances of suspicion exist warranting some restraint can be imagined less appropriate than a court of law.
 
 
 
The court cannot undertake an investigation as to the sufficiency of the material which made the director to `reasonably suspect` the applicant. In my judgment, once the director makes an order requiring a person, whom he reasonably suspects to be a drug addict, to be medically examined, the only question left is whether the director has exercised his power under s 33(1) of the Act in good faith. In this case there is no allegation of bad faith on the part of the director. The applicant in his affidavit merely denied being a drug addict and denies that there can be any reason for the director to `reasonably suspect` him to be a drug addict. This, in my view is clearly insufficient to discharge the onus of proving bad faith on the part of the director.
The second ground relied upon by counsel for the applicant raises a more substantive issue. It concerns the order made by Mr Poh Geok Ek the acting director, on 26 May 1980 requiring the applicant to be admitted to the Sembawang Drug Rehabilitation Centre, in short, the detention order. It is submitted that under s 33(2) of the Act, it must be made to `appear to the director` that it is necessary for a person to undergo treatment or rehabilitation; that in this case the Director acted on the bare opinion of the medical officer; that there was no factual evidence before the director on which it could `appear to him` that the applicant should undergo treatment and that the order was therefore improperly made.
In my view, the power granted to the director under s 33(2) of the Act to require a person to be admitted to an approved institution for treatment or rehabilitation is subjective of his satisfaction which must be based on the evidence prescribed by the statute. The competence of the director to make a detention order is plainly subject to a condition precedent. Before the director can exercise his power under s 33(2) of the Act the person suspected to be a drug addict must be medically examined or observed or subjected to a urine test. The director must make his decision on factual evidence gathered in the medical examination, or by observation or disclosed by the urine test. In this case no urine test was made. The director acted on the report of the medical officer. The report did not set out factual evidence or any clinical evidence on which the director could form his own opinion as to whether or not the applicant was a drug addict. The medical report on which the director acted merely stated that the applicant was, in the opinion of the medical officer, a drug addict. It follows that the director acted on the bare opinion of the medical officer. The director could hardly be satisfied on his own, if he did not have the requisite material before him on which he could exercise his personal judgment before making the order of 26 May 1980.
It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that the director is not medically qualified and is therefore not in a position to appreciate clinical evidence and form a judgment on it and that he is entitled to act on the opinion of the medical officer.
It is a well-known principle of law that when a power has been confided to a person in circumstances indicating that trust is being placed in his individual judgment and discretion, he must exercise that power personally unless he has been expressly empowered to delegate it to another. An authority entrusted with a discretion must not in the purported exercise of its discretion, act under the dictation of another body or person. The director has a right to decline to follow any advice and reject any opinion offered or expressed by a medical officer in his report. An order under s 33(2) of the Act drastically affects the liberty of the person and must be made on the personal judgment of the director in whom is vested the power to make such orders.
The legislature has vested the power of detention in the director and before he can exercise it, it must be made to appear to him on relevant factual evidence that it is necessary for the person medically examined to undergo treatment at an approved institution. The existence of factual evidence is a condition precedent for the making of the order. There must be material before him on which the director can form an independent opinion. When an order made by the director under s 33(2) of the Act is challenged, the director should be able to produce for the court`s scrutiny the material on which he formed his personal judgment before making the impugned order. The courts cannot and must not shirk to assert their power, which they undoubtedly have, to scrutinise the factual bases upon which the director has exercised his discretionary power under s 33(2) of the Act.
The applicant has in this case obtained and filed an affidavit by Dr Gwee Ah Leng the former senior physician of the Singapore General Hospital in which Dr Gwee states that the medical report relied upon by the director `does not disclose that the applicant is a drug addict`. This is not quite correct. The medical report does state and therefore does disclose that in the opinion of the medical officer, the applicant is a drug addict. What Dr Gwee probably meant is that the medical report in question does not set out any clinical evidence on which a finding can be made that the applicant is a drug addict. If this is what he meant, then I agree with him entirely.
Where there is the requisite evidence before the director, it is not for this court to say whether such evidence is adequate or sufficient for an order under s 33(2) of the Act. It is not for the court to question whether the factual evidence placed before the director is sufficient or not for the subjective satisfaction of the director or whether the subjective decision is right or not. The role of the court is limited to ensuring that the director`s discretion has been exercised according to law. But where, as in this case, the applicant satisfies the court that the director did not have before him any factual evidence on which he could have made up his own mind, the order made by the director cannot be sustained and must be set aside.
A medical officer required to carry out an examination or observation on a suspected drug addict is of course entitled to express his opinion whether or not the person is a drug addict, but before the does so he must set out his factual or clinical findings on which he bases his opinion. If his opinion is based entirely on observations, then he must set out in his report what he observed. If he observed `withdrawal symptoms` then he must set out in his report what those symptoms were which he classified as `withdrawal symptoms`. If a full medical report prepared along these lines is placed before the director and it appears to him from such a report that the person examined or observed should undergo treatment or rehabilitation at an approved institution, the director will be acting well within his power in making a detention order under s 33(2) of the Act.
In my judgment, there was no material in this case before the director on which he could make up his own mind whether or not the applicant was a person who required treatment at an approved institution. I hold accordingly that the order made by the acting director on 26 May 1980 was improperly made. In the result the application succeeds. Habeas corpus is allowed.
It may be said that this application has been allowed on a mere technicality. That is not so. The liberty of the subject is involved and legislation affecting a person`s liberty must be strictly construed and strictly complied with. There must not be any relaxation of the vigilance of the court in seeing that the law is duly observed especially in a matter so fundamental as the liberty of the subject.

This is an appeal against the decision of the learned magistrate who dismissed the claim of the appellant for the sum of $1,132.20 being the agreed damages suffered by the appellant`s taxi. The claim was against the first respondent as the owner and driver of motor pick-up GF 6797 E. The second respondent was sued as the registered owner of a trade plate bearing No 0857S which was attached to a motor crane bearing No GS 13278. The motor crane was owned by the third respondent and the appellant claimed that it was driven by one Abdullah bin Haji Bakar as the servant or agent of the second or third respondents.
Although the sum at stake is small, this appeal raises important questions as to the practice and evidential effect of documents which are agreed by parties in a litigation to be included in an agreed bundle, the court`s application of the principles of logic and commonsense to circumstances surrounding a collision which do not infrequently arise and the practice of a trial judge before whom a submission is made that the plaintiff not having made out a case, the defendant has no case to answer.
Only the appellant gave evidence at the trial. He was the owner of motor taxi SH 4490. He hired out the taxi to one Tan Ah Lek for a specific sum. The hire was not dependent on Tan Ah Lek`s earnings. The appellant alleged in evidence that Tan Ah Lek was not employed by him. At about 3.30pm on 21 June 1978 the taxi, whilst in the charge of Tan Ah Lek, was involved in a motor accident, The taxi was later repaired for $802.20. The appellant also said in evidence that since the commencement of the proceedings he had tried to locate Tan Ah Lek to give evidence but was unsuccessful. This is the entire effect of his evidence. He was not cross-examined by any of the three respondents. The appellant did not and indeed could not call any other oral evidence as he had not witnessed the collision.
At the commencement of the trial, an agreed bundle of documents and photographs was by agreement admitted into evidence and marked as exts `AB1-16`. The first three documents were certified true copies of the Police Reports of Tan Ah Lek, Abdullah bin Haji Bakar (the crane driver) and Tan Song Gou (the pickup driver). Tan Ah Lek said in his police report that at the time of the accident along Jurong Port Road his taxi was `hit from the rear by Datsun Pickup GF 6797 E`. The `rear portion` of the taxi was dented. No one was injured. The crane driver`s report disclosed that he was driving the crane along Jurong Port Road towards the Port Road circus. Before approaching the Jurong Interchange, there was a traffic jam. When traffic in front of him moved forward, there was a car space in front of him. The pickup driver driving motor pickup GF 6797 E overtook him and swerved into the empty space. At that moment the traffic in front came to a halt. He said `as a result` the crane knocked into the rear left corner of the pickup. The crane was not damaged.
The pickup driver`s version is this. He said he was following the taxi. When the traffic ahead of him stopped, he did likewise. Whilst waiting for the traffic in front of him to move on, he was knocked from behind by the crane. The impact forced his pickup forward and it knocked into and damaged the rear of the taxi.
One gets the clear picture from the reports that the pickup had collided into the rear of the taxi which was either stationary or was moving forward very slowly. Whether the pickup was stationary behind the taxi and was hit from behind by the crane or whether the pickup had swerved into the open space and path of the crane is clearly a matter between them. As far as the taxi is concerned, it is clear the pickup had collided into its rear.
The other documents in the agreed bundle principally related to the damage of the taxi and the pickup and the repairs of the taxi. As quantum was agreed, I need not dwell on them save to underscore the fact that the descriptions and photographs of the damage to the taxi and the pickup confirmed the picture of the pickup having collided into the rear of the taxi.
At the close of the appellant`s case, all three respondents submitted that there was no case for them to meet. They were put to an election by the learned magistrate (as to which I shall have to return to later) and they all submitted no case to answer and elected not to give any evidence if the decision on the submission went against them.
Counsel for the first respondent, Mr Simon Yuen, submitted that although the police reports were included in the agreed bundle and admitted into evidence, all that was agreed was the authenticity of the documents. The contents of the documents were not agreed and the police reports do not prove the facts. He asserted that the makers of the documents or the driver of the taxi had to be called to prove the facts. He relied on 
 Yap Choo Hoo 
 v Tahir bin Yasin & Anor 
 
 
[1970] 2 MLJ 138
 . If this submission is right, there would be no evidence to how the accident had occurred. Counsel for the second and third respondents associated himself with these arguments but at the trial he also complained that he had no chance to cross-examine Tan Ah Lek if the court could rely on Tan Ah Lek`s police report as evidence.
 In Yap Choo Hoo 
 v Tahir bin Yasin & Anor 
 
 
[1970] 2 MLJ 138
  it was held by Mr Sharma J that a documenEMPHASISn forming part of an Agreed Bundle has got to be proved, although it need not be formally and strictly proved. Even if one understands the qualification of this decision (as to which I am not sure), I must respectfully disagree with his reasoning which was delivered orally. I am afraid that the learned judge had mis-read the effect of Practice Note 1 of 1948 ([1948] MLJ xiv) which was issued by the Registrar of the Supreme Court of the then Malayan Union and which still has effect in Singapore today. The note is in the following terms: 
 
In civil suits in the Supreme Court where an advocate and solicitor is engaged on either side, it is his duty to assist the court by presenting documentary evidence in the most convenient possible manner. In most cases it is possible to agree the majority of documents which will be required in evidence. In every such case they should be so agreed and copies should then be typed and made up in a proper bundle bound and paged in order of date. In all cases where documents cannot be agreed copies must be available and can conveniently be bound and paged in another bundle. As regards agreed documents, the court need not be troubled to see the originals at all. As regards disputed documents, it will be necessary to prove or attempt to prove them; but the court should be given a copy for the judge`s use and a copy for the file and all counsel should for convenience be furnished with copies in the same format. The expenses of such copies of relevant documents can properly be allowed on taxation. If the steps outlined above are not taken, much time is wasted and great inconvenience ensues ...
 
 
 
He underlined the words: `In most cases it is possible to agree the majority of documents which will be required in evidence.` I am afraid his emphasis on this sentence and on the words `will be required in evidence` had led him astray. As a result, the learned judge failed to appreciate that the documents are admitted into evidence without formal proof. They do form part and parcel of the evidence. As the practice note clearly says: `As regards agreed documents, the court need not trouble to see the originals at all.` He was also revolted by the proposition that once a document forms part of the agreed bundle of documents it automatically proves itself without any formal production of the original or a copy thereof or without any witness tendering it or producing it in court. He vigorously stated: 
 
...it would be against all conceptions of justice as the result of it would be that one of the parties would be deprived of the right to cross-examine a witness who would otherwise be required to produce the document even though formally.
 
 
 
With respect again, no question of depriving anybody`s right to cross-examine arises. It is all left to agreement between the parties. A party wishing to cross-examine the maker of a document should not agree to its inclusion in the agreed bundle or should where convenience dictates at least extract a written undertaking from the other side that the maker would be produced at the trial for cross-examination. This is not to say that the party cannot cross-examine the maker of an agreed document if the maker chooses to give evidence nor that the party in agreeing to the inclusion of a document agrees with what the document purports to say or its evidential value. The party having agreed to the document is perfectly entitled to rebut or reduce the evidential or probative effect of the contents of the document by other evidence. What is clear is that the documents in the agreed bundle are admitted into evidence by consent without production of the maker or the originals and the contents do form part of the evidence before the court.
It is also not as though Sharma J was not aware of what the Federal Court had decided earlier on this matter in 
 Henry Trading Co Ltd v Harun 
 
 
[1966] 2 MLJ 281
 . It was there said by Wan Suleiman J at p 282: 
 
The other statement of law made by the learned trial judge on which I feel I should comment is that part of the judgment wherein he said that the contents of an agreed bundle of documents must be proved unless such contents are admitted by the other side. With respect, I say that where there is an agreed bundle of documents there is no need to prove these documents. This rule is too well established in law to be doubted.
 
 
 
The other two members of the Federal Court in concurring must be taken to have affirmed this statement and it was not right for Sharma J to cast any doubt on this. He ought to have followed the decision.
I accordingly hold that the police reports in the agreed bundle form part of the evidence adduced by the appellant at the trial and on the basis of those reports I find that the appellant`s taxi was at the material time either stationary or was moving slowly ahead when it was collided into at the rear portion by the pickup. Whether the pickup had cut into the crane driver`s path or was pushed forward by the crane when the pickup was stationary is a matter for the first respondent and the third respondent. In the absence of special circumstances and notwithstanding that the appellant had not relied on the doctrine of 
 res ipsa 
 loquitur 
, I say that the balance of probabilities was in favour of both the pickup driver and the crane driver having been negligent. In coming to this decision, I am also not treating the decisions of the English Court of Appeal in 
 Baker v 
 Market Harborough Industrial Co-operative Ltd 
[1953] 1 WLR 1472
 and in 
 France 
 v Parkinson 
[1954] 1 All ER 739 as laying down any rule of law but rather as illustrative of the application of the principles of logic and commonsense to the circumstances of this collision which do not infrequently arise. The police reports of both the pickup driver and the crane driver gave me the picture of how the collision had occurred and they were on the balance of probabilities both equally to blame.
The onus which in this case was a fine one had therefore shifted to the first and third respondents at the close of the appellant`s case. At that stage, they submitted that they had no case to answer. The learned magistrate put them on the usual election. He, in effect, said to them: `I`m not going to rule on your submission of no case to answer unless you indicate to me that if I should rule against you on your submission you will offer no evidence on your behalf.` Was the learned magistrate right? He was referred to 
 Pandey v Hotel Marco Polo Pte Ltd 
 
 [1978-1979] SLR 490 
 where TS Sinnathuray J said by an addenda to his oral judgment: 
 
On the subject of no case to answer, a summary of the practice of the Courts of England is to be found in the White Book at 35/7/2. The last time the practice was judicially considered is in the Court of Appeal decision 
 Storey v Storey
 [1963] P 63 CA:
 
 
 
`There are, however, two sets of circumstances under which a defendant may submit that he has no case to answer. In the one case there may be a submission that, accepting the plaintiff`s evidence at its face value, no case has been established in law, and in the other that the evidence led for the plaintiff is so unsatisfactory or unreliable that the court should find that the burden of proof has not been discharged.`
 
 
 
In my judgment, it would be a desirable practice in our courts to allow a submission of no case to answer at the end of the plaintiff`s case, without putting the defendant to his election, whether to call evidence or not, if his submission fails. It is trite to say that we have a young legal profession and a fused one. Most are small practitioners and engage in many fields of law. The time and effort put in litigation matters are diffused. Such a practice therefore will ensure not only that there is a thorough preparation of the case before trial, but also a careful presentation of it at the hearing. Altogether, the practice will bring about a saving of costs for the parties.
 
 
 
These pronouncements should have been binding on or at least highy persuasive to the learned magistrate. Yet he did not follow them and did put all three respondents to the election. Was the learned magistrate right? It would appear that the subordinate courts have often not followed these pronouncements of TS Sinnathuray J. I have to address myself on this question because if the learned magistrate was wrong, I would have ordered the learned magistrate to continue with the trial and allow the first respondent and the third respondent to adduce evidence in their favour. However, after careful consideration, I am reluctantly compelled to say that I cannot agree with the pronouncements of TS Sinnathuray J. Instead of our expeditious disposal of a trial and a saving of costs, I am afraid that the very opposite consequences will ensue if the practice should grow in our courts to allow a submission of no case to answer at the end of the plaintiff`s case, without putting the defendant to his election whether to call evidence or not, if his submission fails. A defendant who is not put to an election will not be under any disincentive. He will be encouraged to make a submission of no case to answer, go through the evidence and the law. The plaintiff answers. The defendant replies. Multiply this process in every civil case, the logical conclusion must be that trials are prolonged. I should think that this would be a most undesirable consequence. In my view if a judge is asked to rule at the end of the plaintiff`s case that the plaintiff has made out no case it is most desirable that he should put counsel for the defence to his election as to whether he wishes to call evidence for the defence and should refuse to give a ruling unless counsel elects to call no evidence.
I respectfully adopt what fell from the lips of Thomson CJ (as he then was) in 
 Simirah v Chua Hock Lee & Anor 
 
 [1963] MLJ 239 
, 241: 
 
... the question then arises what this court should do in view of the course taken at the trial by counsel tor the defendants when he submitted that there was no case to answer.
 
 
 
It is a great pity that when this submission was made the advice of Goddard, LJ (as he then was) in the case of 
 Purry
 
 v Aluminium Corp Ltd
 162 LTR 236 was disregarded. His Lordship there observed that in cases of negligence if a judge is asked to rule at the end of the plaintiff`s case that the plaintiff had made out no case it is most desirable that he should put counsel for the defence to his election as to whether he wishes to call evidence for the defence and should refuse to give a ruling unless counsel elects to call no evidence. That statement as to the practice which should be followed in such circumstances has been approved again and again (

 [1945] P 15;

 v Storey
 [1963] P 63).
 
 
 
In the present case it is unfortunate that counsel who made the submission of no case to answer neglected to refresh the judge`s memory on this point. It is equally unfortunate, and even more surprisings, that counsel for the plaintiff should also have failed in this regard. In the circumstances I think we have no option so far as the second defendant is concerned but to order a new trial. In my view, for which I have stated my reasons, the submission of no case to answer should have failed and the position would then have had to be considered in the light of the following passage from the judgment of Lord Greene MR in the case of 
 Yuill
 
 v
 
 Yuill
, supra (at p 18):
 
 
 
`The practice which has been laid down amounts to no more than a direction to the judge to put counsel who desires to make a submission of no case to his election, and to refuse to rule unless counsel elects to call no evidence. Where counsel has so elected he is, of course, bound: but if for any reason, be it through oversight or (as here) through a misapprehension as to the nature of counsel`s argument, the judge does not put counsel to his election, and no election in fact takes place, counsel is entitled to call his evidence just as if he had never made the submission.`
 
 
 
The appeal as against the first and third respondents is therefore allowed with costs. Judgment for $1,132.20 should be entered against them with costs both here and below.
As far as the second respondent is concerned, the company was the registered owner of the name plate. The second respondent wrongfully withheld information as to its relationship with the crane driver. It was accordingly joined as a second defendant. The appeal against the second respondent is dismissed, but I make no order as to costs here and below.

The defendant appeals with leave from a decision of the Court of Appeal in Singapore dismissing his appeal against the decision of FA Chua J who awarded the plaintiff $130,000 (the equivalent of Â£29,600 sterling) as damages for slander.
At all material times the plaintiff (an advocate by profession) was Prime Minister of Singapore and Secretary-General of the People`s Action Party, the party in government. The defendant is also an advocate and solicitor of wide experience and at all material times he was the Secretary-General of the Workers` Party, a political party which contested the Parliamentary General Election held in Singapore on 23 December 1976. Both plaintiff and defendant were candidates at that election.
In 1955 the plaintiff had formed the law partnership of `Lee & Lee` with his wife and his brother, Mr Lee Kim Yew, and he continued in that partnership until he became Prime Minister for the first time in 1959. He then ceased to be a partner, his name was removed from the firm`s notepaper and thereafter he had no association with its activities, though his wife and his brother continued in practice under the style of `Lee & Lee`. The defendant and his wife were members of a firm of lawyers practising under the name of `JB Jeyaretnam and Co`.
At a press conference held on nomination day (13 December 1976) the plaintiff criticized the defendant and other members of his party for the policies they were advocating, and in particular said of them `... none of those who proposed to give things away, either by their management of their own parties or even of their own personal fortunes, had shown they could accumulate anything.` The defendant said in evidence that these words insulted him and made him very angry.
At an election rally held on 18 December at which some 1,500 people were present, the defendant delivered a speech in the course of which he said: 
 
I`m not very good in the management of my own personal fortune but Mr Lee Kuan Yew has managed his personal fortunes very well. He is the Prime Minister of Singapore. His wife is the senior partner of Lee and Lee and his brother is the director of several companies, including Tat Lee Bank in Market Street; the bank which was given a permit with alacrity, a banking permit licence when other banks were having difficulty getting their licence. So Mr Lee Kuan Yew is very adept at managing his own personal fortunes but I am not. I am a fool for your sake. And I tell you this, my dear friends, that if I should become Prime Minister of Singapore, I`m not saying I will, Mr Lee Kuan Yew keeps talking as though he is going to remain for the next twenty years. I know it`s left to the people; the people decide who will form the government and then the people in Parliament decide who will be the Prime Minister. All I`m saying is, if I become Prime Minister there will be no firm of JB Jeyaretnam and Co in Singapore because I wouldn`t know how to manage my own personal fortunes.
 
 
 
In the General Election held on 23 December the People`s Action Party won all 69 seats and the number of electors voting for them was higher than at the preceding election held four years earlier.
On 8 January 1977 the plaintiff`s solicitors wrote to the defendant, complaining that the aforesaid words used by him on 18 December were understood to mean that the plaintiff was wanting in honesty and integrity as a Prime Minister. In the reply thereto it was denied that the defendant`s words had the defamatory meaning alleged, and the defendant indicated his willingness to acknowledge that he had intended to convey no such meaning.
An action for slander was instituted a few days later, the statement of claim alleging of the aforementioned words that `in their natural and ordinary meaning [they] meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff had procured preferential treatment for his brother and/or wife to his own and/or their personal financial advantage, had thereby abused and would continue to abuse the office of Prime Minister of Singapore, is wanting in honesty and integrity, and is unfit to hold the said office. The said words were calculated to disparage the plaintiff in his aforesaid office. In the premises, the plaintiff has been injured in his character, credit and reputation as Prime Minister.`
By his amended defence, the defendant denied that his words were capable of bearing such a meaning or any defamatory meaning. He further alleged that when he made his speech on 18 December the occasion was one of qualified privilege, he was then merely replying to an attack on his financial capacity and reputation made by the plaintiff at the press conference on 13 December. It was further pleaded that the defendant had been `... under a public, moral or social duty as a candidate in the 1976 Parliamentary Elections to communicate the said words to the electors who had an interest to receive the said communication,` but this alternative ground was never pursued and was later expressly disclaimed.
In the further alternative, the defendant pleaded that the words complained of were fair comment upon a matter of public interest, `namely, the comparative financial abilities of the plaintiff and [the defendant] ... .` By his reply the plaintiff put in issue the pleas of qualified privilege and fair comment, and alleged (with particulars) that the defendant had been actuated by express malice. Before trial the defendant administered interrogatories of such a nature that, in the submission of the plaintiff, they were calculated to exacerbate the injury caused to his feelings by the defendant`s defamatory words.
The action came on for trial in November 1978 before FA Chua J who had ample opportunity of judging the credibility of the defendant during the three days over which his evidence was spread. He denied that he had defamed the plaintiff. But he accepted that, if his words were indeed reasonably capable of being understood as alleging corruption or nepotism on the plaintiff`s part, such an allegation would be `outrageous` and `a wicked lie`, for before ever he made his election speech he knew that the plaintiff had nothing to do with the granting of banking licences. He claimed that he had intended no more than to answer the attack of financial incompetence launched against him by the plaintiff, and that he honestly thought he had done so without casting any aspersions on the plaintiff`s established reputation for honesty in his public life.
A reserved judgment was delivered on 9 January 1979. On the issue of defamation 
 vel non, 
 after a lengthy review of the evidence the learned judge observed: 
 
The defendant is saying that the plaintiff`s wife and brother are the means by which the plaintiff has managed his personal fortune. The suggestion that the Tat Lee Bank was given a banking licence with alacrity when other banks were having difficulties getting their licences is a very clear suggestion that the plaintiff`s brother`s bank was shown favour. The defendant was therefore suggesting that one of the ways in which the plaintiff manages his personal fortune well was by dispensing deliberate favours to his brother ... . The defendant is clearly saying that the plaintiff is adept in managing his own fortune because he used corrupt methods ... . There can be no doubt that the words bear the meaning that the plaintiff had procured the grant of favours to Lee & Lee and to his family. To put it in blunt terms, the words mean that the plaintiff had been guilty of nepotism and corruption, and this would mean that the plaintiff is unfit to be Prime Minister.
 
 
 
This conclusion as to the clear defamatory import of the defendant`s words was upheld in the Court of Appeal, whose unanimous judgment put the matter in the following way: 
 
[Counsel for the defendant] contends that ... the natural and ordinary meaning of the words relates to the accumulation of wealth, not by corrupt means at all but by legitimate and legal means which nevertheless the speaker deprecated ... and thus the words complained of are not capable of carrying a defamatory meaning ... Such an interpretation would, in our opinion, be an utterly unreasonable interpretation of the words.
 
 
 
Before this Board the defendant no longer appeals on this issue of defamation, but that is not to say that the emphatic rejection by both courts of the case so strenuously (and mistakenly) advanced on his behalf has no bearing on the outcome of this appeal and particularly in relation to the issue of damages which must later be considered.
In the Court of Appeal the defendant did not pursue his appeal from the dismissal by the trial judge of the plea of fair comment on the ground that `the imputations in the present case are undoubtedly imputations of fact`. The Board therefore turns to consider the only subsisting defence in relation to the issue of liability. It is well-established law that a person whose character or conduct has been attacked is entitled to answer back, and any defamatory statements made in doing so will not be actionable at the suit of his attacker 
 provided 
they are published 
 bona fide 
 and are fairly relevant to the attack made upon him, see 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (8th Ed), para 514, and the cases there cited. In 
 Turner v Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures Ltd 
 [1950] 1 All ER 449 at p 470, Lord Oaksey said: 
 
There is, it seems to me, an analogy between the criminal law of self-defence and a man`s right to defend himself against written or verbal attacks. In both cases he is entitled, if he can, to defend himself effectively, and he only loses the protection of the law if he goes beyond defence and proceeds to offence. That is to say, the circumstances in which he defends himself, either by acts or by words, negative the malice which the law draws from violent acts or defamatory words ... The law does not concern itself with niceties in such matters. If you are attacked by a prize fighter, you are not bound to adhere to the Queensberry rules in your defence.
 
 
 
Then can it properly be said that the defendant spoke at the election rally merely in proper self-defence to the criticisms levelled against him and his political colleagues by the plaintiff at the press conference which, on his own evidence, had angered him? In other words, can criticism on the ground of personal or political incompetence properly be answered by charges of corruption and nepotism? As to this, FA Chua J said: 
 
The charge of nepotism and corruption against the plaintiff was in no sense a defence by defendant against a charge of incompetence. The defendant made an unwarranted and unjustifiable attack on the plaintiff`s honesty and integrity.
 
 
 
And the Court of Appeal in its turn observed: 
 
An accusation of corruption and nepotism is clearly unrelated to a criticism of incompetence in financial affairs and can in no sense amount to a defence against such a criticism, however strong that may be. On the contrary, it amounts to a counter-attack which exceeds the bounds of legitimate defence.
 
 
 
With those concurrent findings of fact this Board is in respectful and complete agreement. In the result, it matters not whether one holds that, the defendant having decided 
 [agrave] l`outrance 
 to launch a grossly excessive attack on the plaintiff`s integrity, the occasion was never privileged at all, or whether one says that the occasion itself was potentially privileged, but that the privilege was destroyed by so grave an abuse by the defendant of his right to reply in terms reasonably proportionate to the attack made upon him. Whichever view one adopts, the conclusion must be that no plea of qualified privilege was available to the defendant.
It is sufficient to deal briefly with the argument advanced by defendant`s counsel that, in view of the defendant`s insistence (a) that he had never intended to defame the plaintiff, and (b) that he throughout honestly believed that his words could not be understood to defame, a plea of qualified privilege is still open to him, and this notwithstanding concurrent findings that the plaintiff had in fact been defamed. In such circumstances, so ran counsel`s submission, it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove that the defendant had been actuated by express malice, that no such proof had been forthcoming, and that the defendant ought therefore to have been exonerated.
For reasons which this Board was unable to follow, defendant`s counsel cited in support of his submission the speech of Lord Diplock in 
 Horrocks v Lowe 
 
[1975] AC 135
 at pp 149-151 and particularly the portion thereof at pp 149-151 beginning, `So the 
 motive 
 with which the defendant on a privileged occasion made a statement defamatory of the plaintiff becomes crucial` (emphasis added).` Notwithstanding what later appears in that passage, counsel reiterated that the honest belief (asserted by the defendant) that nothing he said in replying to the plaintiff`s criticisms could be regarded as defamatory of him served to preserve the privileged nature of the occasion.
Such a submission ignores the evidence in the case and the findings of both courts. For if one thing is perfectly clear in the frequently complex law of defamation it is that no defence of qualified privilege or fair comment is available to a defendant who has knowingly and falsely defamed another. Honesty is the indispensable basis of such defences, and the ratio decidendi of
 Horrocks v Lowe 
 was simply that the trial judge`s finding that the defendant honestly believed he was speaking the truth could not be reconciled with another finding that he was nevertheless actuated by express malice. But in the present case the defendant never asserted his belief that the plaintiff had indeed been corrupt. Indeed, he expressed his complete confidence in the plaintiff`s integrity. FA Chua J`s finding of fact on the matter was that: 
 
The defendant made the publication recklessly, being indifferent to the truth of what he published, and neither considering nor caring whether it was true or not, and he should be treated as if he knew it to be false. In speaking and publishing those words the defendant was actuated by express malice.
 
 
 
And later, when dealing with the matter of damages, the learned judge added: 
 
He has, in an attempt to avoid responsibility, pretended that the words do not bear the meaning put on them by the plaintiff when in truth he must know that his words bore this meaning, and he intended them to do so.
 
 
 
The Court of Appeal in its turn said: 
 
It was a grave slander perpetrated deliberately, and not only without regard to the truth but knowing that it was untrue. It was perpetrated for political gain, not caring what distress it would cause and what harm it would inflict on the personal and political reputation of an incumbent Prime Minister.
 
 
 
In the judgment of their Lordships` Board, there was ample evidence to support such concurrent findings of the defendant`s express malice in publishing the slander complained of.
Something must finally be said about the judge`s award of damages, which was again upheld by the Court of Appeal. Plaintiff`s counsel had said in opening the case that, while the damages ought to be large, punitive damages were not being asked for and only fair compensation was sought. For the defendant it was urged before their Lordships` Board that damages not exceeding one-third of the sum actually awarded would have been adequate compensation to the plaintiff, whose election chances had been wholly unaffected by anything the defendant said, as his triumph in the election itself demonstrated. And complaint was made that the trial judge wrongly adverted to the absence of an unqualified apology, the administration of interrogatories, and the like in support of the view he expressed that the defendant `sought to aggravate the injury at every turn`. But, in the judgment of the Board, it has not been demonstrated that he improperly took into consideration any irrelevant matters or failed to have regard to any mitigating factors.
The task of assessing damages is one to be approached broadly, and, `Quite obviously the award must include factors for injury to the feelings, the anxiety and uncertainty undergone in the litigation, the absence of apology ... or the malice of the defendant`: 
 Cassell & Co Ltd v 
 
 Broome 
[1972] AC 1027
 at p 1071 per Lord Hailsham LC at p 1071E. The learned judge described his award as `fair compensation for this very serious slander`, and the Court of Appeal considered that the defendant had published `a very grave slander which struck at the heart of the Prime Minister`s political reputation`. The appellant is thus again confronted by a concurrent finding of fact arrived at by both lower courts. In such circumstances the settled practice of the Board is not to interfere unless it has been demonstrated that there has been `some miscarriage of justice or violation of some principle of law or procedure`: 
 Srimati Bibhabati Devi v Kumar Ramendra Narayan Roy 
 
[1946] AC 508
, 521 per Lord Thankerton at p 521. And reluctance to interfere is particularly called for where concurrent findings are dependent upon local conditions with which local judges are inevitably more familiar than members of their Lordships` Board can ever hope to be. The assessment of damages in the present case is peculiarly dependent on local conditions and local tariffs, and neither in that respect nor in relation to the issue of liability has the appellant demonstrated that any error of law underlay the conclusions arrived at in the lower courts.
Their Lordships will therefore dismiss the appeal. The appellant must pay the respondent`s costs.

The appellant, Lim Meng Huat, was tried and convicted by the High Court on a charge of murder, of causing the death of one Ng Kim Leng. At the conclusion of the hearing before us, we dismissed the appeal against conviction. We now give our reasons.
On the night of 21 January 1978 a group of about seven or eight persons was seated drinking beer and stout at a table in front of Stall No 8 at Boon Lay Garden Food Centre in Jurong. The drinking had started at about 11pm. During the course of the night some persons left the group and others joined in; however, amongst those present almost throughout were the deceased, Lim Kim Seng, Seow Peng, Penang Seng and a girl named Alice. She, it would appear, was the centre of attraction in the group.
Late that night, at about 2am there was an ugly incident at the table. A police constable known to some of them as Mata Fong who was on radio patrol duty in that area went to the table. He invited Alice to go out with him later that night. Alice refused. Seow Peng intervened and tried to persuade her to change her mind. Alice got annoyed. After Mata Fong had left, she rebuked Seow Peng for asking her to go out with a police constable. There was an acrimonious exchange of words between the two of them. This irritated Penang Seng. He suddenly took an empty beer bottle, broke it on the table, and armed with it, he stood up and angrily told Alice to shut up. Those nearby immediately disarmed Penang Seng. Whilst order was being restored, the deceased was heard to say to Penang Seng that he should not have behaved towards Alice in the manner he had done. Soon everyone was pacified, and they were all drinking again. At about this time, the appellant, who was a friend of Alice, was seen seated at an adjacent table in front of Stall No 7.
About 45 minutes later, the appellant was seen leaving his table. He went through a corridor to the rear portion of the food centre. In a short time, he re-appeared. He rushed to the group. He went behind the deceased and stabbed him in the back near the kidney region. He was armed with an object, about a foot long, wrapped in paper. The appellant also stabbed Lim Kim Seng who was seated next to the deceased. Thereupon everyone got up from the table and ran away.
The deceased ran to his flat which was a few blocks away from the food centre. He knocked at the front door. His mother and brothers found him seated outside. He was in pain and bleeding from his back. He was carried into the flat. The ambulance was summoned. It was just past 4am.
The ambulance attendant arrived at the flat at about 4.10am. He saw the deceased bleeding profusely, trembling in pain, and having difficulty in breathing. In the ambulance the condition of the deceased worsened. He was gasping for breath. He was given oxygen. When he was taken to the Accident and Emergency Department of Alexandra General Hospital, he was almost unconscious. By now it was 4.30am.
The clinical finding of the medical officer who attended on the deceased is that when she saw the deceased he was in a state of shock. She, and a surgical medical officer, made efforts to resuscitate him. They were unsuccessful. The deceased was pronounced dead at 4.55am of 22 January.
On 23 January at about 9.15am Dr Wee Keng Poh, a forensic pathologist, performed an autopsy on the deceased. He found a single external injury of a fatal stab wound. It was situated in the right posterior chest wall of the deceased. It had penetrated through the right 11th posterior intercostal space, it had cut through the right diaphragm, through and through the right kidney, and finally it had cut into the right psoas major and crus muscles which are muscles in the back of the body. The depth of the wound was about 121/2 cm. Dr Wee said that the wound was caused by a knife that had a sharp single edge. He said that death was caused directly as a result of excessive bleeding from this stab wound. According to him death had occurred within two hours of the stabbing. In the opinion of Dr Wee the stab wound of the deceased was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to result in his death.
When the appellant gave evidence on his own behalf, he could not seriously challenge the facts given for the prosecution. He said that at the time of the tragic incident he was so drunk that he did not know what had happened. The trial judges rejected his defence that he did not cause the injury to the deceased. They found that the appellant was not drunk and that he knew exactly what he was doing when he stabbed the deceased. On the real issue, whether the appellant had committed the offence of murder, the trial judges found that the appellant had intentionally inflicted the stab wound on the deceased and that the stab wound was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of the deceased. They found the appellant guilty of murder under para (c) of s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 103).
At the hearing before us, we granted the appellant leave to file a supplemental petition of appeal. In it he challenged the finding of the trial judges that the stab wound was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of the deceased on the ground that: 
 
it appears to have been based on the evidence of Dr Chng Hong Chee, an expert witness called by the prosecution ... not in compliance with the mandatory provisions of s 187(3) of the Reprint of the Criminal Procedure Code ... .
 
 
 
And was therefore `improperly admitted, unlawful and gravely prejudicial` to the appellant. This was the only ground on which submission was made to us.
We therefore now have to consider how it came about that Dr Chng Hong Chee (Dr Chng) was called to give evidence, the issue taken on appeal on the admissibility of his evidence, and finally what weight, if any, the trial Judges attached to his evidence.
Dr Chng is the consultant surgeon at the Alexandra General Hospital, He was not a witness at the preliminary inquiry. Two days before the trial in the High Court, on 2 February 1980, the learned DPP gave notice to the Registrar of the Supreme Court and to the then counsel for the appellant of the intention to call Dr Chng. The notice was given under s 187(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code referred to above, which reads as follows: 
 
A person who has not given evidence at a preliminary inquiry shall not be called as a witness by the prosecution at any trial before the verdict is given, unless the accused person or his advocate and the Registrar have been previously served with a notice in writing of the intention to call such person stating the person`s name and address and the substance of the evidence intended to be given.
 
 
 
In substance the notice said that Dr Chng would confirm that Lim Kim Seng (the other person who had been stabbed by the appellant) was medically examined and treated by Dr Yeap Choong Lieng (Dr Yeap) on 22 January 1978 after a minor operation was performed on him and that a medical report on him was subsequently put up by Dr Yeap on 23 March 1978. So, at this point of time, Dr Chng was called as a witness because Dr Yeap was not available to give evidence at the trial as he was away in England on post-graduate studies. Dr Chng gave evidence on the first day of the trial, on 4 February 1980, in accordance with the aforesaid notice.
Then, at the commencement of the continued hearing on 7 February 1980, the learned DPP made an application to the court, and what he said is to be found at p 222 of the transcript of the trial: 
 
Deputy Public Prosecutor: My Lords, my learned friend had made an application to recall Dr Tay Woo Kheng. She is present in court, my Lord, this morning ... To further assist the court I have taken the liberty of informing Dr Chng Hong Chee to be present in court this morning and to recall him so that he may further assist the court by having before him the clinical findings of Dr Tay as well as having the opportunity of going through the autopsy report and to give his assessment of how serious is the injury on the deceased and whether or not it is possible for the deceased to survive the stab wound.... I have spoken to my learned friend that I have to assist the court in this respect.
 
 
 
We gather from the record of proceedings that the learned DPP took the course of action he did because the medical records of the deceased made by the medical officer, Dr Tay Woo Kheng (Dr Tay), who had attended on the deceased at the Accident and Emergency Department at 4.15am had been misplaced and could not be found.
When Dr Tay was recalled, she expanded on her earlier evidence that when she first saw the deceased he was in a state of severe shock. He was pale, gasping, and his extremities were cold. The volume of his pulse was low, and his blood pressure was unrecordable. She was unable to set up a drip because all the veins of the deceased were collapsed. Together with Dr Yeap (the surgical medical officer who was away in England during the trial) a cut was made at the left medial ankle of the deceased to locate a vein. About the time the drip was inserted, the deceased lapsed into unconsciousness. The efforts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful. He died within 25 minutes of his admission into the hospital.
Dr Chng then gave evidence. The submission for the appellant was that the following evidence of Dr Chng should not have been admitted in the trial. Based on the clinical findings of Dr Tay, Dr Chng was of the view that when the deceased was brought into the hospital, he had already collapsed and was in a state of haemorrhagic shock. In the condition the deceased was, he could not be operated. He had to be first resuscitated. Dr Chng was of the view that the deceased was brought to the hospital too late for him to be resuscitated. Dr Chng reiterated the finding made by Dr Wee in the autopsy report that the deceased had suffered a very serious injury, and that the injury was certainly sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause his death.
On these facts relating to the evidence of Dr Chng, firstly, it is clear that at the trial Dr Chng was not called as an ordinary witness to give evidence of facts. He came forward to assist the Court as an expert witness. On the first occasion he explained to the Court the medical records made by Dr Yeap. He elaborated on the injury found on Lim Kim Seng, the surgery that was performed on him and the medical treatment given to him. Dr Chng was called because Dr Yeap was not available to give evidence at the trial.
Secondly, it is also clear that at the commencement of the trial the learned DPP could not have anticipated that the expert evidence of Dr Chng would be required touching on the deceased. It was only when he was told that the medical records of the deceased could not be found that he decided to recall Dr Chng to assist the court in the matter. Dr Chng had to sit in Court and listen to the evidence of Dr Tay before he could give his expert views on the clinical findings made by Dr Tay of the deceased.
Thirdly, it is also clear that at the trial, the then counsel for the appellant was given notice of the application to recall Dr Chng and told of the purpose of it. No objection was raised on behalf of the appellant. It is to be inferred that counsel was satisfied that the recall would serve the interests of justice. The recall of a witness, however, is always in the discretion of the court: see s 138(4) of the Evidence Act (Cap 5) which provides: 
 
The court may in all cases permit a witness to be recalled either for further examination-in-chief or for further cross-examination, and if it does so, the parties have the right of further cross-examination and re-examination respectively.
 
 
 
Moreover, the admission of evidence of a witness who is recalled is also in the discretion of the court. We note that it was not submitted for the appellant that the trial judges had in any way erred as regards the exercise of their discretion in permitting the recall of Dr Chng or in the admission of his evidence in the trial.
The question that remains for consideration is whether the second round of the evidence of Dr Chng was in breach of s 187(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (the Code).
Counsel for the appellant relied on two lines of cases in support of his submission that non-compliance of s 187(3) of the Code is fatal in this case. The first line of cases related to the obtaining of the consent, say that of the Public Prosecutor, before a prosecution could be launched against a person. It is plain that the obtaining of the consent being the foundation for the prosecution, the failure to obtain it will render the proceedings a nullity: see 
 PP 
 
 v 
 
 Oie Hee Koi 
 
[1968] AC 829
; 
 
 
[1968] 1 MLJ 148
  and 
 Secretary of State for Defence v 
 
 Warn 
 
[1970] AC 394
. The other line of cases related to reports of certain persons, like a chemist`s report, or now a scientific officer`s report which under s 368 of the Code may not be used in evidence in a criminal trial unless a copy of it has been delivered to the accused not less than ten clear days before the commencement of the trial. Here the principles that apply on appeal are these. Where it is found on the record of appeal that without the report the prosecution cannot establish a
 prima facie 
 case, the failure to deliver the report on the accused not less than ten clear days before the trial will result in the conviction being quashed. On the other hand, the improper admission of the report can have no effect where independently of the evidence admitted, there was sufficient evidence to justify the conviction: see s 167 of the Evidence Act (Cap 5): see 
 Chong Peng 
 
 v 
 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1954] MLJ 39
  and 
 Wong Kok Keong 
 
 v 
 
 R 
 
 
 
[1955] MLJ 13
 . In our view, on the observations we have made, neither of the two lines of cases is relevant in the consideration of s 187(3) of the Code.
We accept the submission for the appellant that s 187(3) of the Code is a mandatory provision, It provides that a person who has not given evidence at a preliminary inquiry cannot be called as a witness by the prosecution in a trial unless the requirements in the provision are complied with. In the present case it cannot be said that Dr Chng was not properly before the Court. As the learned DPP has rightly submitted for the respondent, Dr Chng was already a witness in the trial. The complaint however was that Dr Chng was recalled and had testified on matters relating to the deceased of which notice had not been given under s 187(3) of the Code. The short answer to that is that there is nothing in s 187(3) of the Code that requires that in such a circumstance a fresh notice has to be given to the accused or his advocate to recall a witness who has already given evidence. As we have earlier said, to permit a witness to be recalled and the admission of his evidence are matters eminently for the trial judges.
Finally, we would observe that in the oral grounds of decision of the president of the trial court, the trial judges had relied not on the evidence of Dr Chng, but on the expert evidence of the forensic pathologist, Dr Wee Keng Poh, that the fatal stab wound inflicted by the appellant on the deceased was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause his death. So, on the assumption that the evidence given by Dr Chng on his recall should not have been admitted at the trial, we are satisfied that it has not occasioned a failure of justice. For all these reasons, we dismissed the appeal.

Introduction


	
	MATHEWS AJ: On 8 October 2015 Lance Murdoch and Jame Phan were indicted on two charges: first that on 12 October 2013 they murdered Kamran Yousaf; second, that on the same date they robbed Dianne Torro of a sum of cash while armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a pistol. Mr Murdoch pleaded not guilty to both charges. Mr Phan pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder, and guilty to the charge of armed robbery. A jury was duly empanelled, and a trial proceeded in relation to the charges to which each accused had pleaded not guilty. On 29 October the jury returned a verdict of guilty in relation to all charges.
	
	
	The sentencing proceedings in relation to the two offenders have been dealt with separately, with the consent of all concerned. This was appropriate as there was a major disparity between the objective culpability of each of them in relation to the major charge of murder. Accordingly, Mr Phan has already been sentenced for both offences, in addition to several other offences of armed robbery to which he had pleaded guilty.
	


Circumstances of the Offences


	
	The two offences for which Mr Murdoch is to be sentenced arise out of the same incident, which took place at the Villawood Fruit Market on the afternoon of Saturday 12 October 2013. The deceased, Mr Yousaf, was an employee at the store. At about 3.30 that afternoon two men arrived at the store, entering through the rear lane. They had surgical masks covering the lower part of their faces and were wearing hooded tops, with the hoods covering their heads, so that most of their faces were concealed. They were also wearing high visibility yellow vests, of the type that workmen often wear. One of them was wielding a hammer, and the other a small silver pistol. Two employees of the market were having lunch in the back lane, outside the rear entrance to the shop, when these two men approached them and demanded to be taken inside and to the till.
	
	
	The following account is a very brief encapsulation of a great deal of detailed evidence which was given at the trial by a number of witnesses, who were store employees, people who worked nearby, and members of the public who happened to be in or near the store at the time. As is often the case in relation to events which happen quickly and unexpectedly, there were a number of differences in the details of their descriptions. However there was general agreement as to the overall course of events after the two men came into the store. One thing we now know with absolute certainty is that the man with the hammer was Jame Phan; and the gunman, as the jury’s verdict confirms, was the offender Lance Murdoch.
	
	
	Having entered the store through the rear entrance, the two men demanded to be taken to the till. Once there, Mr Murdoch demanded that one of the employees give him the till. She refused to do so. Very shortly afterwards Mr Phan jumped into the other register area and reefed out one of the tills. He was running towards the rear of the store, holding both the till and the hammer, when Mr Yousaf grabbed him from behind. At one stage during the confrontation which followed, Mr Phan struck Mr Yousaf with the hammer, causing a laceration to the left side of his head. Unfortunately for Mr Yousaf, that was the least of the injuries he sustained during this episode. They were already in the rear lane outside the shop, and Mr Yousaf was holding Mr Phan from behind, with his arms around his waist, when Mr Murdoch, who had run on ahead, returned and fired a shot at him. At that time Mr Phan was leaning forwards and down, so that the upper part of Mr Yousaf’s body was exposed from the front. As the post mortem report later showed, the bullet entered his right, mid abdomen and caused extensive internal injuries. It was estimated to have been fired at very close range, namely from a distance of between 10 centimetres and a metre.
	
	
	In spite of the seriousness of this injury, Mr Yousaf remained upright for some little time after this, and maintained his grip on Mr Phan. He was assisted in this by a customer who had been in the store, and also by one of the other workers. Mr Yousaf was trying to get Mr Phan back inside the shop when Mr Murdoch, who had run down the lane away from the shop, returned and shot at him again. On this occasion the bullet entered Mr Yousaf’s lower back, passed through soft tissue, and lodged within the bone of the mid sacrum. These two wounds, which caused extensive internal bleeding, constituted the immediate cause of Mr Yousaf’s death.
	
	
	Mr Phan had been forced back inside the store, and the rear shutter door had been closed, when Mr Yousaf collapsed. All subsequent attempts to revive him were unsuccessful. By that time Mr Phan had been tied up and was lying on the ground. The police arrived shortly afterwards and Mr Phan was arrested and taken into custody. He declined to enter into an interview with the police.
	
	
	As to Mr Murdoch, after shooting Mr Yousaf the second time, he ran down the rear lane, but returned shortly afterwards and fired a third shot, which did not strike anyone. He then ran across Woodville Road and through some Housing Commission apartments and an adjacent car park, eventually arriving at a lane which ran through a wooded area. There he was seen by a bystander to drop both his yellow vest and his face mask. These were later found to contain Mr Murdoch’s DNA.
	
	
	Mr Murdoch was arrested by police at his home two days later, on 14 October 2013, and taken into custody. An interview took place shortly afterwards in which he admitted that he knew Mr Phan, and that the two of them had been together at a casino in the early hours of the morning of 12 October. However he denied any knowledge of the robbery or murder at the fruit market, saying that he was at home asleep throughout that day.
	
	
	The issues raised at the trial were quite different in relation to each of the two accused. The sole issue in relation to Mr Murdoch was that of identification. He maintained his denial that he had been in any way involved in the robbery or the murder, and his assertion that he had been asleep at home all day. However there was abundant evidence to support his identification as the man wielding the pistol, including the DNA evidence I have mentioned. Once the jury was satisfied of that matter to the requisite degree, there was no realistic issue as to his guilt of both charges, given the totality of the evidence as to his actions that afternoon.
	
	
	Identification, of course, was not an issue at all in relation to Mr Phan, who was apprehended at the scene. Hence his plea of guilty to the charge of armed robbery. His defence to the murder charge was, effectively, that the Crown could not prove that he knew that Mr Murdoch would fire the gun. Therefore he could not bear accessorial liability for the killing of Mr Yousaf. The Crown relied on constructive murder in his case, and it became clear from a series of jury questions that his conviction was based on the proposition that he foresaw the possibility of the gun being discharged, but not that someone would be killed or injured.
	
	
	As I said when sentencing Mr Phan, this was a highly significant matter on sentence, as it very substantially reduced his culpability for the murder of Mr Yousaf. It meant that the objective criminality in his case was of a very low order indeed for the offence of murder.
	


Objective Criminality of the Offender


	
	The situation in relation to Mr Murdoch was entirely different. He deliberately fired two shots at Mr Yousaf, the first from very close range, so the conclusion is inescapable that he must have intended at the very least to inflict very serious injury. His motive was to enable his co-offender to escape after he had been lawfully captured. There is nothing in the circumstances of the killing to reduce his culpability for the offence of murder. Certainly the offence itself was not premeditated, but the offender was carrying a loaded pistol which he was clearly prepared to use. I accept the Crown’s submission that in all the circumstances the criminality in his case is above the midline of objective seriousness for murder. Indeed Mr Brewer, who appeared for Mr Murdoch, did not seek to argue to the contrary.
	
	
	The murder of Mr Yousaf is, of course, by far the more serious offence of the two for which the offender is to be sentenced. However the robbery offence must also be dealt with. It was a premeditated offence, as these offences tend to be. Ultimately no money was taken. I would place this offence slightly below the midline of objective seriousness for aggravated armed robbery.
	
	
	I should say that in making these assessments I have taken into account the aggravating and mitigating factors referred to in ss 21A(2) and (3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 (“the Act”). I will be referring to them in more detail a little later. In the meantime, I turn to say something about the offender’s personal background.
	


The Offender’s Background


	
	Mr Murdoch is now 30 years old, having been born in Campbelltown on 31 January 1986. He is the older of two boys. It is apparent that he had an extremely difficult childhood, including being exposed to drug use within the home. His parents separated when he was very young. Afterwards he lived with his mother. When he was in primary school he reconnected with his father, but his father committed suicide by taking a heroin overdose soon afterwards. Mr Murdoch found school extremely difficult, as he was unable to read or write. He remains essentially illiterate to this day. He was frequently in trouble at school for fighting, truanting, drug use and smoking, and was expelled in Year 8. He started to use cannabis at the age of 12, and by the time he was 14 he was smoking cannabis on a daily basis.
	
	
	It was also at the age of 14 that the offender had the first of his many brushes with the law. Whilst still a minor, he came before the Children’s Court on at least seven occasions, according to my calculations, in relation to 25 different offences. In April 2003, when he was still only 17 years old, he committed a number of serious offences, including a kidnapping offence and armed robbery, for which he was ultimately sentenced by the Court of Criminal Appeal to imprisonment for 6 years and 8 months, with a non-parole period of 5 years. This was subsequently extended by one month following his conviction for two offences of attempt to escape from lawful custody. In the 16 years since his first incarceration at the age of 14 years, the offender has been in the community for a maximum of 5 years, and has a minimal employment history. On all accounts he has become institutionalised, a condition which is unfortunately unlikely to be ameliorated during the lengthy term of imprisonment that he will necessarily have to serve as a result of the present offences, together with several sentences yet to be imposed on him. These relate, first, to three armed robbery offences which took place at various locations in the western suburbs of Sydney within the week before these offences. Each was committed in company with Mr Phan, and each bore a startling resemblance to the Villawood Fruit Market robbery. Mr Phan pleaded guilty to each of these, and was sentenced at the same time as he was sentenced in relation to his participation in these offences. However, Mr Murdoch pleaded not guilty. Following a jury trial in the District Court, I am told that he was convicted in relation to all charges, and is yet to be sentenced. In addition, he faces sentence in the District Court for a firearms offence committed while he was in custody in relation to the current offences.
	
	
	Mr Murdoch has been involved in a number of motor bike accidents over the years. The most serious of these took place only nine weeks before these offences. As a result of that accident Mr Murdoch suffered severe head injuries, including multiple basal skull fractures and loss of vision in his right eye. He was admitted to hospital after the accident, but then discharged himself against medical advice. He reported a decline in his memory since this accident, as well as increased irritability and frequent headaches. He was examined by the forensic psychiatrist, Dr Richard Furst in January this year, and the doctor’s report, dated 22 February 2016, was tendered into evidence. Dr Furst considered that Mr Murdoch suffered from the following three mental disorders:
	



	
	Acquired brain disorder.
	
	
	Substance abuse disorder (opiates and amphetamines dependence).
	
	
	Personality disorder (antisocial traits).
	



	
	Mr Murdoch’s drug dependence has been a constant issue in his adult life. Indeed it is almost certain that he committed the robbery on this occasion in order to obtain money to feed his drug addiction. He has expressed a desire to remain drug free on his release. However he has tested positive to drugs on three occasions since his incarceration for these offences, albeit that the last occasion was over 12 months ago now. Dr Furst recommended treatment options whilst Mr Murdoch is in custody in order to deal with this issue.
	
	
	Dr Furst’s prognosis was anything but positive. In the last two paragraphs of his report, he said as follows:
	


The nature of his institutionalisation, personality structure, chronic substance dependence, childhood adversity and the serious nature of his index robbery/murder offences and multiple other and previous robbery offences are all negative prognostic factors, meaning Mr Murdoch poses an ongoing risk to the community upon his release from custody, especially if the (sic) relapses into using drugs.

However, the treatment options outlined above offer some hope that his risk of reoffending and pattern of institutionalisation can be ameliorated to some degree.

Aggravating and Mitigating Factors


	
	The following are the aggravating factors pursuant to s 21A(2) of the Act which are not inherent in the offences of murder or armed robbery:
	
	
	First, pursuant to paragraph (d), the offender has a record of previous convictions. I have already mentioned the numerous convictions recorded against Mr Murdoch over the years, involving a variety of offences, most of them being offences of dishonesty. This is clearly a very significant factor in the present circumstances.
	
	
	Next, pursuant to paragraph (ea), the robbery offence was committed in the presence of a child under 18. An 11-year old girl was in the shop near the checkouts when Mr Murdoch and Mr Phan approached with the pistol and the hammer. She gave evidence at the trial. This was obviously a traumatic event for the child in question, but I do not consider this aggravating factor to be as serious as the others.
	
	
	Further, pursuant to paragraph (e), the robbery offence was committed in company. This is clearly a significant matter. Indeed without it, there would have been no murder for the motive for the murder was to enable the co-offender to escape after he had been lawfully captured.
	
	
	Finally, pursuant to paragraph (n), the robbery offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity. This was clearly thought out in advance, with both offenders effectively disguising themselves in order to avoid detection.
	
	
	There are no mitigating factors pursuant to s 21A(3) in the present case. Mr Murdoch has clearly shown no remorse for his actions. Indeed, as already indicated, he has continued to deny that he was involved in these offences, in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
	
	
	I now turn to discuss the appropriate sentence in this case.
	


The Appropriate Sentence


	
	The offender comes to be sentenced for two major offences. By far the most serious, of course, is the murder of Mr Yousaf, which involved the deliberate taking of an innocent human life.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 20 years. Since the High Court judgment in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 25, it has been accepted that the standard non-parole period constitutes a guide post rather than a starting point, as had previously been considered.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for aggravated armed robbery is imprisonment for 25 years. There is no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	In determining the appropriate sentences it is necessary to take account of the purposes of sentence, as set out in s 3A of the Act. As relevant here, they are:
	



	
	to punish the offender;
	
	
	to deter the offender and others from committing similar offences;
	
	
	to protect the community from the offender;
	
	
	to promote the rehabilitation of the offender;
	
	
	to denounce the offender, and to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.
	



	
	In Mr Murdoch’s case, the evidence indicates that rehabilitation is not a likely outcome. However, given the seriousness of these offences, together with the other offences for which he still faces sentence, he will be at least into advanced middle age by the time he is released from custody, and it is entirely possible that by then he will be a somewhat different person.
	
	
	The two offences arise out of the same incident, which is a relevant matter on sentence. In the circumstances, I propose to impose an aggregate sentence in relation to both of them, pursuant to s 53A of the Act. This enables me to impose what I believe to be the appropriate overall sentence and non-parole period, taking into account the total criminality involved in both offences.
	
	
	Mr Brewer submitted that special circumstances exist which justify a departure between the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period. However the overall sentence which the offender will be serving is such that there will in any event be a lengthy parole period which will be more than adequate to deal with the issues described by Mr Brewer.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody in relation to these offences since 14 October 2013, and his sentence will commence on that date.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 53A (2) of the Act, I indicate that for the offence of murder alone, I would have imposed a prison sentence consisting of a non-parole period of 21 years with an additional term of 7 years, making a total term of 28 years. The reasons for setting a non-parole period which exceeds the standard non-parole period have already been given. They are, primarily, the objective seriousness of this offence, the absence of any significant mitigating factors, and the offender’s criminal history together with his negative prospects of rehabilitation. For the aggravated armed robbery, I would have imposed a head sentence of 8 years.
	
	
	I am obliged to warn Mr Murdoch, which I now do, of the existence of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, and the fact that that Act applies to the offence of which he has been convicted, and for which he is about to be sentenced. At some future point of time, an application may be made that, notwithstanding the completion of his sentence, he nevertheless ought to be detained in ongoing custody or else ought to be the subject of an extended supervision order, impacting on his liberty.
	
	
	Lance Murdoch, I sentence you to an aggregate term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 22 years and 6 months commencing on 14 October 2013 and expiring on 13 April 2036 with an additional term of 7 years and 6 months, commencing on 14 April 2036 and expiring on 13 October 2043, making a total sentence of 30 years. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole is 13 April 2036.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offence and sentence

The applicant was charged with an offence of wound with intent to murder contrary to s 27 of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 25 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.


	
	Ten days before his trial was due to commence, the applicant entered a plea of guilty to that charge. He was sentenced by Judge Hanley SC on 24 September 2015. His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years commencing 28 May 2013 and expiring 27 May 2021 with a balance of term of 4 years expiring 27 May 2025.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against that sentence pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. He relies upon a single ground of appeal:
	


That the sentencing judge erred in failing to quantify the discount to be afforded to the applicant for his assistance to the authorities

Factual background


	
	Mr Shannon Suttle (the victim) had been married to Ms Tara Hebb (the co-accused). The co-accused and the victim had two children together. Pursuant to an order of the Family Court, the victim had been granted access to the children every third Saturday, which was to take place at Oxley Park in Sydney. The access order therefore required the co-accused, who was then living at Tweed Heads, to take the children to Sydney every third Saturday.
	
	
	The applicant first met the co-accused in 2013 when they each lived in the same unit complex in Tweed Heads. The co-accused told the applicant that the victim had threatened to harm her and her children.
	
	
	In May 2013 the applicant told his father that he was travelling to Sydney and his father assisted him in booking a flight from Coolangatta on 16 May 2013. On this date, the co-accused sent a text message to him saying “So long as the boys’ dad is gone, I will be happy”. In his record of interview the applicant agreed that he understood from this text message that the co-accused wanted the victim dead. It was the Crown case that it was at this time that the applicant agreed to kill the victim for the co-accused.
	
	
	On 18 May 2013 the applicant arrived at his mother’s residence in Blacktown. He stayed there for a number of days. During the stay, he told his mother that he had met a girl named Tara in Tweed Heads. He told his mother that her ex-partner was causing her trouble and that she had to bring her children down to Sydney to see him.
	
	
	On 22 May 2013 the co-accused sent a text message to the applicant providing the name of the victim’s employer, his fiancée’s name and the name of both his fiancée’s parents. She sent a further message to the applicant asking if everything was right to go from his end. During his stay with his mother, the applicant told her that he thought that he may have to go away for a long time.
	
	
	On Saturday, 25 May 2013 the co-accused sent the applicant a text message providing the address of the father’s group that the victim was attending. The co-accused said that her sons would be with the victim. On this day the applicant arranged for his mother to take him to the Blacktown Railway Station at about 9.30am. At about 10.30am his mother received a phone call from him in which he was crying and asked to be picked up at the Doonside Railway Station. She refused because she had other plans.
	
	
	On that day the victim arrived at the drop-in centre at Oxley Park at around 10am. The co-accused delivered her children to the drop-in centre also at around 10am. She contacted a friend, Ms Middlebrook, and arranged to meet her at the drop-in centre while she was waiting for the victim’s visit to end. This occurred at about 11.30am. The co-accused requested Ms Middlebrook to pick up her friend “Matt” from St Marys Railway Station and drive him to the park where the access visit with the children was to continue.
	
	
	Ms Middlebrook picked up the applicant in her vehicle and drove him to the edge of the park. The applicant exited the car and departed. He went to a nearby grocery store and purchased a fruit knife with a 20 cm blade. He was wearing a dark hooded jumper, a beanie and dark pants. He was pictured on CCTV walking to and from the park.
	
	
	Shortly before 12pm, the co-accused returned to the drop-in centre and told the victim that she would take the children to the park for the second part of the access visit. She then drove the children to the park and parked near Ms Middlebrook’s vehicle.
	
	
	The victim was picked up by his fiancée and driven to the park. The victim could see that the co-accused was parked on the other side of the park and recognised Ms Middlebrook’s vehicle. The victim walked into the park and his son commenced to run towards him.
	
	
	At the same time, the applicant ran towards the victim and commenced punching him and then tackled him to the ground. He was armed with a knife and stabbed the victim at least six times using a punching motion. The punches were to the victim’s head, face, back and chest. The victim attempted to fight him off.
	
	
	The applicant got off the victim and fled along Muscio Street, where a witness observed him jump over a fence into a construction site. A subsequent search of the site by police located the knife that was used in the attack. Another witness observed the applicant to run further along Muscio Street before jumping a fence which led into a church on Marsden Road. A search of the grounds of the church located the dark coloured hooded jacket, the dark coloured tracksuit pants and a blue coloured beanie, which the applicant had been wearing. The applicant returned to his mother’s house in Blacktown.
	
	
	When an ambulance attended the victim he was observed to be bleeding from a number of wounds, including wounds to the back of the head, thigh and chest. He was taken to Westmead Hospital. He had a superficial laceration to his left forehead, a penetrating wound to his left pectoral region, a penetrating wound through the abdominal wall of the stomach, a 2 cm penetrating wound to the thigh and a 1 cm wound to the right buttock. A laparotomy was performed to ensure that no major organs had been perforated.
	
	
	The co-accused was spoken to by police that day. On the afternoon of 25 May 2013 she sent a text message to the applicant saying “Stuck at the cop shop, you need to smash your phone, they saw you I think”.
	
	
	On Sunday, 26 May 2013 the co-accused telephoned the applicant and the conversation was intercepted. During the call, the co-accused informed the applicant that he needed to destroy his SIM card and discussed what had happened to him after the stabbing. The co-accused informed the applicant that the incident was being reported in the media and that they had his description. The applicant told the co-accused that he needed to get away from where he was.
	
	
	At about 8am on Tuesday, 28 May 2013 the applicant was arrested at Gosford train station while attempting to return to his home address. He was conveyed to Gosford Police Station and interviewed. He was asked about what happened on Saturday. He replied “I stabbed someone”. When asked what the co-accused meant by the text message “So long as the boys’ dad is gone, I will be happy”, the applicant said “She wanted him dead”.
	
	
	The applicant stated that he had obtained a lift from an unknown person to the park in a small green coloured car and that he had purchased the knife before the stabbing from the shops nearby. A search of the applicant identified a small 2013 diary which included hand written notes. On one of the pages was the name of the victim, the victim’s parents’ address and a mobile phone number. The applicant said that it was written by the co-accused.
	
	
	On Wednesday, 29 May 2013 the co-accused was arrested at Tweed Heads Police Station and taken into custody at which time she said “I didn’t want him to go through with it”. Investigators asked why she still organised for her friend to convey the applicant to the park on the day if she did not want the incident to occur. She did not respond and refused to be further interviewed.
	
	
	In the course of his sentence judgment, his Honour had occasion to consider the assistance for which the applicant submitted he was entitled to a discount. His Honour dealt with the matter as follows:
	


“Assistance

On 28 May 2013, the offender was arrested and charged by police in respect to this matter. Whilst speaking to police in an ERISP, he stated “I stabbed someone” and “she (Hebb) wanted him dead” (answer 54 & answer 175). On 17 March 2015, the offender gave police a statement which set out the evidence he was prepared to provide in a court of law as a witness in the trial of Hebb. The Crown does not accept the offender has been fully frank in the statement and will not rely upon him as a witness of truth at the forthcoming trial of Hebb. Despite this, the offender’s early disclosures to the police and later undertaking to the police attract some limited discount on the sentence.

I make this assessment on the basis that I understand he will be called at the trial of Hebb and although he may be declared an “unfavourable witness”, his evidence implicating Hebb will provide assistance in her prosecution.

Generally however, in assessing his assistance, I accept the Crown submission that this is of limited value on the basis that in his record of interview, dated 28 May 2013, the offender initially attempted to explain the offence is a random attack. However, when confronted with his diary and the text messages from the co-accused, the offender gave a more complete account. Accordingly, the Crown does not accept his statement made to police on 17 March 2015 as credible. The Crown submits it is an attempt to minimise his and the co-offender’s conduct. There is some considerable force in the Crown submission.” (Sentence judgment 16.6 – 17.4)

The appeal


	
	The appeal turned largely on the meaning of s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act). That section relevantly provides:
	


“23(1) A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence.

(2)    In deciding whether to impose a lesser penalty for an offence and the nature and extent of the penalty it imposes, the court must consider the following matters:

(a)    (Repealed)

(b)   the significance and usefulness of the offender’s assistance to the authority or authorities concerned, taking into consideration any evaluation by the authority or authorities of the assistance rendered or undertaken to be rendered,

(c)    the truthfulness, completeness and reliability of any information or evidence provided by the offender,

(d)    the nature and extent of the offender’s assistance or promised assistance,

(e)    the timeliness of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(f)    any benefits that the offender has gained or may gain by reason of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(g)    whether the offender will suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(h)    any injury suffered by the offender or the offender’s family, or any danger or risk of injury to the offender or the offender’s family, resulting from the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(i)    whether the assistance or promised assistance concerns the offence for which the offender is being sentenced or an unrelated offence,

(j)    (Repealed)

(3)     A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.

(4)    A court that imposes a lesser penalty under this section on an offender because the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities must:

(a)    indicate to the offender, and make a record of the fact, that the lesser penalty is being imposed for either or both of those reasons, and

(b)    state the penalty that it would otherwise have imposed, and

(c)    where the lesser penalty is being imposed for both reasons - state the amount by which the penalty has been reduced for each reason.

(5)    Subsection (4) does not limit any requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

(6)    The failure of a court to comply with the requirements of subsection (4) with respect to any sentence does not invalidate the sentence.”


	
	Also relevant is s 101A of the Act which provides:
	


“101A Effect of failure to comply with Act

A failure to comply with a provision of this Act may be considered by an appeal court in any appeal against sentence even if this Act declares that the failure to comply does not invalidate the sentence.”


	
	The Crown’s written submissions accepted that the ground of appeal had been made out:
	


“Application

47   In this case Judge Hanley failed to comply with the requirements imposed by section 23(4) of the CSP Act. His Honour found that the applicant’s early disclosures to the police and his undertaking to give evidence in the trial of the co-accused, “attracts some limited discount on sentence” (ROS at 16). His Honour failed to indicate the discount for the applicant’s past and future assistance to authorities and to state the penalty that would otherwise have been imposed if no discount for assistance was given.

48   In light of the recent decision of this Court in Panetta it may be accepted that his Honour’s non-compliance with s 23(4) of the CSP Act constitutes appellable error and requires this Court to consider whether a more or less severe sentence is warranted in law.”


	
	Before making that concession, the Crown set out its analysis of cases on the issue of the interrelation between s 23(4), 23(6) and 101A of the Act. The Crown noted that there was a possible conflict between the decisions of this Court in R v Robinson [2014] NSWCCA 12 at [42] (Basten JA) and Avery v R [2015] NSWCCA 50 at [68] (Bellew J) on the one hand and Panetta v R [2016] NSWCCA 85 at [36] (Adams J) on the other. It is not necessary, for the purposes of deciding this application, for this Court to express any final opinion on that possible conflict of approach. This is because full argument was not received on the issue and the occurrence of error and the making out of the applicant’s ground of appeal has been expressly conceded by the Crown. The argument before this Court proceeded on the question of whether on re-sentence, a lesser sentence was warranted in law.
	
	
	Accordingly, in following this approach this Court should not be taken to have expressed any firm view on whether the approach in Panetta should be followed in preference to that suggested in Robinson and Avery.
	
	
	As was made clear in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601, once error of the necessary type has been identified, the sentencing discretion has to be re-exercised by this Court. There the plurality (French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ) said:
	


“42   Spigelman CJ's analysis in Baxter should be accepted. When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion. By way of example, s 44(1) of the Sentencing Act requires the court when sentencing an offender to imprisonment to first set the non-parole period and then set the balance of the term. Prior to 1 February 2003, a court was required to first set the term of the sentence and then specify the non-parole period. A court which sentences an offender to imprisonment after 1 February 2003 by first setting the term of the sentence commits legal error. Without more, the error does not affect the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.

43   After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law. The result of the Court of Criminal Appeal's independent exercise of discretion may be the conclusion that the same sentence or a greater sentence is the appropriate sentence. In neither case is the Court required to re-sentence. Nor is the Court required to re-sentence in a case in which it concludes that a lesser sentence is appropriate for one or more offences, but that a greater sentence is appropriate for another or other offences, with the result that the aggregate sentence that it considers warranted in law exceeds the aggregate sentence that is the subject of appeal. The occasions calling for the Court of Criminal Appeal to grant leave, allow an offender's appeal and substitute a more severe sentence are likely to be rare. Were the Court to grant leave in such a case, convention would require that it inform the appellant of its intended course so that he or she might abandon the appeal.”


	
	As I understand the opinion of the plurality, it does not require this Court on re-sentence to conduct a de novo sentence hearing with it being necessary for the Court to make its own specific findings of fact. This may be necessary where wrongful fact finding has been identified as one of the bases for the appeal being upheld. Where as here, no specific challenge has been made to the fact finding by his Honour, this Court in re-sentencing can accept as the basis for its re-exercise of the sentencing discretion, the facts which have been found by the sentencing judge. It, of course, remains necessary for this Court to apply to those facts “the factors that the Sentencing Act and any other Act or rule of law require or permit”.
	
	
	On the issue of the objective seriousness of the offence, the following findings by the sentencing judge are relevant to the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion. The offence carries the highest maximum penalty prescribed by the legislature short of life imprisonment. This is because s 27 of the Crimes Act requires an accused to actually have an intention to kill the victim. That maximum sentence is an important guide post when determining the seriousness of the offence. Another important consideration is the extent of the injuries suffered by the victim. These have already been summarised but involved six significant penetrating stab wounds requiring major surgery. It was only by chance that the injuries did not result in the death of the victim.
	
	
	The amount of violence involved was significant and took place over a substantial period of time. The violent assault and stabbing continued after the victim had been forced to the ground. It was an aggravating factor that a weapon was used and that the attack occurred in front of the victim’s children.
	
	
	His Honour rejected the explanation in the applicant’s ERISP that this was a spontaneous offence. His Honour referred to evidence which was consistent with there being a significant degree of prior planning. This included the trip to Sydney and the movement of motor vehicles at specific times. Absent other considerations, the objective seriousness of the offending was high.
	
	
	There was, however, another important consideration which impacted on the applicant’s moral culpability for the offending. The applicant had suffered significant brain injuries as a result of two motor vehicles accidents, which occurred on 2 July 2005 and 25 April 2008. In each accident the brain injury was described as “severe”. The assessment by Drs Allnutt and Ashkar placed the applicant’s intellectual skills as a result of these injuries within the lowest 10 percent of the population. The applicant’s capacity to engage in complex planning and abstract reasoning was assessed as “borderline” or “extremely low”.
	
	
	The applicant had in the past displayed aggressive behaviour which was found by the doctors to be due to a combination of brain injury and drug use. There was no issue that the applicant had a long history of drug abuse which pre-dated the offending behaviour and included the abuse of alcohol, cannabis, amphetamines, heroin and methylamphetamine. The applicant told both doctors that at the time of committing the offence he was in the middle of a drug binge and was highly intoxicated by ice. This part of the applicant’s history to the doctors was expressly rejected by his Honour on the basis of the observations of his mother at the time and his performance during the ERISP.
	
	
	His Honour’s conclusions on this issue are important and in the absence of any challenge to them, need to be taken into account by this Court in the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion. His Honour said:
	


“I am satisfied the offender’s significant cognitive functioning issues arising from two incidents of brain trauma that incurred in the two motor vehicle accidents and the fact his higher-level thinking skills (e.g. complex attention planning and organisation, abstract reasoning, self-monitoring) were “borderline” or “extremely low” made him an easy target and susceptible to being manipulated by the co-offender Hebb, into committing the offence. I accept he probably believed his actions were “morally” justified on the basis presented to him by Hebb, being that the victim was going to harm her children. To this extent, his moral culpability was reduced and to some extent his appropriateness as a vehicle for general deterrence is limited.” (Sentence judgment 12.4)


	
	Despite the presence of brain damage, his Honour was satisfied that the applicant was aware that he was committing a serious criminal offence. The matters which his Honour took into account in reaching that conclusion were:
	



	
	Putting into effect the plan by travelling to Sydney on the pretext of his visiting his mother.
	
	
	His comment to his mother that “he was going away for a long time”.
	
	
	The initial lies to police in his first interview, which unravelled when he was confronted with objective evidence to the contrary.
	
	
	The text messages between him and the co-accused before and after the stabbing demonstrated his awareness of the plan and the steps taken to avoid detection.
	
	
	His explanations to Dr Allnutt and Ashkar concerning the commission of the offence and his drug usage at the time did not withstand close scrutiny.
	
	
	His claim that he was under the influence of methylamphetamine and heroin at the relevant time was not borne out by other evidence.
	



	
	Specifically his Honour rejected the following propositions, which were put on behalf of the applicant:
	



	
	He was under the influence of crystal methylamphetamine at the time of the offence.
	
	
	He was in the process of an ongoing drug binge at the time of the offence.
	
	
	There was no agreement between the applicant and the co-accused until the exact time of the offence.
	
	
	That he was not taking his prescribed medication.
	



	
	His Honour disregarded the applicant’s criminal antecedents as an aggravating factor in that they were relatively minor. His Honour took into account the injury, emotional harm, loss and damage caused by the offence. Reference has already been made to the physical injuries. The victim also referred to significant emotional harm, anxiety and paranoia which he had suffered following the accident.
	
	
	By way of mitigation, the applicant had pleaded guilty although not at the earliest point in time. His Honour allowed a 10 percent reduction for that plea of guilty. That accords with my assessment of the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty entered 10 days before trial in circumstances where there was no issue that the applicant had stabbed the victim in the way asserted.
	
	
	Given the applicant’s success in his ground of appeal, the question of assistance requires closer examination. Merely because an offender is co-operative during an ERISP and makes admissions, does not of itself necessarily entitle him to a further reduction in sentence pursuant to s 23 of the Act. Under the section, whether to allow a reduction is discretionary. It is not automatic. Moreover, such co-operation and admissions relate more to the discount for a plea of guilty than what would be conventionally regarded as “assistance”.
	
	
	The assistance here is the evidence in the ERISP and the statement of 17 March 2015 which was relevant to the part played by the co-accused. Such evidence would be of value in the Crown case against the co-accused and would entitle the applicant to some discount. His Honour so found.
	
	
	In assessing the extent of the discount, however, other matters need to be kept in mind.
	



	
	Given the unreliability of much of what was said in the ERISP and in the subsequent statement, that evidence might not be given great weight by a jury.
	
	
	There were real issues with the truthfulness, completeness and reliability of what was contained in the ERISP and the subsequent statement.
	
	
	The content of the 17 March 2015 statement was replete with self-serving assertions which were designed to minimise the culpability of the applicant. This reduced the usefulness of any evidence by him which could be used against the co-accused.
	



	
	Of considerable importance was the evidence of the police officer in charge, Detective Kendle, which was that the 17 March 2015 statement was of minimal value and some assistance could be obtained by the Crown from the ERISP. He said that there was no evidence that such assistance as the applicant was prepared to give would give rise to him experiencing harsher custodial conditions, nor would it place him or his family at risk.
	
	
	Taking those matters into account, I am prepared to accept that the evidence of the applicant would be of assistance in the Crown case against the co-accused, but only to a relatively minor extent. The discount which I would allow for assistance would be a total of 5 percent. I would apportion that assistance as to nil for the past and 5 percent for the future.
	
	
	In relation to other mitigating matters, there was no issue that the applicant had shown some remorse and that there was some acceptance of responsibility by him. His rehabilitation prospects are not particularly good. This is because of his heavy drug use. Nevertheless, the record of his performance while in custody provides a basis for him achieving rehabilitation and not re-offending.
	
	
	There were difficulties in the applicant’s childhood and background in that his father abused alcohol and drugs. There was domestic violence to which he and his mother were subjected until the marriage broke up when he was aged 10. He was aged 26 at the time of the offence and is now aged 29.
	
	
	The two motor vehicle accidents have rendered him unemployable and he is currently living on the Lifetime Care and Support Scheme provided for under the Motor Accident Compensation Act 1999.
	
	
	Taking those matters to which I have referred into account, having regard to his Honour’s unchallenged factual findings, and having regard to my own assessment of the documents which were before his Honour, I am of the opinion that a lesser sentence is warranted in law than that which was imposed at first instance. In imposing that sentence, I find that special circumstances do exist for the reasons identified by his Honour. The sentence which I would impose is imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years and a balance of term of 3 years. My principal reason for imposing a lesser sentence is that I have given substantial weight to the causal effect of the applicant’s brain damage on the offending.
	
	
	Accordingly, the orders which I propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal against sentence is granted and the appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The sentence imposed in the District Court on 24 September 2015 is quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years commencing 28 May 2013 and expiring on 27 May 2019 with a balance of term of 3 years expiring 27 May 2022. The applicant will become eligible for parole on 28 May 2019.
	



	
	HARRISON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL for the reasons given by him. I consider that his Honour’s conclusions are particularly appropriate having regard to the appellant’s subjective circumstances to which his Honour has had regard.
	
	
	For example, included in the material provided to this Court were medical reports from a psychiatrist Dr Stephen Allnutt dated 4 September 2013 and from a psychologist Dr Peter Ashkar dated 10 November 2014. Dr Allnutt’s report includes the following analysis:
	


“Your client was brought up in an inconsistent, abusive and violent environment with frequent geographic moves. He demonstrated behavioural problems at school likely contributed to by a combination of the stress of his developmental environment and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. [He] was prescribed Dexamphetamines and he left school at a relatively early stage.

He was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered frontal lobe damage, which in my view would have aggravated a pre-existing propensity to impulsivity and behavioural difficulties. This was further compounded by another accident that occurred in 2008. As a consequence of his frontal lobe damage he would have experienced Executive Dysfunction characterised likely by poor problem solving and a tendency to concrete thinking.

He discontinued the use of substances in 2011, but in the wake of a death of a friend (in May 2013), he recommenced using methamphetamines. The information he provided supports the conclusion that the methamphetamines triggered the onset of a Drug Induced Psychosis characterised by auditory hallucinations. Soon after this, a girl informed him that her child was at risk from another man ...

In my view the combination of his executive dysfunction and auditory hallucinations resulted in the emergence of a belief that in fact this child was at risk, further compounded by the command nature of the voices, telling him to protect the child. At the time he held the belief with conviction and was prone to do so due to mental conditions. He describes that the material time of the offending believing that what he was doing was the right thing and describes feeling convinced of that course of action as the right thing.

Based on information provided to me, your client had suffered a ‘disease of the mind’ at the time of the alleged offence; that affected his capacity for reasoning; but not to the extent that he was unable to reason about the nature and quality of his actions.

He was affected by his capacity to reason about the moral wrongfulness of his actions with an adequate degree of sense and composure and on this basis has available to him a defence of mental illness.”


	
	Dr Ashkar summarised his conclusions in the following terms:
	


“23. Mr Hitchcock is a 27-year-old man with a history of learning difficulties and traumatic brain injury. He is accused of stabbing a man in a park in May 2013 and is facing attempted murder (and associated lesser) charges. He was seen for neuropsychological assessment to assist in determining his level of intellectual and cognitive functioning and fitness to be tried.

24. Mr Hitchcock’s history of intellectual and cognitive functioning is a complex one. He sustained a severe traumatic brain injury in a motor vehicle accident in July 2005 and an extremely severe traumatic brain injury in a pedestrian accident in April 2008. He had a history of Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder and learning difficulties at school and substance misuse throughout his adolescent and adult years. He was likely functioning towards the low end of the ‘low average’ range (ie, at or near the 10th percentile) with regard to his intellectual and cognitive functioning before his traumatic brain injuries in 2005 and 2008.

25. Neuropsychological assessment in December 2008 (approximately eight months after his second traumatic brain injury) suggested a reduction in Mr Hitchcock’s information processing speed (from pre-injury level) and difficulties with aspects his higher-level thinking involving planning and organisation, verbal abstract reasoning, mental flexibility, idea generation, and problem solving. His intellectual and memory skills were relatively intact. Behaviourally, he demonstrated a low frustration tolerance and was easily angered.

26. Findings from this assessment are broadly consistent with the results of the 2008 assessment. Mr Hitchcock’s verbal and nonverbal/visual intellectual skills are at the lower end of the normal range (‘borderline’). The same is true for his information processing speed (‘borderline’). His attention and concentration skills are a personal weakness (‘extremely low’), which is not surprising given his history of Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder and traumatic brain injury. His learning and memory skills are relatively intact (‘low average’ or better) but his memory lacks precision and is vulnerable to contamination (i.e., he confused old with new material). His higher-level thinking skills (e.g., complex attention, planning and organisation, abstract reasoning, self-monitoring) are largely commensurate with his level of intellectual functioning and are either ‘borderline’ or ‘extremely low’.

27. The observed reductions in Mr Hitchcock’s cognitive functioning (from estimated ‘low average’ to ‘borderline’ and ‘extremely low’ levels) are likely due to his history of substance misuse and traumatic brain injury. Mr Hitchcock has passed the point of maximum spontaneous neurological recovery (from his 2005 and 2008 traumatic brain injuries) and his cognitive functioning is unlikely to improve substantially over time.

28. Mr Hitchcock demonstrates sufficient cognitive resources to understand the nature of his charges and to assist in his defence under the Presser [1958] and Kesavarajah [1991] criteria, notwithstanding the limitations in his cognitive functioning. He is able to name his charges and he understands their nature. He has patchy memory of his behaviour at the time in question (predominantly due to his substance use and symptoms of psychosis) but he is able to piece together an account of his behaviour at that time. He understands the meaning of ‘innocent’, ‘guilty’, ‘truth’ and ‘lie’. He appreciates the consequences of pleading guilty and of pleading not guilty, and he is able to make a reasoned decision about his plea. He has a basic understanding of courtroom process and personnel. He has difficulty generating information of importance to his defence, but he is capable of doing so with the appropriate guidance and support from his solicitor.

29. The available documentation strongly suggests that Mr Hitchcock has been having difficulty controlling his anger (and his behaviour more generally) since his traumatic brain injury in 2008. Changes in personality, increases in anger, and reductions in behavioural and emotional control are common in people who have experienced extremely severe traumatic brain injuries and are typically associated with damage to the frontal lobes of the brain (an area of the brain that is particularly susceptible to damage in traumatic brain injury). Mr Hitchcock also has difficulty controlling his substance use (in large part) because of his traumatic brain injury. His traumatic brain injury may therefore be an important mitigating factor for consideration in his defence and/or at sentencing.”


	
	It is apparent that the somewhat curious, if not bizarre, events that constitute the offending that is the subject of this appeal cannot be divorced from the appellant’s significant mental and cognitive difficulties. The Chief Judge has properly emphasised the causal relationship between these conditions and the offending. The result is a subjective case in which the appellant’s moral culpability for what is clearly a serious offence is necessarily significantly reduced.
	
	
	The appellant should be resentenced in the way proposed by the Chief Judge.
	
	
	CAMPBELL J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

7 January 2005
                                                                                                      
 
Yong Pung How CJ (delivering the judgment of the court):
1
         
 This was an application by the Law Society of Singapore (“the Law Society”) under s 98(5) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the LPA”) to make absolute an order to show cause. We granted the application and ordered the respondent, Tay Soo Wan, to be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors. We now give our reasons.
The facts
2
         
 The respondent was called to the Bar in 1978 as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore. At all material times, he was the sole proprietor of the firm M/s S W Tay and Co.
3
         
 For the purposes of this judgment, we do not deem it necessary to go into the details of the respondent’s misconduct, except to state briefly that between December 2000 and June 2002, the respondent dishonestly misappropriated a total of $118,434.75 from moneys entrusted to him by various clients, and converted those moneys to his own use. The law eventually caught up with him, and three charges of criminal breach of trust, punishable under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed), were preferred against him. He pleaded guilty to one charge, whilst the other two charges were taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing.
4
         
 The district judge sentenced the respondent to a term of 21 months’ imprisonment on 28 January 2004. The respondent did not appeal. At the time of the proceedings before us, he was serving his sentence and chose not to appear before this court.
The show cause proceedings
5
         
 Where an advocate and solicitor has been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty, s 94A of the LPA directs the Law Society to proceed with an application for the respondent to show cause as to why he should not be dealt with under s 83(1) of the LPA. Section 83(1) of the LPA provides that an errant solicitor may be struck off the roll, suspended from practice or censured if the court is satisfied that due cause has been shown.
6
         
 In turn, s 83(2)(a) of the LPA states that due cause may be shown by proof that an advocate and solicitor “has been convicted of a criminal offence, implying a defect of character which makes him unfit for his profession”. As it is not open to either the respondent or the court to go behind the respondent’s conviction by virtue of s 83(6) of the LPA, the respondent’s failure to tender any submissions before us was immaterial.
7
         
 We were satisfied that due cause had been shown. The respondent was convicted of a criminal offence involving fraud and dishonesty, committed in the course of his professional duties as an advocate and solicitor. Our justice system had expressed its disapprobation of his conduct by sentencing him to 21 months in jail. In sum, the respondent’s dishonest conduct and subsequent conviction fell squarely within the ambit of s 83(2)(a) of the LPA, implying a defect of character which made him unfit for his profession: 
Law Society of Singapore v Loh Wai Mun Daniel
 
[2004] 2 SLR 261
, 
Law Society of Singapore v Caines Colin
 
[2004] SGHC 250
, and most recently, 
Law Society of Singapore v Yap Shao Sin Philip
 
[2004] SGHC 252
.
8
         
 Ergo, the only issue remaining before us was that of the appropriate order to be made under s 83(1) of the LPA.
The appropriate order to be made
9
         
 As the respondent failed to appear before us, we were not apprised of any factors that might have mitigated his conduct in misappropriating the moneys. In any case, it is well established that where the advocate and solicitor has been convicted of dishonest conduct, the weight to be attached to a plea in mitigation is virtually negligible. Striking off will be the consequence as a matter of course:

Law Society of Singapore v Ravindra Samuel
 
[1999] 1 SLR 696
 and 
Law Society of Singapore v Tham Yu Xian Rick
 
[1999] 4 SLR 168
.
10
       
 The paramount considerations before any court in deciding on the appropriate order to be made in such a case are the protection of the public and the preservation of the good name of the legal profession: 
Re Knight Glenn Jeyasingam
 
[1994] 3 SLR 531
. In this regard, we also considered that the respondent’s dishonest acts were committed in his capacity as an advocate and solicitor, which must have further undermined the trust of the public in the legal profession.
11
       
 On the facts before us, there was no question that the twin objectives enunciated in 
Re Knight Glenn Jeyasingam
 were best served by striking the respondent off the roll of advocates and solicitors. We further ordered that the respondent should bear the cost of these proceedings.
Order accordingly.",2005-01-07 00:00:00,SG High Court

Choo Han Teck J:
1          This was an action commenced by the plaintiff to enforce a settlement agreement that he alleged had been concluded between his solicitors and the defendant’s solicitors in respect of a previous suit filed as Magistrate’s Court Suit No 14645 of 2002. In that action (“the tort claim”), the plaintiff sued the defendant for damages in negligence arising from a road accident on 27 September 2000. On that day, the plaintiff’s motorcycle collided with the defendant’s car when the defendant’s car emerged from the driveway of a motor car showroom at 911 Bukit Timah Road. The plaintiff, then 28 years old, suffered serious injuries.
2          Eventually, the solicitors agreed on the question of liability, namely, that the defendant would agree to be liable for 90% of the blame and the plaintiff would accept contributory negligence of 10% on his part. There was no agreement on quantum at all. The plaintiff’s Writ expired in the meantime and the action became time-barred on 27 September 2003. The plaintiff then commenced this action (“the contract claim”) on 2 November 2003. It was in the contract claim that the plaintiff sought a summary judgment for damages to be assessed. His application was dismissed by the deputy registrar on 6 May 2004 and he appealed to the district judge, Ms Foo Tuat Yien, who dismissed his appeal on 8 October 2004. The plaintiff then appealed to this court against the District Court’s judgment (
[2004] SGDC 281
).
3          The events should now be set out in detail in chronological order before the law is considered. The accident on which the tort claim was based occurred on 27 September 2000. On 3 April 2002, the plaintiff’s solicitors wrote to the defendant’s solicitors notifying them that the plaintiff was holding the defendant liable for the accident, and on 4 June 2002, the plaintiff issued the Writ of Summons in the tort claim. The defendant’s solicitors wrote to the plaintiff’s solicitors on 11 June 2002 to say that they had just been briefed and requested the plaintiff “to hold [his] hands in the matter”. That is legal parlance, particularly in tortious actions, which is understood by lawyers to mean that no further steps in the proceedings are to be taken without notifying the other party. The plaintiff’s solicitors replied the following day to say that they had not served the Writ but in any event, the Writ was inadvertently commenced in the Magistrate’s Court instead of the District Court. The letter further stated that the plaintiff would withhold service of the fresh Writ pending the defendant’s reply to the plaintiff’s solicitor’s letter of 3 April 2002 asking if the defendant would admit liability. Negotiations continued and on 14 October 2002, the defendant’s solicitors replied. The relevant portions of the reply state:
We would therefore be grateful if you could persuade/advise your client to reconsider our proposal on liability and revert.
On quantum, please be informed that our clients would like to obtain a 2
nd
 opinion on the need for the further operations on your client’s left ankle. Kindly let us know if your client has any objection to be re-examined by a specialist appointed by us/our clients.
On your quantification for general damages, please let us know if quantum for pain and suffering can be agreed at $20,000. For the loss of earning capacity and future medical expenses, we will revert with our clients’ instructions on same after we have received our own specialist’s report on your client’s injury.
Please let us have your client[’s] instructions on liability and on our clients’ request for a re-examination.
4          The plaintiff’s solicitors replied on 22 October 2002 to say that the plaintiff did not accept the defendant’s proposals in respect of quantum, and added that “[i]n any event, our client would like to resolve the issue of liability first before considering any reduction in quantum”. The two crucial letters forming the alleged agreement were then exchanged after that. The defendant’s solicitors wrote on 19 November 2002 to say:
We refer to your letter dated 22 October 2002.
We have our clients’ instructions to settle your client’s claim at 90%. Please take your client[’s] instructions.
As regards paragraph 4 of your letter, our clients will bear the costs of the medical re-examination and would pay the usual $50 for your client’s time and transport expenses. Please confirm your client’s agreement before we proceed to make the necessary arrangements. We will give your client at least 7 [days’] notice of the appointment date.
The plaintiff’s response on 20 November 2002 stated:
We refer to the above matter and your letter dated 19 November 2002 on which we have taken our client’s instructions.
Our client is willing purely for the sake of settlement to accept your client’s offer on liability (ie 90%-10% in our client’s favour)
Further, our client is agreeable to the terms of the last paragraph of your letter. Please let us know the appointment date.
5          More letters were subsequently exchanged concerning the medical examination of the plaintiff and, eventually, a proposal by the defendant’s solicitors on the issue of quantum. Their letter of 21 March 2003 proposed as follows:
Subject to our clients’ instructions and for an amicable settlement, we would propose agreeing to quantum on 100% as follows:
a.         pain and suffering, loss of amenities   …     $20,000.00
b.         loss of earning capacity                    …     $12,000.00
c.         medical expenses (RM310)             …          $155.00
d.         medical expenses                            …       $8,420.88
e.         transport expenses                          …          $268.75
f.          repair costs (RM744)                     …          $372.00
g.         towing expenses                              …          $120.00
h.         damaged personal items                  …          $100.00
i.          costs and disbursements to be determined/agreed
As for the future medical expenses, we are prepared to advise our clients to follow Dr Ngian’s recommendation and to allow future medical expenses for a Pan Talar Fusion. We would however like to check with the NUH on the costs of a Pan Talar Fusion in that hospital before we revert with our clients’ offer on future medical expenses. We would therefore be grateful if you could arrange for your client to sign the enclosed Consent Form to enable us to obtain the aforesaid information.
6          Reminders were sent by the defendant’s solicitors on 28 April 2003 and 19 May 2003 for the plaintiff’s response. On 27 May 2003, the plaintiff’s solicitors wrote to reject the defendant’s offer and made a counter-offer. The defendant’s solicitors did not respond. In the meantime, the plaintiff’s Writ expired on 4 December 2002 and he had six months from that date to apply for the renewal of the Writ. This was not done, and the cause of action expired on 27 September 2003.
7          On 22 August 2003 and 16 October 2003, the plaintiff’s solicitors wrote to the defendant’s solicitors. The relevant paragraphs of the two letters stated:
We refer to our letter of 27 May 2003.
To date, we have not received any reply from you.
If your clients are not minded to accept our client’s proposal for settlement, we shall proceed with the matter, which will escalate costs.
…
We refer to the above matter and our letters to you dated 22 August 2003 and 27 May 2003 to which we have not received any reply.
As you are aware, liability was agreed 90%:10% in favour of our clients on 20 November 2002, leaving only quantum to be agreed or assessed.
8          On 21 November 2003 the plaintiff filed the contract claim based on the agreement concluded in November 2002 by the letters of 19 and 20 November 2002 of the defendant and the plaintiff respectively. The Statement of Claim in the contract claim pleaded as follows:
9.1        The Defendant admits 90% liability in respect of the said accident with the Plaintiff bearing the remainder 10% of liability.
9.2        The issue of quantum is to be disposed of by mutual agreement of the parties.
9.3        As part of the agreed process of assessing quantum, the Plaintiff, at the Defendant’s insurers’ request via the Defendant’s Solicitors’ letters dated 14 October 2002 and 19 November 2002, attended a medical re-examination on 16 December 2002 at the Defendant’s insurer[s’] own cost.
9.4        The issue of quantum is to be settled within a reasonable period of time from when the said agreement was formed in or about 20 November 2002.
9.5        Once quantum is agreed, the said agreed sum shall be paid to the Plaintiff or the Plaintiff’s Solicitors within a reasonable period from the date of agreement of quantum.
9          Mr Lim Chor Pee, counsel for the plaintiff, submitted that the defendant had “agreed to pay 90% of damages”. He argued that “an agreement to pay damages to be assessed is a good agreement even though damages are left to be assessed”. Miss Chong Pik Wah, counsel for the defendant, submitted that there was no agreement because the issue of quantum was not agreed. For his part, Mr Lim relied on the authority of 
Tomlin v Standard Telephones and Cables Ltd
 
[1969] 1 WLR 1378
 (“
Tomlin
”).
10        
Tomlin
 also concerned a tort claim in which the solicitors for the plaintiff and defendant respectively negotiated over the issues of liability and quantum. The court, at first instance, found that the series of letters exchanged between the lawyers resulted in a concluded agreement as to liability. Quantum was not agreed. In that case, the plaintiff commenced proceedings only after there was no agreement on quantum. His solicitors then sought to shorten legal proceedings by confining the case to quantum only. The defendants disputed that an agreement on liability had been reached. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s finding that the issue of liability had been settled by agreement. It referred to a letter written by the plaintiff’s solicitors as follows:
Whilst, as you appreciate, I take the opposite view to yourself on the question of liability, my client has instructed me to say that he will agree to settle his case on a 50/50 basis as you propose and accordingly this leaves only the question of quantum to be disposed of.
11        Dankwerts LJ, on appeal, noted that the above letter was, significantly, not refuted in subsequent letters. He found (at 1382) that the correspondence proceeded “on the basis that there was a concluded agreement on the basis of a 50/50 liability, and, as stated, it would appear there was only a question of quantum to be decided after that by way of further negotiation or, as it might appear, by recourse to the court”. Sir Gordon Willmer concurred with Dankwerts LJ but “not without some doubt and hesitation”. He drew upon his experience from admiralty practice and reminded parties that liability was almost universally dealt with separately from quantum, and concluded at 1386 that he could “see no reason why it should not be possible to carve out of [the] correspondence an agreement as to liability, leaving the question of quantum of damages open for further negotiation”. Omrod J dissented on the ground that the “agreement” was reached on a “without prejudice” basis. He was of the view that the negotiations were “an attempt to settle this case for a sum of money, and that the ‘without prejudice’ umbrella remains up and protects the parties negotiating up to the point when they agree on a figure” (at 1385).
12        
Tomlin
 was fully argued before the district judge. She drew on her own experience in the Primary Dispute Resolution Centre in the Subordinate Courts, and noted (at [10]) that:
Although parties may first agree on liability, both parties (especially an insurer) are understandably wary of finally committing themselves on liability without reaching agreement on quantum of damages payable at 100% as they do not know the ultimate amount of damages, which the plaintiff will receive and which the defendant will have to pay. Although there may be an in-principle agreement on liability before agreement on quantum or vice versa, parties know that they can be frank and open in their negotiations, because if they do not agree on quantum/liability, they can both retract from their agreed positions on either liability/quantum and contest both liability and quantum in the action. There are times, where after a writ is filed and served, parties, who are still unable to agree on quantum but are able to agree on liability, will, to save costs of trial, agree to enter interlocutory judgment on liability with damages to be assessed by the court.
13        The district judge distinguished Dankwerts LJ’s decision on the facts, noting that in the present case the plaintiff did not proceed with the original Writ and had issued a Writ in a fresh action based on the agreement. Secondly, the district judge relied on the dissenting judgment of Omrod J to support her opinion that since the negotiations between the parties were made under “without prejudice” letters, there was therefore “no settlement reached between the parties although they had agreed on liability”.
14        Both counsel submitted before me that this appeal ought to be dealt with on a point of law, as the essential facts were not in dispute. They agreed that it would make little sense to proceed to trial because the relevant evidence would be based on the undisputed facts presently before me. Having heard both counsel, I agree that this matter need not proceed to trial because the decision on law would be sufficient to end the dispute. Unfortunately, the point of law was not specifically set out, as it should be. However, on the facts as well as the arguments of both counsel, there appears to be two questions, both of which are quite clear, and for the convenience of the parties, I shall state them as follows:
(a)        Whether a cause of action in contract can arise from the “without prejudice” negotiations between solicitors on behalf of their clients; and
(b)        If so, whether such a cause of action exists on the facts.
15        The context in which an agreement is made is relevant in helping one understand what that agreement really was. In this case, we are examining the effect of the negotiations between solicitors in a personal accident claim. It is, of course, a claim in tort. I will accept that the court can take judicial notice of the practice, especially in this country, where solicitors often begin by engaging in a cautious exchange of proposals. The early stage of negotiations is important because it might there be established whether the parties had decided to negotiate on a global basis, that is to say, that they will carry on until both issues, namely liability and quantum, are agreed. Alternatively, they might have decided to complete the negotiations in two stages, that is to say, they might have wished to determine liability before proceeding to negotiating on quantum. In this case, the plaintiff’s solicitors’ letter of 22 October 2002 stated that they wished to “resolve the issue of liability first before considering any reduction in quantum”. The onus thus shifted to the defendant’s solicitors to correct that path if they so wished, but they did not. The district judge could not be faulted for forming the view that there was no settlement because the “parties intended to settle only if they resolved both liability and quantum”, because the letter from the plaintiff continued to make reference to quantum. However, upon closer scrutiny, I am of the opinion that liability had, in fact, been settled. This case, therefore, is similar to 
Tomlin
. The parties had decided to negotiate on liability before quantum. Like 
Tomlin,
 the parties did reach an agreement on liability.
16        When that stage has been reached, the parties can carry on and negotiate the issue of quantum. Alternatively, they can enter interlocutory judgment with damages to be assessed. At this point, if either party reneges on the agreement on liability, the court can hold, as was the case in 
Tomlin
, that that issue is closed. It can then allow judgment to be entered 
in that action
 and order damages to be assessed. If, for some reason, the parties do not proceed to the assessment of damages, the case ends with no result for the plaintiff, because the agreement on liability means nothing to him, other than that parties may proceed to have damages assessed 
in that action
. It does not confer on the plaintiff a deferred right to pursue his right to damages by switching from a tort claim to a contract claim. In the present case, the plaintiff’s claim in tort has been extinguished by the limitation of time. What he has is a bare agreement that the defendant is responsible for 90% of the accident in which the plaintiff was injured. Nothing more can be inferred or implied, unlike the circumstances in a tort action where it will be implied that once liability is firmly decided, the plaintiff has the right to ask for damages to be assessed. If he does nothing, and that right expires, as it did in this case, he cannot return to court by way of a contract claim, in the hope of completing the right in tort, which he has forsaken.
17        Mr Lim submitted that the contract was complete, and although the quantum of damages was not settled, the mechanism is there to be applied, and that mechanism is the assessment of damages by the court. In my view, this submission overlooks the fact that the plaintiff is now claiming in contract. And this is one case where, if price is not settled, no contract exists. It is not always correct to assume that an order for the assessment of damages is the only, or even an appropriate, mechanism for determining price in this situation. Since the present action is a contract claim, any inference as to what, if any, mechanism for settling price, must lean in favour of a consensual agreement as that mechanism. The court is not involved in such a situation. If price is not achieved, nothing is gained. No contract is made.
18        I should address the question of “without prejudice” negotiations in such cases since it was an issue that resulted in a dissent in 
Tomlin
, and the judge below had placed some importance to it. It is true, as the district judge observed, that the plaintiff’s solicitors’ letter of 16 October 2003 was marked “without prejudice”, but that letter was in reference to the issue of quantum. Their letter accepting the offer on liability, written on 20 November 2002, was an open letter. An open letter ends the “without prejudice” correspondence.
19        For the reasons above, this appeal is dismissed. Costs are to follow the event, and to be taxed if not agreed.",2005-01-31 00:00:00,SG High Court

on appeal from the court of appeal for british columbia

                    Criminal law — Sentencing — Sentencing procedure — Guilty
plea — Joint submission on sentence from Crown and defence counsel — Whether
trial judge erred in departing from joint submission — Proper legal test trial
judges should apply in deciding whether it is appropriate in a particular case
to depart from joint submission.

                    A‑C
attended a drop‑in centre which provided assistance to people suffering
from mental health and addiction problems. He had a long‑standing mental
health disorder and substance abuse issues. On February 9, 2013, A‑C
punched a regular volunteer at the drop‑in centre, G, who fell, hit his
head on the pavement, and died. A‑C was 28 years old and had a prior
criminal record. After his arrest, he was taken to a mental health facility. Following
his discharge, A‑C breached his bail conditions and was held in custody
thereafter until his sentencing hearing, a period of approximately 11 months.
After several days of trial, A‑C pleaded guilty to manslaughter for his
role in the death of G. The Crown and the defence made a joint submission on
sentence, proposing a further 18 months’ in custody with no period of
probation to follow. The trial judge applied a “fitness test” to the joint
submission and rejected it. He concluded that an appropriate sentence was two
years less a day, factoring in deductions for pre‑sentence custody, and
added a three year probation order. The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed A‑C’s sentence appeal on the basis
that the sentence imposed was fit in the circumstances.

                    Held: The appeal should be allowed and the sentence varied to bring it
into conformity with the joint submission.

                    Joint
submissions on sentence — that is, when Crown and defence counsel agree to
recommend a particular sentence to the trial judge, in exchange for the accused
entering a plea of guilty — are vitally important to the well‑being of
the criminal justice system, as well as the justice system at large. Generally,
such agreements are unexceptional and they are readily approved by trial judges
without any difficulty. Occasionally, however, a joint submission may appear to
be unduly lenient, or perhaps unduly harsh, and trial judges are not obliged to
go along with them (Criminal Code, s. 606(1.1) (b)(iii)). 

                    There
is a lack of consensus regarding the legal test trial judges should apply in
deciding whether it is appropriate in a particular case to depart from a joint
submission. There are four possible approaches: the
fitness test; the demonstrably unfit test; the public interest test; and, the
approach that treats the fitness and public interest tests as essentially the
same. The public interest test is the proper legal test that trial
judges should apply. Under the public interest test, a trial judge should not
depart from a joint submission on sentence unless the proposed sentence would bring
the administration of justice into disrepute or would otherwise be contrary to
the public interest. For joint submissions to be possible, the parties must
have a high degree of confidence that they will be accepted. The public interest test, by being more stringent than the other tests proposed, best reflects
the many benefits that joint submissions bring to the criminal justice system
and the corresponding need for a high degree of certainty in them. 

                    Crown
and defence counsel are well placed to arrive at a joint submission that
addresses the interests of both the public and the accused. Trial judges should
not reject a joint submission lightly. They should only do so where the
proposed sentence would be viewed by reasonable and informed persons as a
breakdown in the proper functioning of the justice system. A lower threshold
than this would cast the efficacy of resolution agreements into too great a
degree of uncertainty. 

                    Where
the joint submission is contentious and raises concerns with the trial judge,
the following procedures should be followed. First, the trial judge should
approach the joint submission on an “as‑is” basis. Second, the
public interest test should be applied when a trial judge is considering going
above or below the sentence proposed in the joint submission, although
different considerations may inform the public interest in each context. Third,
the trial judge may inquire about the circumstances leading to the joint
submission — and, in particular, any benefits obtained by the Crown or
concessions made by the accused. Fourth, the trial judge should notify counsel
of any concerns and invite further submissions on those concerns, including the
possibility of allowing the accused to withdraw his or her guilty plea. Fifth,
if the trial judge’s concerns are not alleviated, the judge may allow the
accused to withdraw his or her guilty plea. Finally, if the trial judge remains
unsatisfied by counsel’s submissions, he or she should provide clear and cogent
reasons for departing from the joint submission.

                    In
the present case, the trial judge applied the fitness test, a less stringent
test than he should have applied, and in doing so, he erred in principle. In
view of the trial judge’s error, deference is not owed. Applying the proper
legal test — the public interest test — the sentence proposed by the parties
did not, in the circumstances, warrant a departure from the joint submission. Indeed,
it was close to the range of sentence identified by the trial judge. Moreover,
A‑C gave up his right to a trial and any self‑defence argument he
may have had. In the end, the trial judge’s deviation from the recommended
custodial sentence — by only six months — amounts to little more than
tinkering. In addition, the probation order should not have been made. Counsel’s
view that the probation order was duplicative and therefore unnecessary to
protect the public was reasonable in the circumstances.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

                    Moldaver J. — 

[1]                             
Resolution discussions between Crown and defence
counsel are not only commonplace in the criminal justice system, they are
essential.  Properly conducted, they permit the system to function smoothly and
efficiently.

[2]                             
Joint submissions on sentence — that is, when
Crown and defence counsel agree to recommend a particular sentence to the
judge, in exchange for the accused entering a plea of guilty — are a subset of
resolution discussions.[1]  They are both an accepted and acceptable means of plea
resolution.  They occur every day in courtrooms across this country and they
are vital to the efficient operation of the criminal justice system.  As this
Court said in R. v. Nixon, 2011 SCC 34, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 566, not only do
joint submissions “help to resolve the vast majority of criminal cases in
Canada”, but “in doing so, [they] contribute to a fair and efficient criminal
justice system” (para. 47). 

[3]                             
But joint submissions on sentence are not
sacrosanct.  Trial judges may depart from them.  That is what happened here. 
The appellant, Mr. Anthony-Cook, entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter on
the basis of a joint submission as to sentence.  The trial judge rejected the
joint submission and imposed a longer custodial sentence than the sentence
proposed by Crown and defence counsel.  He also imposed a probation order for
three years, even though the joint submission did not contemplate a period of
probation.  

[4]                             
The narrow issue before us is whether the trial
judge erred in departing from the joint submission proposed by the parties. 
The broader issue concerns the legal test trial judges should apply in deciding
whether it is appropriate in a particular case to depart from a joint submission.

[5]                             
For the reasons that follow, I am respectfully
of the view that the trial judge in the present case applied a less stringent
test than he should have in choosing to depart from the joint submission — and
in doing so, he erred in principle.  The test he applied was a “fitness of
sentence” test.  The test he should have applied is whether the proposed
sentence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, or would
otherwise be contrary to the public interest. 

[6]                             
In view of the trial judge’s error, deference is
not owed and we can look at the matter afresh, using the correct test to
determine whether the joint submission on sentence should have been accepted. 
Applying that test, I am satisfied that the sentence proposed by the parties did
not, in the circumstances, warrant a departure from the joint submission. 
Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and vary the sentence to bring it into
conformity with the joint submission.

I.             
Facts

[7]                             
On June 16, 2014, the appellant entered a plea
of guilty to manslaughter for his role in the death of Michael Gregory.  The
facts underlying his plea are as simple as they are tragic.

[8]                             
The Kettle Friendship Society is a society in
Vancouver, British Columbia, that provides services to individuals with mental
health and addictions issues.  The appellant has a long history of such
problems and from time to time, he turned to the Society’s drop-in centre for
assistance.  So too did Mr. Gregory although, in his case, in addition to
receiving assistance, he acted as a volunteer.

[9]                             
On the morning of February 9, 2013, Mr. Gregory
attended the centre but left at around 10:30 a.m. because he was feeling ill. 
At about the same time, the appellant was in the centre’s computer room.  One
of the other attendees complained about him causing a disturbance.  Staff found
him swearing and punching at a board near a computer.  They told him to leave,
which he did.  On his way out, he shouted at the staff and appeared angry and
upset.

[10]                         
As the appellant walked away from the drop-in
centre, he saw Mr. Gregory crossing the street, heading away from him.  The
appellant called out to Mr. Gregory, shouting words to the effect that he would
“kick his head in”.

[11]                         
Mr. Gregory shouted back, telling the appellant
to “smarten up” or “dummy up”.  He then changed direction and after catching up
with the appellant, grabbed him by the shoulder and began pushing him.  The two
men pushed each other.  Mr. Gregory continued yelling, and the appellant threw
three or four punches, none of which connected.

[12]                         
Mr. Gregory then backed away from the appellant
with his hands raised.  The appellant moved forward and threw two more punches,
striking Mr. Gregory in and around the head and neck.  The first blow stunned
Mr. Gregory, and the second knocked him unconscious.  Mr. Gregory fell
backwards.  His skull fractured when it hit the pavement.  He never regained
consciousness, and was pronounced dead at the hospital.  All of the punches
occurred within a matter of 10 to 20 seconds.

[13]                         
After Mr. Gregory fell, the appellant fled.  He
was located and arrested by the police about five hours later.  He was released
without charge the following day but was detained at a mental health facility
pursuant to a Director’s warrant issued under the Mental Health Act,
R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 288.  He remained in detention at a mental health facility
for about two months, until April 4, 2013, when he was taken into police
custody and charged with manslaughter. 

[14]                         
Four days later, the appellant was released on
bail with conditions.  One condition required that he reside at a mental health
facility unless discharged by his physicians.  In early July 2013, after
spending three months in a facility, the appellant’s physicians discharged him
into the community.  However, on July 19, 2013, he was arrested for breaching
the curfew condition of his bail order and his bail was revoked.  He was held
in custody thereafter until his sentencing hearing in June 2014, a period of
approximately 11 months.

[15]                         
Initially, the appellant entered a plea of not
guilty to the charge of manslaughter.  He changed his plea to guilty after
several days of trial.  He did so following a resolution agreement with the
Crown, under which the appellant would serve a further 18 months in custody —
in addition to the period of about a year he had spent in pre-trial custody —
with no period of probation to follow.  In exchange, the appellant would plead
guilty to manslaughter, thereby giving up his right to a trial, and with it,
the possibility of raising the defence of self-defence.

[16]                         
The appellant was 28 years old at the time of
his plea.  He has a criminal record dating back to 2007.  It includes
convictions for breaking and entering, theft, mischief, and failing to comply
with probation orders.  His criminal record does not reflect a history of violence,
apart from one conviction involving a minor assault.  The appellant also has
long-standing mental health and drug use problems.  He suffers from a
refractory psychotic disorder (schizoaffective disorder).  While there is no
suggestion that drug use played a role in the present offence, it has been a
factor in some of his prior offences.

[17]                         
At the sentencing hearing, the trial judge put
the Crown and defence on notice that he had serious reservations about the
joint submission.  He asked for further submissions.  He also invited the
appellant to apply to withdraw his guilty plea, if he wished to do so.  The
appellant declined the trial judge’s invitation.

[18]                         
The trial judge expressed two concerns with the
joint submission.  First, he noted that counsel had mistakenly overestimated by
some six months the amount of credit to which the appellant was entitled for
time spent in pre-sentence custody.  Crown counsel acknowledged the error, but
stated that it did not alter his position on the joint submission and he
continued to seek a further custodial sentence of 18 months.

[19]                         
Second, the trial judge was concerned that
without a probation order, the sentence would not adequately protect the
public.  In particular, he considered it important that the appellant refrain from
using non-medically prescribed drugs.  Counsel informed the trial judge that a
probation order would not be appropriate for two reasons.  First, it would be
duplicative because the appellant remained certified under the Mental Health
Act, and he would be supervised by his treatment team while living in the
community.  If his psychosis worsened or he failed to take his medications, a
warrant could issue requiring that he be returned to the hospital, where he
would remain until his team felt he was suitable for release.  Second, counsel
maintained that a probation order would set the appellant up for failure
because, in the past, he had experienced difficulty complying with multiple
reporting obligations due to his mental illness.

II.          
Decisions Below

A.          
Supreme Court of British Columbia (Ehrcke J.),
2014 BCSC 1503

[20]                         
The trial judge rejected the joint submission. 
While giving it “very careful consideration”, he concluded that it did not
“give adequate weight to the principles of denunciation, deterrence, and protection
of the public” (para. 68 (CanLII)).  In its place, instead of sentencing the
appellant to a further term of 18 months in custody, as requested, he sentenced
him to a custodial term of two years less a day (after credit for pre-sentence
custody) — a six month differential.  In addition, he placed the appellant on
probation for three years.

[21]                         
In departing from the joint submission, the
trial judge considered the circumstances of the appellant and the offence, and
various sentencing authorities provided by counsel.  He determined that three
years would be a fit sentence (before credit for pre-sentence custody), and
that any sentence below that “would be an unfit sentence” (para. 43).  In view
of his conclusion that the appellant was entitled to less credit for time spent
in pre-sentence custody than counsel had recommended, he increased the proposed
custodial sentence by six months in order to achieve the effective three-year
sentence he considered “fit”.

[22]                         
The trial judge also rejected the joint
submission to the extent that it did not include an order for probation.  He
considered that such an order was necessary to protect the public because the
treatment team could not control the appellant’s use of street drugs. 
Accordingly, he imposed a three-year probation order, which included a term
prohibiting the appellant from possessing or consuming non-medically prescribed
drugs.

B.           
Court of Appeal for British Columbia (Neilson,
Bennett and Garson JJ.A.), 2015 BCCA 22, 367 B.C.A.C. 96

[23]                         
The Court of Appeal for British Columbia
unanimously dismissed the appellant’s sentence appeal.  Justice Garson, writing
for the court, concluded that the sentence imposed was “fit in the
circumstances” (para. 1).

[24]                         
The court accepted the Crown’s position that it
was unnecessary to decide the test for departing from a joint submission.  In
its view, the trial judge did not err in his assessment of the appropriate
range of sentence, and it was open to him to decline to give the appellant any
credit for time spent in a mental health facility.  Reading the trial judge’s
reasons as a whole, it was clear that he viewed the joint submission as neither
fit, nor in the public interest, having regard to the risk to the public the
appellant posed should he use illegal drugs and fail to comply with his
treatment regime.  In short, the court found no error in the trial judge’s
reasoning or in the sentence he imposed.  

III.       
Analysis

[25]                         
It is an accepted and entirely desirable
practice for Crown and defence counsel to agree to a joint submission on
sentence in exchange for a plea of guilty.  Agreements of this nature are
commonplace and vitally important to the well-being of our criminal justice
system, as well as our justice system at large.  Generally, such agreements are
unexceptional and they are readily approved by trial judges without any
difficulty.  Occasionally, however, a joint submission may appear to be unduly
lenient, or perhaps unduly harsh, and trial judges are not obliged to go along
with them (Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 606(1.1) (b)(iii)). 
In such cases, trial judges need a test against which to measure the
acceptability of the joint submission.  The question is: What test?  

[26]                         
Not unexpectedly, the answer is contentious. 
Provincial appellate courts across the country do not agree on a uniform test,
nor do the parties or the various interveners who appeared before us.  Minor
variations aside, four possible tests or approaches emerge from the submissions
we received.  

[27]                         
The first of these is the “fitness” test.  Under
this test, trial judges should give joint submissions serious consideration,
but may depart from them if, having regard to the circumstances of the case and
the applicable sentencing principles, they conclude that the proposed sentence
is not “fit”.  Some provincial appellate courts use this test, most commonly in
the western provinces (see, for example, R. v. G.W.C., 2000 ABCA
333, 277 A.R. 20, at paras. 17-18; R. v. Bezdan, 2001 BCCA 215, 154
B.C.A.C. 122, at para. 15; R. v. MacIvor, 2003 NSCA 60, 215 N.S.R. (2d)
344, at para. 31).  Crown counsel for the respondent urged us to adopt this
test, arguing that it best reflects the trial judge’s duty to come to an
independent decision regarding the appropriate sentence.  

[28]                         
The second test is also a “fitness” test,
although of a different kind.  It resembles the standard of review that
appellate courts apply on sentencing appeals in circumstances where the
sentence imposed by the trial judge is entitled to deference.  Under this test,
trial judges should not depart from a joint submission unless they conclude
that the sentence proposed is “demonstrably unfit” (R. v. Lacasse, 2015
SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at para. 11).  This is clearly a more stringent
test than the simple “fitness” test.  However, the parties did not point us to
any appellate decisions that have adopted it, and I am aware of none.

[29]                         
The third test, commonly referred to as the
“public interest” test, was developed in the Report of the Attorney General’s
Advisory Committee on Charge Screening, Disclosure, and Resolution Discussions
(1993) (the “Martin Committee Report”).[2]  Under this test, trial judges “should not depart from a joint
submission unless the proposed sentence would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute, or is otherwise not in the public interest” (p. 327
(emphasis deleted)).  This test has also been adopted by a number of provincial
appellate courts (see, for example, R. v. Dorsey, (1999), 123 O.A.C.
342, at para. 11; R. v. Druken, 2006 NLCA 67, 261 Nfld. & P.E.I.R.
271, at para. 29; R. v. Nome, 2002 BCCA 468, 172 B.C.A.C. 183, at paras.
13-14).  The appellant supports this test, largely because it provides “a high
threshold and is intended to foster confidence in an accused, who has given up
his right to a trial, that the joint submission he obtained in return for a
plea of guilty will be respected by the sentencing judge” (R. v. Cerasuolo
(2001), 151 C.C.C. (3d) 445 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 8). 

[30]                         
And, finally,
some courts, most notably in Quebec, treat the fitness and public interest
tests as essentially the same, and use the language of the two tests
interchangeably (though in Quebec “reasonableness” is used in place of
“fitness”: see, for example, R. v. Douglas (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 37,
at para. 51; R. v.
Dion, 2015 QCCA 1826, at para. 14 (CanLII); R. v. Dumont, 2013 QCCA
576, at para. 12 (CanLII); R. v. Mailhot, 2013 QCCA 870, at para. 7 (CanLII).  Perhaps the best example of
this is found in Douglas, an oft-referred to decision of the Quebec Court
of Appeal in which Fish J.A. (as he then was), said: 

In my view, a reasonable joint
submission cannot be said to “bring the administration of justice into
disrepute”.  An unreasonable joint submission, on the other hand, is
surely “contrary to the public interest”.  Accordingly, though it is
purposively framed in striking and evocative terms, I do not believe that the
[public interest test] departs substantially from the test of reasonableness
articulated by other courts, including our own.  Their shared conceptual
foundation is that the interests of justice are well served by the acceptance
of a joint submission on sentence accompanied by a negotiated plea of guilty ―
provided, of course, that the sentence jointly proposed falls within the
acceptable range and the plea is warranted by the facts admitted.  [Endnote
omitted; para. 51.]

[31]                         
Having
considered the various options, I believe that the public interest test, as
amplified in these reasons, is the proper test.  It is more stringent than the
other tests proposed and it best reflects the many benefits that joint
submissions bring to the criminal justice system and the corresponding need for
a high degree of certainty in them.  Moreover, it is distinct from the
“fitness” tests used by trial judges and appellate courts in conventional
sentencing hearings and, in that sense, helps to keep trial judges focused on
the unique considerations that apply when assessing the acceptability of a
joint submission.  To the extent Douglas holds otherwise, I am
respectfully of the view that it is wrongly decided and should not be followed.

A.          
The Proper Test

[32]                         
Under the public interest test, a trial judge
should not depart from a joint submission on sentence unless the proposed
sentence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute or is
otherwise contrary to the public interest.  But, what does this threshold
mean?  Two decisions from the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal are
helpful in this regard.

[33]                         
In Druken, at para. 29, the court held
that a joint submission will bring the administration of justice into disrepute
or be contrary to the public interest if, despite the public interest
considerations that support imposing it, it is so “markedly out of line with
the expectations of reasonable persons aware of the circumstances of the case
that they would view it as a break down in the proper functioning of the
criminal justice system”.  And, as stated by the same court in R. v. B.O.2,
2010 NLCA 19 (CanLII), at para. 56, when assessing a joint submission, trial
judges should “avoid rendering a decision that causes an informed and
reasonable public to lose confidence in the institution of the courts”. 

[34]                         
In my view, these powerful statements capture
the essence of the public interest test developed by the Martin Committee. 
They emphasize that a joint submission should not be rejected lightly, a
conclusion with which I agree.  Rejection denotes a submission so unhinged from
the circumstances of the offence and the offender that its acceptance would
lead reasonable and informed persons, aware of all the relevant circumstances,
including the importance of promoting certainty in resolution discussions, to
believe that the proper functioning of the justice system had broken down. 
This is an undeniably high threshold — and for good reason, as I shall explain.

B.           
Why a Stringent
Test Is Required 

[35]                         
Guilty pleas in exchange for joint submissions
on sentence are a “proper and necessary part of the administration of criminal
justice” (Martin Committee Report, at p. 290).  When plea resolutions are
“properly conducted [they] benefit not only the accused, but also victims,
witnesses, counsel, and the administration of justice generally” (Martin
Committee Report, at p. 281 (emphasis deleted)).

[36]                         
Accused persons benefit by pleading guilty in
exchange for a joint submission on sentence (see D. Layton and M. Proulx, Ethics
and Criminal Law (2nd ed. 2015), at p. 436).  The most obvious benefit is
that the Crown agrees to recommend a sentence that the accused is prepared to
accept.  This recommendation is likely to be more lenient than the accused
might expect after a trial and/or contested sentencing hearing.  Accused
persons who plead guilty promptly are able to minimize the stress and legal
costs associated with trials.  Moreover, for those who are truly remorseful, a
guilty plea offers an opportunity to begin making amends.  For many accused,
maximizing certainty as to the outcome is crucial — and a joint submission,
though not inviolable, offers considerable comfort in this regard.

[37]                         
The Martin Committee recognized this.  As it
noted at p. 328, the most important factor in the “ability to conclude
resolution agreements, thereby deriving the benefits that such agreements
bring, is that of certainty”.  Generally speaking, accused persons will not
give up their right to a trial on the merits, and all the procedural safeguards
it entails, unless they have “some assurance that [trial judges] will in most
instances honour agreements entered into by the Crown” (Cerasuolo, at
para. 9).

[38]                         
The Crown also relies on the certainty of joint
submissions.  Agreements that are certain are attractive to the Crown “because
there is less risk that what Crown counsel concludes is an appropriate
resolution of the case in the public interest will be undercut” (Martin
Committee Report, at p. 328).

[39]                         
From the Crown’s perspective, the certain or
near certain acceptance of joint submissions on sentence offers several
potential benefits.  First, the guarantee of a conviction that comes with a
guilty plea makes resolution desirable (Martin Committee Report, at pp.
285-86).  The Crown’s case may suffer from flaws, such as an unwilling witness,
a witness of dubious worth, or evidence that is potentially inadmissible —
problems that can lead to an acquittal.  By agreeing to a joint submission in
exchange for a guilty plea, the Crown avoids this risk.  Second, the accused
may have information or testimony to offer the Crown that can prove invaluable
to other investigations or prosecutions.  But this information may not be
forthcoming absent an agreement as to a joint submission.  Third, the Crown may
consider it best to resolve a particular case for the benefit of victims or
witnesses.  When an accused pleads guilty in exchange for a joint submission on
sentence, victims and witnesses are spared the “the emotional cost of a trial”
(R. v. Edgar, 2010 ONCA 529, 101 O.R. (3d) 161, at para. 111). 
Moreover, victims may obtain some comfort from a guilty plea, given that it
“indicates an accused’s acknowledgement of responsibility and may amount to an
expression of remorse” (Edgar, at para. 111).

[40]                         
In addition to the many benefits that joint
submissions offer to participants in the criminal justice system, they play a
vital role in contributing to the administration of justice at large.  The
prospect of a joint submission that carries with it a high degree of certainty
encourages accused persons to enter a plea of guilty.  And guilty pleas save
the justice system precious time, resources, and expenses, which can be
channeled into other matters.  This is no small benefit.  To the extent that
they avoid trials, joint submissions on sentence permit our justice system to
function more efficiently.  Indeed, I would argue that they permit it to function. 
Without them, our justice system would be brought to its knees, and eventually
collapse under its own weight. 

[41]                         
But as I have said, for joint submissions to be
possible, the parties must have a high degree of confidence that they will be
accepted.  Too much doubt and the parties may choose instead to accept the
risks of a trial or a contested sentencing hearing.  The accused in particular
will be reluctant to forgo a trial with its attendant safeguards, including the
crucial ability to test the strength of the Crown’s case, if joint submissions
come to be seen as an insufficiently certain alternative.  

[42]                         
Hence, the importance of trial judges exhibiting
restraint, rejecting joint submissions only where the proposed sentence would
be viewed by reasonable and informed persons as a breakdown in the proper
functioning of the justice system.  A lower threshold than this would cast the
efficacy of resolution agreements into too great a degree of uncertainty.  The
public interest test ensures that these resolution agreements are afforded a
high degree of certainty.

[43]                         
At the same time, this test also recognizes that
certainty of outcome is not “the ultimate goal of the sentencing process. 
Certainty must yield where the harm caused by accepting the joint submission is
beyond the value gained by promoting certainty of result” (R. v. DeSousa,
2012 ONCA 254, 109 O.R. (3d) 792, per Doherty J.A., at para. 22). 

[44]                         
Finally, I note that a high threshold for
departing from joint submissions is not only necessary to obtain all the
benefits of joint submissions, it is appropriate.  Crown and defence counsel
are well placed to arrive at a joint submission that reflects the interests of
both the public and the accused (Martin Committee Report, at p. 287).  As a
rule, they will be highly knowledgeable about the circumstances of the offender
and the offence and the strengths and weaknesses of their respective
positions.  The Crown is charged with representing the community’s interest in
seeing that justice is done (R. v. Power, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at p.
616).  Defence counsel is required to act in the accused’s best interests,
which includes ensuring that the accused’s plea is voluntary and informed (see,
for example, Law Society of British Columbia, Code of Professional Conduct
for British Columbia (online), rule 5.1-8).  And both counsel are bound
professionally and ethically not to mislead the court (ibid., rule
2.1-2(c)).  In short, they are entirely capable of arriving at resolutions that
are fair and consistent with the public interest (Martin Committee Report, at
p. 287).

[45]                         
Bearing in mind these benefits and the need for
certainty, I turn to the other tests proposed by the respondent Crown and some
of the interveners.

C.           
The Fitness of Sentence and Demonstrably Unfit
Tests Should Be Rejected

[46]                         
As indicated, the position of the respondent is
that while trial judges should give serious consideration to joint submissions,
such submissions may be rejected on a simple “fitness” test.  With respect,
this test is not sufficiently stringent.  Under it, trial judges must ask what
a fit or appropriate sentence would be, instead of asking whether the
sentence proposed would be viewed by reasonable and informed persons as a
breakdown in the proper functioning of the justice system.  In short, the
“fitness” test does not direct trial judges to approach joint submissions from
a position of restraint.  Rather, it sends a different, and in my view, a wrong
signal: that they may interfere if they have a different view of what a “fit”
sentence would be.  If trial judges were free to interfere on this basis, the
result would be to “effectively eliminate the use of plea bargaining as part of
the criminal prosecution process” (R. v. Oxford, 2010 NLCA 45, 299 Nfld.
& P.E.I.R. 327, at para. 55).  

[47]                         
While the “demonstrably unfit” test used by
appellate courts is undoubtedly a higher threshold than the simple “fitness”
test, in rare cases, this threshold may not be sufficiently robust for the
joint submission context.  I would not rule out the possibility that a sentence
which would otherwise be considered demonstrably unfit absent a joint
submission may nonetheless be acceptable in the context of one.  For example,
take the case of an accused involved in a very serious crime that the Crown may
have difficulty proving because of deficiencies in its case.  The accused
agrees to plead guilty, and to assist the Crown in prosecuting his
co-conspirators for this and other more serious offences.  The Crown might
reasonably conclude that it is in the public interest to agree, by way of a
joint submission, to a very lenient sentence in order to obtain the accused’s
guilty plea and his assistance.  In short, a very lenient, even “demonstrably
unfit” sentence may, in a particular case, serve the greater good. 

[48]                         
Further, both the fitness test and the appellate
“demonstrably unfit” test suffer from a similar flaw: they are designed for
different contexts.  As such, there is an appreciable risk that the approaches
which apply to conventional sentencing hearings or sentencing appeals will be
conflated with the approach that must be adhered to on a joint submission.  In
conventional sentencing hearings, trial judges look at the circumstances of the
offender and the offence, and the applicable sentencing principles.  They are
not asked to consider the critical systemic benefits that flow from joint
submissions, namely, the ability of the justice system to function fairly and
efficiently.  Similarly, appellate courts are not bound to consider these
systemic benefits on a conventional sentencing appeal.  The public interest
test avoids these pitfalls.

D.          
Guidance for Trial Judges 

[49]                         
Finally, I would offer some brief guidance to
trial judges on the approach they should follow when they are troubled by a
joint submission on sentence.

[50]                         
Courts across the country are generally in
agreement on the procedure judges should follow when they are inclined to
depart from a joint submission (see, for example, B.O.2, at paras.
74-82; R. v. Sinclair, 2004 MBCA 48, 185 C.C.C. (3d) 569,
at para. 17; G.W.C., at para. 26).  The parties and interveners
emphasize the importance of procedure.  It ensures that joint submissions are
given proper consideration, and that accused persons — who have already entered
a plea of guilty — are treated fairly.  The following procedures reflect
practical wisdom gained from the experience of our trial and appellate courts. 
They are meant to apply only to those cases where the joint submission is
contentious and raises concerns with the trial judge.  As I mentioned earlier,
most joint submissions are unexceptional and are readily approved by trial
judges without any difficulty.[3] 

[51]                         
First, trial judges should approach the joint
submission on an “as-is” basis.  That is to say, the public interest test
applies whether the judge is considering varying the proposed sentence or
adding something to it that the parties have not mentioned, for example, a
probation order.  If the parties have not asked for a particular order, the
trial judge should assume that it was considered and excluded from the joint
submission.  However, if counsel have neglected to include a mandatory order,
the judge should not hesitate to inform counsel.  The need for certainty in
joint submissions cannot justify failing to impose a mandatory order.

[52]                         
Second, trial judges should apply the public
interest test when they are considering “jumping” or “undercutting” a joint
submission (DeSousa, per Doherty J.A.). That is not to say that the
analysis will be the same in either case.  On the contrary, from the accused’s
perspective, “undercutting” does not engage concerns about fair trial rights or
undermine confidence in the certainty of plea negotiations. In addition, in assessing whether the severity of a
joint submission would offend the public interest, trial judges should be
mindful of the power imbalance that may exist between the Crown and defence,
particularly where the accused is self-represented or in custody at the time of
sentencing. These factors may temper the public interest in certainty and
justify “undercutting” in limited circumstances. At the same time, where the trial judge is considering “undercutting”, he or she
should bear in mind that the community’s confidence in the administration of
justice may suffer if an accused enjoys the benefits of a joint submission
without having to serve the agreed-upon sentence (see DeSousa, at paras.
23-24).

[53]                         
Third, when faced with a contentious joint
submission, trial judges will undoubtedly want to know about the circumstances
leading to the joint submission — and in particular, any benefits obtained by
the Crown or concessions made by the accused.  The greater the benefits
obtained by the Crown, and the more concessions made by the accused, the more
likely it is that the trial judge should accept the joint submission, even
though it may appear to be unduly lenient.  For example, if the joint
submission is the product of an agreement by the accused to assist the Crown or
police, or an evidentiary weakness in the Crown’s case, a very lenient sentence
might not be contrary to the public interest.  On the other hand, if the joint
submission resulted only from the accused’s realization that conviction was
inevitable, the same sentence might cause the public to lose confidence in the
criminal justice system. 

[54]                         
Counsel should, of course, provide the court
with a full account of the circumstances of the offender, the offence, and the
joint submission without waiting for a specific request from the trial judge. 
As trial judges are obliged to depart only rarely from joint submissions, there
is a “corollary obligation upon counsel” to ensure that they “amply justify
their position on the facts of the case as presented in open court” (Martin
Committee Report, at p. 329).  Sentencing — including sentencing based on a
joint submission — cannot be done in the dark.  The Crown and the defence must
“provide the trial judge not only with the proposed sentence, but with a full
description of the facts relevant to the offender and the offence”, in order to
give the judge “a proper basis upon which to determine whether [the joint
submission] should be accepted” (DeSousa, at para. 15; see also Sinclair,
at para. 14).

[55]                         
This is not to say that counsel must inform the
trial judge of “their negotiating positions or the substance of their
discussions leading to the agreement” (R. v. Tkachuk, 2001 ABCA 243, 293
A.R. 171, at para. 34).  But counsel must be able to inform the trial judge why
the proposed sentence would not bring the administration of justice into
disrepute or otherwise be contrary to the public interest.  If they do not,
they run the risk that the trial judge will reject the joint submission. 

[56]                         
There may, of course, be cases where it is not
possible to put the main considerations underlying a joint submission on the
public record because of safety or privacy concerns, or the risk of
jeopardizing ongoing criminal investigations (see Martin Committee Report, at
p. 317).  In such cases, counsel must find alternative means of communicating
these considerations to the trial judge in order to ensure that the judge is
apprised of the relevant considerations and that a proper record is created for
appeal purposes.  

[57]                         
A thorough justification of the joint submission
also has an important public perception component.  Unless counsel put the
considerations underlying the joint submission on the record, “though justice
may be done, it may not have the appearance of being done; the public may
suspect, rightly or wrongly, that an impropriety has occurred” (C. C. Ruby, G.
J. Chan and N. R. Hasan, Sentencing (8th ed. 2012), at p. 73).  

[58]                         
Fourth, if the trial judge is not satisfied with
the sentence proposed by counsel, “fundamental fairness dictates that an
opportunity be afforded to counsel to make further submissions in an attempt to
address the . . . judge’s concerns before the sentence is imposed” (G.W.C.,
at para. 26).  The judge should notify counsel that he or she has concerns, and
invite further submissions on those concerns, including the possibility of allowing
the accused to withdraw his or her guilty plea, as the trial judge did in this
case.  

[59]                         
Fifth, if the trial judge’s concerns about the
joint submission are not alleviated, the judge may allow the accused to apply
to withdraw his or her guilty plea.  The circumstances in which a plea may be
withdrawn need not be settled here.  However, by way of example, withdrawal may
be permitted where counsel have made a fundamental error about the legality of
the proposed joint submission, for example, where a conditional sentence has
been proposed but is unavailable. 

[60]                         
Finally, trial judges who remain unsatisfied by
counsel’s submissions should provide clear and cogent reasons for departing
from the joint submission.  These reasons will help explain to the parties why
the proposed sentence was unacceptable, and may assist them in the resolution
of future cases.  Reasons will also facilitate appellate review.

IV.       
Application 

[61]                         
The Crown submits that on any test, the trial
judge was entitled to depart from the joint submission.  Respectfully, I cannot
agree.  Setting aside that the trial judge failed to apply the proper test — he
asked only whether the joint submission was fit — he failed to take into
account the important systemic benefits of joint submissions, and the corresponding
need for them to be reasonably certain.  

[62]                         
In terms of the custodial sentence, it appears
the trial judge treated the joint submission as though it was a conventional
sentencing hearing.  With respect, he erred in doing so.  The parties made a
clear and firm recommendation on the appropriate sentence.  Importantly, the
Crown did not resile from the joint submission, but maintained his position
that he was seeking a further period of 18 months in custody even after he
learned of the calculation error.  

[63]                         
In my respectful view, there was no basis for
the trial judge to substitute his opinion for the considered agreement of
counsel.  The custodial term proposed, while low, was not so low as to bring
the administration of justice into disrepute or be contrary to the public
interest.  It was close to the range of sentence identified by the trial judge,
and, as I have said, joint submissions promote the smooth operation of the
criminal justice system.  The appellant gave up his right to a trial and any
self-defence argument he may have had.  In the end, the trial judge’s deviation
from the recommended custodial sentence — by only six months — amounts to
little more than tinkering.  

[64]                         
The probation order raises more difficult
questions, but, in my view, it should not have been made.  While the trial
judge had reason to be concerned about how the appellant would manage in the
community, these concerns were addressed by counsel (see para. 19, above).  

[65]                         
Normally a probation order requiring that the
accused refrain from the use of non-medically prescribed drugs would be, if not
essential, certainly warranted where it is shown that an accused’s drug
addiction has contributed to his offending.  However, the failure to impose
such an order in the context of a joint submission is not necessarily fatal,
particularly in a case like this, where the reason for the order is somewhat
attenuated by the Director’s warrant and the likelihood that the order would be
self-defeating.  

[66]                         
The Crown, having considered the public interest,
obviously felt that society would be adequately protected without a probation
order.  Counsel’s view that the probation order was duplicative and therefore
unnecessary to protect the public was reasonable in the circumstances.  In
fact, counsel appear to have come to a practical decision on how best to
further the appellant’s rehabilitation while ensuring the public’s protection. 

V.          
Conclusion

[67]                         
I would allow the appeal, and vary the
appellant’s sentence to bring it into conformity with the joint submission, namely,
that the appellant serve an additional 18 months in custody, with no period of
probation to follow.  The sentence jointly proposed by the Crown and defence
was not one that would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, nor
was it otherwise contrary to the public interest.

[1] These reasons do not address sentencing flowing from plea
agreements in which the parties are not in full agreement as to the appropriate
sentence.





[2] The Committee was commissioned in 1991 by the Hon. Howard Hampton,
Attorney General of Ontario, to study the early stages of the criminal process,
namely, charge screening, disclosure, and resolution or plea discussions.  The
Committee comprised leading members of the criminal bar, including both Crown
and defence counsel, senior police officers, and other members of the
community.  Notably, it was chaired by the Hon. G. Arthur Martin, one of the
foremost criminal law jurists in this country’s history.





[3]
As indicated, these reasons do
not address sentencing flowing from plea agreements in which the parties are
not in full agreement as to the appropriate sentence. In other instances, the
Crown and accused may negotiate sentencing positions that reflect partial
agreement or an agreed upon range. Such arrangements may involve a comparable quid
pro quo. In such circumstances, it may be that similar considerations would
apply where a trial judge is, for instance, inclined to exceed the ceiling
proposed by the Crown, but we leave that question for another day.",2016-10-21 00:00:00,CA Supreme Court

	LEEMING JA: I agree with R S Hulme AJ.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: I agree with R S Hulme AJ.
	
	
	R S HULME AJ: Subject to any issue that arises out of delay in lodging documents, the Court has before it two applications for leave to appeal against sentence. The first relates to sentences imposed by English DCJ on 30 May 2013 in proceedings 2009/00058502. The second relates to sentences imposed by Syme DCJ on 15 November 2013 in proceedings 2011/00142641.
	


Lateness of the Applications


	
	The Notices of Appeal contained in the Appeal Book were filed on 28 January and 10 February 2016 and during the hearing the issue arose whether the Court should entertain appeals that seemed to be so late.
	
	
	However access to the Court records shows that Notices of Intention to Appeal were lodged on 20 November 2013 and 14 January 2014. The time for lodging Notices of Appeal was extended by the Registrar on 8 occasions, ultimately to 30 January 2016.
	
	
	The topic was also the subject of affidavits which revealed that on 7 November and 9 December 2013, Mr Turner advised the Aboriginal Legal Service that he wished to appeal against the severity of his sentence imposed by English DCJ and that in the interim and following month or so there were a number of conversations between solicitors and attempted contact with the Court registry. Arguably relevant to the topic of delay, is also the fact that the trial before Syme DCJ occurred in February 2013 and it was listed for sentence on 26 July, 16 August, 4 October and 15 November 2013. However I need not pursue this aspect. The Court records make it clear that both appeals are within time.
	


2009 Proceedings 


	
	The sentences imposed by English DCJ were in respect of charges that arose out of an altercation which occurred on 5 May 2009 at the Kingswood TAFE between the Applicant and a Clinton Walker. In consequence the Applicant was charged with:-
	


(i)   Inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm;

(ii)   Reckless wounding;

(iii)   Assault occasioning actual bodily harm; and

(iv)   Intentionally damaging a mobile phone.


	
	The Applicant pleaded guilty to the fourth charge. He stood for trial on the other charges. Taking the view that the injury to the victim did not amount to grievous bodily harm, her Honour directed that the Applicant be acquitted on the first charge. A jury found him not guilty on the second but convicted on the third. Pursuant to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 that charge carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment of 5 years.
	
	
	On 30 May 2013, her Honour sentenced the Applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months commencing on 17 April 2011 for the mobile phone offence and, for the assault offence, imprisonment for 2 years 6 months and 16 days including a non-parole period of 1 year 10 months and 26 days, both such periods also commencing on 17 April 2011.
	
	
	Her Honour specified that the non-parole period of the longer sentence would expire on 14 March 2013 and that the Applicant would be eligible for parole on that day. As a matter of law both statements cannot be correct but nothing turns on that fact in the instant appeal.
	
	
	It is not apparent how her Honour arrived at the somewhat odd periods she nominated although it is clear that some pre-sentence custody was taken into account. Be that as it may, it was not suggested that the unusual nature of the periods bespoke error.
	
	
	The Applicant has sought leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by English DCJ upon the grounds:-
	


(i)   The sentencing Judge erred in failing to take into account that the charges could have been dealt with in the Local Court and to have regard to the maximum penalty in such a case.

(ii)   The individual sentences and the effective sentence are manifestly excessive.


	
	Although the sentences imposed by English DCJ have expired, the duration of the non-parole period her Honour fixed was relied on to determine the commencement of the first of the sentences imposed by Syme DCJ, and no doubt influenced the commencement of the others so has a continuing relevance.
	


2009 Proceedings – Circumstances of Offending


	
	The circumstances of the offending involving Mr Walker and some of English DCJ’s findings and remarks were as follows.
	
	
	At the Kingswood TAFE the Applicant walked past the victim who said something to him. The Applicant went to the toilets and when he was walking out the victim opened the toilet door quickly causing injury. An argument ensued in which the victim was the aggressor. The Applicant turned away saying words to the effect “leave me alone.” The victim said something further and the Applicant turned and approached the victim. Punches were thrown, some of which caused marks to the Applicant’s face and one of which caused the victim to strike his head on a door jamb and to fall unconscious to the floor. While the victim lay unconscious, the Applicant, according to her Honour, punched and kicked the victim viciously. The Crown submissions to her Honour would indicate that there was in fact only one kick, although a powerful one. By-standers attempted to prevent further assault and the Applicant picked up the victim’s phone and threw it causing it to hit a wall and be destroyed. The Applicant’s demeanour at the time was described by Crown witnesses as “pretty angry” and “raging at the time”.
	
	
	The striking of his head on the door jamb occasioned a minimally displaced fracture of the victim’s right orbital floor. The victim also suffered lacerations to his facial area, some minor, and some of which required suturing. The victim was discharged from hospital on the same day and her Honour recorded that there was no victim impact statement indicating any substantial ongoing emotional harm suffered by the victim.
	
	
	The Applicant was born in July 1982. At the time the Applicant was sentenced by English DCJ (on 30 May 2013) the only significant matters on his record, the relevant charge dates and sentences imposed were:-
	


1998 – Shoplifting – dismissed with a caution under s 33 (presumably of the Mental Health Act).

January 2001 – Aggravated robbery – Imprisonment for 2 years 6 months.

June 2001 – Assault occasioning actual bodily harm – $500 fine.

August 2001 - Robbery armed with an offensive weapon – Imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months including a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 30 July 2001.

April 2006 – Behaving in an offensive manner – Fine of $500.

August 2010 – Common assault and stalking with intent to cause fear of harm – Two 18 month s 9 bonds.


	
	Her Honour referred to the Applicant having “lengthy criminal antecedents” including in those the offences committed in 2010 and those tried before Syme DCJ and of which, by the time English DCJ came to sentence the Applicant he had been convicted. English DCJ continued:-
	


From the history contained in the reports of Dr Furst, the psychiatrist, the offender had a troubled upbringing. He attended Kingswood High School and then Penrith Christian College. He regularly truanted from school however was able to complete his Year 10 Certificate. He was, at the time of the commission of this offence, two weeks shy of completing a Diploma in Information Technology at TAFE. Unfortunately he was prevented from completing his Diploma as a result of the charges brought against him.

He has a history of abusing cannabis from the age of about 13. He says his usage escalated and by the time he was 17 or 18 he was using one gram a day. He had tried heroin on one occasion and amphetamines on another but stated they had no effect and that was when he was 16 or 17. He commenced to abuse alcohol at the age of 10 drinking as much as his uncles would supply to him. He described himself as an alcoholic from the age of 16. He has undergone some drug and alcohol counselling in the past. He was exposed to significant domestic violence. His father stabbed an uncle at a party. The offender says he was kidnapped by his father who had “knocked his mother out”. His father also shot his mother. It was an unhappy childhood. His mother re-partnered but he continued to suffer physical abuse at the hands of her partners. He says he was sexually abused by an uncle.

Following conflict with his mother in his late teens he was asked to leave the family home and he lived on the streets. From the age of 19 he began to suffer symptoms consistent with schizophrenia, he would hear voices and see images and began to experience paranoia.

When he was admitted into custody previously he was prescribed Seroquel by a psychiatrist. Unfortunately when he was released from custody he failed to comply with his treatment regime and he stopped taking his medication in about March 2009. He says in any event the Seroquel never totally controlled his symptoms.

He was admitted to the Pialla Unit at the Nepean Hospital in November 2010 for a week and he was again prescribed Seroquel. He says following his release from hospital he was unable to obtain a health care card and he stopped taking his medication as it was too expensive to purchase. In any event he did not like the side effects from taking it.

There were further episodes of paranoia and aggression in December 2010 which resulted in him being returned to custody between 29 December 2010 and 23 January 2011. His antipsychotic medication was changed to Risperidone and he attended for follow up treatment with the Penrith Mental Health team. His treating psychiatrist was Dr Anwar.

On 29 April 2011 the offender overdosed on a large quantity of medication, heroin and alcohol. According to the report of Dr Furst dated 25 September 2011 as a result of a significant physical insult from his overdose the offender lost the use of his legs and is now a paraplegic, he is wheelchair bound.

Following the breakdown of his relationship with his former partner he had stopped taking his medication and he had begun to abuse amphetamines and Valium and to binge drink. At the time of the second consultation with Dr Furst the offender had been prescribed Solian, a medication which was causing fewer side effects and assisting him to think more clearly.

…

He is an offender who was exposed to drug and alcohol abuse and physical and sexual abuse from a very young age. There is no doubt that he developed a psychotic disorder and is now in need of ongoing psychiatric care. He is of course now disabled because of the drug overdose in 2011. The state of his mental health and his disability will make his time in custody more onerous.

…

I am unable to find him remorseful or contrite other than to the extent of his plea to the property damage charge… His prospects of rehabilitation remain guarded, more so because of the state of his mental health and his failure in the past to comply with treatment regimes which have been put in place to assist him. I do find only now, because he is wheelchair bound, that the likelihood of him re-offending is low, otherwise such a finding could not be made.

His record for serious offences of violence is one which disentitles him to leniency although it does not aggravate the offence for which he is now being sentenced. The offence for which he is now being sentenced is a prevalent offence and it must attract a significant component for general deterrence in any sentence to be imposed. This was a particularly vicious assault upon an unconscious victim who was laying on the floor unable to defend himself. …

I referred earlier to the criminal antecedents of the offender, as I have said they do not aggravate this matter but I do find there is a need for specific deterrence to address retribution, deterrence and protection of the community. This was not an uncharacteristic aberration on the part of this offender. He was willing to engage in an act of violence demonstrating a continuing disobedience of the law. I have had regard to the seriousness of the offence committed and the subjective circumstances of the offender. I find that only a sentence of full time custody will suffice.

I am asked to make a finding of special circumstances but I decline to do so. This is not the first occasion on which this offender has found himself in custody. I have taken into account the state of his mental health and the fact that he is wheelchair bound but he is no longer a young man. …


	
	Dr Furst’s reports to which reference was made were obtained in April and September 2011. Of these only that of 9 April 2011 was before this Court.
	


2009 Proceedings – Ground 1

The sentencing Judge erred in failing to take into account that the charges could have been dealt with in the Local Court and to have regard to the maximum penalty in such a case.


	
	One issue that arose during the hearing of the appeal was whether the point the subject of this ground was ever taken before English DCJ.
	
	
	There was no reference to the matter in oral submissions made by defence counsel in the court below but written submissions he made have been lost. The result is that no-one knows if the point was ever taken before her Honour. In this situation the Court should consider the ground on its merits.
	
	
	There is no doubt that the charges of reckless wounding, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and that involving the mobile phone could have been dealt with in the Local Court where the maximum period of imprisonment that could have been imposed for each charge was 2 years and there is in her Honour’s remarks no reference to the fact. The charge of inflicting grievous bodily harm could not have been dealt with in the Local Court.
	
	
	It is also clear that as the charges arose out of the fight between the Applicant and Mr Walker, they could only sensibly be tried together. English DCJ concluded that the injury suffered by Mr Walker did not amount to grievous bodily harm but it is not so obvious that a fractured eye socket does not fall into that category that one can say the most serious of the charges should never have been brought.
	
	
	That an offence dealt with in the District Court could have been dealt with in the Local Court is commonly considered a matter relevant to a determination of the appropriate sentence. I confess I do not understand why in most cases this should be so. The objective seriousness of an offence and the offender’s subjective circumstances are the factors that should influence a determination of the appropriate sentence and, subject to the qualifications that follow, I can see no reason why, for a particular offence and offender, it should matter which Court imposes a sentence. Of course there is a jurisdictional limit on the Local Court as to the maximum sentence it can impose and there may be particular statutory provisions to which regard must otherwise be had.
	
	
	However, there are many cases which decide or reflect a view that the possibility that a matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court is relevant – see e.g. R v Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297 at [16], Regina v Palmer [2005] NSWCCA 349 at [14]-[15], Regina v El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [30] and Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; (2012) 223 A Crim R 460. That said, in Baines v R [2016] NSWCCA 132 at [10] Basten JA observed that how the fact that a matter could have been dealt with in a Local Court contributes to mitigation is by no means clear. See also SM v R [2016] NSWCCA 171 at [26].
	
	
	Although I have not carried out an exhaustive search, the earliest case in this line I am aware of is R v Dalton-Morgan (unreported, NSWCCA, 14 December 1989) where however a particular statutory provision provided grounds for the decision reached. That factor does not seem to have been recognised in later cases, e. g. R v Jason Smith (unreported, NSWCCA, 11 September 1991) and R v Crombie. Be that as it may, the general principle was not the subject of debate in the instant application and I shall accordingly proceed in accordance with past practice.
	
	
	It was submitted on behalf of the Applicant that, whether or not there was any submission to English DCJ that she should take account of the fact that the assault occasioning actual bodily harm charge could have been dealt with in the Local Court, the relevant circumstances were before her Honour and she was therefore obliged to consider them, including the maximum penalty that was available had the matter been dealt with in the Local Court.
	
	
	In that connection counsel for the Applicant referred the Court to Cowan v R [2015] NSWCCA 118 at [40] and Ingrey v R [2016] NSWCCA 31. In the former case Bellew J, with the concurrence of Bathurst CJ and Simpson J, observed:-
	


There was considerable evidence before the sentencing judge regarding the applicant’s mental state. In these circumstances, and notwithstanding the absence of any specific submission as to the principles governing the sentencing of mentally ill offenders, the sentencing judge was under an obligation to consider those principles and, if appropriate, to apply them. I am fortified in that view by the recent observations of Price J (with whom Hidden and Schmidt JJ agreed) in Martin v R [2015] NSWCCA 6 at [53]:

“It is evident from these opinions that the applicant’s mental disorders may have contributed to his offending. Although a specific submission was not made by the applicant’s counsel on this issue, the focus of the applicant’s case on sentence as his mental health. In my respectful opinion, the judge was obliged to expressly make some assessment as to whether the applicant’s moral culpability for the serious crimes that he committed was reduced by his mental condition. In assessing the objective seriousness of the offences, her Honour did not make any reference to the applicant’s mental health and erred in not doing so.”


	
	In the second Hoeben CJ at CL, with the concurrence of Adams and Fullerton JJ remarked:-
	


34.   It is true, as the Crown submitted, that in Bugmy v The Queen the plurality said:

   “40 … The circumstance that an offender has been raised in a community surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may mitigate the sentence because his or her moral culpability is likely to be less than the culpability of an offender whose formative years have not been marred in that way.” (emphasis added)

35.   My understanding of that statement is that it refers to the ultimate effect of that factor. The plurality were not saying that a consideration of this factor was optional. What the plurality clearly had in mind was that even when that factor is taken into account, there may be countervailing factors (such as the protection of the community) which might reduce or eliminate its effect. In other words, this factor where it is present should be taken into account in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. That is something which his Honour did not do.


	
	In response the Crown relied on remarks of this Court in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at [109] – [112] where Johnson J (with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL) observed:-
	


109.       Unless this Court is able to clearly determine that the offence in question, committed by the particular offender with his or her criminal history, ought to have remained in the Local Court, then the argument is theoretical at best. The bare theoretical possibility of the matter being dealt with in the Local Court does not suffice: Wise v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 264 at [31]; R v Cage [2006] NSWCCA 304 at [31]; Edwards v The Queen at [47]; McIntyre v The Queen (2009) 198 A Crim R 549 at [62]-[67].

110.      Grounds of appeal, as asserted by the present applicant, have been considered in a number of recent decisions of this Court, including Bonwick v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 177, Dagdanasar v The Queen (2010) 57 MVR 230, Lewis v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 220, Kean v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 136 and LB v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 220. The frequency of appeals which raise this ground tends to emphasise the fact that the issue is well known as a potential factor to be taken into account on sentence, so that this Court should apply a rigorous approach in requiring offenders to take the point at first instance, before being permitted to raise it in this Court.

111.       The ground of appeal can only be meaningful if this Court determines that the total sentence for the particular offence should not have exceeded the jurisdictional limit of the Local Court. It might be thought that a ground asserting manifest excess is capable of covering the same ground, if the position is that clear in the particular case.

112.       Unless it is plainly wrong that the offence is in the District Court, it is difficult to see how an offender can succeed on a ground of appeal which claims that a relevant factor has not been taken into account by the sentencing judge.


	
	I hesitate to add more remarks on the topic but it seems to me that the situation is this. A sentencing judge should refer to matters raised in evidence or submissions which have some reasonable prospect of affecting his conclusion. However, experience shows that there are many matters raised which do not answer this description and judges are not obliged to go through the solemn farce of referring to all matters that might possibly, if unreasonably, affect the result, just for the sake of demolishing or rejecting them.
	
	
	The sentence English DCJ imposed was well in excess of the jurisdiction of the Local Court. It follows that, if she had turned her mind to the topic, her Honour would have concluded that the limits on that jurisdiction made the case an inappropriate one to be dealt with in the lower Court. Furthermore, consistently with the sentence her Honour imposed there is no rational basis for concluding her decision would have been different if she did or had turned her mind to the possibility that the Local Court could have dealt with the matter. In the circumstances I do not see any error in her Honour omitting to mention the possibility that the nature of the charge meant it could have been dealt with in the Local Court, whether or not accompanying that mention with the observation that the case was one inappropriate to have been so dealt with.
	
	
	While the conclusion I have ultimately reached means that the case is one that could have been brought in the Local Court, it was not one which in my view should have been brought there – c.f McCullough v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 94; 194 A Crim R 439 at [22].
	
	
	I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


2009 Proceedings – Ground 2

The individual sentences and the effective sentence are manifestly excessive.


	
	So far as the assault offence is concerned, experience shows that not only is there is a very substantial degree of violence in the community but it has become common for victims unconscious or relatively helpless on the ground to be kicked by their assailants. No longer is attention paid to the old saying that “you don’t hit a man when he is down”, rather is the opportunity commonly taken by assailants to inflict further damage. Generally the kicking is with shoes or boots and not uncommonly the result is brain damage to the victim.
	
	
	It behoves the courts to actively discourage such cowardly and dangerous behaviour and in addressing the Applicant’s assault offence English DCJ was clearly correct in reflecting on the need for retribution, specific and other deterrence and protection of the community and in imposing a sentence that gave weight to these factors. However, her Honour had also to take into account the circumstances of the Applicant.
	
	
	Her Honour was clearly conscious of the Applicant’s troubled upbringing and psychiatric problems although apart from her recitation of the details, nothing that her Honour said indicates that she gave either of these factors any weight. There is no recognition in her Honour’s remarks of Dr Furst’s view, expressed in his report of 9 April 2011 that:-
	


(Mr Turner) also has a history of poor attachment to his parents and marked behavioural disturbance in his youth. It is likely that the early onset of his alcohol abuse and the severe childhood sexual abuse, trauma and neglect he was exposed to adversely affected his personality formation and made him more prone to angry outbursts, difficulty sustaining relationships and impulsivity.


	
	The Applicant did have a significant criminal record although I doubt the correctness of her Honour’s description of it as “lengthy”. More significantly, during the 8 years immediately prior to the offences for which he was being sentenced by English DCJ he had not been convicted of any serious offence. Given his past, that was a substantial achievement. Despite a less than ideal childhood education he had taken it upon himself to further his education in the respect described by English DCJ. He was entitled to have these matters taken into account but again there is nothing to indicate they were.
	
	
	Of course their absence was not one of the grounds of appeal and I mention them only to indicate factors that may well have contributed to the sentence imposed being as heavy as it was.
	
	
	The Applicant’s offending was unpremeditated and clearly inspired by the actions of Mr Walker. Certainly the Applicant should have exercised more self-control but it is inherently likely that the Applicant’s lack in this regard was significantly contributed to by his upbringing and mental conditions for which he was not primarily responsible. Thus I have no difficulty in accepting the opinion of Dr Furst which I have quoted.
	
	
	Her Honour recorded in her remarks that when the Applicant had been in custody previously he was prescribed Seroquel by a psychiatrist but that the Applicant stopped taking this medication in about March 2009. In that connection it may well be that the Applicant contributed to his loss of self-control in May of that year. However experience in the courts shows that discontinuing medication is a common feature of those suffering from schizophrenia and while this discontinuance is relevant I would not weigh it too heavily against the Applicant.
	
	
	One factor which may have operated in the Applicant’s favour more than it should have done was English DCJ’s conclusion that the Applicant was a paraplegic. So far as one can judge no challenge was made to that conclusion before her Honour and in any consideration of whether the sentences imposed by her Honour were manifestly excessive this Court should accept her Honour’s view.
	
	
	That said, matters raised in the trial before Syme DCJ tend to indicate that in fact the Applicant was not afflicted in the way he suggested. Insofar as this Court is involved in any resentencing of the Applicant it is unreal to think that we can adopt one approach in one resentencing but not in another and while in judging whether English DCJ erred, the Court should accept her Honour’s view on that topic, in any re-sentencing this Court should adopt whatever appears to the court to be correct. For reasons which will become apparent, in my view the Applicant has not been shown to suffer from paraplegia.
	
	
	When regard is had to all of the matters to which I have referred, the conclusion at which I have arrived is that the sentence imposed for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm was manifestly excessive. Particularly relevant are circumstances of the Applicant’s upbringing, his mental health, the likely contribution of these factors to the offences for which English DCJ sentenced him, to the fact he reacted to provocation and that, prior to those offences, he made the efforts he did to redeem himself.
	
	
	Approaching the matter de novo, in the circumstances to which I have referred an appropriate sentence for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm is imprisonment for 1 year including a non-parole period of 9 months.
	
	
	As the duration of the sentence imposed for the offence of damaging Mr Walker’s phone is entirely concurrent with, but less than, English DCJ imposed and I regard as appropriate for the assault offence, I would not give leave to appeal in respect of the lesser sentence.
	


2011 Proceedings


	
	On 27 April 2011 the Applicant became involved in an altercation with his former partner who may be referred to as “SE”. Arising out of events on that day he was charged with:-
	


(i)   Assaulting SE, thereby occasioning actual bodily harm.

(ii)   Attempting to have sexual intercourse with SE without her consent, knowing she was not consenting, in circumstances of aggravation namely that before the attempted sexual intercourse he inflicted actual bodily harm upon her.

(iii)   Having sexual intercourse with SE without her consent, knowing she was not consenting, in circumstances of aggravation namely that before the sexual intercourse he inflicted actual bodily harm upon her.

(iv)   Having sexual intercourse with SE without her consent, knowing she was not consenting, in circumstances of aggravation namely that before the sexual intercourse he inflicted actual bodily harm upon her.


	
	A jury convicted the Applicant on all counts and on 15 November 2013 Syme DCJ imposed the following sentences:-
	


(i)   Imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months commencing on 14 March 2013.

(ii)   Imprisonment for a fixed term of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 14 March 2013.

(iii)   Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 7 years commencing on 14 December 2013 with a balance of term of 4 years.

(iv)   Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 7 years commencing on 14 December 2013 with a balance of term of 4 years.


	
	The effective sentence thus imposed for these four offences was imprisonment for 11 years and 9 months including a non-parole period of 7 years and 9 months. This sentence commenced on the day English DCJ had said that the non-parole period she imposed would end and that the Applicant would be eligible for parole. The effective non-parole period arising from the sentences imposed by English DCJ and Syme DCJ was about 9 years and 8 months.
	
	
	The relevant provisions of the Crimes Act 1900 and maximum penalties prescribed for the offences charged are :-
	


(i)   Count 1 – s 59 (1) – imprisonment for 5 years.

(ii)   Counts 2 – ss 61J and 61P – imprisonment for 20 years.

(iii)   Counts 3 & 4 – s 61J (1) – imprisonment for 20 years.


	
	For the offences the subject of counts 3 and 4, a standard non-parole period of 10 years has been prescribed.
	
	
	The grounds upon which the Applicant has sought leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by Syme DCJ are:-
	


(i)   The sentencing Judge failed to take into account the evidence of the Applicant’s disadvantaged background, which was relevant to his mental health and his moral culpability.

(ii)   The sentencing Judge erred in her consideration of the circumstances of the Applicant’s protective custody, and in not taking this into account on sentence as a matter of mitigation.

(iii)   The sentencing Judge erred in not taking into account on sentence as a matter in mitigation the Applicant’s paralysis and confinement to a wheelchair during his two and a half year period of incarceration.

(iv)   The sentencing Judge erred in misapprehending the maximum penalty in relation to the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

(v)   The sentencing Judge erred in her consideration of accumulation in relation to the sentence imposed by her Honour English DCJ.

(vi)   The individual sentences and the effective sentence are manifestly excessive.


	
	The circumstances of and leading to the offences are succinctly stated by her Honour:-
	


(i)   The Applicant and the complainant were in a relationship from 2006. After a child was born in late 2009, the relationship became strained and in December 2010 an AVO was taken out against the Applicant. At that time SE moved to her parents’ home, the Applicant remaining in the complainant’s unit where they had jointly cohabitated.

(ii)   The Applicant and the complainant maintained contact and occasionally the complainant stayed overnight at the unit. In March 2011 the Applicant threatened the complainant. He held a knife to her throat and said if she went to the police again he would kill her, her parents and their child. Some of the threats were recorded on the complainant’s mobile phone and her Honour remarked that they supported the Crown case that the complainant feared the Applicant.

(iii)   Despite this incident, the complainant tried to maintain a good relationship with the Applicant. On 27 April 2011 the Applicant telephoned the complainant and asked her to come and assist him move back to his parents’ home. She agreed and attended at the unit. When she arrived, she found it in semi-darkness, the Applicant in the kitchen holding two large kitchen knives and with some apparently self-inflicted cuts to his arms. The Applicant was aggressive and threatening, waving the knives around and refusing to put them down. He hit her on the head with the flat of the knife, kicked her on the upper thigh with his bare foot and said he would kill her if she tried to escape. He calmed down for a time and allowed her to put a bandage on him. He ordered her to clean up his blood from the floor and bench.

(iv)   He told the complainant to sit on the couch. He ordered her to remove her pants and shoes and when she did not comply quickly enough, he removed them. He told her to lie on the couch face down. In fear she complied. He attempted to force his penis into her anus but was unsuccessful.

(v)   He then forced her into the bedroom and onto the bed and again attempted penile anal intercourse. She screamed. He applied saliva to his penis and continued the attempt causing the complainant a great deal of pain.

(vi)   At her request to do it “normally” the Applicant penetrated her vagina and then removing his penis from there succeeded in inserting it into her anus. The penetration lasted a few seconds and he then ejaculated.

(vii)   The Applicant would not allow the complainant to leave the unit without him. He insisted on going with her to her family home, remaining with her for the rest of the evening, in her Honour’s words “to stop her making a complaint about his behaviour to the police”.

(viii)   The complainant contacted the police on the following day.

(ix)   At trial the Applicant denied any sexual assault or intercourse and the use of force.


	
	Some other aspects of the incident appear from the “Crown Proposed Facts on Sentence”. Some time after SE arrived at the unit and observed the Applicant bleeding from his wrists, he wanted her to put one of the knives in his chest. Later he returned to the kitchen and again put a knife to his wrist.
	
	
	Other findings of her Honour bearing on the length of the sentences she imposed included:-
	


(i)   At the time of committing the offences the Applicant was on two s 9 bonds and on bail for another offence, factors which are aggravating;

(ii)   In December 2011 SE complained about the Applicant harassing and intimidating her and an AVO was taken out;

(iii)   In March 2011 the Applicant threatened SE with a knife he held to her throat and threatened to kill her, the child of SE and the Applicant and SE’s parents;

(iv)   The offences charged were not part of planned or organised criminal activity;

(v)   There was some evidence of planning with malicious intent;

(vi)   During the evening the Applicant made threats to kill SE if she tried to leave and this formed an aggravating circumstance for all 3 sexual offences;

(vii)   During the events the Applicant caused pain to SE and slapped her face. These matters were also aggravating;

(viii)   The Applicant’s offence involved a breach of trust, he having lured the victim to where she was attacked.


	
	The grounds of appeal are primarily concerned with the Applicant’s subjective circumstances and to that topic I now turn. During the sentencing hearing evidence on the topic was given by the Applicant and contained in reports of Dr Furst.
	
	
	One of Dr Furst’s reports was that dated 9 April 2011 which had been before English DCJ and provided most of the material I have recounted in [18] above. The other, dated 24 July 2013, was inspired by the conviction of the Applicant in the trial conducted before Syme DCJ. In it Dr Furst did not retreat from anything he had said in the earlier report, including his opinion as to the impact of the Applicant’s upbringing, included a diagnosis that the Applicant was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, substance abuse and a personality disorder with antisocial and borderline traits and opined:-
	


Your client is impulsive and was mentally disordered at the time of his offence, inflicting serious self-harm at the time, asking the victim to push the knife into his chest and then sexually assaulting her. He probably failed to consider the consequences of his alleged actions. He has limited coping skills and took a near fatal overdose on 29/04/11. He took a further two overdoses in custody and now has a psychogenic paraplegia.

Mr Turner was probably acutely psychotic and depressed at the time of the alleged offence before the Court, as a consequence of his schizophrenic illness, belief that the victim was having an affair and his daughter did not belong to him, acute depression, and the destabilising effects of the drugs he had been abusing over the previous 2-3 months.

In my opinion, his psychotic illness, personality disorder, depression, mental disorder, and his beliefs that his partner was being unfaithful to him and his daughter was not his own mitigate against the seriousness of his actions.


	
	Asked to address the Applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation, Dr Furst said, inter alia:-
	


Mr Turner was exposed to violence and alcohol abuse as a child, has developed a serious psychotic disorder, has a history consistent with substance dependence, and probably has an underlying personality disorder with borderline and antisocial traits. His adjustment to the community and the risk he poses to himself and others will require assertive treatment and monitoring in the community, probably through longer term case management and possibly a Community Treatment Order with his local mental health team when released on parole to increase his chances of compliance.

His overall risk of future violence is moderate, but would be significantly reduced through assertive psychiatric treatment, psychotherapy to address his childhood abuse issues, and ongoing abstinence from alcohol and drugs of abuse. His physical disability in the form of paralysis is a further factor that, paradoxically, reduced his risk of future violence. In my view, the primary risks Mr Turner faces are those of further demoralisation and suicide, especially given he has already tried to kill himself in a serious way on three occasions since the offence in question on 27/04/11.


	
	Dr Furst also observed:-
	


(The Applicant) is a man who has evidence of personality dysfunction, impulsivity and poor coping skills, including multiple attempts to suicide and other forms of self-harm.


	
	Although she accepted the diagnosis of schizophrenia Syme DCJ did not accept a deal of what Dr Furst had said. She remarked that Dr Furst’s opinion was apparently made in ignorance of some circumstances of the offending, and was based on Mr Turner’s version of events – a version a number of aspects of which her Honour rejected. Indeed at one stage her Honour said, “there is much to question in Mr Turner’s self-reported history”.
	
	
	One matter her Honour regarded as significant in this connection was the preparation in which the Applicant had engaged prior to the sexual offences. Whether her Honour was justified in this view is not apparent because Dr Furst expressly adverted to the fact that the version of events given by the Applicant was at odds with the Crown Case Statement. The Crown Case Statement was not included in the appeal papers.
	
	
	Included in her Honour’s remarks was the following:-
	


Dr Furst noted that the offender was first diagnosed with this schizophrenia condition, in 2008 when under the care of Justice Health. The records do not support this. For reasons I will refer to later, the history given by Mr Turner is unreliable. He was admitted to Nepean hospital in late 2010 and apparently assessed there with schizophrenia and antisocial personality traits at that time. In 2007 he was in custody, but there is no mention at that time of mental health issues, in his custody record. – AB 31


	
	The records to which her Honour referred were a bundle of clinical notes and other health records or reports emanating primarily from Justice Health, bearing dates between December 2010 and July 2013. Based on them Syme DCJ also recorded that the Applicant refused to attend appointments with psychiatrists, psychologists and mental health workers, refused to take prescribed medication and in recent times had refused physiotherapy for his claimed paralysis.
	
	
	It should be noted that omitted from the bundle were some early significant records that had been part of Exhibit 4 before English DCJ. These were an Inmate Profile Document and an Alerts Detailing Report from the Prison Authorities, and contain notations:-
	


1/8/2001   History of suicide – has thoughts of suicide/self-harm.

…

14/2/2007   Please keep at MRRC as long as possible. Inmate is schizophrenia sufferer on medication. Is working in Cortex and is good worker and stable. Has to be seen by a psychiatrist. I feel if he is kept here as long as possible this will help him.


	
	It is not appropriate to take these last mentioned documents into account in deciding whether the sentences imposed by Syme DCJ are affected by error but, as I have indicated above, in any re-sentencing, this Court should adopt whatever view of the Applicant’s incapacity and its consequences appears to the Court to be correct.
	
	
	Although quoting most of Dr Furst’s opinion that the Applicant:–
	


Was probably acutely psychotic and depressed at the time of the alleged offence before the Court, as a consequence of his schizophrenic illness, belief that the victim was having an affair and his daughter did not belong to him, acute depression and the destabilising effects of the drugs he had been abusing over the previous 2-3 months. – AB 117

her Honour somewhat surprisingly went on to remark that Dr Furst did not state that there was a relationship between the Applicant’s mental illness and the offence apart from observing that he was most likely impulsive and mentally disordered at the time.


	
	Later her Honour observed:-
	


While I accept, therefore, that from time to time, Mr Turner abused substances and did not take his medication, I cannot find a causal connection between those facts and the commission of this offence, taking into account the degree of planning involved and the actions that he took before and after the offence. The complainant did not observe him to be significantly intoxicated, and he did not suggest he was experiencing any psychosis at the time of offending. – AB 35.8


	
	Elsewhere her Honour remarked that the Applicant’s moral culpability was mildly diminished by his apparently unmedicated mental illness or depression.
	
	
	Syme DCJ also observed:-
	


The offender complained to Dr Furst that he [had] not seen a psychiatrist [for] 12 months and receives little medication. Despite his complaints, he reported that he is taking Amisulpride and Zoloft. Reportedly he is doing well in custody on this medication. This is contradicted in the clinical notes, which observe that Mr Turner is refusing both his medication and mental health professional visits. He is not exhibiting signs of mental illness, but has been noted to be aggressive and uncooperative. (sic) – AB 35.1


	
	Based on the clinical notes to which I have referred her Honour concluded that the Applicant, though aware of the diagnosis of schizophrenia, chose not to take the medication prescribed for him and that his mental illness could be managed when he chose it to be. Her Honour observed that the Applicant was not exhibiting signs of mental illness but had been noted to be aggressive and uncooperative. She declined to make a finding that the Applicant would suffer more from incarceration due to his mental illness and recorded doubts whether the Applicant would comply with any mental health treatment plan on his release.
	
	
	These findings of her Honour reflected challenges that had had been made to the Applicant on a number of topics including his use of psychiatric and physiotherapy services and the taking of medication, his ability to walk and need for a wheelchair and the restrictions that being on protection involved. There was no challenge however to what Dr Furst had said concerning the Applicant’s childhood (substantially set out in [18] above) or the Applicant’s own evidence on the topic. Included in that evidence was that his childhood was:-
	


“Very violent and sexually, physically, mentally”. (sic) His father kept coming to the house and bashing his mother, putting her into a coma. He remembers his father coming into the house and stabbing his mother and her relatives. He himself also suffered violence from his mother and stepfather.


	
	Other evidence given by the Applicant and which was not the subject of challenge was that he had a history of self-harm extending back to when he first went to gaol when he was 18. A Concord Hospital “Discharge Referral” of October 2011, included in the documents emanating from Justice Health RSH, records that the Applicant “has had many self harm attempts”.
	
	
	Her Honour opined that the Applicant’s willingness to engage in therapy both for his mental illness and to modify his sexual and violent offending is in doubt and concluded that she was not of the view that the Applicant’s paralysis can be taken into account as an ameliorating factor when considering his risk of offending. Her Honour added:-
	


My finding is that even if his risk of re offending generally is in the moderate range, if he regains the use of his legs that risk will increase. His animosity to the complainant and indeed members of her family, who he has previously threatened to kill, together with the child is a major concern.


	
	Further conclusions at which her Honour arrived included the following:-
	


(i)   The Applicant had shown no remorse.

(ii)   The Applicant had poor prospects of rehabilitation and while his criminal record was not aggravating, it deprived him of leniency.

(iii)   The Applicant is manipulative and aggressive and has been uncooperative with all assistance offered in custody from health attendees.

(iv)   During the proceedings the Applicant manifested extreme hostility towards SE, he has expressed threats to kill SE’s family and her child and his animosity towards SE is a major concern.

(v)   The Applicant’s mental illness justified a finding of special circumstances.

2011 Proceedings – Quadriplegia


	
	One topic to which considerable attention was given was whether after his arrest the Applicant had developed quadriplegia.
	
	
	Included in the Applicant’s evidence were statements to the effect that after finding out that SE was cheating on him, that his father was terminally ill and that he was going back to gaol for hitting SE he tried to commit suicide by overdosing on a variety of drugs, he lost consciousness and when he woke up in hospital he was handcuffed and unable to walk. He said that he had been unable to walk since, needing a wheelchair to move around.
	
	
	It was accepted that the Applicant’s claimed inability to use his legs was not supported by general medical opinion which found no physical cause for the apparent paraplegia. In the clinical notes produced from Justice Health the Applicant is recorded on 28/2/10 (which may be a misprint for 2012) as saying he had started to feel pain in his legs and was able to move his big toe in his right foot. Notes of 9 March 2012 record that he is getting sensation back in his toe and feet and had moved his right toe “today”. Syme DCJ recorded that the Applicant had fully functioning reflexes on testing and had been observed moving his feet independently.
	
	
	Addressing the Applicant’s apparent paraplegia, and assuming it was genuine, Dr Furst expressed the view that the Applicant suffered from a conversion disorder which he explained:-
	


Conversion disorder is thought to be a psychogenic physical manifestation of internal distress and/or conflicts. In the absence of any neurological diagnosis accounting for his paralysis, a conversion disorder is the most likely cause of his paralysis over the last 2 years, which has left Mr Turner wheelchair bound and highly disabled.


	
	Although the relevant evidence is not before this Court in her remarks Syme DCJ observed that Dr Furst had also said that he “could not rule out the possibility of malingering” though if the Applicant was malingering it had gone on for an unusually long time. During the hearing before this Court it was not suggested Dr Furst had not made these remarks.
	
	
	Her Honour did not make a finding that the Applicant was malingering but recorded that whether the cause of the Applicant’s apparent paraplegia be conversion disorder or malingering the Applicant was expected to improve and any physical limitations he had would self-correct. She said that she was not of the view that his paralysis could be taken into account as an ameliorating factor when considering his risk of reoffending.
	


2011 Proceedings – Protection


	
	Syme DCJ recorded that the Applicant had been placed in protection following a complaint of assault but that more recently Corrective Services no longer recommended protection. Her Honour continued:-
	


He is now in protection at his request. When confronted with this at the sentencing hearing, he said that he requested protective custody because he was known in the gaol as being in protection and was housed with sex offenders, thus he felt in danger. This explanation does not make sense.

2009 and 2011 Proceedings – Recent Affidavits


	
	During the hearing of the applications a number of affidavits were read on the usual basis, viz. that they are irrelevant to the issue of error by the sentencing judges but are relevant to any issue of re-sentence. One was from a Ms Betteridge that revealed that the Applicant had refused to supply urine in February 2014, failed to comply with prison routine in April 2014, and committed assaults in September 2014 and April 2015. None of the offences were bad although details of the September assault are worth recounting.
	
	
	A nurse attended on the Applicant’s cell with medication. She refused to give it to him unless he stood up. He refused, saying he could not and when she sought to leave he threw a cup of water at her.
	
	
	An affidavit from the Applicant was also read. He said that prison staff insisted he could walk and his wheelchair was taken away on 15 August 2014. Then he had to crawl to use the toilet or shower and missed appointments. He was moved to Junee Correctional Centre in January 2015. He began to regain feelings in his legs just before then and soon after arriving at Junee regained the ability to walk. After June 2015 and feeling safer because he was not in a wheelchair he elected to move to a less restrictive form of protection and has availed himself of facilities, including the gaol chess group and choir. He says since being in custody that he has been taking his prescribed medication, Amulsulpride for schizophrenia, Zoloft for depression, Zoccor for high cholesterol and magnesium tablets for cramps.
	
	
	The Applicant said that since moving to Junee he has completed a number of courses and since August 2015 he has been working as a painter. He has also put his name down to participate in the CUBIT program.
	
	
	The Applicant said that until 4 months prior to moving to Junee he was kept in his cell for 23 hours a day. Thereafter at the MRRC he was allowed out for 3 hours each day.
	
	
	Ms Betteridge also referred to a case plan dated 30 June 2015 which involved the Applicant being offered education but that he did not express interest in participating in any TAFE programs.
	


2011 Proceedings – Ground 1

The sentencing Judge failed to take into account the evidence of the Applicant’s disadvantaged background, which was relevant to his mental health and his moral culpability.


	
	This ground is made out. All her Honour said concerning the Applicant’s family history was:-
	


Other information I have from the report is that he is now 31 years of age. There is no evidence of any current family connection or support. Clearly he has a mother who he told the complainant he intended to go and stay with and there was some information in relation to his father, who is now deceased. His education and training status is unclear and has been diagnosed with a mental illness for some time.


	
	Having regard to the evidence that there was before her Honour, this was quite inadequate reference to, and consideration of, the topic. Nor are her Honour’s remarks as to the Applicant’s reliability a sufficient explanation for not saying more. As I indicated the Applicant was not challenged on Dr Furst’s or the Applicant’s own account of his upbringing.
	
	
	I have set out above some of Dr Furst’s views as to the significance of the Applicant’s childhood. Indeed one hardly needs evidence that exposure and subjection to appreciable violence while a child is likely to have lasting and detrimental impacts. And it would be surprising if parents who practised such violence ever inculcated in their children proper standards of self-control, resilience in the face of adversity, and as to the treatment of others.
	
	
	These factors were quite separate from, and additional to, the Applicant’s schizophrenia and were and are required to be taken into account in the sentencing of the Applicant. They were not.
	


2011 Proceedings – Ground 2

The sentencing Judge erred in her consideration of the circumstances of the Applicant’s protective custody, and in not taking this into account on sentence as a matter of mitigation.


	
	I would uphold this ground also.
	
	
	Contrary to her Honour’s view it is notorious that being on protection generally carries a stigma that the person was there for conduct anathema to the general prison population, sometimes for offences against children – see R v Burchell (1987) 34 A Crim R 148; R v Totten [2003] NSWCCA 207 – but commonly because the person is thought to be a “dog” or informer. Persons who have been on protection are not given any presumption of innocence by the rest of the prison population and accordingly it is quite understandable that the Applicant may feel the need to remain on protection. In these circumstances, it is not unlikely that the Applicant will remain on some form of protection. That said, there are many degrees of it and the change in type which has already occurred demonstrates that it is in the highest degree unlikely that the Applicant will continue to suffer the same degree of restriction in the future as he has in the past.
	
	
	In that connection the Applicant gave evidence before Syme DCJ that, except for the not infrequent days when there was a lockdown and prisoners were confined to their cells all day, he was normally allowed out of his cell for only 2 hours per day. He said that this has continued since about May 2012.
	
	
	The uncertainty as to the nature of the conditions of future incarceration obviously made difficult any determination of what impact it should have on the length of the sentence to be imposed but, that said, protection is a factor that commonly arises and one that the Applicant was entitled to have taken into account.
	


2011 Proceedings – Ground 3

The sentencing Judge erred in not taking into account on sentence as a matter in mitigation the Applicant’s paralysis and confinement to a wheelchair during his two and a half year period of incarceration.


	
	I would not uphold this ground. As a factor in mitigation, the onus of establishing the ground, and the facts that underlay it, was on the Applicant. In the circumstances of the case this involved the Applicant showing that, on the balance of probabilities, the wheelchair was necessary and not the result of him malingering.
	
	
	Relevant in this regard were numerous findings of her Honour. She observed that “the history given by Mr Turner is unreliable” and contrasted his complaints about being unable to access psychiatric and psychological support with medical records that were in evidence. Her Honour noted another inconsistency between a complaint of Mr Turner to the effect a broken wheelchair was not replaced and the content of clinical notes. She remarked also on inconsistencies between accounts given to Dr Furst by Mr Turner as to the circumstances of his offence and treatment in custody with other evidence. She described other of Mr Turner’s evidence as “vague and contradictory”. She described Mr Turner as “manipulative and aggressive”.
	
	
	While undoubtedly some of her Honour’s remarks were directed towards the future, many had application to the past and though it appeared that the Applicant had not walked and had availed himself of a wheelchair for 2 years or so, it is clear that the Applicant did not satisfy the onus he bore on the topic of this ground.
	


2011 Proceedings – Ground 4

The sentencing Judge erred in misapprehending the maximum penalty in relation to the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.


	
	Subject to remarks made later under this ground, the ground also should be upheld. Syme DCJ stated that the maximum period of imprisonment prescribed for assault occasioning actual bodily harm is 7 years. As I have already indicated, the maximum period of imprisonment prescribed is 5 years not 7 years as stated by her Honour.
	
	
	Although there are cases where it has been held that an erroneous statement as to the maximum penalty does not, of itself warrant another sentence in law – see e.g. Des Rosiers v R [2006] NSWCCA 16; 159 A Crim R 549 at [20]; Smith v R [2007] NSWCCA 138 at [34]; R v Couch-Clarke [2010] NSWCCA 288 at [39] – the maximum penalty is one of the guideposts to which sentencing judge are required have regard in imposing a sentence – Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120; [2011] HCA 39 at [27]. I would not readily infer a sentencing judge’s reference to it was not a factor taken into account and, if misstated, not something that influenced the sentence for that offence.
	
	
	However, I would not uphold a further submission that flowed from this ground, viz. that the error was liable to have influenced her Honour in the sentences she imposed for the offences the subject of the second, third and fourth charges. There is simply no basis for contending that the error the subject of this ground was not confined in its operation to the sentence imposed for the offence of assault.
	
	
	However, in her remarks her Honour said:-
	


Finally, I propose to order that the AOABH charge be served concurrently with the attempted sex assault offence, as that offence forms part of the circumstances of the sexual offences.


	
	In these circumstances, the sentence imposed for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm had no practical effect and I would refuse to grant leave to appeal against it.
	


2011 Proceedings – Ground 5

The sentencing Judge erred in her consideration of accumulation in relation to the sentence imposed by her Honour English DCJ.


	
	All her Honour said on the topic of accumulation was as follows:-
	


Mr Turner was sentenced to a period in custody for assault occasioning actual bodily harm a non-parole period to date from 17 April 2011, which was due to expire on 14 March 2013. He has therefore been in custody solely on this matter from 14 March 2013. He has now also been sentenced for the intimidation of the complainant relative to the events of 11 March 2011, to which I have referred above. As I have specifically referred to the 11 March offences as forming part of the narrative for the threats that were part of these offences, no accumulation is appropriate. In relation to these charges, there will be some accumulation, but noting a course of conduct over a period of hours, the accumulation will be moderate. Finally, I propose to order that the AOABH charge be served concurrently with the attempted sex assault offence, as that offence forms part of the circumstances of the sexual offences.


	
	There would seem to have been no evidence before her Honour as to the sentence imposed for the 11 March 2011 events. Her reason for making the sentences she imposed concurrent with that sentence provide no explanation as to why her sentences were made entirely cumulative to those imposed by English DCJ and her Honour otherwise provided no reasons for this occurring.
	
	
	Of course, one possibility is that her Honour thought that the concurrency that was reflected in her sentence was sufficient but this is contradicted by her remarks that I have quoted above.
	
	
	It is highly unusual to simply aggregate sentences without reference to totality. However Syme DCJ made no reference to that topic and provided no reasons why the sentences she imposed should simply be accumulated on the effective non-parole period imposed by English DCJ.
	
	
	General principles of totality lead to the conclusion that her Honour erred.
	


2011 proceedings – Ground 6

The individual sentences and the effective sentence are manifestly excessive


	
	The conclusions at which I have arrived in respect of Grounds 1 and 2 make it unnecessary for me to pursue this ground. Kentwell v The Queen (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37 requires that I consider de novo the sentences appropriate for the Applicant’s offending. Of course in doing so I must accord due regard to her Honour’s primary findings.
	
	
	Undoubtedly a determination of appropriate sentences in this case is difficult. On the one side are the serious nature of the Applicant’s offending, the fact of four offences, the statutory guides and in particular the 10 years non-parole period, his criminal record, Syme DCJ’s findings as to the Applicant’s prospects of re-offending and the risk he poses to the complainant and her relatives. On the other are his upbringing and mental health although insofar as these argue for the possibility that he will continue to be a danger to the complainant or the community generally they do not operate only in the direction of leniency. Also arguing for lesser sentences are the Applicant’s previous achievement in redeeming himself and making positive efforts at Junee.
	
	
	The above list is not of course exhaustive. There was the impact on the complainant to which Syme DCJ adverted and I have referred to other factors above. I have paid attention to the Remarks on Sentence that have been canvassed and the dozens of pages of written and oral submissions advanced in the proceedings.
	
	
	One factor to which I have given no weight is the previous sexual relationship between SE and the Applicant. That such a relationship is entitled to weight in some circumstances is clear – NM v R [2012] NSWCCA 215 – but the luring of SE to the premises and the violent nature of what then transpired make the approach recognised in NM inappropriate.
	
	
	The Applicant’s actions preparatory to the offences committed in April 2011 led Syme DCJ to reject Dr Furst’s opinion that the Applicant was psychotic. On the other hand, nor could his mental faculties be regarded as close to normal. While jealousy inspired by a belief that the victim was having an affair and that his daughter did not belong to him may have had aspects of rationality, cutting himself with a knife and inviting the victim to push the knife into his chest did not, at least unless induced by major depression. Experience shows that many with schizophrenia do cease to take their medication and that fact should not be weighed too heavily against the Applicant. Particularly is that so when it appears that the medication prescribed at that stage had side effects that the Applicant found unpleasant.
	
	
	When to the Applicant’s mental disability is added the impact of his upbringing, the Applicant’s offending is not to be judged by normal standards.
	
	
	If the Applicant was malingering on the issue of paraplegia, it must have been demonstrated to him by now that doing so does not work and he has made life more difficult for himself. It is now over 5 years since the offences and 3 years since his trial so there has been a significant amount of time for his feelings toward the victim to moderate and at some time he does have to be released. His actions at Junee to some extent echo the efforts to improve himself that occurred before the offence dealt with by English DCJ.
	
	
	In these circumstances it seems to me that, in lieu of the sentences imposed by Syme DCJ, appropriate sentences for the sexual intercourse offences are concurrent terms of imprisonment for 8 years including non-parole periods of 5 years and for the attempted intercourse offence imprisonment for a fixed term of 4 years, and involving 9 months accumulation. On grounds of totality, I would commence the earliest of these sentences 4 months before the non-parole period of the sentence for what I may call the English DCJ offences concludes. The result will be that the Applicant will have an effective total non-parole period of 6 years and 2 months and a total sentence 3 years longer.
	
	
	Accordingly,
	


In respect of Proceedings 2009/00058502:

(i)   Grant leave to appeal in respect of the sentence imposed for assault occasioning actual bodily harm;

(ii)   Allow the appeal in respect of that sentence;

(iii)   Quash that sentence, and in lieu;

(iv)   Sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 9 months commencing on 17 April 2011 together with a further term of 3 months;

(v)   Refuse leave to appeal in respect of the sentence imposed for intentionally damaging property.

In respect of Proceedings 2011/00142641:

(i)   Grant leave to appeal in respect of the sentences imposed for the offences of attempting to have aggravated sexual intercourse and having aggravated sexual intercourse;

(ii)   Allow the appeal in respect of those sentences;

(iii)   Quash those sentences and in lieu;

(iv)   In respect of the offence of attempted aggravated sexual intercourse, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for a fixed term of 4 years commencing on 17 September 2011;

(v)   In respect of each of the offences of aggravated sexual intercourse, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 17 June 2012 together with a further term of 3 years commencing on 17 June 2017;

(vi)   Refuse leave to appeal in respect of the sentence imposed for assault occasioning actual bodily harm;

(vii)   Record as the date upon which it appears to the Court that the Applicant shall be eligible for parole, 17 June 2017.

2700956,R v Haines; R v Lee [2016] NSWSC 1333,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Lloyd Edward Haines and Michael Lee have each pleaded guilty to the murder of Daniel McNulty and to the armed robbery with wounding of Brett Fitzgerald on 10 August 2014. Mr Haines entered pleas of guilty to these offences on 21 June 2016. Mr Lee had done so on 16 June 2016. Those pleas were entered in anticipation of a joint trial that was scheduled to commence on 20 June 2016. The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 20 years. The maximum penalty for armed robbery with wounding is 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years.
	
	
	Each offender is now to be sentenced for the offences to which he has pleaded guilty in accordance with a detailed set of agreed facts. Those facts are as follows.
	


Agreed facts


	
	Daniel McNulty and Brett Fitzgerald lived in a unit in Walker Street, Redfern. It was on the ground floor of a multi-block unit complex that contained many such units. Mr McNulty and Mr Fitzgerald had known each other for more than 18 months but had only shared the same premises for about 2 weeks before the commission of the offences that are the subject of these proceedings. Both men were known to supply drugs from their unit.
	
	
	Mr Haines was dependent on methamphetamine. He had purchased drugs from the Walker Street unit on a couple of occasions before, and had on one occasion gone there acting aggressively to complain about the quality of the drugs that he had purchased. Mr Haines was a friend of Mr Lee who was himself also a drug user. As at 10 August 2014, Mr Lee had been going out with Harriet Wran for approximately 2 weeks. That evening Mr Lee and Ms Wran arranged to meet Mr Haines at Redfern. The three of them went to various units in the Walker Street complex looking to buy drugs. They were unsuccessful.
	
	
	The three of them then approached the unit occupied by Mr McNulty and Mr Fitzgerald. Mr Lee and Ms Wran did not know these men. Mr Haines told Mr Lee that Mr McNulty supplied drugs, that he had previously had dealings with these men at their unit and that it was unlikely that they would let Mr Haines into the unit or sell him drugs.
	
	
	Some time after reaching the unit, Mr Haines, Mr Lee and Ms Wran formed an intention to rob the occupants of drugs and money. Ms Wran knocked on the door. Mr McNulty told her to go to a side window. She did so. She then went back to the front door and knocked again. Mr McNulty said, “Don’t worry, it’s just a girl”. Mr McNulty then let Ms Wran into the unit. At that time Mr McNulty and Mr Fitzgerald were both in the lounge room near the front door.
	
	
	Mr Lee and Mr Haines immediately entered the unit. It was only then that the occupants became aware of their presence with Ms Wran. Mr Lee was in possession of a knife. Mr Haines had his head covered with a balaclava. A violent struggle then occurred involving the offenders and the occupants. It was in the course of this struggle that Mr Lee fatally stabbed Mr McNulty and also stabbed Mr Fitzgerald. Mr Haines hit Mr Fitzgerald with a hammer that he found at the unit.
	
	
	During the course of the robbery the offenders found a small amount of drugs and approximately $650 in cash. After leaving the unit, Mr Lee and Ms Wran separated from Mr Haines and all three left the area.
	
	
	Following their departure, Mr Fitzgerald checked on Mr McNulty who was unresponsive. He called an ambulance. Mr Fitzgerald was himself treated by ambulance officers and taken to hospital. Mr McNulty was later discovered in the unit deceased. He had suffered fatal stab wounds to his back and chest, as well as his left thigh. Mr Fitzgerald was found to have sustained five stab wounds and lacerations to his head requiring surgery.
	
	
	Mr Haines was arrested whilst reporting to a police station on 12 August 2014. Mr Lee was arrested at Liverpool the following day. Mr Haines was interviewed by police and denied his involvement in these events. Mr Lee was interviewed more than once and initially denied his involvement as well. He later told police that he had gone to the unit to buy drugs with the others but was attacked by the victims and so acted in self-defence.
	
	
	It is accepted that the pleas of guilty to murder are based upon the concept of constructive murder. Mr Lee’s act of stabbing Mr McNulty causing his death occurred during the commission by him and Mr Haines and Ms Wran of the armed robbery with wounding.
	
	
	The agreed facts upon the basis of which Mr Lee and Mr Haines are to be sentenced differ slightly. The differences appear to be insignificant for sentencing purposes. I have combined the agreed facts in the preceding summary but I have sentenced each offender only upon the basis of the facts individually referable to them.
	
	
	Lest there be any doubt about it, I note that, in the case of Mr Haines, it is agreed between him and the Crown that his liability for the murder of Mr McNulty is constructive murder arising from the following fundamental facts:
	



	
	The foundational offence was armed robbery with wounding.
	
	
	The plan to commit the robbery only came into being very shortly before Mr Haines, Mr Lee and Ms Wran arrived at the door of the victims’ unit.
	
	
	It was not until about that time that Mr Haines first became aware that Mr Lee was in possession of a knife.
	
	
	There was never any intention that the knife would be used although Mr Haines was aware of the possibility that it might be.
	
	
	Mr Haines did not foresee the possibility that Mr Lee would use the knife to inflict injury upon or kill any person inside the unit.
	
	
	Mr Haines did not strike blows that caused Mr McNulty’s death.
	
	
	Having regard to the evidence, the possibility foreseen by Mr Haines was that Mr Lee might brandish the knife as some sort of threat to overcome any resistance that may have been encountered to a demand for money and/or drugs.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	Mr Lee stabbed Mr McNulty during the course of the aggravated robbery, causing his death. The Crown does not allege and does not need to establish any particular intent with which the fatal blow was inflicted by Mr Lee. The mortal wound occurred during the commission of the aggravated robbery offence. Mr Lee is liable as he struck the fatal blow with a knife. Mr Haines is liable for the death of Mr McNulty upon the basis of his participation in the joint foundational robbery offence during which the act causing death occurred and his contemplation of Mr Lee’s use of the knife during the robbery.
	
	
	In R v Jacobs and Mehajer (2004) 151 A Crim R 452; [2004] NSWCCA 462, Wood CJ at CL said this at [332]-[333]:
	


“[332] Constructive murder is not to be regarded as less serious, and thereby attracting a lighter total sentence or non-parole period than that which is appropriate for other categories of murder: R v Mills NSWCCA 3 April 1995. Just as is the case for the other categories, there are degrees of seriousness of constructive murder, and the determination of the appropriate sentence for any individual offence depends upon the nature of the offender’s conduct and the part which he or she played in the events giving rise to death: R v JB [1999] NSWCCA 93.

[333] On any view this was a very serious case of constructive murder, being one in which three men went to the cafe with the intention of carrying out a robbery, where very significant violence was inflicted, where a knife was used and where the victims were callously abandoned at the premises.”


	
	To a similar effect, Adams J in Raad v R [2011] NSWCCA 138 referred with approval at [12] to the trial judge’s description of the seriousness of the offence:
	


“[12] In respect of the seriousness of the crime, his Honour said –

‘16 The relative seriousness of any crime depends on its own facts and does not depend on some general categorisation. While it is difficult to imagine a murder that involves the requisite intention being less serious than the least serious felony murder, this is not in the category of least serious felony murder. Mr Raad intended to commit an armed robbery. He did so with a loaded gun. He had loaded the gun shortly before the robbery and had his finger on the trigger when he pulled the gun out from his belt.

17 Even though I am not satisfied that he intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, he must have understood that committing an armed robbery with a loaded gun, having the safety catch off the weapon and having his finger on the trigger could foreseeably result in serious injury, if not death. The seriousness of the offence, including the armed robbery, must be measured against the regime that existed at the time of the commission of the offence, namely, in 2001.’”


	
	Buddin J added the following comments at [75]:
	


“…Notwithstanding the primary judge’s conclusion that the applicant did not intend to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the victim, this was nonetheless an objectively serious example of the offence of murder…”


	
	There are certainly varying degrees of constructive murder: see R v JB; R v RJH [1999] NSWCCA 93 per Stein JA at [33] as follows:
	


“[33] I think it is correct to say that there are degrees of seriousness of felony murder, just as any other serious crime. The starting point was for the judge to determine the objective gravity of the crime. This depends, for the most part, on the nature of the actual acts of the offender which played a part in the death of the victim. His Honour’s finding that the applicant participated in an attack on the deceased with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm on him does not elevate the felony murder into another class of murder. His Honour had to assess the material before him, including the evidence of the applicant, in order to consider what was an appropriate sentence. It is conceded by the applicant that in doing so the judge is entitled to take into account the infliction of grievous bodily harm, but not the intention to inflict it. In light of the facts of this case, it seems to be a distinction without a difference. It is necessary to analyse the conduct involved to ascertain the degree of moral culpability. Even assuming that his Honour was wrong, and I am not convinced of this, it is difficult to see that a re-sentencing would make any difference. Nor do I accept that it has been established that RJH was denied procedural fairness in giving evidence on his plea. I do not see that it can be concluded that his Honour passed sentence on the applicant on the basis of a different factual substratum than that required by the charge of felony murder.”


	
	The Crown contended that the present case is an objectively serious case of constructive murder, in which Mr Lee entered the unit armed with a knife intending to rob Mr McNulty who he then killed in his own home by stabbing him to effect the robbery. Mr Haines entered the unit for the same joint criminal purpose. Mr Haines was aware that Mr Lee had the knife. Mr Haines participated in the joint robbery, inflicting wounds to Mr Fitzgerald. Mr Haines is liable for murder upon the basis of the actions of Mr Lee committed during the foundational offence.
	
	
	The Crown contended that the taking of a human life while in pursuit of the unlawful obtaining of drugs and money constitutes an offence that deserves severe punishment.
	
	
	With respect to the armed robbery with wounding, the Crown similarly contended that the foundational offence was an objectively serious example of aggravated robbery. Both offenders are jointly liable for the invasion of Mr McNulty’s home on a Saturday evening. Both were equally involved in the robbery, the motivation for which was the obtaining of drugs and money. In the face of resistance from the occupants of the unit, the offenders chose not to retreat but instead resorted to the use of weapons to overcome it. Each offender is responsible for having created the dangerous risk to the occupants that resulted in the death of Mr McNulty and the serious wounding of Mr Fitzgerald, even though only Mr Lee struck the blows that killed Mr McNulty. Neither offender sought personally to render assistance to the victims or to summon help for them from others.
	
	
	With respect to both offences, the Crown submitted that the offences were objectively serious but that they fell just below the mid-range. The planning of the robbery offence was minimal, neither offender went to the unit with an intention to kill or even to inflict grievous bodily harm and the killing was not premeditated. The offenders certainly had an opportunity to retreat rather than to continue with the robbery and to inflict violence and they left the victims seriously wounded with no apparent regard for their welfare.
	
	
	Mr Lee submitted that the offences were below the mid-range of objective seriousness. There was an absence of significant planning of any type. The intention to rob was formed after reaching the victims’ unit. It was conceded that Mr Lee’s use of the knife set him apart from his co-offender even though he did not plan originally to use it.
	
	
	Mr Haines submitted to a like effect. His initial motivation was to purchase drugs. The plan to rob emerged in effect at the last minute. The robbery offence escalated quickly and unexpectedly. Mr Haines’ knowledge that Mr Lee had a knife extended only to an appreciation of the fact that there was a possibility it might be brandished in the robbery without actual foresight that Mr Lee would actually use it to inflict an injury. Mr Haines had also expected that there would be very little resistance offered by the occupants upon the basis of his previous experience with them.
	
	
	As I indicated in my remarks on sentence in R v Wran [2016] NSWSC 1015, the facts also reveal that there was initially not even a plan to rob. Once entry to the unit had been gained, the robbery escalated well beyond the scope of the offence to which each offender was a party. Indeed, it escalated unexpectedly and quickly in a manner that neither offender anticipated or foresaw.
	
	
	I accept that the relevant absence of planning in this case reliably informs the level of objective seriousness of these offences. Mr Lee and Mr Haines attended the victims’ unit in the confident expectation that by threat of force rather than its use, together with the advantage of surprise, they could secure their objective of stealing drugs and money from unarmed and compliant individuals. So deficient was the original plan that the prospect of any genuine resistance seems never to have been contemplated. The fact that it developed at all was completely contrary to Mr Haines’ original confident prediction.
	
	
	It is trite to observe that neither of these offences would have been committed if the offenders had not gone to the apartment with the intent to rob in the first place or had sensibly and quickly retreated from that plan when Mr McNulty and Mr Fitzgerald refused to cooperate with it in the second place. That needs to be borne in mind throughout, as well as the callous disregard for their victims, apparent from the fact that the offenders left the scene with concerns only for their own apprehension. However, in the scheme of criminal conduct of this type, the offences have not been made more serious by the existence of a conscious intention to kill or inflict serious injury. They have also not been made more serious by the uncontrolled manner in which the events escalated in the circumstances, to what the Crown accepts to have been the offenders’ surprise. The Crown has neither proved nor sought to establish that Mr Lee intended to kill or to inflict serious injury upon Mr McNulty. He and Mr Haines are each guilty of murder notwithstanding. But the objective seriousness of their offending is less than if such an intention were evident.
	
	
	In my opinion, these are serious offences but they nevertheless fall below the mid-range of objective seriousness for offences of their type.
	


Subjective circumstances

Mr Lee


	
	Mr Lee was born in August 1979. He is currently 37 years of age. He is one of four children of South Korean parents who came to Australia when he was three years old. His parents separated when he was 17 years old. Mr Lee had a distant relationship with his father, who was a businessman who travelled overseas for most of the year. Mr Lee rarely had any contact with his father, who used physical punishment as discipline from time to time. Mr Lee became used to the fact that he was distant from his father. His parents’ separation resulted from his father’s unexplained departure leaving his mother in considerable debt. Mr Lee had a positive relationship with his mother who he described, in a report to Danielle Hopkins, a psychologist, dated 24 September 2012, as a “good, traditional” Korean woman.
	
	
	Mr Lee has a significant criminal history, dating back to his early teens. He has spent several periods in custody throughout his adolescence and adulthood. Offences for which Mr Lee has been imprisoned include aggravated break and enter, larceny, obtain money by deception, possess prohibited drugs, possess safe breaking implements, use false instrument with intent and deal with the proceeds of crime, among others.
	
	
	Mr Lee would appear to have been an above average student academically but had difficulties adjusting to school. He was suspended on two occasions for fighting in primary school and expelled in year 7 for the same thing. He did not complete his high school education. He completed two years of an apprenticeship as a chef. He has no children.
	
	
	Mr Lee began to consume alcohol on a regular basis from 12 to 16 years of age. He has been a daily cannabis user since the age of 12 years. He began to smoke heroin at the age of 13. This became a daily habit. He also used cocaine, becoming an intravenous user of cocaine at 18 years of age. He abused various prescription drugs such as Xanax and Rohypnol, which he used as sleeping aids between the ages of 15 and 33. He also used methamphetamine. He developed chronic difficulties with poly-substance abuse. Mr Lee had not, by 2012 at least, had contact with any mental health professionals or received a diagnosis of mental illness or been prescribed any psychotropic medication. I have not been provided with an updated psychological report taking account of any changes that might have occurred since 2012, or any information particularly taking into account Mr Lee’s position or mental state since his arrest for the present offences.
	
	
	By his own account, Mr Lee has led a life entirely consumed by his addiction to drugs and criminal behaviour directly and indirectly associated with it.
	


Mr Haines


	
	In the case of Mr Haines, I was provided with a current psychological assessment in the form of a report from Dr Susan Pulman, psychologist, dated 31 August 2016.
	
	
	Mr Haines was born in April 1985 and is currently 31 years of age. He is the eldest of five children. He has a significant history of substance dependence including heroin and cocaine as well as alcohol from his early teenage years. His childhood was difficult due to domestic violence and being raised by his mother who was by reason of mental illness unable to care for her children. He spent time in foster care. He had a troublesome relationship with his father who was himself substance dependent. Mr Haines was raised in a setting where substance abuse and antisocial lifestyles were normal. He developed problematic behaviours from a young age and lacked direction and guidance throughout childhood and adolescence. He was expelled from school in year 7 and quickly became substance dependent. He has only ever worked sporadically.
	
	
	Mr Haines has an overall Full Scale IQ within the Borderline range in the Low Average to Average level of functioning. His working and information processing speed were found by Dr Pulman to be significantly abnormal relative to his other cognitive abilities. He has impairments in memory, visuospatial ability, planning and organising as well as mental flexibility, most likely due to traumatic brain injury and acquired brain injury from chronic long term intravenous use of heroin and cocaine and binge drinking. He requires ongoing psychiatric review and treatment.
	
	
	Mr Haines has a criminal history dating from 1997 in the Children’s Court. He has been imprisoned for aggravated break, enter and steal offences and stealing on a number of occasions. His criminal record does not contain any offences similar to either of the current offences. His only convictions for offences involving violence of any sort are for either assaulting or resisting police officers in the execution of their duty, for which sentences of imprisonment were imposed.
	


Pleas of guilty


	
	The Crown conceded that the late pleas of guilty in each case by Mr Lee and Mr Haines were of some utilitarian value. The pleas were only days apart. The Crown contended that Mr Lee’s plea should attract a discount of no more than 15 percent and that Mr Haines’ plea should attract a discount of no more than 10 percent.
	
	
	It does not seem to me that the relative timing of the pleas provides any reliable basis for distinguishing their value. In the case of Mr Haines it is apparent that, for reasons associated with his ability to appreciate or comprehend the basis of his liability for murder in the circumstances of this case, having regard to the fact that he committed no physical act that caused or contributed directly to Mr McNulty’s death, some delays were suffered before this could be adequately explained and before he was able finally to understand his correct legal position. The same cannot be said for Mr Lee. However, in the final result a trial of some moderate complexity was avoided, together with the associated benefits to prospective jurors and witnesses, with the simultaneous general facilitation of the course of justice. A discount of 15 percent in Mr Lee’s case seems to me accurately to reflect the proper value of his plea. In Mr Haines’ case, I consider that a discount of 17.5 percent is appropriate as it is also necessary specifically to include in that discount an additional discount to reflect the limited value of his offer to assist the authorities. This is referred to next.
	


Offers of assistance


	
	After their pleas were entered, each offender offered assistance to the Crown in the remaining case against their co-offender Ms Wran. Mr Haines agreed to provide a statement and to be interviewed by the Crown. The statement was provided to Ms Wran’s lawyers. Mr Haines’ assistance was not utilised by the Crown in the prosecution of its case against her.
	
	
	Mr Lee made a later and conditional offer to provide assistance. The offer was not considered by the Crown.
	
	
	The evaluation of offers of assistance is covered by ss 22 and 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It was contended on Mr Haines’ behalf that the Crown not only took a statement from him but apparently considered it to have been of sufficient value to serve it on Ms Wran’s lawyers. That occurred before Ms Wran finally entered her plea of guilty. Mr Haines submitted that it would in those circumstances be appropriate to conclude that the assistance offered had some contributing impact upon negotiations between the Crown and Ms Wran and her ultimate decision to plead guilty.
	
	
	Unfortunately, the evidence does not permit me to decide whether or not Mr Haines’ offer of assistance was of any utility to the Crown, given its timing and content. The Crown was by then in negotiations with Ms Wran’s lawyers and the offer of assistance was in part, at least, in conflict with other evidence upon which the Crown proposed to rely. There is in the circumstances also no suggestion that Mr Haines’ custodial conditions will reflect his willingness to assist.
	
	
	The Crown somewhat generously submitted that Mr Haines would in the circumstances be entitled to some small discount for this offer of assistance in addition to his pleas. Notwithstanding that concession, I have some difficulty accepting that any significant discount should apply. At the heart of a consideration of the value of an offer of assistance must at least be the hypothetical utility of the assistance that is offered. I have no material upon the basis of which to make any such assessment in this case. In so saying I accept and understand that it is not the case that offers of assistance that are not taken up, or which do not ultimately prove to be useful, are to be given very little or no weight: see, for example, what was said by Hunt and Badgery-Parker JJ in R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 252-3 as follows:
	


“It is clearly in the public interest that offenders should be encouraged to supply information to the authorities which will assist them to bring other offenders to justice, and to give evidence against those other offenders in relation to whom they have given such information.

…

Again, in order to ensure that such encouragement is given, the reward for providing assistance should be granted if the offender has genuinely cooperated with the authorities whether or not the information supplied objectively turns out in fact to have been effective. The information which he gives must be such as could significantly assist the authorities.”


	
	However, as the emphasised word in that passage suggests, at least some preliminary or cursory assessment of the assistance seems to be necessary before its value can be determined. In this case I have nothing of the sort to go on. I am prepared to discount Mr Haines’ sentence by an additional 2.5 percent to reflect the fact of his offer to assist the authorities, but I am not prepared to do so to any greater extent in the absence of any evidence beyond that fact.
	


Contrition and remorse


	
	Mr Lee did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. He provided me with a letter written by him in the following terms:
	


“I have written this letter to the court so I can express in my own words as best and as honest as I can just how truly sorry and remorseful I am that due to my actions a person had died and also another person was seriously hurt.

I know that my words are little comfort to Mr McNulty’s family but I truly hope believe me when I tell them that I am just so sorry for the pain and suffering that I have caused them and wish there was something I could do or say to make things better but I know there is nothing. I would also like to let Mr Fitzgerald and his family know that I am so sorry for what he has gone through due to my actions. I would do anything to take it all back and change the outcome.

Your Honour, I am 38 years old now and have been using drugs since the age of 12 which means that I have been using drugs now for over 26 years and I know that due to my serious drug problem that’s the main reason that I did what I did. I have lived a criminal lifestyle most of my life due to my drug problem. Sadly your Honour drugs have had a hold over me for so long which has ruined my life and I’m just sorry that I didn’t wake up to myself sooner and changed my life.

Your Honour, during my sentence I plan to make sure that I do as many courses and programmes that I can so I will better myself to make sure that I have a very long look at myself and also reflect on what I’ve done and much pain I’ve caused to Mr McNulty, Mr Fitzgerald and also my own family.”


	
	Mr Lee’s expressions of regret and remorse were not tested in cross-examination. It was not however suggested by the Crown that what Mr Lee has written should be disregarded as being insincere or disingenuous. I have given them as much weight as they deserve in the circumstances. Mr Lee’s pleas of guilty are an acceptance of his responsibility for these offences and demonstrate some remorse in addition to what is contained in his letter. I am however ultimately left with the difficulty that Mr Lee’s concern to avoid being cross-examined about his role in these tragic events has significantly occluded my ability to appreciate the genuineness of his expressions of sorrow.
	
	
	Mr Haines also provided me with a letter in his own handwriting. It was in these terms:
	


“I wish more than anything that I could go back and change what happened that night, the only excuse I have for my actions is that my mind was clouded by the drug ice.

I know that this is a poor excuse when someone’s life has been taken but it is the only excuse I have because I never meant for this to happen. It’s been almost two years and I still have nightmares about what happened. I know that I have to live with my mistakes.

I just wish that I could show everyone that has been affected by my actions how ashamed of myself and truly sorry I am.”


	
	Mr Haines gave evidence at the sentencing proceedings. He confirmed and expanded upon the sentiments expressed in his letter. Mr Haines’ pleas of guilty are also an acceptance of his responsibility for these offences and demonstrate some remorse in addition to that contained in his letter and elaborated upon in his evidence.
	


Prospects of rehabilitation


	
	In the case of Mr Lee I have no expectation that he will avoid the prospect of reoffending when he is ultimately released to parole. He has led an unfortunate life chronically afflicted by drug use and criminal behaviour. His history of incarceration and reoffending does not confidently suggest that this pattern will change in the future. Against that somewhat pessimistic prediction is the fact that Mr Lee has never before spent long unbroken periods in gaol of the type he now faces, and his determination to improve his prospects through education has to be respected.
	
	
	Mr Haines suffers from the difficulty that his intellectual and cognitive abilities are likely always to limit his progress both within and outside the prison environment. Mr Haines’ limited capacity to acquire any new skills will constrain his progress in my opinion and reduce his practical access to courses and educational opportunities while in custody. In contrast, however, his relatively moderate criminal history would not in my view appear to present an insurmountable obstacle in the way of concluding that he has reasonable prospects of returning to life without crime in the future.
	


Disparity


	
	Mr Lee carried a knife to the victims’ unit and produced it at or about the time the offenders entered it. Mr Lee is directly responsible for the stabbing murder of Mr McNulty. By his plea, Mr Haines has accepted responsibility for the foundational offence during which Mr Lee killed Mr McNulty. The Crown submitted in these circumstances that it would be appropriate for there to be some disparity in the non-parole periods and the total terms of imprisonment to be imposed on Mr Lee and Mr Haines respectively for the offence of murder having regard to their roles.
	
	
	On Mr Lee’s behalf it was conceded, uncontroversially, that the authorities recognise that a distinction can be made upon the basis of separate and different roles. It was ultimately submitted on Mr Lee’s behalf, however, that “there may be little differentiation in the total effective sentence as between the offenders”. No further elaboration of that submission was made.
	
	
	It was submitted for Mr Haines that I should in this context proceed to impose a shorter sentence upon him than upon Mr Lee.
	


Deterrence, punishment and retribution


	
	In the course of my sentencing remarks when recently sentencing Ms Wran for her involvement in these events, I passed some particular remarks about deterrence. It is appropriate to repeat some of them here:
	


“[68] I was urged by the Crown to take account of the need to recognise general deterrence as an important aspect of the sentencing exercise. I have on more than one occasion expressed some personal concern about the role of general deterrence in formulating what is a proper sentence for offenders, having regard to what I consider to be the very real prospect that potentially similar offenders would be highly unlikely to notice. I also remain to be convinced that such prospective offenders would in any event be likely to give measured consideration to the consequences of their actions, far less a thoughtful review of the comparative criminal sanctions that might attend their apprehension.

[69] That is not to say that the Courts have no role to play in educating the community about the consequences of crime. I am however unconvinced that the length of sentences has much, if anything at all, to do with that process. Having regard to the particular circumstances of this case, the more important message, deserving of wide dissemination, is that drugs and drug addiction do not discriminate between or among sections of society. Every family in Australia today is a potential target for direct and vicarious disruption and sadness caused by crimes related to illicit drugs. The combination of mental illness and drug addiction do not in my experience respond well to either punishment or logic.

[70] By way of contrast, special deterrence may have a more important function in crafting the proper sentence for vulnerable individuals. That is particularly so in cases where some glimmer of insight appears to be evident. Conditional bonds and suspended sentences have an important role to play in such cases.”


	
	Mr Lee and Mr Haines are in differing degrees exemplars of this idea. Mr Lee has been imprisoned on many occasions for a wide series of offences in cascading degrees of seriousness. Mr Haines has also been incarcerated more than once but for less time than Mr Lee and over a shorter period. It is not easy to discern in their respective criminal histories any tangible indication suggesting the imprisonment of others has influenced their own criminal conduct. Indeed, the pattern of reoffending and reimprisonment suggests otherwise. Nor is there for similar reasons any evidence that either man was specifically deterred from reoffending by his own particular custodial history. Mr Lee was only released from prison shortly before these crimes were committed and was in effect sentenced to 6 months imprisonment for other offences dating from 13 August 2014 when he was arrested. Mr Haines had been sentenced to a non-parole period of imprisonment commencing on 12 June 2014 and was on bail for an offence committed on 26 February 2014. Each offender has previously had the benefit of drug rehabilitation programmes through parole conditions or Drug Court intervention.
	
	
	What does appear to be clear is that these present offences were committed in circumstances where each offender was determined to obtain drugs for his own use. I have no way of knowing for sure, but it seems likely that these offenders gave no consideration at all to the consequences of their actions at the time. That is additionally so in this case where those consequences were unrelated to anything that had been consciously planned, but were instead consequences that exploded uncontrollably and unexpectedly in the ways that are now so tragically understood.
	
	
	Punishment and retribution are in my view far easier concepts to understand as important aspects of the sentencing exercise. They also operate coextensively with deterrence as they serve to inform the imposition of what is a proper sentence in any particular case. What is very clear is that Mr Lee and Mr Haines are to be punished for their crimes in a way that marks out the community’s disapprobation for the senseless death of Mr McNulty and the serious wounding of Mr Fitzgerald in the course of a robbery that went wrong.
	


Special circumstances


	
	It does not seem to me that the statutory parole to non-parole ratio requires variation in either case as the periods of parole to which each offender is likely to be released will provide adequate opportunities for the type of post-release supervision that Mr Lee and Mr Haines might be expected to require.
	


Commencement of sentences


	
	Mr Lee was sentenced in April 2016 to concurrent terms of imprisonment totalling 6 months for drug-related matters, commencing on 13 August 2014 and expiring on 12 February 2015. Therefore six months of his post-arrest custody for the current matters is referable to these other offences.
	
	
	On 22 October 2014, Mr Haines was sentenced for the break and enter offence for which he was on bail at the time of the commission of the current matters. He was sentenced to a 6 months non-parole period commencing on 12 June 2014, which is not referable to the offences for which he is now to be sentenced.
	
	
	Notwithstanding these matters, I propose to commence the sentences in these proceedings from the dates upon which each offender was arrested and taken into custody. The offenders each stand to be sentenced for serious crimes. The pernicious role of drug addiction is significant in each case. What would amount to minor variations to the commencement date of the sentences to take account of time being served for other drug related offences does not seem to me to be particularly important in these circumstances. I acknowledge that it would be otherwise if the offenders were disadvantaged by, for example, a failure to give credit for time served.
	


Accumulation and totality


	
	The Crown emphasised that even though the offences arose out of the same criminal enterprise, there were separate victims and separate criminality. In those circumstances the Crown maintained that there should be some accumulation of the sentences to be imposed for each offence. The fact that one offence is the foundational offence for murder does not preclude a separate sentence being imposed: R v McGarritty (NSWCCA 10 June 1994 unreported).
	
	
	It was conceded on behalf of Mr Lee that there should be some limited, partial accumulation between the sentences to give effect to the fact that there were separate victims.
	
	
	I propose to accumulate the sentences for each offence in the case of both offenders by one year. The foundational offence is an objectively serious example of an offence of its type. The separate offences under consideration manifestly arose out of associated events. However, it is to an extent somewhat artificial to revisit those chaotic and frenetic events now with a view to apportioning penalties dispassionately by reference to the relationship that each offence bears to the other. It must necessarily be acknowledged that there were two victims who were the subject of these crimes. Mr Fitzgerald survives to contemplate the appropriateness of the sentences imposed upon the offenders for the way in which the violent events that occurred at his unit personally affected him. Where the foundational offence is separately charged, a sentence sufficient to recognise that fact both generally and in practical effect should be imposed. The extent of the accumulation for which I have provided is not intended in this case to detract from that fact.
	
	
	I have also paid particular regard to the principle of totality. In my opinion, any greater degree of accumulation of the sentences than that indicated would distort the comparative value of the individual sentences in the context of the offenders’ respective acts of criminality as a whole. I have therefore attempted to mark out the seriousness of the foundational offence without simultaneously according it disproportionate significance in all of the circumstances that give rise to these proceedings.
	


The proper sentence


	
	As I have already observed, the Crown concedes and the offenders accept that these offences fall below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of their type. It is, however, important to understand that such a conclusion is not a dismissive comment upon the sanctity of Mr McNulty’s life or upon Mr Fitzgerald’s right to live free from the threat of serious assault. It is no more than the need in a sentencing exercise to give expression in comparative terms to the seriousness of the crimes objectively assessed.
	
	
	The law sensibly recognises that there is a difference between crimes that are cynically planned to exact revenge or achieve financial gain or that are associated with some aggravating feature such as gratuitous cruelty on the one hand and those that result from circumstances that are unanticipated or unexpected on the other hand. That difference is to be reflected in sentencing outcomes. Mr Lee and Mr Haines did not go to the Redfern premises intending to kill Mr McNulty or to assault Mr Fitzgerald. They went there in the feeble hope of scoring a small amount of drugs for their personal use which they expected to achieve without the use of actual force. They were mistaken. They remain, however, criminally responsible for what occurred but their culpability for murder, by way of example, is treated for sentencing purposes differently to a murder that was carefully planned or that was accompanied by features that are absent here.
	
	
	I consider that Mr Haines’ moral culpability for the murder of Mr McNulty is less than that of Mr Lee. Mr Lee went to the premises armed with the knife that caused the death. The ultimate use and physical control of the weapon was literally and figuratively in Mr Lee’s hands. His decisions about its use were made without reference to Mr Haines. He is directly responsible for the stabbing murder of Mr McNulty. In contrast, Mr Haines’ role in the murder of Mr McNulty and his liability for it are factually and legally derivative. Mr Haines went to the premises unarmed. He was not physically in contact with Mr McNulty at all. The difference between the respective involvements of the two men should be reflected in the sentences to be imposed upon each of them.
	
	
	By reason of the offences for which Mr Lee and Mr Haines are to be sentenced, they are each a person who has committed a “serious violence offence” for the purposes of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2000. That Act establishes a regime by which such offenders may become the subject of extended supervision orders or continuing detention orders before the expiration of their sentence. I am required by s 25C(1) of the Act to warn Mr Lee and Mr Haines of the existence of the Act and its application to them.
	
	
	Lloyd Edward Haines, for the offence of armed robbery with wounding I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of 5 years commencing on 12 August 2014 expiring on 11 August 2019. For the offence of murder I sentence you to imprisonment for 14 years and 8 months consisting of a non-parole period of 11 years commencing on 12 August 2015 expiring on 11 August 2026 with a balance of term of 3 years and 8 months expiring on 11 April 2030. The first day upon which you will become eligible for release on parole is 12 August 2026.
	
	
	Michael Lee, for the offence of armed robbery with wounding I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of 5 years commencing on 13 August 2014 expiring on 12 August 2019. For the offence of murder I sentence you to imprisonment for 17 years and 6 months consisting of a non-parole period of 13 years and 6 months commencing on 13 August 2015 expiring on 12 February 2029 with a balance of term of 4 years expiring on 12 February 2033. The first day upon which you will become eligible for release on parole is 13 February 2029.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and sentence

On 21 August 2015 the applicant was sentenced by Judge Syme in the Newcastle District Court in respect of the following two offences:

Charge one - aggravated enter a dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, the circumstance of aggravation being that he inflicted actual bodily harm on Zoe Flick, contrary to s 111(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years.

Charge two – cause grievous bodily harm to Rebecca Gardner with intent to do so, contrary to s 33(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years. This offence carries a standard non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment.


	
	Her Honour sentenced the applicant as follows:
	


Charge one – Imprisonment for 7 years commencing 7 February 2014 and expiring 6 February 2021 with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months to expire 6 May 2019.

Charge two – Imprisonment for 12 years to commence 7 February 2015 and to expire 6 February 2027 with a non-parole period of 8 years and 9 months to expire 6 November 2023.

This produced an effective sentence of imprisonment for 13 years commencing 7 February 2014 and expiring 6 February 2027 with a non-parole period of 9 years and 9 months expiring 6 November 2023.


	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal from those sentences on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1 – Her Honour took into account an irrelevant consideration in finding that each victim held a “very real and reasonable” fear of being sexually assaulted.

Ground 2 – Her Honour failed to properly take into account the applicant’s lack of prior convictions and good character as mitigating factors on sentence.

Ground 3 – Her Honour failed to properly take into account that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation as mitigating factors on sentence.

Ground 4 – Her Honour failed to properly take into account the applicant’s remorse as a mitigating factor on sentence.

Ground 5 – The sentences imposed are manifestly excessive.

Factual background


	
	An agreed set of facts was before the court. The victims were both employed as cleaning contractors and were cleaning a property in Medowie. The applicant had been in Raymond Terrace for some time and was driving in the Medowie area. Between 3.20pm and 4pm he approached the premises in which the two victims were cleaning on two separate occasions. On the first occasion he looked over the rear six foot fence and used a piece of timber in order to assist him to look over the fence. On the second occasion he entered the rear yard and spoke to both victims on a pretext about a lost tennis ball.
	
	
	The victims continued to clean the premises. They moved inside and were listening to music. The applicant entered the premises through the front door carrying two items with him - a roll of black electrical tape and a cotton hand wrap which he was wearing on his left hand.
	
	
	Without warning, he struck Ms Gardner twice to the left side of her face. After being struck, Ms Gardner fell to the ground and lost consciousness.
	
	
	Ms Flick was unaware of the applicant’s presence. She turned around and observed him in the family room. Again without warning, he placed Ms Flick in a headlock and began to punch her in the face with his left fist. She resisted but was overwhelmed and quickly rendered unconscious by the blows to her head. While she was unconscious, the applicant wrapped black electrical tape around her mouth. It was over 3 metres long. He then positioned Ms Flick and Ms Gardner on the floor of the family room, side by side and left the premises.
	
	
	Shortly thereafter, the victims regained consciousness and sought help. They were hospitalised with significant injuries. Ms Gardner had a severely broken jaw, had two front teeth knocked out and suffered further cuts and abrasions to her face and body. She required surgery to insert a metal plate, screws and wire to repair the break. Ms Flick required sutures to a laceration to her left eye, she suffered multiple cuts, bruises and abrasions to her face and body. Both victims were extremely traumatised as a result of the attack.
	
	
	Her Honour had before her victim impact statements from each of the victims which she took into account as indicating the consequences for the victims of the injuries they had suffered. Ms Flick said that she had to take painkillers for three months and suffered severe psychological effects. She said that she had been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder. Ms Gardner has been left with permanent damage to her teeth, so that eating is a constant reminder of the assault and is painful. She told the court that the social and psychological effects were continuing. Both victims were forced to move back with their families.
	
	
	As a result of investigation, the applicant was identified. When he was first spoken to by police he denied the offences, but subsequently admitted them and pleaded guilty to the two offences in the Local Court.
	


Proceedings on sentence


	
	The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. Her Honour allowed a 25% discount for his early plea of guilty. Before dealing with sentencing principles, her Honour resolved some issues of fact. Her Honour rejected a suggestion by the Crown that there was a sexual element in the offending. Having done so, her Honour observed:
	


“However, no doubt the complainants, the victims of this offence, had a very real and reasonable such fear because they were both violently physically assaulted and rendered unconscious and restrained.” (Sentence judgment 3.7)


	
	In relation to planning, her Honour found:
	


“The offender also referred to taking supplements prior to the commission of these offences. There is no evidence that the prior Internet searches, as I said, or the taking of supplements are directly related to this specific offence. However, both paint a worrying picture of the offender’s life and interests in the months prior to the commission of the offence. He was apparently self-focused, violence-focused and intent on making himself physically fit without any particular aim in mind.

Again, this is a consideration for those planning his treatment while in custody and his supervision on release but those particular issues do not aggravate the circumstance of this offence in so far as planning has occurred. The offender in his evidence said that he did not plan the offence and said it was spontaneous. However, this is not a spontaneous offence as is meant by the Act.

He parked about 50 metres away from the house where the attack occurred. He saw the young complainants outside the premises. He took items from his truck which were used in the attack. He approached them a few minutes prior and spoke to them and watched them. He left the rear yard and walked through the front door, before attacking them violently. As I noted, this was not spontaneous. There is evidence of planning on the day, although the choice of victims seems to have been dictated by, to some extent, chance and seems to have been dictated by their small stature. They were certainly easy targets.” (Sentence judgment 4.7 – 5.5)


	
	Her Honour went on to observe:
	


“The offender told the Court that he stopped attacking them spontaneously because he immediately knew what he had done was wrong. However, there was no effort to call for assistance for them but there is no evidence otherwise that he was startled or interrupted during the course of the offending.” (Sentence judgment 5.6)


	
	Having referred to the contents of the victim impact statements, her Honour took them into account when assessing the objective seriousness of the offending as follows:
	


“These are significant statements and will be properly assessed when assessing the objective seriousness of this offending. The Crown correctly suggests that the circumstance of injury to the complainants, including any long-term consequences, are relevant when assessing the overall criminality rather than as a separate heading, and I accept that. I will simply note here how it is proposed to take these matters into account and I will borrow from the Crown’s submissions because I think he has had more time to put them in writing than I have.

Generally speaking, the extent of the injuries inflicted and the intention of the offender are instrumental factors in determining not only the appropriate charge but also the nature and length of the sentence to be imposed. The Crown has correctly quoted, and I think this is from Sigatano’s case (1998) CLR:

“The seriousness of a section 33 offence and what constitutes an appropriate sentence will be, to a very significant degree, determined by the nature of the victim’s injuries. In the case where the injuries are particularly serious, there is little scope to ameliorate the sentences by providing for rehabilitation.”

and I accept that, and the Crown has quoted from Mitchell’s case in that place.”


	
	Her Honour referred to the applicant’s subjective case as follows:
	


“I note when considering the offender’s circumstances that he does not have a record of any prior criminal convictions. He was thirty-one when this offence was committed. He was prior to that time of no concern to society, the community or the justice system. He was a person of prior good character. Both the offender’s father and a family friend Ms Toms gave evidence of his prior good character. Ms Toms described him as a family person who was always courteous and never aggressive. His lack of prior record and his positive prior engagement with the community will be taken into account when considering his risk of re-offending and his prospects of rehabilitation in so far as the Court can do so within the limitations of the offences charged.

When considering his prospects of rehabilitation and the issue of remorse, Mr Medcalf did give evidence in court and did make himself available for cross-examination. He has told the Court that he had some problems but was really unable to define what they were. He so far has, I find, limited insight into the reason why he committed such violent offences and directed his violence at people he apparently did not know nor had any prior contact with. Mr Medcalf told the Court that he thought the supplements he was taking were making him feel anxious and he suggested that his actions may have been a possible consequence of the supplements he was taking.

Dr Westmore, who prepared a report in January or February of this year, when referring to his prospects of rehabilitation said as follows. Dr Westmore is a respected psychiatrist and I have received his report by consent. I do accept the contents of that report. He said:

“At the time I assessed him I did not think that he needed psychiatric medication but definitely he would benefit from some counselling. If it is accepted.”

said Dr Westmore,

“that the offending behaviour was uncharacteristic and unexpected and indeed an aberrant event which occurred in part because of his mental state at the relevant time, providing he does not become depressed and angry again his risks of re-offending are in the lower range. Obviously he must never use supplements again and he needs to continue counselling on his return to the community. It is unlikely he will receive any extended counselling during the course of his incarceration.”

Again, when considering the offending behaviour Mr Medcalf was unable to provide a cogent explanation, if there ever could be one, for these offences. He referred to becoming anxious as a result of his supplement use.”


	
	Her Honour noted:
	


“Mr Rosser for Mr Medcalf does not submit on instructions from his client that the supplement use had any causal effect on the commission of the offences. Further, no submission is made that there was any mental health or psychiatric reason for the commission of the offences. The evidence relating to psychiatric presentation and supplement use is relevant only to the issue of rehabilitation and it is in that context that I will put it on the record.”


	
	I interpolate that this concession by the applicant’s legal representative at this point was unfortunate. As is made clear by a reading of Dr Westmore’s report and as her Honour made clear subsequently in her sentence judgment, there was a causal connection found by Dr Westmore between the applicant’s mental state and the commission of the offence although that of itself was not a full explanation. Neither Dr Westmore nor the applicant could fully explain why he committed these offences. That having been said, it is of no assistance to the applicant in this appeal and has properly not been relied upon by his counsel, since the point was expressly abandoned in the sentence proceedings. Her Honour cannot be said to have erred in not taking into account a matter which was given up in submissions.
	
	
	Her Honour said:
	


“Dr Westmore was of the opinion that, based on his history, Mr Medcalf was suffering from a depressive disorder at the time the offending behaviour occurred. He said the differential diagnosis would include a major depressive disorder or a moderate to severe adjustment disorder and depressed and anxious mood. He was of the opinion that he may also have a discrete anxiety disorder but the history and diagnosis of that was less clear. He observed that his general level of functioning leading up to the offending behaviour appeared to have fluctuated considerably but his history would suggest that he was functioning below his premorbid levels of functioning, noting that he was having increased conflict with others, relationship breakdowns and a history of increased alcohol consumption.

I also note that Mr Medcalf reported taking a wide range of supplements which he obtained from various Internet sites supplied from the United States. There are no objective tests which relate to these supplements and there is no information as to what level of these supplements were in Mr Medcalf’s body at the time the offences were committed.” (Sentence judgment 9.1)


	
	Her Honour then referred to a pharmacological report by Professor Arnold, the effect of which was that there was no evidence that these supplements improved weight loss or muscle development and there was no evidence of them being harmful, although there was anecdotal evidence to that effect. Her Honour noted Professor Arnold’s conclusion as follows:
	


“At the conclusion of the report Mr Arnold said when referring to some of the steroid products or nutritional substances that contain some of the ephedrines or steroid-like substances:

“Like for other anabolic steroids, it is possible that exposure to DHEA and androsterone could have contributed to Mr Medcalf’s mental state at the time of the incident, increasing his feelings of anxiety, irritability and aggressivity. However, it is impossible to conclude with greater certainty, given the limited information, on the actual dosages taken and the dosages found in these preparations.”

It would seem that even though Mr Medcalf is of the view that his taking of supplements may have affected his behaviour on that day, there is no direct evidence to support that proposition but, as I said before, it is a worrying feature of his life at that time that he was using and abusing substances that he did not know the effects of at such a high level.

Dr Westmore concluded in his report:

“Mr Medcalf’s behaviour does appear to have been completely unexpected and uncharacteristic when one considers his longitudinal life profile.”

and that is an assessment that I would agree with.

“That would suggest,”

said Dr Westmore,

“that there was something wrong with him from a psychological or psychiatric perspective at the relevant time but he does not, in my opinion, have a psychiatric defence to the matters now before the Court. He was able in a spontaneous way to acknowledge the wrongness of his actions and he has some insight into the considerable trauma he caused his victims. He also has some insight into the fact that he was depressed and anxious at the relevant time but I think he would benefit from counselling in relation to the nature and extent of his aggressive behaviour towards the two girls and he would be assisted by understanding himself more completely the nature of the psychodynamic factors which is likely to have led him to selecting women as victims rather than men.”” (Sentence judgment 10.3 – 11.1)


	
	Her Honour expressed her findings in relation to remorse and rehabilitation as follows:
	


“As I noted in Mr Medcalf’s evidence, there are many features of this offence and specifically of Mr Medcalf that at this stage are unknown factors. Therefore, the Court can make a finding that, while he has expressed remorse as best as he is able at the moment, and while there are some prospects that he has relatively low risks of re-offending, this all depends on him being able to undertake further counselling which would give him better insight in the future, being in a position where he is properly supervised so that he does not get himself into a position where he becomes obsessed with things that convinced him to involve himself in a heavy supplement programme, and also a better handle on his own personality and his own potentially depressive feelings which apparently has caused him relationship difficulties in the past.

This is a complex matter for sentencing and it is a complex matter dealing with Mr Medcalf. His prospects of rehabilitation will be taken into account. It is a long-term prospect, in my view.” (Sentence judgment 11.2)


	
	Her Honour set out other aspects of the applicant’s subjective case as follows:
	


“With respect to the offender’s background, I note that he grew up with his family in Queensland and New South Wales. He has a very supportive family. His father told the Court that he commenced using drugs as a teenager and the family became supportive and assisting him at that time. His drug use fluctuated over time, sometimes interfering with his work. However, he successfully completed a carpentry apprenticeship and worked in his own business. He was not satisfied with the work process and he was, at the time of the offence, living at his sister’s home by arrangement. He is now thirty-two years of age. He has never married but he has maintained some long-term relationships. He appears dissatisfied with his life and with his relationships in general, even prior to the commission of this offence.

He does have significant family support. His father gave evidence and he offers support in the future. He told the Court that his son prior to this offence was considered to be happy and easy-going. The father was understandably shocked by the charges and is still puzzled by his son’s behaviour but, fortunately for Mr Medcalf Junior’s prospects of rehabilitation, his father still offers support and will assist him in providing employment on his eventual release.” (Sentence judgment 11.9 – 12.7)


	
	Her Honour assessed the objective seriousness of these offences as “objectively placed higher than mid-range seriousness”. Her Honour considered the protection of the community from the applicant as an important consideration as was denunciation so as to recognise the harm done to the victims and to the community as a result of his offending. Her Honour then proceeded to sentence.
	
	
	There was before her Honour a statistical summary of 70 cases involving offences contrary to s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 extending from 2004 until 2015. The summaries included the following information: the name and citation of the case, the offence or offences, the original sentence, the result of the appeal, where a weapon was used the nature of the weapon and a five to ten line summary of the facts of the case. Of those 70 cases, the sentence passed by her Honour in this case was equal to the highest sentence imposed.
	
	
	The cases where similar sentences were imposed were:
	


Vragovic v R [2007] NSWCCA 46. The sentence was 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years. An exhaust pipe and a shortened firearm were used. A brief summary of the facts were - the offender had attacked his estranged wife aged 57 - broke into her home at night - beat her face and body - the victim suffered fractured ribs, a pneumothorax, a fracture to left scapula, lacerations to scalp and head. The victim suffered serious continuing consequences of the attack. The offence was characterised as “above mid-range”.

R v Jione [2007] NSWCCA 170. Successful Crown appeal – sentence of imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years – offender punched victim numerous times on two occasions while drinking at a hotel. The victim was reduced to a vegetative state. The offence was characterised as “above mid-range and in the category of high seriousness”.

Sproates v R [2009] NSWCCA 29. Sentence of imprisonment of 12 years with a non-parole of 8 years – pistol used. Offender involved in altercation in hotel with victim. Approached victim outside hotel and threatened him with pistol. Fired three shots hitting victim in stomach – severe injuries – bullet entered left abdomen, passed through the liver, the stomach and lodged near the spine and pancreas – requirement for major surgery. The victim suffered severe physical consequences for the rest of his life. The offence was characterised as at the “upper end of range”.

Bourke v R [2010] NSWCCA 22; 199 A Crim R 38. Sentence of imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years – pole and axe used. Attacked victim at a party with weapons obtained from home – motive unknown – attack was unprovoked. Victim suffered serious cuts to head including a cut above the eye which went down to the bone and fractures to fingers – offence characterised as “above mid-range of seriousness towards upper end of seriousness”.

The appeal

Ground 1 – Her Honour took into account an irrelevant consideration in finding that each victim held a “very real and reasonable” fear of being sexually assaulted.


	
	The applicant submitted that there was no basis for her Honour making such a finding, particularly when the finding was expressed as there being “no doubt” as to that state of affairs existing. The applicant submitted that neither victim had said anything in their victim impact statements about having such a fear. The applicant submitted that this finding must have played some part in her Honour’s reasoning towards sentence, otherwise she would not have said anything about it. The applicant submitted that in the circumstances this observation by her Honour was an irrelevant consideration and amounted to an error which required re-sentencing.
	


Consideration


	
	I agree that there was no factual basis for her Honour making that observation. There could, however, have been no objection to it had her Honour expressed herself in terms of “likelihood” or “probability”. That having been said, it is not at all clear that the observation had any effect on the sentence ultimately imposed. Her Honour made the observation on one occasion, early in her sentence judgment, in circumstances where she was in effect excluding an earlier Crown submission that there was a sexual motivation. It was at most an incorrect observation on a peripheral issue. It follows that I am not persuaded that error requiring re-sentence has occurred.
	


Ground 2 – Her Honour failed to properly take into account the applicant’s lack of prior convictions and good character as mitigating factors on sentence.


	
	The applicant submitted that the Crown in the sentence proceedings had accepted that his lack of criminal record and good character were mitigating factors on sentence (s 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). He submitted that this was confirmed by the opinion of Dr Westmore which was accepted by her Honour, that the offences were uncharacteristic and aberrant. In that regard, the applicant relied upon Regina v Darrell Terry McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 where Spigelman CJ said:
	


“26   … the majority judgment in Veen No 2 recognised that prior convictions are pertinent to where, within the boundary set by the objective circumstances, a sentence should lie.”

The applicant submitted that because of his absence of convictions and prior good character, the sentences imposed should fall more towards the lenient end of the boundary set by the objective seriousness of the offences.


	
	The applicant also relied upon the observation of McHugh J in Ryan v R [2001] HCA 21; 206 CLR 267 at [29]:
	


“29   … In the sentencing context, however, being of otherwise good character may in some circumstances suggest that the prisoner's actions in committing the offence for which he or she is being sentenced were ""out of character"" and that he or she is unlikely to re-offend. For that purpose, the absence of previous convictions is usually regarded as evidence of good character. On the other hand, many previous convictions suggest that the offence for which sentence is being passed was not an ""uncharacteristic aberration"".

30   Another, but less articulated, reason for considering ""good character"" in the sentencing context appears to involve the idea that a ""morally good"" person is less deserving of punishment for a particular offence than a ""morally neutral or bad"" person who has committed an identical offence. Walker and Padfield have described as ""remarkable"":

""... cases in which the court is influenced by meritorious conduct which has nothing to do with the offence. …”

31   Notwithstanding the ""remarkable"" rationale for taking into account a prisoner's otherwise good character, at common law it is an established mitigating factor in the sentencing process. What makes a person of otherwise ""good character"" will necessarily vary according to the individual who stands for sentence. It is impossible to state a universal rule.”


	
	The applicant submitted that her Honour should have taken into account the “out of character” nature of the offending and his previous good character as positive mitigating factors as well as matters to be taken into account when assessing his risk of re-offending and prospects of rehabilitation in the context of the protection of the public.
	


Consideration


	
	A ground of appeal expressed in terms of “failing to properly take into account” implicitly concedes that a particular factor was taken into account but challenges the exercise of discretion on the part of the sentencing judge. In this case, however, there is more to the complaint. The applicant submits that her Honour should not have restricted her consideration of that issue only in the context of rehabilitation and risk of re-offending, but that it had a wider application. There is no such qualification to its use as a mitigating factor in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	There is considerable force in this aspect of the ground of appeal which feeds into Ground 5. It follows that her Honour did fail to give full and proper effect to what was an unchallenged mitigating factor.
	


Ground 3 – Her Honour failed to properly take into account that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation as mitigating factors on sentence.


	
	In Ground 3, the applicant challenged her Honour’s mode of reasoning and her ultimate finding that at best the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were “long term”, i.e. guarded. The applicant submitted that her Honour should have had regard to the opinion of Dr Westmore that this offending was out of character, that his prospects of rehabilitation were good and that there was a low chance of him re-offending. He submitted that her Honour should have taken into account his lack of prior convictions and prior good character and the support of his family, particularly his father. There was also his expressed willingness to undertake courses and therapy to better understand what he had done and why. The applicant submitted that her Honour had made no mention of those matters and did not appear to have taken them into account.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that her Honour’s reasoning had focused entirely upon his inability to explain why he had committed the offences. Her reasoning was that if he could not explain why these offences had occurred, then they might occur again in the future. The applicant submitted that this line of reasoning placed too much weight on his lack of an explanation and disregarded the other positive matters which had been put to her Honour and in particular, the opinion of Dr Westmore.
	


Consideration


	
	There is no doubt that her Honour was conscious of the matters to which the applicant refers because she dealt with them in her judgment. Her conclusion, while not favouring the applicant, was open to her given the “unknown factors” relating to the applicant’s motivation for the offending. This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 4 – Her Honour failed to properly take into account the applicant’s remorse as a mitigating factor on sentence.


	
	The applicant submitted that her Honour’s approach to remorse appears to have conflated the question of his remorse with whether or not he was able to explain why he committed the offences. He submitted that the evidence established that despite him not being able to satisfactorily explain why he committed the offences, he was remorseful for what he had done. He had fully accepted responsibility for his actions and he acknowledged the injury that his actions had caused. It was never suggested by the Crown in its case on sentence that he was not genuinely remorseful. The applicant was not cross-examined to that effect.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that her Honour’s finding that he “has expressed remorse as best he is able at the moment” did not go so far as to reveal how her Honour intended to take his remorse into account in determining the appropriate sentences. He submitted that her Honour’s other observations about his lack of insight suggests that she did not take his remorse into account as a mitigating factor pursuant to s 21A(2)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Consideration


	
	This ground of appeal is made out. The applicant’s submission that her Honour did conflate the two concepts is correct. I can see no necessary contradiction between an offender being unable to explain why he offended and yet still being genuinely sorry for what he or she had done and in particular, for the harm which he or she may have caused the victims. While her Honour was not necessarily bound by any concessions by the Crown, it is of significance that the Crown accepted that the applicant was genuinely remorseful.
	


Ground 5 – The sentences imposed are manifestly excessive.


	
	The applicant submitted that when one takes into account the starting point for each sentence before the 25% percent discount, their excessive nature becomes clear. In the case of the enter with intent offence, the starting point was imprisonment for 9 years and 4 months against a maximum penalty of 14 years. With the cause grievous bodily harm with intent offence, the starting point was imprisonment for 16 years against a maximum penalty of 25 years. In that offence the non-parole period imposed was one of 8 years and 9 months against a standard non-parole period of 7 years.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the sentencing statistics reveal that the individual sentences imposed on the applicant were at the very top of the reported range. In relation to the offence of enter with intent, the statistics for the period June 2008 until June 2015 reveal that during that period 155 offenders received terms of fulltime imprisonment for that offence. Out of those 155 only the applicant received a sentence of 7 years imprisonment or longer. Three offenders received sentences of 6 years, two received sentences of 5 years and the remaining 149 received sentences of less than 5 years.
	
	
	For the offence of cause grievous bodily harm with intent, the statistics maintained for the same period reveal that 126 offenders received terms of fulltime imprisonment. Out of those 126, only 5 including the applicant, received a sentence of 12 years. There was no sentence higher than 12 years.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that while his offending was objectively serious criminal conduct, and deserved sentences that reflected that fact, there were a number of mitigating factors present.
	



	
	He had no prior criminal record and no history of violence.
	
	
	He was a person of prior good character.
	
	
	He was genuinely remorseful.
	
	
	He was unlikely to re-offend; and
	
	
	Had good prospects of rehabilitation.
	



	
	The applicant submitted that given this combination of factors in mitigation, the fact that the sentences imposed on him were at the very top of the reported range was unreasonable and plainly unjust.
	


Consideration


	
	To succeed on this ground the applicant must demonstrate that the sentence was “unreasonable or plainly unjust” (Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [325]; Makarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]). This is to be established in the context where there is no single correct sentence and judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and application of principle: Makarian at [27).
	
	
	It is not sufficient that this Court might have exercised the sentencing discretion in a manner different to the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised her discretion: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at [15].
	
	
	There is no doubt that the objective seriousness of the offending was substantial. There was a high degree of violence, the offences were unprovoked and the consequences for the victims serious. In the circumstances her Honour’s finding that the objective seriousness of the offending was above the mid-range of objective seriousness was open to her. General and personal deterrence were of high importance.
	
	
	This Court has consistently recognised the limitations of statistics. At best, they are a blunt tool when considering sentencing patterns. Nevertheless they are of some value. In Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 the plurality (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) said:
	


“53   Next, in seeking consistency, sentencing judges must have regard to what has been done in other cases. In the present matter, the prosecution produced detailed information, for the sentencing judge and for the Court of Criminal Appeal, about sentences that had been passed in other cases arising out of tax evasion as well as cases of customs and excise fraud and social security fraud. Care must be taken, however, in using what has been done in other cases.

54   In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa, Simpson J accurately identified the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. As her Honour said: ""Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts."" But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix ""the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence"". Past sentences ""are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence"" (emphasis added). When considering past sentences, ""it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that 'unifying principles' may be discerned"".”


	
	The plurality went on to say in relation to questions of manifest inadequacy or manifest excess:
	


“58   The single ground of appeal advanced by the Director in each appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was that the sentences imposed at first instance were manifestly inadequate. That is, the error which the Director asserted that the sentencing judge had made was of the last kind mentioned in House v The King. By asserting manifest inadequacy, the Director alleged that the result embodied in the sentencing judge's orders was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"". The Director did not allege that any specific error could be identified (as would be the case if the sentencing judge were said to have acted upon wrong principle, allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect her, mistaken the facts or not taken into account some material considerations). Rather, the Director asserted that it was to be inferred from the result that there was ""a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance"".

59   As was said in Dinsdale v The Queen, ""[m]anifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion"". And, as the plurality pointed out in Wong, appellate intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate ""is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases"". Rather, as the plurality went on to say in Wong, ""[i]ntervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons"". But, by its very nature, that is a conclusion that does not admit of lengthy exposition. And, in the present matters, the Court of Criminal Appeal, having described the circumstances of the offending and the personal circumstances of the offenders, said that ""the sentence imposed in these matters is so far outside the range of sentences available that there must have been error"".”


	
	Leaving aside the errors identified in Grounds 2 and 4, I have concluded that the sentences imposed here were manifestly excessive. In reaching that conclusion, I have essentially based it on the last kind of error referred to in House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505.
	
	
	As was indicated in the applicant’s submissions in respect of Ground 5, the starting point for the head sentences before the 25% discount for an early plea was respectively 9 years and 4 months and 16 years. By inference the instinctive synthesis process by which her Honour arrived at those starting points must also have taken into account the mitigating factors identified in those earlier grounds of appeal, i.e. lack of prior offending and previous good character, together with genuine remorse. In other words, the starting point for those sentences must have been higher than that produced by a mere adding on of the 25% discount. This is a further indication of excess, although the precise nature of the error cannot be determined.
	
	
	Even allowing for the relatively blunt nature of statistics, the fact that these sentences were at the very top of those passed over the last 8 -10 years, while not decisive, is relevant and important.
	
	
	It follows that these sentences are plainly unreasonable and unjust and therefore manifestly excessive. It is necessary for the applicant to be re-sentenced (Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601).
	


Re-sentence


	
	There was no additional material placed before the Court speaking to the applicant’s time in custody between the date of sentencing and the present time. The circumstances of the offending and the mitigating circumstances have been set out earlier in this judgment. By reference to those matters in the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion, I would impose the following sentences. In respect of offence one – the enter with intent to commit a serious indictable offence – I would impose a sentence of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months, with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months.
	
	
	For the offence of cause grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, I would impose a sentence of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years and 3 months, with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months.
	
	
	The effective sentence would therefore be a sentence of imprisonment for 10 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 8 years and 3 months.
	
	
	Accordingly, the orders which I propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The sentences imposed on the applicant in the District Court at Newcastle on 21 August 2015 are quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced as follows:
	



	
	Count 1 - enter with intent to commit a serious indictable offence – to wit assault in circumstances of aggravation with intentional infliction of actual bodily harm, contrary to s 111(2) Crimes Act 1900 – imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months, commencing 7 February 2014 and expiring 6 August 2018, with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months, expiring 6 February 2020.
	
	
	Count 2 - cause grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, contrary to s 33(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900 – imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years and 3 months, commencing 7 February 2015 and expiring 6 May 2022 with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months expiring 6 November 2024.
	



	
	The earliest date on which the applicant will be entitled to parole will be 6 May 2022.
	



	
	CAMPBELL J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	BUTTON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2700963,Popovic v R; Hristovski v R; Bubanja v R; and Koloamatangi v R [2016] NSWCCA 202,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

On 8 September 2007, Dragan Sekuljica was fatally shot as he was leaving Splashes night club in Wollongong. On 24 May 2014, the applicants, Zlatan Popovic, Jason Hristovski, Dalibor Bubanja and Tevi Koloamatangi, were convicted of his murder.

The Crown case was that the applicants were each a party to a joint criminal enterprise to kill Mr Sekuljica. According to the Crown, Mr Koloamatangi was the gunman, Mr Popovic had arranged the murder, Mr Hristovski had supplied the gun and Mr Bubanja had acted as the lookout at Splashes on the night of the murder. The principal Crown witnesses were Mr Taylor and Mr Radz, who had both been given indemnities in return for giving evidence at the trial.

The applicants sought leave to appeal against their convictions. Additionally, Mr Bubanja sought leave to appeal against his sentence.

The applicants’ grounds of appeal raised the following issues:

(i)   Whether the trial judge should have given a direction in accordance with Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 regarding the provision of a firearm in the case against Mr Hristovski;

(ii)   Whether the trial judge’s warnings to the jury regarding the evidence of Mr Taylor and Mr Radz were adequate and whether the trial judge erred by giving a hearsay warning to the jury in relation to a note made by Detective Ritchie;

(iii)   Whether the trial judge erred in inviting the jury to consider whether Mr Taylor had a reason to lie;

(iv)   Whether the summing up was so imbalanced against the applicants as to deprive each of them of a fair trial; and

(v)   Whether the verdicts against Mr Bubanja and Mr Hristovski were unreasonable.

The Court held, granting leave to appeal, allowing the appeal and quashing the convictions:

In relation to (i):

(1)   The trial judge did not err in refusing to give a direction that in order to convict Mr Hristovski, the jury needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he provided a firearm to the shooter. The directions in respect of the burden and standard of proof were in any case sufficient: [1] (Beazley P); [4] (R A Hulme J); [199]-[201] (Adamson J)

Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573; Filippou v The Queen [2015] HCA 29; 256 CLR 47; Burrell v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 163; 196 A Crim R 199; R v Davidson [2009] NSWCCA 150; 75 NSWLR 150.

(2)   There was also no error in his Honour’s failure to warn the jury that they were required to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Hristovski provided the firearm before they could use that circumstance as a basis for inferring Mr Hristovski’s guilt. This was because the Crown case highlighted the provision of the gun: [1] (Beazley P); [4] (R A Hulme J); [202]-[203] (Adamson J)

In relation to (ii)

(3)   His Honour misdirected the jury by giving a hearsay warning in respect of Detective Ritchie’s note, in circumstances where the hearsay rule did not apply as the note was relevant for a non-hearsay purpose. The warning was also adverse to the applicants’ interests as it undermined the challenge to Mr Taylor’s credibility: [1] (Beazley P); [5] (R A Hulme J); [213]-[215] (Adamson J)

(4)   The warnings given about the unreliability of the evidence of Mr Taylor and Mr Radz were deprived of any substantial force by reason of the error identified in (iii): [1] (Beazley P); [5] (R A Hulme J); [221] (Adamson J)

In relation to (iii)

(5)   The trial judge erred by inviting the jury to consider a reason why Mr Taylor would lie. This gave the jury the impression that if they could not identify a reason why Mr Taylor would lie, then they should accept his evidence: [1] (Beazley P); [5] (R A Hulme J); [220]-[221] (Adamson J)

South v R [2007] NSWCCA 117

In relation to (iv)

(6)   The suggestions made to the jury during the summing up about how they might assess the evidence in a manner that might favour the Crown case had not been raised by the prosecutor in his closing address. This caused unfairness due to the inability of defence counsel to respond: [1] (Beazley P); [6] (R A Hulme J); [225], [243], [246]-[247], [251] (Adamson J)

(7)   The cumulative effect of the challenges made by the applicants to the summing up reveal that the summing up was so imbalanced as to deprive the applicants of a fair trial: [1] (Beazley P); [5] (R A Hulme J); [234]-[271] (Adamson J)

In relation to (v)

(8)   The evidence brought against each of Mr Hristovski and Mr Bubanja raised a reasonable doubt as to their guilt: [1] (Beazley P); [10]-[13] (R A Hulme J); [301], [323] (Adamson J)

(9)   Due to the lack of balance in the summing up, the doubts experienced on appeal could not be resolved by any advantage that the jury enjoyed. The guilty verdicts in respect of Mr Bubanja and Mr Hristovski were unreasonable: [1]-[2] (Beazley P); [9], [14] (R A Hulme J); [303]-[304], [324]-[326] (Adamson J).

Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgments of R A Hulme J and Adamson J. I agree with the reasons of Adamson J and the orders her Honour proposes. I also agree with the additional observations of R A Hulme J.
	
	
	In agreeing with their Honours’ reasons, I have reviewed the evidence, including the CCTV footage, and independently have come to the view that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied of the guilt of Mr Hristovski or of the guilt of Mr Bubanja.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I have had the considerable advantage of having read in draft the judgment of Adamson J. In particular I am grateful for her Honour's thorough review of the evidence, the submissions of counsel and the summing up by the trial judge.
	
	
	I agree with Adamson J for the reasons she has given that grounds 1 and 2 of Mr Hristovski’s appeal (Shepherd direction) should be rejected.
	
	
	I also agree that the various grounds otherwise challenging aspects of the trial judge’s summing up should be upheld for the reasons her Honour has provided. (Mr Popovic’s Grounds 1, 2 and 3; Mr Koloamatangi’s Grounds 1 and 2; Mr Bubanja’s Grounds 2, 3 and 3A; and Mr Hristovski’s Ground 3). I confirm that in assessing the balance of the summing up, I have had regard to its overall effect rather than examining the impugned passages piecemeal. Viewed in isolation, some of those passages might not be of great significance but it is the cumulative effect that gives rise to a miscarriage in my view.
	
	
	One theme permeated the summing up; that is, there were suggestions made to the jury about how they might assess the evidence in a manner that might favour the Crown that had not been raised by the prosecutor in his closing address. But, as was conceded by the Crown at the hearing in this Court, there were no matters favouring the applicants that had not been raised in their counsel’s addresses. This is not to say that a judge cannot point out matters that have not been raised in addresses that might assist a jury’s assessment of the evidence. But, of course, great care is required to maintain balance and to avoid putting to the jury anything of such significance that there is unfairness in the inability of defence counsel to respond. Regrettably, in this case there was such unfairness.
	
	
	The unreasonable verdict grounds (Mr Bubanja Ground 1 and Mr Hristovski Ground 4) should be upheld as well. I am in general agreement with the reasoning of Adamson J in relation to this but wish to clarify my view in the light of my own assessment of the evidence.
	
	
	First, however, it is worth noting that some fundamental propositions in relation to an appellate court's treatment of a ground of appeal asserting that a verdict of guilty returned by a jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported were very recently restated by the High Court of Australia in R v Baden-Clay [2016] HCA 35 at [65]-[66]. They included:
	


""It is fundamental to our system of criminal justice in relation to allegations of serious crimes tried by jury that the jury is 'the constitutional tribunal for deciding issues of fact'. Given the central place of the jury trial in the administration of criminal justice over the centuries, and the abiding importance of the role of the jury as representative of the community in that respect, the setting aside of a jury's verdict on the ground that it is ""unreasonable""… is a serious step, not to be taken without particular regard to the advantage enjoyed by the jury over a court of appeal which has not seen or heard the witnesses called at trial. …

With those considerations in mind, a court of criminal appeal is not to substitute trial by an appeal court for trial by jury. Where there is an appeal against conviction on the ground that the verdict was unreasonable, the ultimate question for the appeal court 'must always be whether the [appeal] court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty'.""


	
	I accept that in this case there is a difficulty in having regard to the ""advantage enjoyed by the jury"" when that advantage was potentially impacted adversely by the manner in which it was suggested they might assess the evidence of key prosecution witnesses whose credibility was seriously in issue. This is particularly so in relation to the trial judge's suggestion that they examine reasons ""why would they lie?"" which implicitly carried with it that the evidence of those witnesses might be more readily accepted if the jury could not identify a particular reason. It was, of course, fundamental that it was for the Crown to persuade the jury that they were telling the truth in the essential aspects of their evidence.
	
	
	Mr Taylor’s credibility and reliability were very important matters in the assessment of the case against Mr Hristovski. I am not so troubled about matters of time, the sequence of events and the colour of the gun. In large part, such matters were naturally open to imprecision: timing and sequence of events because of the long period that had elapsed between the events in question and when Mr Taylor first reduced his version to written form (5 years) and when he gave evidence (7 years); and the colour of the gun because of the less than ideal circumstances (poor lighting and the brevity and trauma of the event) in which the witnesses at the nightclub had in which to see and recall the appearance of the weapon. These matters did not inspire confidence in Mr Taylor but I would place less weight on them than the applicants’ counsel did in submissions in this Court, and their trial counsel did in address to the jury, as being destructive of his credibility and reliability.
	
	
	The one thing that particularly gives rise to a reasonable doubt about the guilt of Mr Hristovski in my mind is the seeming impossibility of Mr Taylor’s account of the collection of the gun from Mr Hristovski at Warrawong. (See the analysis by Adamson J under the headings “The sequence of events on the evening of 7 and 8 September 2007” and “The fact and timing of the visit to Mr Hristovski’s on 7-8 September 2007”.) It was a critical element in the case against Mr Hristovski but the evidence is such that there must be a grave doubt that it occurred at all. And the simple fact is, if there is a doubt about that, there is a doubt about Mr Hristovski’s guilt. This assessment may be made without recourse to the jury’s advantage, even if that was appropriate.
	
	
	I cannot add anything useful to the review of the case against Mr Bubanja provided in the judgment of Adamson J. It was a case that was significantly dependent upon acceptance of particular aspects of the evidence of two indemnified witnesses who will be referred to in these reasons as Messrs Taylor and Radz. Mr Taylor’s evidence was problematic in a number of respects and the example I have referred to in relation to the collection of the gun is damaging in relation to his credibility generally. Mr Radz’s evidence was, on my assessment, of even more dubious credibility. The remainder of the case against Mr Bubanja was not enough to restore confidence in those men’s evidence.
	
	
	I am mindful of the Crown’s submissions as to the importance of having regard to the combined force of all aspects of its case. In particular, the telephone evidence certainly provided the Crown with a powerful basis to argue for a joint enterprise being pursued by each of the applicants given the flurry of communications and attempted communications in which they were involved, and the sequence of them, in the critical period leading up to the shooting. The problem, though, is the absence of evidence as to the content of such communications which left the Crown cases in respect of Messrs Hristovski and Bubanja heavily dependent upon the evidence of Messrs Taylor and Radz to fill the gap.
	
	
	Accordingly I have reached the same conclusion as Adamson J that the verdicts of guilty in respect of the applicants Hristovski and Bubanja are unreasonable.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by Adamson J.
	
	
	ADAMSON J: On 29 May 2014, after a trial by jury, Tevi Koloamatangi, Dalibor Bubanja, Zlatan Popovic and Jason Hristovski (the applicants) were found guilty of the murder of Dragan Sekuljica on 8 September 2007. On 30 May 2014 the applicants were found not guilty of shooting Robert Gyles with intent to murder him.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the deceased was shot a number of times by a single gunman, Mr Koloamatangi, just after 3am on Saturday 8 September 2007 as he was leaving Splashes night club in the Wollongong Novotel Hotel to cross the road to get into a taxi. He ran back inside and was followed by the gunman, who shot him again at close range and also shot Mr Gyles, a security guard who was nearby. The gunman fled to a vehicle driven by Peter Taylor. The deceased died at the scene. Mr Gyles survived.
	
	
	The Crown case was that Mr Popovic had arranged the murder following a feud between Zoran Bubanja, the father of Mr Bubanja, and the deceased. The Crown case was that Mr Hristovski had supplied the gun (which belonged to Johnny Radz but was being held by Mr Hristovski for safekeeping) earlier that evening to Mr Koloamatangi and Mr Taylor for the purpose of its being used in a murder that night; and that Mr Bubanja acted as the lookout at Splashes on the night of 7-8 September 2007.
	
	
	Mr Koloamatangi was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment commencing on 1 June 2023; Mr Popovic to a term of 34 years imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 26 years commencing on 21 September 2012 with a further term of 8 years; Mr Bubanja to a term of 34 years imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 26 years commencing on 1 February 2014 with a further term of 8 years; and Mr Hristovski to a term of 29 years imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 22 years commencing on 25 July 2014 with a further term of 7 years.
	
	
	The applicants apply for leave to appeal against their respective convictions for the murder of the deceased. Mr Bubanja seeks leave to appeal against his sentence.
	


The grounds of appeal


	
	Mr Popovic, seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds:
	



	
	A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the trial judge’s directions to the jury to consider, and as to matters to take into account in considering, whether Mr Taylor had lied in his evidence (Summing Up (SU) 106, 107, 114, 117);
	
	
	A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the trial judge’s directions to the jury as to matters they should consider in relation to an argument put by the applicant (SU 119, 120-121); and
	
	
	A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the failure of the trial judge to discharge the jury (SU 121).
	



	
	Mr Koloamatangi, seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds:
	



	
	The trial judge erred in failing properly to warn the jury regarding the unreliability of evidence of:
	



	
	A witness criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceedings (Mr Taylor); and
	
	
	A prison informer (Mr Radz); and
	



	
	The judge’s summing up caused a miscarriage of justice.
	



	
	Mr Bubanja, seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds:
	



	
	The verdict was unreasonable within s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	
	
	The trial judge erred in inviting the jury to consider what reason the Crown witness, Peter Taylor, would have for lying, particularly in the absence of a direction that rejection of any proposed motive did not justify a conclusion that his evidence was truthful;
	
	
	The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury adequately, as required by s 165 Evidence Act 1995, about the possible unreliability of the evidence of the Crown witness, Peter Taylor, in particular by inviting the jury to consider what reason the witness would have for lying, particularly in the absence of a direction that rejection of any proposed motive did not justify a conclusion that Taylor’s evidence was truthful; and
	
	
	The trial judge’s summing up occasioned a miscarriage of justice in that it failed to present a balanced account of the conflicting cases (ground 3A, added with leave).
	



	
	Mr Bubanja also seeks leave to appeal against his sentence on the basis of a “justifiable sense of grievance” in light of the sentences imposed upon Mr Hristovski and Mr Popovic (ground 4).
	
	
	Mr Hristovski, seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds:
	



	
	The trial judge erred in not directing the jury that before they could convict the applicant they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he provided a firearm to the shooter;
	
	
	In the alternative, the trial judge erred in not directing the jury that before they may use the alleged provision of a firearm to the shooter as a circumstance from which to consider the drawing of the inference of guilt, they needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it had occurred;
	
	
	The summing up as a whole failed adequately to convey to the jury the degree of scrutiny required regarding Mr Taylor’s evidence and tended on this issue to reverse the onus of proof; and
	
	
	The verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence.
	



	
	Although the applicants’ grounds of appeal are expressed in different ways, there is considerable overlap between them. The two principal challenges to the convictions are, in the case of Mr Hristovski and Mr Bubanja, that the verdict was unreasonable; and, in the case of each applicant, that the summing up was so unbalanced as to deprive him of a fair trial. The second challenge also incorporates other grounds, some of which are confined to a single applicant, such as Mr Hristovski’s complaint that a direction in accordance with Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 (the Shepherd direction) was not given.
	
	
	Because the grounds concern the summing up and the reasonableness of the verdicts (in the case of Mr Hristovski and Mr Bubanja) in light of the evidence at trial, it is convenient to set out the Crown case at trial and the evidence before turning to the summing up in order that it can be seen in context.
	


The trial


	
	The trial commenced on 2 April 2014. The jury was sent out to deliberate on 22 May 2014, after 32 sitting days. As the unreasonable verdict grounds have been raised only by Mr Bubanja and Mr Hristovski the outline of the evidence at trial will concentrate mainly on the evidence against them and in support of the Crown case generally, rather than evidence that is specific to either Mr Popovic or Mr Koloamatangi (such as the build, skin colour and appearance of the gunman).
	
	
	None of the applicants gave evidence. The principal Crown witnesses were Mr Radz and Mr Taylor, who had both been given indemnities in return for giving evidence at the trial. Mr Taylor was criminally concerned with the shooting of the deceased as, according to his evidence, he had dined with Mr Popovic and Mr Koloamatangi earlier that evening, collected the gun which was used in the shooting from Mr Hristovski; delivered Mr Koloamatangi to the scene by car and driven him away soon after the shooting. Both Mr Taylor and Mr Radz also gave evidence of admissions made by Mr Popovic and Mr Bubanja which implicated them in the shooting.
	
	
	The evidence of other Crown witnesses was either relevant to the background (including a possible motive arising from a dispute between Zoran Bubanja and the deceased following the construction of units at Figtree); or to the events leading up to and immediately after the killing.
	


The background

Mr Radz


	
	Mr Radz lived in the Wollongong area until his imprisonment in 2000 following a conviction for a shooting offence. Before his incarceration he met Mr Popovic through a mutual friend. Mr Radz was in prison from 2000 until his release in April 2006. At about this time he met Mr Bubanja who was then living in Figtree. The two became friends and Mr Radz moved into Mr Bubanja’s house and they spent most days together. Mr Radz also contacted Mr Popovic after his release. Mr Radz heard of the deceased through Mr Bubanja, although he did not meet him. According to Mr Radz, Mr Bubanja told him many times in 2006 that he could not wait until the deceased was released from gaol (which took place in May 2006) so that he could put a bullet in his head.
	
	
	In about May 2006, according to Mr Radz, Zoran Bubanja and Mr Bubanja and two others told him that he had organised a meeting with the deceased at 8pm at Chicko’s and that they wanted Mr Radz to shoot him in the leg. Mr Radz declined the assignment as he was on parole and believed he was being watched by the police.
	
	
	In June 2006 police came to Mr Bubanja’s residence, after which Mr Radz moved to a unit in Wollongong, where he remained until his parole officer told him that he was not to live in the Illawarra area. He subsequently moved to his parents’ house in Sydney.
	


The disagreement between the deceased and Zoran Bubanja


	
	The deceased’s widow, Mrs Sekuljica, gave evidence that the deceased and Zoran Bubanja had been good friends. The deceased was godfather to one of Zoran’s children (Mr Bubanja’s sister). They had both been involved in the construction business and had worked together. Their last joint project, the construction of units at Figtree, some time before 2006, ended their friendship. The deceased told his wife that Zoran owed him money at the end of the project which, to her knowledge, was never paid.
	
	
	In 2006 the deceased and his wife were living with their two children in a unit in Corrimal Street which had a restricted entry activated by an intercom system with a camera. According to Mrs Sekuljica, towards the end of May 2006, Zoran and his sons “Daki” (Mr Bubanja) and Marko and another man (who on the Crown case was Mr Radz) came to the entrance to the unit. She could see the men and hear their conversation. Zoran asked the deceased to come outside. Mrs Sekuljica formed the view that Zoran was intoxicated and told her husband that she did not want him to go outside. The deceased remained inside and switched off his mobile phone.
	
	
	Mr Radz gave a significantly different version of this incident. According to Mr Radz, Zoran Bubanja pressed the buzzer and, when it was not answered, Zoran, Mr Bubanja and the others started kicking the doors and Zoran Bubanja said to the deceased through the intercom, “You fucking dog, you’re dead.”
	


The gun


	
	According to Mr Radz, in about March 2007, he contacted Mr Hristovski to ask him if he could collect an old-looking silver revolver, about 20-25cms long from him and hide it for him. According to Mr Radz, Mr Hristovski agreed and came to collect the gun. Mr Radz said that he had seen the gun once underneath the counter in Mr Hristovski’s workshop but had not seen it since.
	
	
	By April 2007 Mr Radz was married and living in Yagoona. He gave evidence that on Good Friday in April 2007 Mr Popovic told him that Zoran Bubanja was paying him to get him (Mr Radz) to kill the deceased. According to Mr Radz, he refused the job because he had enough dramas. Not long after this discussion, Mr Radz’s parole was revoked and he returned to prison between June and October 2007.
	


Mr Koloamatangi


	
	In April or May 2007 Mr Popovic introduced to family friends of the deceased (Angela Djuraki and her husband) a man known as “Doc” (Mr Koloamatangi) and asked if he could stay the night at their place. Mrs Djuraki and her husband agreed to his staying.
	


In the weeks before the killing


	
	One night in August 2007, Mr Hristovski and Amy Ewen, his then girlfriend, went out with friends to Mamma’s Pizza in Lower Crown Street, Wollongong before going to the Steelers Club. Mamma’s Pizza was run by Mr Popovic’s mother who employed Mr Taylor, who was also known as “Herbie”, as a driver in her business.
	
	
	When they arrived home that evening to Mr Hristovski’s parents’ place in Warrawong where they lived, Ms Ewen went to bed and fell asleep but Mr Hristovski went out again. Ms Ewen said that it was not uncommon for Mr Hristovski to go out without her. On his return he threw something heavy on the bed which hit her legs and woke her up. She sat up and saw that it was a gun, which she thought was a revolver. The light from the window was sufficient for her to see that part of the gun was silver. She saw the gun, or a similar gun, again on many occasions. Sometimes it was kept under the bottom drawer in the bedside table and sometimes in their wardrobe.
	
	
	Mrs Sekuljica gave evidence that about a fortnight before the killing the deceased rang to ask her to pick him up from the North Wollongong Hotel (also known as the North Gong Hotel) and take him to Mamma’s Pizza. He went inside and came out again a minute later. He asked her to take him to get a kebab from a shop in Figtree. On the way to Figtree, the deceased received a phone call from Mr Popovic, in the course of which the deceased called him both a “trader” [traitor] and “Izdanica”, after a Serbian leader who had given up the Serbian people by swapping sides. Mr Popovic told the deceased to meet him at the bushland at Mt Keira. The deceased agreed that he would do so. By the time the deceased and his wife arrived at the kebab shop it was still daylight. Mrs Sekuljica estimated that they arrived there before 6pm.
	
	
	The Crown tendered footage of the beer garden in the grounds of the North Wollongong Hotel on 31 August 2007 which showed the deceased, Zoran Bubanja and Mr Bubanja speaking together for almost half an hour. At times the three were separate from other acquaintances but at other times they were joined by others. The footage shows that they were generally on good terms but there were a few minutes when there was apparent conflict, or at least disagreement, between the deceased and Zoran Bubanja, as manifested by each man sticking out his chest and some slight shoving between them, although there is no evidence of any blow being struck. The timing of the footage is consistent with its having been taken on the same afternoon on which Mrs Sekuljica collected the deceased from the hotel and before the heated conversation between the deceased and Mr Popovic referred to above.
	
	
	Mr Taylor’s evidence was that he had met “Doc” (Mr Koloamatangi) and Mr Bubanja a couple of weeks before the shooting. He already knew Mr Hristovski and the deceased. Mr Taylor’s evidence was that, about two to three weeks before the shooting, he overheard Mr Popovic talking to Mr Bubanja and Mr Hristovski in the Woolworths car park, across the road from Mr Popovic’s unit, which was empty at the time. Mr Taylor said that he heard a reference to “Dragan” (the deceased) and “Dusan” (a friend of the deceased). Mr Bubanja (“Daki”) said that they were dogs and were speaking to police.
	
	
	Mr Taylor’s evidence was that, a week before the shooting, he and Mr Popovic were conversing at the front of Mr Taylor’s unit in Angel Street, Corrimal. Mr Popovic told him: “it is war” and asked him: “are you with me?” to which Mr Taylor responded, “Yes”.
	
	
	On 2 September 2007 Mrs Djuraki returned from a trip overseas. When the deceased visited her at home between 2 September and 7 September 2007 he told her that Zlatan [Popovic] was the biggest traitor in Serbian history.
	
	
	Ms Ewen recalled an occasion a few days before the shooting when Mr Hristovski left his home at Warrawong for Wollongong between 7pm and 10pm. On his return, he told her that he had been to see “friends” at Mamma’s Pizza. He made specific mention of Mr Bubanja and Mr Popovic and may have mentioned “Dragan” [the deceased].
	
	
	Mr Taylor gave evidence that a day or two before the shooting (which was confirmed by a register to be the day before, 6 September 2007) he went to the Collegians Rugby Club by himself. While he was there he joined Mr Koloamatangi and his girlfriend Emma; Mr Bubanja; and Mr Popovic and his fiancée, Emily. He said that he stayed only for half an hour. Mr Taylor accepted in cross-examination that he was only able to be precise about matters such as the date on which he attended the Collegians Rugby Club because detectives had taken him through the register that he had signed on entry.
	


Friday 7 September 2007


	
	On Friday 7 September 2007 Mrs Sekuljica and the deceased were at home after taking their children to school. Later Mrs Sekuljica went out alone. When she returned and found that the deceased had gone out she assumed that he had gone to the North Wollongong pub since he often went there on Fridays. The CCTV footage established that the deceased arrived at the North Wollongong Hotel at 12.26.38pm and left at 14:26:15pm on Friday 7 September 2007.
	


Mr Taylor’s evidence about the events of 7-8 September 2007


	
	Mr Taylor said towards the end of his evidence in chief that he and Mr Popovic had gone to Mr Hristovski’s place at Warrawong together between lunch and the evening on 7 September 2007 for the purpose of Mr Taylor knowing where Mr Hristovski lived. In cross-examination Mr Taylor admitted that he had never made a statement to that effect before including it in his evidence in chief on 10 April 2014. He adhered to his evidence that this visit had occurred although he could not remember what else had occurred during the day on 7 September 2007 and ultimately said that he might have been shown the way to Mr Hristovski’s place the previous day.
	
	
	On the evening of 7 September 2007 there was a dinner at Kings Chinese restaurant in Wollongong which was attended by Mr Popovic and his fiancée, Emily; one of Mr Popovic’s cousins and his girlfriend; Mr Taylor; and Mr Koloamatangi and his girlfriend, Emma. In cross-examination Mr Taylor said that the dinner started between 6 and 7 and finished about 8 or 8.30pm. He said that it was not possible that they were still there at 10pm.
	
	
	Mr Taylor gave evidence in chief that, after the dinner, he had driven Mr Koloamatangi and Emma back to Sydney and dropped Emma somewhere near the Harbour Bridge before driving back to Wollongong with Mr Koloamatangi.
	
	
	According to Mr Taylor, on their return to Wollongong they went to Mr Popovic’s unit. He estimated that they arrived there at about 10.30pm or 11pm. Mr Taylor accepted in cross-examination that the whole of his evidence (about time) was predicated on his being back in Wollongong by 10.30pm or 11pm. Mr Taylor said in evidence in chief and confirmed in cross-examination that he stayed for about an hour at Mr Popovic’s unit before leaving for Mr Hristovski’s house.
	
	
	Mr Taylor’s evidence was that Mr Popovic sat down with him and Mr Koloamatangi. Mr Taylor did not catch all of their conversation as Mr Popovic and Mr Koloamatangi were whispering to each other. In cross-examination, Mr Taylor agreed that he said in three statements to police (4, 6 and 12 June 2012) that he had been told by Mr Popovic during that visit that the deceased was at the “North Gong Hotel”. Mr Popovic asked Mr Taylor to go to Mr Hristovski’s house to pick something up. There was also mention that they were going to go and see Dragan (the deceased) afterwards. Mr Taylor said originally in his evidence in chief that they left at about midnight but later said, also in chief, that they arrived at Mr Hristovski’s place between 11pm and midnight. Mr Taylor estimated that it took about 15 minutes to get from Mr Popovic’s unit in George Street, Wollongong, to Mr Hristovski’s place in Warrawong.
	
	
	Mr Taylor confirmed in cross-examination that he was in the Wollongong CBD by about 12.49am on 8 September 2007.
	
	
	Mr Taylor’s evidence was that he and Mr Koloamatangi drove from Mr Popovic’s unit to Warrawong and parked in the cul-de-sac outside Mr Hristovski’s house in Blaxland Avenue and waited for him to come out. Ten minutes later, Mr Hristovski came out with an old cream coloured bag with a short revolver with six bullets, stamped “Astra” which was silver with a black handle. According to Mr Taylor, Mr Koloamatangi said, “What the fuck is this. What am I going to fucking do with this?” to which Mr Hristovski responded, “That’s all I have.” Mr Taylor asked Mr Hristovski what they were going to do to Dragan (the deceased) and Mr Hristovski motioned with his hand in the shape of a gun.
	
	
	Mr Taylor, who accepted that he had a rough idea by this time that someone was going to be shot, spoke with Mr Koloamatangi about what clothes would be needed. According to Mr Taylor, he and Mr Koloamatangi went from Warrawong to Mr Taylor’s unit in Corrimal (which was 25-35kms north of Mr Hristovski’s house and took about twenty minutes) to collect black pants, gloves and a beanie. Mr Taylor gave Mr Koloamatangi the dark blue hoodie he had been wearing that night and Mr Koloamatangi cut holes in the beanie to turn it into a balaclava. Mr Taylor confirmed in cross-examination that in his statement of 9 July 2012 he told police that he was in his own home for about 20 minutes.
	
	
	Mr Taylor said that about this time they spoke on the phone to Mr Popovic who told them to go to Splashes.
	
	
	Mr Taylor parked in the car park near Splashes and sat in the car smoking. He said that he turned his phone off so that no one could track his whereabouts. In cross-examination, he confirmed that he was sitting in the car for an hour and a half to two hours while Mr Koloamatangi waited outside.
	
	
	Mr Taylor heard about five gunshots, started the car and drove to the exit to the car park. Mr Koloamatangi jumped in the back seat of the car and confirmed that he had done what he had to do. Mr Taylor then drove him back to Sydney.
	
	
	According to Mr Taylor, on the way back to Sydney, Mr Koloamatangi asked him to call Mr Popovic about Mr Koloamatangi’s money. Mr Taylor’s evidence was that he used Mr Koloamatangi’s phone to make the call (having earlier been shown his own telephone records which did not show that such a call had been made from his phone). Mr Popovic told Mr Taylor to come and see him “tomorrow”. Mr Taylor drove Mr Koloamatangi to Mascot before returning home to Corrimal.

Note: DVM means diverted to voicemail; UC means unanswered call


	
	It is common ground that the evidence did not reveal a single call made by a relevant party in the area which came through the Berkeley tower which covered Warrawong (where Mr Hristovski’s then residence was located).
	


The other evidence of what occurred at Splashes night club on the night of Friday 7 September 2007 and early morning of Saturday 8 September 2007


	
	A number of prosecution witnesses who were in and around Splashes at that time gave evidence about the lighting, the weather, the clothing of the gunman and the colour of the gun. Although there were some variations in their evidence, each of them identified the weapon carried by the gunman as being a dark colour.
	
	
	The evidence of Timothy Berry, an expert witness, was that the bullets (recovered from the deceased’s body and Mr Gyles’ body) indicated that the gun was a revolver rather than a pistol and could have been either a 38 special firearm or a 357 Magnum calibre firearm. The rifling effect of the firearm could have been created by many other weapons, including Astras.
	
	
	CCTV footage from cameras outside Splashes established that Mr Bubanja arrived at the night club from 11.27pm with his friends Miodrog Milisic (Big Mickey) and Stanko (Stan) Petrovic. The deceased arrived with others at 12.30am. Mr Bubanja and the deceased, who already knew each other, had contact in the bar of the club and also in the toilets. Mr Harris, an off-duty security guard, heard parts of their discussion and understood that there was a problem that needed to be fixed. There was evidence of the interaction between the two men from witnesses, some of whom did not observe any conflict between them and others who did. Witnesses gave evidence of poor telephone reception inside the night club which necessitated people stepping outside to make and receive calls. The number of calls which were made to Mr Bubanja that night which are recorded as “DVM”, or divert to voicemail is consistent with the poor reception inside Splashes.
	
	
	At about 3am on 8 September 2007 the deceased left Splashes with Mr Bubanja and Big Mickey. Mr Bubanja said in his Electronically Recorded Interview of a Suspected Person (ERISP) that they intended to catch a taxi to a brothel. The deceased made a call to a taxi at about this time. Just outside the premises, the deceased was shot by a man wearing a black balaclava. The deceased ran back inside Splashes and was followed by the gunman. Mr Gyles, a security officer, approached the gunman to restrain him and was himself shot in the elbow. The gunman then shot the deceased a further three times. The deceased died soon afterwards. The gunman left the premises and was driven away by Mr Taylor who was parked nearby.
	
	
	Witnesses spoke of Mr Bubanja being distressed after the shooting.
	


Mr Hristovski’s whereabouts on 7-8 September 2007


	
	On the evening of 7 September 2007 Ms Ewen and Mr Hristovski had something to eat after which they went to their room (in Mr Hristovski’s parents’ house at Warrawong) to watch movies. Ms Ewen fell asleep at about midnight. She woke in the early hours of the morning to find that Mr Hristovski was no longer in bed next to her. There was a phone beside the bed (which was Mr Hristovski’s as she did not have her own mobile phone at the time) which she tried to use to call him but it did not have any credit. At that time Mr Hristovski had two phones. She went back to sleep and was woken by Mr Hristovski getting back to bed. She estimated that he returned some time between 3am and 5am. She could see light coming through the window. He told her that he had gone to pick up Mr Bubanja from a nightclub in Wollongong and take him home. Ms Ewen agreed, in cross-examination, that Mr Hristovski and Mr Bubanja were good “mates” and that Mr Hristovski would often go out at night to give Mr Bubanja a lift.
	


The aftermath


	
	On Saturday 8 September 2007 Ms Ewen heard Mr Hristovski’s brother, Daniel, telling him that he had been at Splashes the previous night and had seen Mr Bubanja there. Mr Hristovski told his brother that he had picked him up from Splashes and taken him home. Later that morning, as a result of a television news bulletin, Ms Ewen first discovered that there had been a shooting in Wollongong. She learned from the television news on Monday 10 September 2007 that the deceased had been shot dead at Splashes in the early hours of Saturday morning.
	
	
	According to Mr Taylor, later that same day, on Saturday 8 September 2007, or the following day, Mr Taylor collected money from Mr Popovic and drove to Sydney to deliver it to Mr Koloamatangi who complained that it was “short”. On several occasions Mr Taylor delivered money to Mr Koloamatangi from Mr Popovic. Mr Taylor said that he was not paid for his involvement in the shooting or for his collecting money and delivering it to Mr Koloamatangi. There was no indication in the evidence of why Mr Taylor had been willing to participate in the murder.
	
	
	Either a couple of days, or a week, after the shooting, Mr Popovic said to Mr Taylor, “Go get the gun and toss it into a pond” in front of “Dusan’s” house. Dusan was a friend of the deceased. When Mr Taylor passed on this message to Mr Koloamatangi he said that he had already disposed of it in a bin at a location in Surry Hills which he referred to as the “Projects”.
	
	
	According to Mr Taylor, he saw Mr Bubanja a week or two after the shooting but there was no conversation about it at that time. Later Mr Popovic and Mr Bubanja visited Mr Taylor at home and took him for a drive in Mr Popovic’s white BMW. Mr Popovic and Mr Bubanja were mostly speaking Serbian, which Mr Taylor did not understand. At one point, Mr Popovic, referring to Mr Taylor, said, “Herbie did it.” Mr Bubanja responded, “You’re a sick fuck” and shook his hand. This conversation was relied on by the Crown to prove that Mr Popovic was involved in the killing and that Mr Bubanja was glad that the deceased had been killed.
	
	
	Some time after the shooting, Ms Ewen got a job in the kitchen at Mamma’s Pizza where Mr Taylor was still working as a delivery driver.
	
	
	Not long after Mr Radz was released from gaol in October 2007, he attended Mr Popovic’s wedding to Emily. Later he visited Mr Popovic with his own wife and newborn daughter. According to Mr Radz, he and Mr Popovic went for a walk in the park opposite the cinemas in the Wollongong CBD in the course of which Mr Popovic told him that an Islander called Doc (who Mr Radz said he knew from 2000) [Mr Koloamatangi] had done the job and that “Herbie” [Mr Taylor] was driving and that Mr Bubanja was the one to make the call for Doc to strike and that he was following the deceased to Splashes. Mr Popovic also told him that Zoran Bubanja paid him $250,000 to arrange it and “Doc” $40,000 to do the job.
	
	
	It was put to Mr Radz by Mr Popovic’s trial counsel that this conversation was a lie and that Mr Radz knew all the details which he had allegedly been told by Mr Popovic from either the prosecution brief or from the newspaper. Mr Radz accepted that he had heard from his wife about the murder but that he did not like reading and only read the headlines. He said the whole incident (at Splashes) did not concern him.
	
	
	The Crown tendered recordings of telephone intercepts made on 23 October 2007 and in particular a conversation in which Mr Hristovski phoned Mr Popovic, who put him on to Mr Radz, who was with him at the time. The purpose of the tender was to show that Mr Radz, Mr Hristovski and Mr Popovic were on good terms, which was consistent with the Crown case that Mr Radz had entrusted his gun to Mr Hristovski and that Mr Popovic had been prepared to discuss the murder with Mr Radz.
	
	
	In early 2008 Ms Ewen’s relationship with Mr Hristovski ended.
	
	
	In July 2008 Mr Radz was imprisoned again and remained in custody until his release on 27 April 2009. He gave evidence that while he was at Parklea Correctional Centre (Parklea) he saw Mr Koloamatangi who was on the other side of a wire fence which separated sections of the prison. According to Mr Radz, Mr Koloamatangi told him that he was in the car park with the balaclava and the gun and that when he got the call he ran up to Splashes, shot the deceased outside and then followed him inside, chased him inside and finished him off, by shooting him in the head and the chest and also shot the security guard too, by accident. According to Mr Radz, Mr Popovic had not paid him what he owed him for the job.
	
	
	In about August 2008 Ms Ewen formed a relationship with Mr Taylor. She told him about the single gun, or similar guns, she had seen in Mr Hristovski’s possession when she was living with him. On 17 April 2009 Ms Ewen was still in a relationship with Mr Taylor when he was assaulted, apparently by Mr Hristovski or his associates. Ms Ewen accompanied Mr Taylor to the police station to report the assault. After he was taken to hospital she made a statement to police about the events relating to the shooting. This was the first statement she had made regarding the shooting. The police told her that Mr Hristovski was angry about Mr Taylor starting a relationship with her. At about this time Ms Ewen and Mr Taylor had a further conversation about the gun she had seen in Mr Hristovski’s possession.
	
	
	Some time between Mr Radz’s release from gaol on 27 July 2009 and his going overseas in 2010, he dined with Mr Bubanja and others at a restaurant in Wollongong. According to Mr Radz, Mr Bubanja told him that he was the one who followed the deceased into Splashes and made the phone call for “Doc” to strike, to which Mr Radz said, “you are a sick cunt”, which were said to be words of congratulations or approval.
	
	
	Some time after 2009 Mr Radz went with Mr Bubanja to Zoran Bubanja’s farm to visit Mr Popovic. According to Mr Radz, Mr Bubanja bragged that he was the “man for the whole operation and that if it wasn’t for him it wouldn’t have happened and that the shooter and driver were moved in from what he was telling him and that his father paid for the whole thing and Zlatan [Mr Popovic] organised the whole thing, the shooter, the weapon and the car.”
	
	
	According to Mr Radz, he saw Mr Koloamatangi in Parklea Gaol in about September or October 2013. They were together with an opportunity to speak for “a good five minutes”, during which time Mr Koloamatangi told Mr Radz that he had not been paid yet for the murder although he had confronted Mr Popovic.
	
	
	According to Mr Radz, he also saw Mr Popovic in Parklea in 2013. Mr Popovic told him that “Herbie” [Mr Taylor] had “turned dog” against him for the “Splashes murder”.
	


Mr Taylor’s prior statements


	
	On 1 June 2012 Mr Taylor met with Detectives Ritchie and Santivalle in the course of which they intimated that they might be able to get permission to take an induced statement from him, which he understood meant that nothing in the statement could be used against him. The interview on 1 June 2012 was not recorded but Mr Taylor gave police, for the first time, an outline of what he might be able to tell them. Mr Taylor did not remember any details of the conversation with the detectives that day. When Detective Ritchie had finished the interview he made notes of what he remembered Mr Taylor saying to him, including that he had collected the gun on the night of 7 September 2007 after the dinner at Kings in Wollongong and before the first trip to Sydney. Detective Ritchie explained that he did not take notes in the course of the discussion because he found that potential witnesses tended to be more forthcoming if no notes were made during the first interview, before it was determined whether an induced statement was taken.
	
	
	Mr Taylor accepted in cross-examination that he had made induced statements on 4, 6, 14, 21 June 2012; 9 and 30 July 2012; 10 and 20 September 2012; and 10 January 2013.
	


Mr Bubanja’s police statements


	
	Mr Bubanja made a statement to police on 8 September 2007. He described the sequence of events on the evening of 7 September 2007, including the arrival of the deceased at Splashes about an hour or so after he arrived. He said that he had spent a considerable time talking to the deceased. He described leaving the premises with the deceased and their plan to catch a taxi together to another venue. He described the shooting of the deceased. He went straight from the scene of the murder to the police station to make the statement.
	
	
	Mr Bubanja was interviewed by Detective Chambers on 21 November 2012. He was asked what his relationship was with Mr Popovic, to which he responded, “I just met him.” He said that he could not recall why he had phoned him that night or what Mr Popovic said to him. He was asked whether it was possible that he rang Mr Popovic on the night of the murder and he said he could not remember. He also said he could not remember telling Mr Popovic that the deceased was at Splashes and could not comment on the proposition that he was there keeping a look-out for the deceased. He denied any prior knowledge or, or involvement in, the murder.
	


Challenges to Mr Taylor’s credibility


	
	Substantial challenges were made by all defence counsel to Mr Taylor’s credibility. He admitted that he had been involved in drug dealing, as a result of which he was in fear for his life from a drug dealer called Simon De Witt, whom he used to drive to and from Sydney once or twice a week to purchase ice.
	
	
	Mr Taylor had been given the following indemnity:
	


“TO   PETER TAYLOR

Indemnity under Criminal Procedure Act 1986, section 32

If you actively co-operate in criminal proceedings pending against: Zlatan POPOVIC, Dalibor BUBANJA, Tevi KOLOAMATANGI and Jason HRISTOVSKI for the offences of murder and shoot with intent to murder;

AND if your evidence there is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

I grant you indemnity from prosecution for:

1.   Murder of Dragan Sekuljica on 8 September 2007;

2.   Shoot at with intent to murder Robert Gyles on 8 September 2007;

3.   . . .

4.   Any associated offence in respect of matters relevant to the proceedings and covered by your evidence in the proceedings.”


	
	Mr Taylor’s credibility was challenged on the basis of differences between what he told Detectives Ritchie and Santivalle on 1 June 2012 (as recorded in a file note prepared after the interview) and his evidence. The principal differences relied on were:
	



	
	Mr Taylor was recorded as having told the officers on 1 June 2012 that he had collected the gun from Mr Hristovski before driving to Sydney to drop off Mr Koloamatangi’s girlfriend, whereas in his evidence he said that he collected it after they returned to Wollongong; and
	
	
	In the notes of the interview on 1 June 2012 there is no record of Mr Taylor mentioning that he returned to his home to supply clothing for Mr Koloamatangi.
	



	
	Mr Taylor agreed that he had never, before giving his evidence in chief in April 2014, suggested that he had driven with Mr Popovic to Mr Hristovski’s place before the killing and had realised when giving his evidence in chief that he must have known where it was when he went there later that evening. Mr Taylor asserted that it was only when he saw the paper the next day that he realised that the person who had been shot dead at Splashes was the deceased.
	
	
	Mr Taylor was cross-examined about being approached by police on a number of occasions prior to 2012 when he decided to answer their questions. Mr Taylor confirmed in cross-examination that at the committal hearing in May 2013 he had an independent recollection of the times of the dinner and the trip to Sydney and the return to Wollongong on the night of 7 September 2007.
	
	
	Mr Ramage QC, trial counsel for Mr Popovic, put to Mr Taylor that in his statement of 14 June 2012 he had said that between the time he left Mr Popovic’s unit to collect the gun from Mr Hristovski until he spoke to Mr Popovic after the killing he did not have any other conversations with Mr Popovic. Mr Taylor responded that he thought that he had included in his statement the call from Mr Popovic telling him to go to Splashes night club.
	
	
	Mr Taylor confirmed in cross-examination by Ms Davenport SC, trial counsel for Mr Koloamatangi, that there were no calls recorded on Exhibit G which indicate that Mr Taylor made any telephone calls during the whole of 7 September 2007 or the morning of 8 September 2007 apart from an unconnected call to the phone of Tara Wilton, being a friend for whom he regularly obtained drugs. She put that the absence of record was inconsistent with what he had said in his police statement of 9 July 2012 that he rang Mr Popovic from outside Mr Hristovski’s place to ask him to ring Mr Hristovski to tell him that they had arrived. Mr Taylor identified the call at 00.49.58 in Exhibit G as being the one in which Mr Koloamatangi had phoned Mr Popovic to tell him that they were outside Mr Hristovski’s house.
	
	
	Trial counsel for Mr Koloamatangi cross-examined Mr Taylor about his evidence in chief that, on the way back to Sydney after the shooting, Mr Koloamatangi asked him to call Mr Popovic about Mr Koloamatangi’s money and that Mr Taylor used Mr Koloamatangi’s phone to make the call. Mr Taylor agreed that his first version could have been that he had used his own phone but that it may have been pointed out to him that this did not fit with the phone records (which did not show that he had made any such call). Mr Taylor accepted that the police had gone over “the time line” with him and pointed out that some of the statements he had made did not fit with some of the other evidence they had.
	
	
	Mr Taylor agreed in cross-examination by trial counsel for Mr Bubanja that he only mentioned the gathering in the Woolworth’s car park in his induced statement of 4 June 2012 and that in that statement he had not mentioned that anyone had referred to “Dragan”. He agreed that he referred to “Dragan” as being a name he had heard mentioned in the fortnight prior to the shooting and had not put it in context of the gathering in the car park. Mr Taylor agreed that there was no mention in his statement of 4 June 2012 that Daki or Dalibor Bubanja had been at the Collegians on 6 September 2007.
	
	
	Mr Taylor agreed in cross-examination by Mr Hristovski’s trial counsel that he had been the victim of an attempted kidnapping on 17 April 2009 as a result of which he was assaulted and hospitalised. Shortly after Mr Taylor had provided a statement to police on 17 April 2009 about the assault, he was interviewed by Detectives O’Donohoe and Noble from the Homicide Squad regarding the death of the deceased. Detective O’Donohoe suggested to Mr Taylor that Mr Hristovski might have been involved in the assault because he was angry that Mr Taylor was having a relationship with Ms Ewen.
	
	
	Mr Taylor did not provide the detectives with any information about the killing when he was interviewed on 17 April 2009 about the assault on that day; on 1 July 2009 when he was contacted by Detective Chambers (the officer in charge of the murder investigation); or indeed at any time prior to 1 June 2012. At the time Mr Taylor made the induced statements in 2012 he was no longer in a relationship with Ms Ewen.
	


The relationship between Mr Taylor and Ms Ewen


	
	Mr Taylor agreed in cross-examination by trial counsel for Mr Hristovski that, as at September 2007, Ms Ewen lived with Mr Hristovski and his parents at Blaxland Avenue, Warrawong. He agreed that he had worked with Ms Ewen at Mamma’s Pizza towards the end of 2007, at which time she had been living with her mother at Dapto. He formed a relationship with Ms Ewen in August 2008 and had dropped her at Dapto on a few occasions. He denied that he had ever dropped her off at the Blaxland Avenue address.
	


Challenges to Mr Radz’s credibility


	
	The indemnity granted to Mr Radz by the Attorney-General was tendered in evidence and provided in part:
	


“TO   Johnny Radz

Indemnity under Criminal Procedure Act 1986, section 32

If you actively co-operate in criminal proceedings pending against:

Zlatan POPOVIC, Dalibor BUBANJA and Tevi KOLOAMATANGI for the offences of murder and shoot at with intent to murder on 8 September 2007;

[four other unrelated incidents involving murder or shooting were listed]

…

AND if your evidence there is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

I grant you indemnity from prosecution for:

1.   Fire firearm at dwelling house and reckless disregard for safety 17 October 2012;

2.   Discharge firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on 9 February 2013;

3.   Use unauthorised pistol on 9 February 2013; and

4.   Knowingly deal with proceeds of crime, namely $11500 cash on 18 February 2013.”


	
	Mr Radz accepted that he had been involved in organised crime and gangs for at least part of his adult life. At times he had held weapons for the purposes of providing them, when required, for an outlaw motor cycle gang. He was cross-examined about his criminal history, which began when he was 17. He accepted that in 1996 and 1998 he committed offences of robbery with aggravation, stealing and two assaults but disagreed that these met the description of “organised crime”. Mr Radz agreed that in 2000 he was initially charged with attempted murder, damage property by fire, possess and use unregistered firearm and shoot at persons with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm and two counts of malicious wounding and was ultimately sentenced for shooting at a person with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, with three counts of malicious wounding, damage property by fire and the possession of an unregistered firearm taken into account. He agreed he told police the shooting involved discharging the “full clip” of a Beretta pistol towards a person in a car but maintained the person was not badly injured. He was sentenced to nine years with a minimum of six years imprisonment. Mr Radz agreed that on 5 July 2001 he was also convicted of possession of a knife in a public place.
	
	
	When Mr Popovic’s trial counsel put to Mr Radz that he made up the admissions attributed to the applicants because he wanted to gain from the reward of $200,000 offered for information about the murder, he said that he only became aware of the reward when he was half way through his statement and that he would not put his life in danger for $200,000. Mr Radz agreed that he had gone to prison in 2000 for a crime that involved kneecapping and that he had been charged with the same crime in 2013. He agreed that he knew when he was arrested in February 2013 that he could get a reduction in his sentence if he gave assistance to the police because the police talked to him about it on the night he was arrested.
	
	
	Mr Radz was cross-examined extensively about previous statements he had made to the Crime Commission which he accepted were untrue. Counsel for each of the applicants cross-examined Mr Radz extensively on his credibility, largely on the basis of his prior inconsistent statements. Mr Radz agreed that he had prepared a time line of events to assist his recollection and that there was no mention of Mr Hristovski or of his nickname of Pigeon in the time line for 2007.
	
	
	Mr Radz gave evidence that Mr Bubanja told him many times in 2006 that he could not wait until the deceased was released from gaol (which took place in May 2006) so that he could put a bullet in his head and that seeing him (Mr Radz) was a “dream come true”. Although Mr Radz said that there were 100 witnesses, this appeared to be an exaggeration, particularly as Mr Radz could not name one.
	
	
	He was cross-examined by Mr Hristovski’s trial counsel about why he would have given the gun to Mr Hristovski whom he hardly knew and whom he did not pay to come and collect the gun.
	


Other evidence


	
	The reward note was tendered by Mr Corish, trial counsel for Mr Hristovski:
	


“Office of the Minister for Police,

Sydney

MURDER

TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($200,000)

REWARD

ON the 8th September 2007, Dragan SEKULJICA, aged 28 years, left the licensed premises ‘Splashes Nightclub’ at about 3.00am with two associates. At this time Dragan SEKULJICA was shot by a person unknown and died at the scene.

Notice is hereby given that a reward of up to two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) will be paid by the Government of New South Wales for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the death of Dragan SEKULJOCA.

The allocation of this reward will be at the sole discretion of the Commissioner of Police.”

The defence cases


	
	At the close of the Crown case on 15 May 2014, counsel for all applicants other than Mr Hristovski announced that they did not propose to call any evidence. Mr Corish called Mr Hristovski’s brother, Christopher, who gave evidence that he did not ever see a silver revolver at the premises at Cringila from which the family business operated. The witness gave evidence that he took over the business from his father in about June 2007 at which time he moved the business from Cringila to Unanderra and that he never saw a gun at those premises either.
	


Discussion about directions prior to addresses and the summing up


	
	Trial counsel requested warnings with respect to the evidence of Mr Taylor and Mr Radz. Mr Ramage sought warnings under s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), including a “prison informer” warning in relation to Mr Radz’s evidence and a warning about “admissions” and “hearsay”.
	
	
	The trial counsel for Mr Hristovski requested a Shepherd direction in relation to Mr Hristovski’s provision of the gun. The trial judge said that he was inclined to give such a direction although the Crown said that the jury would only need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that matter if the jury was relying on his provision of the gun alone as evidence of Mr Hristovski’s involvement.
	


Counsel’s addresses

The Crown address

Evidence generally relied upon in support of the Crown case


	
	The Crown summarised the events relevant to its case against all of the applicants by referring to the following:
	



	
	the falling out between Zoran Bubanja and the deceased over the construction of a block of units at some stage prior to 2006;
	
	
	the approach in May 2006 by Zoran Bubanja, Mr Bubanja and Marko Bubanja and Mr Radz to the deceased’s unit (shortly after the deceased was released from gaol) requesting that he come outside;
	
	
	the meeting on 31 August 2007 at the North Wollongong Hotel between Mr Bubanja and his father and the deceased where they appeared to be engaged in a heated exchange, following which there was a telephone call between the deceased and Mr Popovic in which the deceased called him a traitor;
	
	
	the presence at the North Wollongong Hotel on 7 September 2007 of the deceased and Mr Bubanja at different times in the course of the afternoon and evening;
	
	
	the dinner at Kings Chinese restaurant on the evening of 7 September 2007 which was attended by Mr Popovic and his fiancée; Mr Koloamatangi and his girlfriend; a cousin of Mr Popovic and his girlfriend; and Mr Taylor;
	
	
	the return of Mr Taylor and Mr Koloamatangi from Sydney to Wollongong accompanied by phone contact with Mr Popovic to whom a visit was paid, followed by the collection of the gun from Mr Hristovski’s residence and the journey to Mr Taylor’s place to collect clothes;
	
	
	the arrival of Mr Taylor and Mr Koloamatangi at Splashes and their lying in wait for the deceased during a period where there was considerable contact between Mr Popovic, Mr Hristovski and several attempts to contact Mr Bubanja, which were, on occasion, successful;
	
	
	the departure of Mr Hristovski from his residence in the middle of the night while Ms Ewen was asleep and his subsequent return in the early hours of the morning;
	
	
	the interchange between the deceased and Mr Bubanja in the toilet at Splashes;
	
	
	the shooting of the deceased shortly after he had called a taxi on the way out of Splashes;
	
	
	the flurry of telephone calls shortly prior to 3am on 8 September 2007;
	
	
	Mr Taylor driving Mr Koloamatangi back to Sydney from Wollongong shortly after 3am on 8 September 2007.
	



	
	The Crown addressed the jury on its case with respect to each of the applicants in turn.
	


Evidence relied upon in respect of the Crown case against Mr Bubanja


	
	As against Mr Bubanja, the Crown relied on (1) and (2) above and referred to the evidence that Mr Radz lived at Mr Bubanja’s place from April 2006 until June 2006. The Crown also relied on (3) and (4), (7), (9), (10) and (11) above and the incident at Chicko’s when Mr Radz had been asked to shoot the deceased in the leg but had declined the assignment. The Crown submitted that there was ongoing discord between the deceased and Zoran Bubanja, which escalated at the end of August 2007 and continued until the night of the killing on 7-8 September 2007.
	
	
	The Crown referred to: Mr Taylor’s evidence of the gathering in the Woolworth’s car park about a week before the shooting in which the deceased was referred to as a “dog”; the conversation after the shooting in which Mr Bubanja shook Mr Taylor’s hand in recognition for having killed the deceased; and Mr Harris’ evidence about the exchange in the toilets between the deceased and Mr Bubanja in which there was a reference to a problem that needed to be fixed. The Crown also relied on what Mr Bubanja had said in his interview with Detective Chambers on 21 November 2012 and in particular that he had just met Mr Popovic shortly prior to the murder when the evidence established that they had known each other for much longer.
	


Evidence relied upon in respect of the Crown case against Mr Hristovski


	
	As against Mr Hristovski, the Crown relied on “two separate pieces of evidence”: first, the supply of the gun that was used to kill the deceased and to shoot Mr Gyles; and, secondly, Mr Hristovski’s presence in the vicinity of Splashes in the early hours of the morning leading up to and surrounding the time of the shooting and the number of telephone calls to which he was a party. The Crown said that the first piece of evidence would be sufficient for a conviction if the jury was satisfied that the gun was supplied with the intention that it be used in the murder. The Crown continued:
	


“The second piece of evidence, the involvement by leaving his home and going to the vicinity of Splashes Nightclub, either alone or together, with the evidence of the supply of the gun, if you are satisfied that that was done with a view to assisting those that were intending to carry out the shooting, by means of being a conduit to the information as to the whereabouts and movements of the intended victim, then that would give rise to liability by way of participation in that common enterprise, provided of course you were satisfied that he was a participant in that enterprise.”

[Emphasis added.]


	
	The Crown referred to Mr Radz’s evidence of supplying a gun to Mr Hristovski and his evidence that he had seen the gun at the workshop of Mr Hristovski’s family business. He also referred to Ms Ewen’s evidence about the gun in the bedroom as well as the different descriptions of the gun by eyewitnesses at Splashes (that it was black) and by Ms Ewen (that it was silver) and Mr Radz (that it was silver, old and 20-25cms long). The Crown relied on Mr Taylor’s evidence of going to Mr Hristovski’s place with Mr Koloamatangi to collect the gun.
	
	
	The Crown referred to Detective Ritchie’s note of the informal interview which took place with Mr Taylor on 1 June 2012 and suggested that he might have recorded events in a different order from the way they had been related to him by Mr Taylor. The Crown contended that the version recorded in the note, that they had collected the gun before going to Sydney to drop off Mr Koloamatangi’s girlfriend, was unlikely and could be explained by Detective Ritchie having recorded the events in the wrong order.
	
	
	It is not necessary to detail the evidence relied on by the Crown against Mr Koloamatangi or Mr Popovic in addition to the general evidence referred to above as neither applicant sought leave to appeal on the ground that his verdict was unreasonable or not able to be supported.
	
	
	The Crown referred to Mr Taylor’s credibility in the context of the telephone records in the following terms:
	


“So, you have this combination of events where Peter Taylor says, look, I was the driver. I drove Doc to Sydney to drop his girlfriend off. I drove back to Wollongong afterwards with Doc. We know Doc is back in Wollongong. He is using his phone. The Splashes events occur. The phone is used to ring Zlatan Popovic. Peter Taylor says that is the call where Doc asked for money. Then the calls go back to Sydney to around the Mascot area and then Peter Taylor makes his way back to Wollongong. I might say this Peter Taylor you remember, became a witness for the plaintiff in 2012 and his statement details the events shortly before and the night of the shooting murder of Dragan Sekuljica.

He would not have known that the phone records tracked him in the way that they did. He would not know that the phone records tracked phone calls made by Doc and phone calls made by him and tracked the movements that various people also made. The reason I mention that is because if Peter Taylor were making this up, if he were not involved and not involved as the driver for Doc that night at the request of Zlatan Popovic, how could he know about the events of that night in sufficient detail to be able to describe those movements and those telephone calls taking place.

As it turns out, they support his figment of imagination, fantasy if that is what you were to be asked to regard it as.

He might be in error as to some of the timing, some of the details of the timing, and that is not difficult to understand given that he made his statement in 2012, about events five years before. It is important to remember that. I'm not saying that is an excuse for inaccuracy but it is accuracy where accuracy counts where you are being asked to say - Well that couldn't have happened because he has made a mistake about the time.

Now he could not have known that the police had the records of these phones, that they have or been able to do the analysis of phone records that they have and, they wouldn't match up unless he had been involved as the driver of Doc that night.”


	
	The Crown also referred to the calls involving Mr Hristovski which indicate (by reference to the various towers) that he had travelled through Wollongong CBD and to Brokers Point and Thirroul (which cover the area where Splashes is located) and also in the Berkeley area (which covers Warrawong, where he lived).
	


The addresses of defence counsel

Address on behalf of Mr Hristovski


	
	Mr Corish replayed video footage and cross-referenced it to the phone records. He submitted that the Crown had not excluded an innocent explanation: namely, that Mr Hristovski was out with friends on a Friday night and communicated from time to time on the phone with them and others.
	
	
	Mr Corish also relied on the proven falsity of the following aspects of Mr Taylor’s evidence:
	



	
	that the call made by Mr Koloamatangi at 00.49.58 was made outside Mr Hristovski’s house, in light of the evidence that: the tower through which it passed was north of the area within which Warrawong was located; and no call at a relevant time was made by Mr Taylor or Mr Koloamatangi through the tower that covered Warrawong; and
	
	
	that he had switched off his phone while he was in the car park outside Splashes when Exhibit G recorded a call at 1.02.18 on 8 September 2007 which was made from his phone.
	



	
	Mr Corish submitted that Mr Taylor and Mr Radz were both skilled liars. He relied on Mr Taylor’s motive to harm Mr Hristovski by reason of the assault on him that took place in April 2009, which he and Ms Ewen believed was as a result of her former relationship with Mr Hristovski. Mr Corish relied on the inconsistency between Detective Ritchie’s note of the informal interview on 1 June 2012 and Mr Taylor’s evidence at trial as to the sequence of events on 7 and 8 September 2007. He also relied on the disparity between the descriptions of the gun given by the eye witnesses at Splashes (that it was dark); Ms Ewen’s evidence (that it was a silver revolver); Mr Taylor’s evidence (silver gun); and Mr Radz’s evidence of the gun he handed over (old silver revolver 20-25cms in length). Mr Corish also referred to examples of inconsistencies in Mr Taylor’s evidence.
	
	
	Mr Corish read out extracts from the evidence of Mr Radz in support of his submission that he was a skilled liar and submitted that Mr Radz’s evidence was so unreliable that it could not support Mr Taylor’s evidence or the Crown case.
	


Address on behalf of Mr Bubanja


	
	Mr Austin, trial counsel for Mr Bubanja, referred to CCTV footage of the incident at North Wollongong Hotel on 31 August 2007 and replayed parts of the footage at Splashes around the time of the murder. Mr Austin submitted that there was nothing about Mr Bubanja’s conduct that evening that indicated that he was aware that there was about to be an attempt to shoot and kill the deceased.
	
	
	Mr Austin relied on the fact that the last call recorded as having been made (as opposed to received) by Mr Bubanja on 8 September 2007 was made at 00.17.47, which was before the deceased arrived at Splashes and therefore could not have been the call to tip off Mr Koloamatangi that the deceased was either there or was leaving. The next call initiated by Mr Bubanja was not until 11.00.46 on 8 September 2007.
	
	
	Mr Austin submitted that, even if Mr Bubanja had told Mr Popovic that the deceased was at Splashes during the 18-second call initiated by Mr Popovic at 00.50.56, more was required to establish that he was part of a joint criminal enterprise. Mr Austin also referred to the fact that Zoran Bubanja, with whom the deceased was alleged to have a disagreement, had not been charged and that it was Zoran Bubanja who was said to owe money to the deceased. Mr Austin submitted that bad blood between the men could not reliably be inferred from the CCTV footage taken at the North Wollongong Hotel since the body language may have reflected no more than a transient disagreement.
	
	
	Mr Austin described Mr Radz’s evidence of admissions said to have been made by Mr Bubanja as “an evil concoction” by a man with every reason to lie. He also relied on the disparity between Mr Radz’s evidence of the content of the admissions and the objective facts, including that, according to Mr Radz, Mr Bubanja said that he followed the deceased to Splashes and called Mr Popovic to tell him that the deceased was there, when the evidence established that Mr Bubanja arrived at Splashes before the deceased and that Mr Bubanja did not call Mr Popovic at all from Splashes. Mr Austin told the jury that there was not enough evidence against Mr Bubanja unless they accepted Mr Radz’s evidence, which was so exaggerated and unreliable that they could not safely accept it.
	
	
	Mr Austin referred to Mr Taylor’s evidence and submitted that the evidence of “Dragan” being a “dog” in a conversation involving Mr Bubanja was too vague to be reliable as a motive, as was the evidence of the gathering in the Woolworth’s car park. Mr Austin said that the conversation in which Mr Popovic was said to have told Mr Bubanja that “Herbie [Mr Taylor] did it” cannot be a reference to the deceased’s murder since Mr Taylor obviously did not do it. Furthermore Mr Austin submitted that the conversation did not support Mr Bubanja’s involvement in the murder.
	
	
	Mr Austin submitted that the CCTV footage from Splashes showed that the deceased and Mr Bubanja were on good terms and that it appeared that Mr Bubanja was going to leave with the deceased in a taxi.
	


Address on behalf of Mr Koloamatangi


	
	Ms Davenport took the jury through Ex G and submitted that it showed that Mr Taylor’s evidence about his movements that night was wrong. She highlighted the fact that, although Exhibit G showed a “flurry” of telephone calls at the relevant time, none was to Mr Koloamatangi, whom one might expect to be the most important person to whom contact ought be made. Ms Davenport highlighted Mr Taylor’s motive to lie arising from the fact that he was pulled over by police in 2012 with drugs in the car and wanted and needed the indemnity. She submitted that all that the Crown had against Mr Koloamatangi was Mr Taylor’s evidence.
	
	
	As Mr Koloamatangi’s application does not include an unreasonable verdict ground, it is not necessary to summarise his trial counsel’s address further.
	


Address on behalf of Mr Popovic


	
	Mr Ramage adopted and expanded on the submissions of other counsel regarding Mr Taylor and Mr Radz’s credibility. As Mr Popovic’s application does not include an unreasonable verdict ground, it is not necessary to summarise his trial counsel’s address.
	


The summing up

The directions of law and warnings


	
	At the beginning of the summing up the trial judge gave a number of directions and warnings, including a direction relating to multiple accused. At SU 3, the trial judge said:
	


“I will add an eighth direction. . . . Here there are four accused, and in effect four trials, and you have to consider the situation of each of them. Obviously there are some matters and evidence common to all of them, but it is important to recognise that you have to consider the situation of each accused individually, and decide whether in the case of that individual your verdict should be guilty or not guilty.”


	
	The trial judge, after giving the standard directions of law including those regarding onus and standard of proof, gave the jury a document setting out the elements of the offence and what is required to establish a joint criminal enterprise. His Honour then gave four warnings, the first three of which were given in response to the requests made by defence counsel referred to above. His Honour prefaced these warnings with the following words (SU 13):
	


“Because of the nature of the evidence or some of the evidence the Crown relies upon the law requires that I give you certain warnings.”


	
	The first warning was in relation to Mr Taylor’s evidence. The trial judge said in part (SU 14):
	


“The warning is that the evidence to which I am about to refer may be unreliable and you need to exercise caution before deciding to accept it or place weight upon it. In the case of Mr Taylor, the Crown relies upon the evidence of someone who has admitted to being criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the present proceedings.

. . .

Such a person may want to shift the blame from himself on to others and to justify his or her own conduct. In the process the witness may construct untruthful stories which tend to play down his or her own part in the crime and play up the parts of others, even going so far as to blame quite innocent people. He may make false claims as to the involvement of others out of motives of revenge or a feeling of dislike or hostility. He may be motivated to give false evidence in order to qualify for reduction in any sentence he may be facing, or, in Mr Taylor's case, to obtain immunity from prosecution of himself.

Experience has shown that once a witness has given a version to police inculpating someone else the witness may feel locked into that version even if it contained inaccuracies or even if it is substantially untrue.

Of course there may be other reasons which an accused or Court does not know. There is no onus on an accused to establish such reasons. The important thing for you to recognise is the need for caution.”


	
	The second warning was in relation to Mr Radz’s evidence. The trial judge said (SU 15):
	


“In the case of Mr Radz, he also may be motivated to give false evidence in order to secure his immunity from prosecution, or, at least originally, to increase his chances of obtaining bail. Again, once having given a version to the police or Crime Commission inculpating an accused he may feel locked into that version even if it contained inaccuracies or was substantially untrue.

It is relevant for you to bear in mind Mr Radz's criminal past and that people like Mr Radz are liable to the be affected by the standards and culture of prison or criminal society where respect for the law and telling the truth may not be valued in the way as is commonly the case outside prison. And of course in his case also there may be other reasons which the accused or the Court does not know. As I said, there is no onus on an accused to establish such reasons. Again recognise the need for caution.”


	
	The third warning was a further warning about Mr Radz’s evidence in which his Honour said (SU 15):
	


“A further reason for caution in the case of Mr Radz is that much of his evidence against the accused consists of admissions said to have been made by them. This is another area where evidence may be unreliable. It is very easy to assert that in the course of conversation between two persons one made some sort of confession to a crime and it is difficult to prove such statements false.”


	
	The fourth warning, the giving of which had not been raised with counsel earlier, was sought neither by defence counsel, nor by the Crown. It was in the following terms (SU 15-16):
	


“A fourth area where caution is required is that portion of evidence that consists of hearsay evidence. An example of hearsay evidence is what the police or the crime scene investigators say that Mr Taylor or Mr Radz have said out of court. That evidence suffers from the disadvantage that it is second hand. What was said originally was probably given in circumstances less formal than those here and so much care may not have been given as we commonly expect in courts and when the listener may not have correctly heard or understood or remembered what was being said. Of course in this case notes were generally taken at the time or soon afterwards, but the potential for inaccuracies still exists. Bear that in a mind and as I have said, exercise care.

I will say more about it when I come to it, but you may remember that one of the police officers who prepared the investigator's notes of conversations with Mr Taylor which occurred on the 1st of June said in relation to two of those paragraphs, dealing with the order in which Mr Taylor said he went to Sydney and the picking up the gun occurred, the investigator said, 'I may have those paragraphs around the wrong way', or words to that effect. You have got the note. You don't know here, as you didn't hear what Mr Taylor said to those investigators. You have their record. You have what Mr Taylor says now that he said. And if you compare what he said now with what is Taylor in the notes there is an inconsistencies. The problem of hearsay evidence is you don't know often how an inconsistency or the problem arose.”


	
	The substance of the fourth warning was reiterated later in the summing up (SU 104).
	
	
	The trial judge informed the jury about issues that may arise with recollection and the process of drawing inferences. His Honour said (SU 21):
	


“Another suggestion I would make is that when you incline to a conclusion on a particular topic, you then consciously set about considering what arguments are there to the contrary, or what reasons are there why you might be wrong. Again, I come to an example in this case. It is suggested that Mr Taylor and Mr Radz have concocted much of what they have said, with a view to obtaining benefits such as immunity, or such as a reward, and clearly, that is something which you have to take into account. But do examine it. All right, if Mr Taylor is going to concoct a completely cock and bull story, why has he put in all the things he has? Why mention North Wollongong Club? He knew the murder occurred at Splashes. Why even mention North Wollongong, and then have to work out some way of change of address? Wouldn't it have been simpler if he just said, ""I was told to go to Splashes"". I only illustrate it by saying, before you draw a conclusion, look to see what arguments you can think of that are against that conclusion.”


	
	At the conclusion of the first day of the summing up, in the absence of the jury, counsel for Mr Koloamatangi submitted that the warning regarding Mr Radz was inadequate in that it did not warn the jury of the potential unreliability of evidence given by prison informers of admissions made by accused persons (SU 23).
	


The summary of evidence

The circumstances of the shooting


	
	On the second day of the summing up, the trial judge commenced the summary of the evidence. His Honour addressed the circumstances of the shooting, including the description of the gun and the gunman; the “actions of the gunman in so far as they may bear on the reliability of Mr Taylor’s evidence”; and the actions of the gunman as demonstrating an intention to kill. His Honour catalogued the versions of witnesses as to the weather; the number of shots fired; the build and skin colour of the gunman; and what he was wearing.
	
	
	The trial judge (SU 34) referred to the evidence of Adrian Castagna, the Master of Ceremonies at Splashes that night, and read a passage from the transcript of his cross-examination in which he described the gun as “black coloured”, following which the exchange occurred:
	


“Q. And I don't think my friend asked you, were you able to see the colour of that?

A. No.

Q. In fact, you said it was a black coloured weapon?

A. Yes.

Q. And that was your recollection?

A. That's pretty much all I remember from this point.

Q. That is fixed in your mind?

A. Yes.

Q. The gun was black coloured?

A. It was inescapable.”


	
	His Honour then said, “Whether he is talking about the gun was inescapable, or the colour was inescapable, is not clear.” His Honour then read out the same questions and answers again (SU 34).
	


The interaction between the deceased and Mr Bubanja in the toilet and at the bar of Splashes night club


	
	His Honour summarised the evidence of Mr Harris (SU 35), who came across two men at the bar (one of whom was identified as being Mr Bubanja) and later, the same two men in the toilet. There was a discussion between the two men in which they referred to a problem that needed to be, or would be, fixed. His Honour referred to evidence about a conversation between Mr Bubanja and the deceased at the bar which suggested some conflict.
	


The weapon used in the shooting


	
	His Honour referred to the evidence of Mr Berry, the ballistics expert (SU 37), that no fired cartridge cases were found at the scene, which, together with the analysis of the bullets (which were extracted from Mr Gyles and the deceased’s body), indicated that the weapon was a revolver rather than a pistol.
	
	
	The trial judge referred to the evidence of Ms Ewen (SU 37). His Honour reminded the jury of her evidence that she had first seen a gun, which she described as silver, in August 2007 and had seen a gun (whether the same or another gun) on numerous occasions (“possibly a dozen”) thereafter when Mr Hristovski was putting it away. She agreed that the gun had come up in conversation with Mr Taylor and that she had discussed her statement with him. The trial judge told the jury:
	


“It follows from this evidence, if you accept it, that Mr Taylor may have been able to give a similar description of the gun, even if he had never seen it in Mr Hristovski’s possession.”


	
	His Honour then said (SU 38):
	


“May I say, if, one, you treat those estimates of once a fortnight, etcetera, as approximately accurate, and two, you accept Miss Ewen's evidence of commencing to cohabit with Mr Hristovski in late August, and three, make the assumption that she only ever saw the one gun, that gun was not that about which Mr Taylor gave evidence. However, there is no challenge to her evidence that Mr Hristovski had possession of a silver revolver, so you may think it clear therefore that, providing Mr Hristovski co-operated, there was a silver revolver available to anyone who desired to use it, and one available when Mr Taylor said he and Mr Koloamatangi required it.”


	
	His Honour referred to Mr Radz’s evidence that the gun was 20-25cms long as compared with Mr Taylor’s evidence of a short revolver, lady’s weapon or “snub-nosed’ gun (SU 38-39). After summarising the remainder of Ms Ewen’s evidence, his Honour turned to the evidence of the deceased’s widow.
	


The relationship between the deceased and Zoran Bubanja


	
	His Honour referred to Mrs Sekuljica’s evidence about the dispute between the deceased and Zoran Bubanja which arose from the construction of some units before 2006. The trial judge also referred to the incident in May 2006 when Zoran Bubanja, Mr Bubanja and his brother Marko came to the deceased’s unit and spoke to him through the intercom asking him to come out but that the deceased did not comply with the request.
	


The relationship between the deceased and Mr Popovic


	
	The trial judge referred to the evidence of the conversation between the deceased and Mr Popovic, about which Mrs Sekuljica gave evidence, in the course of which the deceased called Mr Popovic a traitor.
	


The telephone evidence


	
	The trial judge referred to Exhibit G which logged the calls and text messages between relevant persons and which also indicated the location of the persons sending and receiving these communications. His Honour went to particular entries at particular times (SU 44-45).
	


Exchange between Bench and Bar in the absence of the jury


	
	In the morning adjournment, in the absence of the jury, counsel raised with the trial judge that his Honour was referring to communications in Exhibit G which had not been the subject of address by counsel. Mr Corish (trial counsel for Mr Hristovski) accused the judge of “cherry picking” “to advance a particular analysis or interpretation of the calls” without proper regard to the evidence about the footprints of the various towers (SU 48-40).
	
	
	In the same adjournment, Mr Corish informed the trial judge that his Honour had referred to Mr Taylor’s description of the gun on 1 June 2012 (when he spoke to officers of the Crime Commission) without referring to Mr Taylor’s statement that the gun was a .32 calibre gun. Mr Corish also challenged his Honour’s insinuation that there was ambiguity about the word “inescapable” in Mr Castagna’s evidence about the colour of the weapon. Mr Corish submitted (SU 52) that Mr Castagna’s statement was made very soon after the shooting and had not been challenged in any meaningful way. He accused the trial judge of embarking “on an impeachment exercise in relation to his description of the weapon being black coloured”. The trial judge refused Mr Corish’s request that he withdraw it. Mr Ramage, trial counsel for Mr Popovic, adopted Mr Corish’s submissions and submitted that the trial judge had engaged in a “deliberate distortion of the witness’s evidence” (SU 54).
	
	
	In response to counsel’s request, the trial judge read out an extract from Ms Ewen’s evidence about the gun in which she said that the body of the gun was silver and that she thought it was a revolver although she was not sure (SU 56).
	


Return to the telephone evidence


	
	When the jury came back, the trial judge took the jury through the evidence of phone calls at particular times to indicate where Mr Taylor and Mr Koloamatangi were. He also referred to the timing of calls between Mr Taylor and the applicants. The trial judge then linked this evidence to the evidence of Mr Taylor (SU 60) as follows:
	


“Can I then take you to another aspect of exhibit G.? I think you will have sufficient memory of what Mr Taylor said in this area for me not to have to go to it at the moment. Can I invite your attention to 8 September in exhibit G, at 00.49. This is the call which, when Mr Taylor was being cross-examined and he had a copy of exhibit G in front of him, he was being questioned about whether there had been a call to Mr Popovic or Mr Hristovski, I think to Mr Popovic, in effect to arrange Mr Hristovski to come out with a gun. Mr Taylor suggested that the 00.49 call seemed to fit.

Now, I might note that that was a call on Mr Koloamatangi's phone to Mr Popovic. Three minutes later, two and a half minutes later, Mr Popovic speaks again to Mr Koloamatangi, there are a couple of attempted calls to Mr Bubanja and then Mr Popovic tries to ring Mr Hristovski at 0.55.22 seconds. That was apparently unsuccessful.

Then at 1.03, Mr Popovic then calls Mr Koloamatangi. He calls Mr Bubanja at 1.06. Again calls Mr Hristovski at 1.08, this time getting through. At 1.09, he then calls Mr Koloamatangi and gets through. At 1.15, Mr Koloamatangi calls Mr Popovic, and at 1.20 Emily calls Mr Hristovski. Emily, you will remember, was the name of Mr Popovic's girlfriend.

Now, it is entirely a matter for you, but does that pattern of calls reflect a request from Mr Taylor and Mr Koloamatangi, ""Tell Hristovski we're there, we're nearly there"", an attempt to tell Mr Hristovski that, unsuccessful, another call between Mr Koloamatangi and Mr Popovic, finally contact is made with Mr Hristovski and some acknowledgment of that. We do not know the content of the calls. There is no direct evidence, rather, of the content of the calls, but you have the pattern of calls. It is a matter for you what you make of that pattern and whether they support or accord with any other evidence in the case, in particular, that of Mr Taylor.

The point was made that the location of Mr Koloamatangi, in particular, his call having been routed through Wollongong CBD, indicates that he was not down at Warrawong waiting outside Mr Hristovski's place at the time as Mr Taylor said he was. You are entitled to take account of the fact that sometimes people ring in advance when they think they are going to be somewhere in 5 minutes or 10 minutes, or they're on the way or whatever. You are entitled to take into account your general experience of the world in reaching the decisions you make, but I invite your attention to that pattern of calls.”

Exchange between Bar and Bench during adjournment


	
	Mr Ramage (trial counsel for Mr Popovic) asked the trial judge to withdraw the comment about the scenario about people calling in advance since it was not based on any evidence.
	
	
	Ms Davenport (trial counsel for Mr Koloamatangi) raised the issue of the summary of the telephone calls in the following terms (SU 64):
	


“My next position is this: Your Honour took the jury through a series of phone calls between- I think it was 1.12am and- sorry, 1.12am and 00.49.58 seconds through to the Emily Popovic call at 1.19, and your Honour suggested to the jury that on the evidence in this trial they could come to the view that that was a series of phone calls in relation to the picking up of the gun from Jason Hristovski.

What your Honour did was to completely ignore the evidence of Mr Taylor that when he came back to Wollongong, which clearly cannot have been between quarter to 1 in the morning, he and Mr Koloamatangi went to Mr Popovic's house and spent approximately- what he said, in fact, one hour, he was adamant that it was an hour, and that was after that hour had elapsed that he was told to go to Jason Hristovski's house to pick something up.

So the series of phone calls that your Honour has pointed to cannot on the evidence of Mr Taylor possibly relate to them travelling towards or to

Mr Hristovski's house to pick up the gun because, on Mr Taylor's evidence, in that period of time they are at Mr Popovic's house. So in my submission your Honour should withdraw that range of possible phone calls as falling into the category of possible connections in relation to the picking up of the gun from the jury because it is simply not available on the evidence of the one person who they can look at to see what time that could have occurred. It could not have occurred at that time.”


	
	Ms Davenport submitted that the trial judge was seeking to undermine the defence submission that there was a number of inconsistencies between Exhibit G (which was relevantly objective incontrovertible evidence) and Mr Taylor’s evidence (SU 65). She continued (SU 65):
	


“What your Honour is doing is in fact addressing these issues in a way the Crown never did. Your Honour is putting forward a prosecution case that was never addressed by the Crown, and that means, that we are in a position of having addressed on the basis of what the Crown said his case was and now your Honour is putting a different possibility before the jury.

The Crown never said to the jury Mr Taylor might be wrong. Mr Taylor might have mistaken it by one hour. The Crown never said that. The Crown just ignored the one hour and went on to put a version of events that excluded the possibility of any time within that.”


	
	Mr Corish (trial counsel for Mr Hristovski) asked the trial judge to withdraw all that he had said about Exhibit G and start again. He reminded the judge that Mr Taylor had identified the call at 00.49.58 as “100 %” the call which was made from Blaxland Avenue, Warrawong (where Mr Hristovski lived). Mr Corish accused the judge of “rehabilitating the witness” and engaging in “an exercise in resurrection” (SU 66).
	
	
	On Monday morning, in the absence of the jury, the question of the adequacy of the prison informer warning was revisited. Ms Davenport submitted that, since the only interaction between Mr Radz and Mr Koloamatangi occurred in prison, it was necessary that a particular warning be given about the reasons why evidence of those particular conversations may be unreliable. She added:
	


“That is, because all a prison[er] has to do is name another prisoner that he was in custody with, create a conversation, and that is the simplicity of it.”


	
	Mr Ramage (trial counsel for Mr Popovic) adopted Ms Davenport’s submissions and submitted that the trial judge ought not to have rolled up the two warnings (criminally concerned and prison informer) into one. Mr Ramage also complained about the fourth warning (set out above) and said (SU 76):
	


“But to roll up as a fourth error [sic, area] a caution as to that portion of the evidence which consists of hearsay evidence in a way which in fact seeks in turn rather to diminish what Mr Taylor first said to the two officers when he was interviewed on the 1st of June is in my respectful submission inappropriate.”


	
	The trial judge informed counsel that, although he indicated that he had told them that he would tell the jury that if they did not accept Mr Taylor’s evidence about picking up the gun from Mr Hristovski that they should acquit, his Honour said that he had changed his mind on the basis that such a direction would be “too adverse to the Crown”.
	


Resumption of the summing up in the presence of the jury


	
	The trial judge informed the jury that what he had said about people ringing in advance was not a direction of law. His Honour said (SU 83):
	


“It's been suggested you may have understood what I said in that passage, or part of it, to be a direction of law. I doubt that, but to make it perfectly clear, there was no direction of law. In the first part of what I said, it is correct to say you are entitled to take into account your general experience of the world, and it follows from that, that if you have any experience of people ringing in advance, then you are entitled to take that into account. But those remarks by me were purely a commentary on the evidence, and nothing more. You can take what note of them that you see fit.”


	
	The trial judge referred to the inconsistency between Exhibit G and Mr Taylor’s evidence about being at Mr Popovic’s for one hour. His Honour also referred to the absence of any calls involving Mr Taylor or Mr Koloamatangi to indicate that they had been in Warrawong (which was covered by the Berkeley tower (SU 85) on the night of 7-8 September 2007.
	
	
	His Honour then said, of Mr Taylor’s evidence (SU 85-86):
	


“Now let me go to Mr Taylor's evidence. There is no doubt his evidence requires a detailed study by you and this for a number of reasons. These include the importance of his evidence to the Crown, what he says his involvement in the offence, the terms of his immunity and because of the inconsistencies in some aspect of his evidence between his evidence here and what he said in some of his statements to the police.

How you regard his evidence is entirely a matter for you, but can I suggest that in your consideration you recognise at least the following possibilities and then see how the evidence fits into one or more of them.

One possibility is that his whole account or alternatively his whole account of the involvement of one or more of the accused is a cock and bull story without any significant elements of the truth on which you can rely. But the other extreme in its essential ingredient is his evidence is wholly correct.

A third possibility is that the inconsistencies in his evidence and your impression of him lead you to the view that you are just not prepared to place reliance on anything he said. A fourth is that the inconsistencies relate to matters of detail and don't throw doubt on the substance of his account.”


	
	The trial judge summarised Mr Taylor’s evidence before saying (SU 93):
	


“From the point of view of the Crown there are three and three only vital bits of evidence in what Mr Taylor had to say. The first is that he and Mr Koloamatangi obtained the gun from Mr Hristovski. The second is that the provision of the gun was on the instruction or pursuant to an arrangement of Mr Popovic. The third was that he drove Mr Koloamatangi to Splashes, waited for him and drove him away.

Now, the evidence of those three things was as you might expect accompanied by a great deal of detail. That detail is important because obviously if there are doubts about it, those doubts are liable to impinge on your views of the three vital matters. However, recognise this detail, or if you prefer surrounding circumstances for what they are.

Now, relevant also to an assessment of Mr Taylor's evidence are a number of matters not directly concerning the events of the 7th and 8th of September but bearing on his credibility.

Even if there were no inconsistencies in Mr Taylor's evidence on the three vital matters which I referred or in the detail accompanying them, this further group of matters that I am about to come to would need to be taken into account by you in assessing whether you accept the substance of what Mr Taylor had to say.”


	
	In this context the trial judge continued the summary of evidence before turning, at SU 102, to Mr Taylor’s evidence of the incident in the Woolworth’s car park. The trial judge said:
	


“There was some inconsistency in Mr Taylor's account of being present, and it is appropriate for the defence to make whatever they could of this inconsistency. But it is also appropriate to bear in mind that Mr Taylor's first account of this incident was in 2012, five years after it was said to have occurred. As I think I said at the outset of the summing-up, try to imagine some event which occurred to you five years ago, and then try and remember all the details, and so how confident you are that you have absolutely everything correct.”


	
	His Honour also referred to the defence “attack” on Mr Taylor’s evidence on the basis of two matters: first, his evidence that he spent an hour at Mr Popovic’s place on the evening of the killing; and, secondly, that he had told investigators on 1 June 2012 (three days before he had made a formal statement on which his evidence at trial was based) that he and Mr Koloamatangi had collected the gun before the first trip to Sydney on that evening. As to the second matter, the trial judge reminded the jury that Mr Taylor had denied the statement recorded in Detective Ritchie’s note about the timing of the collection of the gun. The trial judge read out Detective Ritchie’s evidence of his note which recorded:
	


“After the meeting at Kings Cross [sic, Kings, in Wollongong] restaurant the source [Mr Taylor] accompanied Tevi (Doc) and drove to Jason Hristovski's premises at Warrawong. At this location the source was present when Jason Hristovski handed Koloamatangi a revolver handgun. Source described the handgun as a snub nosed 32 or similar.

The source then drove to Mascot with Tevi (Doc) Koloamatangi and Emma Barber. He has not stated if Barber was present when the transaction with the hand gun took place.”


	
	The trial judge then read out the cross-examination of Detective Ritchie in which the witness raised the question whether the paragraphs ought be switched around. The trial judge continued (SU 104):
	


“Now the witness had earlier himself raised the possibility that the last two paragraphs I quoted should be reversed. Now that evidence from Detective Ritchie is hearsay. Something said out of court and repeated in court. It has, it is liable to have all the problems of hearsay evidence. Was that what Mr Taylor actually said? Did Detective Ritchie hear it accurately? Did he record it accurately? Those sorts of questions. In one sense you can't answer because you weren't there to hear what Mr Taylor said. You have to rely on Detective [Ritchie's] recollection at the time he made his notes. You have to rely on his reservations about whether he recorded things in the right order. However, it is in evidence here and you can rely on it, if you think it appropriate as a version, as evidence of what in fact occurred on the night.

I must however add that cross-examined about what was contained in the investigator's note Mr Taylor firmly adhered to his account that the first trip to Sydney preceded going to Mr Hristovski's and obtaining the gun. It is a matter for you what you make of the conflict.

As I pointed out earlier, it has the problems of hearsay evidence and hearsay evidence was one of the topics about which I gave you a warning a long time ago.”


	
	At SU 105, the trial judge referred to Mr Taylor’s evidence that the call at 00.49 was made from outside Mr Hristovski’s house, which was challenged on the basis that the call was made at a time when Mr Taylor and Mr Koloamatangi were still in the Wollongong CBD area (according to Exhibit G), which does not provide coverage to Warrawong. The trial judge addressed Mr Taylor’s evidence in that context at some length. His Honour’s remarks are set out below in full because of the reliance placed on them in support of the ground that the summing up was unbalanced. His Honour said, at SU 105:
	


“Now relying on the entry in Exhibit G this call was recorded as having passed via the Wollongong CBD tower, Mr Corish described this evidence as a lie. That is, a deliberate untruth. When I earlier took you through parts of Exhibit G, I dealt with the possibility Mr Koloamatangi may in fact have been near Mr Hristovski and even if Mr Taylor's choice of this call was wrong, the circumstances in which he came to select the call do raise the question whether any untruthfulness was deliberate.

Ms Davenport also attacked Mr Taylor's evidence at spending an hour at Mr Popovic submitting as a practical matter he couldn't have spent that time and the time he spent doing other things and I'll return to her attack.

Another aspect of Mr Taylor's evidence concerning the events of the night is his evidence that at Mr Popovic's, at around midnight he was told that Dragan was at the North Gong Hotel and that later he or Mr Koloamatangi received a phone call saying that Dragan was at Splashes.

Now it is entirely a matter for you, but there is certainly something to be said for the view that this evidence is not only wrong, but inexplicable or it is almost so. It seems clear beyond argument that Dragan was not at the North Wollongong Hotel at any time that night, and had not been there for hours.

One could speculate, and that is what it would be, that there might have been some conspiracy that Dragan might have been taken there but there is no evidence whatsoever in favour of that theory. Equally there is no apparent reason for Mr Taylor to make this up.

Mr Sekuljica had been killed at Splashes and you might think an inevitable inference that at the times Mr Taylor was speaking to the police he knew that. Why would he complicate his account, whether the substance of the account be true or a lie, by saying he had been told that Dragan was at the North Wollongong Hotel I suspect will always be a mystery. However, his evidence is there. You must make of it what you will.”


	
	His Honour then turned to the colour of the gun which was described as “the next matter of detail” (SU 106). The trial judge continued (SU 106-107):
	


“Mr Taylor's evidence concerning the colour of the gun could theoretically be the truth, a mistake, or a lie. Why should he lie? If he were indulging in a complete fabrication to gain an indemnity why take the risk of nominating something that might be shown to be wrong. Why not simply say- Doc received the gun in a calico bag. The car was dark. I, Mr Taylor, did not see its colour.

Now I want to make it clear I am not suggesting what you should find in this area. However, I am suggesting as I did right at the outset of this summing-up that you give critical consideration to all possibilities and before you come to a conclusion on any significant matter you look at the arguments against the conclusion.

Were things a deliberate lie? Hang on, why would that lie be told?

Now, when I say 'that lie' I am not saying anything was a lie. I am just saying if you think something was look and say- Hang on that is a possibility, are there arguments against it?”


	
	The trial judge also referred to Ms Davenport’s argument about whether there was time for Mr Taylor to do what he said he did and referred to the evidence of waiting in the car park as “another matter of detail” (SU 107). The trial judge, at SU 109, referred to Ms Davenport’s attack on Mr Taylor’s evidence of events and times and said:
	


“You may think that Ms Davenport's maths is correct. However, her conclusion depends on the accuracy of Mr Taylor's having done all of the things he said he did, and, in his estimates of times. And although he said in his drive around with police confirmed his travel time estimates you are entitled to consider how reliable his evidence of time spent at stops along the way, Mr Popovic's, Mr Hristovski's, and looking for clothing.

Of course if indeed Mr Taylor had collected the gun from Mr Hristovski before his first trip to Sydney as was recorded in the investigator's notes of the interview on the 1st of June then that attack from Ms Davenport based on all the times he said he spent this weekend then perhaps fails.”

Matters raised before the luncheon adjournment in the absence of the jury


	
	Mr Ramage asked the trial judge to withdraw the speculation that there had been some conspiracy that the deceased be taken to the North Gong Hotel. He also requested that his Honour withdraw the question “Why would he [Mr Taylor] lie?” and direct the jury to ignore those remarks. Mr Corish endorsed Mr Ramage’s submissions and contended that the “Why would he lie?” comment suggested that an onus was being placed on the accused to offer an explanation. Mr Corish also submitted that there were reasons for Mr Taylor to lie, including revenge (on Mr Hristovski for the assault of April 2009) and to shift blame from himself to others, as well as the incentive provided by the financial reward and the indemnity. Mr Corish suggested that a more neutral question would be to ask the jury in respect of Mr Taylor, “Why can’t he get the facts right?”
	
	
	At SU 114 trial counsel for Mr Popovic complained about the hearsay warning given in relation to Detective Ritchie’s evidence in the following terms:
	


“Your Honour . . . referred to the investigator's note by Richie [and] . . . said the jury could rely on it as the version of what occurred on the night, and that is what Taylor had said even though it was hearsay. On my respectful submission they could not so rely on it. They could only rely on it as something that Taylor had said to the police which went to his credit in respect of the evidence that he has given here.”

Resumption of the summing up


	
	When the jury returned the following morning (Tuesday 27 May 2014), the trial judge referred to what he had said at 106-107 SU:
	


""’Mr Taylor's evidence concerning the colour of the gun could theoretically be the truth, a mistake, or a lie. Why should he lie?’

There is of course no onus on the accused to offer any explanation for any such conduct, if it occurred, on the part of Mr Taylor or to explain why he might have done so. I raise it solely as I have suggested to you earlier that before you reach any conclusion on any significant matter in the case, you address the argument against that conclusion.”


	
	The trial judge referred to the defence submission that Mr Taylor was a skilled liar and continued (SU 119-120):
	


“Why, if he was telling a, making up a fabricated story for the purposes of financial reward or for the purposes of being not charged himself he should insert in his account matters which were in no sense vital to that account, such as the colour of the gun, such as the reference to North Wollongong Hotel, is a matter to take into account. Again of course there is no obligation on the accused to prove anything but I mention that because when you come to consider the submissions that have been made, take those sorts of things into account.

The other argument that I want to mention is this, and it relates to Mr Taylor's statement that he was told by Mr Popovic to go to Hristovski's and ‘pick up something’. It was submitted that Mr Popovic clearly wouldn't have said ‘something’ as distinct as a ‘gun’.

Well you might in considering that argument bear these things in mind. Your general experience of the world would teach you I withdraw that- on the 20th of October the police were clearly bugging Mr Popovic’s phone. You might think that that possibility is something which might have occurred to Mr Popovic, he had, as the evidence shows, been in gaol. He was friendly with the drug dealing Mr Taylor, and friendly with the kneecapping Mr Radz.”


	
	Mr Ramage (trial counsel for Mr Popovic) interrupted the summing up to apply for a discharge on the basis that there was no evidence that Mr Popovic had been in prison before 2013 when he had been charged with the murder of the deceased. He also relied on the reasons the trial judge had given for suggesting that Mr Popovic might ask Mr Hristovski to “get something” in support of a submission that the trial judge had raised bad character. His Honour refused the application.
	
	
	When the jury came back, the trial judge told them that he had made a mistake and that there was no evidence at all that Mr Popovic had ever been in gaol before the current charge, in 2013 (SU 127). His Honour directed the jury to put out of their minds the “argument” that Mr Popovic’s time in prison may have been a factor in his using the term “something” rather than “gun” (SU 127-129).
	
	
	His Honour then summarised the evidence of Mr Radz.
	
	
	The trial judge commenced the next section of the summing up by saying, “Let me just briefly summarise the cases.” In the following two pages of the summing up, the trial judge summarised the Crown case against each applicant.
	
	
	The trial judge said that the case against Mr Koloamatangi depended on the phone calls; the physical location of his phone; and the fact that he made two trips to Sydney on the night of 7 or 8 September 2007. His Honour said further:
	


“There is Mr Taylor's evidence. There is Mr Radz's evidence. All but the fact of the phone calls and physical location of Mr Koloamatangi's phone and when the calls were made was in dispute.”


	
	The trial judge identified the evidence against Mr Popovic as being the evidence of the deceased’s widow and another witness who had deposed to the deceased referring to Mr Popovic as a traitor; and the evidence of the number of phone calls between Mr Popovic and other persons on the night of 7 and 8 September 2007, including Mr Koloamatangi, whom the Crown submitted was the gunman. His Honour said further:
	


“There is Mr Taylor's evidence, including the statement that he attributes to Mr Popovic, of the latter having said 'it’s war'. There is Mr Taylor's other evidence of being told by Mr Popovic to pick up 'something' and then later go to Splashes.

There is Mr Radz's evidence of what Mr Popovic said to him.”


	
	The trial judge identified the evidence against Mr Bubanja as comprising: “the visit to the unit and the banging on the door”; “the incident in the North Wollongong Hotel”; “the incident in the toilet on the 7th of September”; and “the fact of the phone calls”.
	
	
	The trial judge summarised the Crown case against Mr Hristovski in the following terms:
	


“In the case of Mr Hristovski there is Mr Radz's evidence of the supply of a gun. There is the fact and location of phone calls, and the Crown relies on that connection on what it says is a peculiarity, that Mr Hristovski, despite his numerous calls to Mr Bubanja, neglected to actually go into Splashes, despite being, as the Crown submits, hanging around the area.”


	
	Because of its brevity, I propose to set out in full the trial judge’s summary of the applicants’ cases (SU 155-156):
	


“Now the defence case is shortly this. A number of phone calls, even in the middle of the night prove nothing. At least with the possible explanation of the location of the phones at the time of the call. It is submitted that the location of the phones in any event says nothing about the accused's involvement in Mr Sekuljica's death.

Secondly, it is submitted you can't rely on the evidence of Mr Taylor both because he is or has been a drug addict, a drug dealer, a liar, probably a murderer for his confessed involvement in the death of Mr Sekuljica or if not probably at least possibly a murderer, and his evidence concerning the accused and their suggested involvement in the death of Mr Sekuljica is in many respects demonstrably wrong, inconsistent and at the very least unreliable.

The third aspect of the defence case is the evidence of Mr Radz is even more unreliable. His criminal past leads to the conclusion that what he says cannot be relied on. He has given evidence as the price of avoiding prosecution and gaol for himself. Also, the possibility of financial reward and even in that situation he has given inconsistent accounts.

In that connection the evidence of Mr Tuckerman and Durant is relied on. Mr Radz's evidence is inconsistent with that of Mr Hristovski's brother. Now remember, that the accused start off with the presumption of innocence. They are not required to explain anything and any silence on their part cannot be used to strengthen the Crown case.”


	
	Before the jury was sent out to deliberate, but in their absence, the trial judge invited counsel to make any objections in the absence of the jury. Ms Davenport (trial counsel for Mr Koloamatangi) submitted that the summing up was unbalanced because of the amount of time (which Ms Davenport estimated, as recorded at SU, 159, to be fewer than five minutes) devoted to summarising the defence cases. The other trial counsel adopted and expanded on these submissions. His Honour brought the jury back and made some factual corrections. His Honour said at SU 178:
	


“I should remind you also though I doubt it is necessary, that you heard lengthy submissions by counsel for the accused and of course you should take those submissions into account in your deliberations. If you wish to be reminded of them or any part of them, you have only to ask but they are clearly something to reflect on as of course are the Crown's.”


	
	After the jury was sent out to deliberate, counsel made further submissions about the summing up (the utility of which was questionable having regard to the timing), to which the trial judge responded in the following terms, presumably for the benefit of counsel and in defence of his Honour’s approach to the summing up, since the jury had already commenced its deliberation:
	


“The other thing I wanted to say was this, and it arises out of the submissions yesterday seeking some redirections. The approach adopted in some of what was said yesterday by counsel seems to me to involve a misapprehension of the role of an entitlement of a judge in summing-up. In the matter of Tsigos v R, which is unreported, but the subject of note in 1965 39 ALJR 76, the High Court held that it was permissible for a judge to say:

‘On the evidence before the Court it is my duty to tell you that you will be flying in the face of the oath you took, namely, to return a verdict on the evidence if you were to return a verdict of acquittal because on the evidence I can see no escape from the verdict of murder or manslaughter.’

Tsigos was referred to without any criticism in RPS in the High Court. It was followed by the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal in the R v Dee [1985] 19 A Crim R 224. If a judge is entitled to say what was said in Tsigos, then surely a judge can make the far more moderate criticism of an argument advanced by counsel, or bring to the jury's attention his experience, analytical or otherwise, in considering the issues. Of course I don't suggest the judge, under that guise, can bring in further evidence.”

Grounds of appeal


	
	Because of the overlap between the grounds of appeal I propose to address them as follows:
	



	
	Whether the trial judge should have given a Shepherd warning regarding the provision of a firearm in the case against Mr Hristovski (Mr Hristovski’s grounds 1 and 2);
	
	
	The adequacy of the trial judge’s warnings regarding the evidence of Mr Taylor and Mr Radz (Mr Koloamatangi’s ground 1); and the hearsay warning in relation to Detective Ritchie’s note;
	
	
	The “why would he lie?” question regarding Mr Taylor’s evidence;
	
	
	Whether the summing up was unduly imbalanced against the applicants so as to deprive them of a fair trial;
	
	
	Whether the verdicts in respect of Mr Bubanja and Mr Hristovski were unreasonable.
	


The Shepherd direction (Mr Hristovski’s grounds 1 and 2)

Whether the trial judge was obliged to direct the jury that they needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he provided a firearm to the shooter


	
	Ms Rigg SC, who appeared on behalf of Mr Hristovski, contended that there were two primary facts of which the jury needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt before it could convict Mr Hristovski: first, that he supplied a firearm to Mr Koloamatangi, within hours prior to the shooting, in the presence of Mr Taylor; and, secondly, that, in the hours before the shooting he had extensive telephone contact with Mr Bubanja and Mr Popovic at the times set out in Exhibit G. She submitted that the trial judge ought to have given the jury a Shepherd direction.
	
	
	It is accepted that Mr Hristovski’s trial counsel sought a Shepherd direction with respect to Mr Hristovski’s provision of the gun to Mr Taylor. The trial judge, after having given a preliminary indication that he would give it, subsequently decided that it would be too adverse to the interests of the Crown to give such a direction.
	
	
	It was common ground that the Crown principally relied on two evidentiary bases for its case against Mr Hristovski: the supply of the gun; and his presence in the vicinity of Splashes leading up to and surrounding the time of the shooting, evidenced by Ms Ewen’s evidence of his leaving home in the early hours of the morning and the telephone records indicating his location and communications with the other applicants. Although the Crown accepted that either category would not be sufficient of itself, it submitted that the two could support each other but that the first category need not be proved beyond reasonable doubt, since Mr Hristovski’s involvement was not dependent on his having supplied the gun, although the Crown case was that he had.
	
	
	Whether a Shepherd direction ought be given arises for consideration where it is necessary for the jury to reach a conclusion as an “indispensable intermediate step” in the reasoning process. The metaphor used in Wigmore on Evidence, vol 9 (Chadbourn rev. 1981), par. 412-414 for such a step is that it is a “link in the chain” and is to be distinguished from a “strand in a cable”, which is a fact which need not be proved beyond reasonable doubt because the reasoning does not depend on its being made out, although it may assist the drawing of an inference. The distinction between the elements of the offence, each of which must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, and the relevant facts relied upon to prove each element, which need not be proved beyond reasonable doubt, is subject to a qualification that some facts (which are not elements of the offence) need to be proved beyond reasonable doubt because of their status as “indispensable intermediate steps”.
	
	
	In Shepherd v The Queen Dawson J said at 585:
	


“Whether it is desirable for a trial judge to identify an intermediate conclusion of fact in his charge to the jury in order to instruct them that it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt will depend upon the particular case. Such an instruction will only be possible where the conclusion is a necessary link in a chain of reasoning. Even then, particularly when that is obvious, the instruction may not be helpful.”


	
	The distinction was confirmed in Filippou v The Queen [2015] HCA 29; 256 CLR 47 at [52] (per French CJ, Bell, Keane and Nettle JJ) where a Shepherd direction was described as a principle of law which must be applied in a trial by judge alone, although it need not be expressed in terms in the reasons.
	
	
	Ms Rigg contended that this Court ought apply the test approved in Burrell v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 163; 196 A Crim R 199 at [126]-[128]: namely, what is the effect on the Crown case of removing the fact said to be an indispensable intermediary step? She submitted that if one removes the provision of the gun, all one has is that Mr Hristovski was in the vicinity of Splashes at the relevant time and communicated with some of the other applicants throughout the evening, which would be insufficient to permit the jury to be satisfied that the hypotheses consistent with innocence (such as that he was simply out with friends on a Friday night) had been excluded. By contrast, if the jury was satisfied that the gun was supplied, the evidentiary significance of Mr Hristovski’s location and communications with him at relevant times is substantial.
	
	
	The Crown contended that although the provision of the gun was one way in which the jury could have drawn an inference of guilt to the requisite standard, it was not the only way in which they could infer that Mr Hristovski was playing an active role in assisting the other participants in the enterprise in the vicinity of the murder scene. Accordingly, it contended that the trial judge was correct to refuse to give the direction, on the basis that it would be adverse to the Crown’s interests.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the provision of the gun was an intermediate indispensable fact or that, even if it was, a Shepherd direction needed to be given. It is not enough that the Crown case would be substantially weakened if the relevant fact was removed; or whether there would be a case to go to the jury without it (R v Davidson [2009] NSWCCA 150; 75 NSWLR 150 at [74] per Simpson J) or that a verdict without the evidence of provision of the gun would be unreasonable.
	
	
	Although I am not persuaded that the giving of a Shepherd direction would have been confusing or adverse to the interests of the Crown, the question whether such a direction is appropriate is a matter for the trial judge to assess. I am not satisfied that the trial judge was in error in not giving the jury a direction that they needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Hristovski provided the gun to Mr Taylor. As Spigelman CJ said in R v Davidson  at [19]:
	


“… the emphasis always given to the Crown's obligation to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt will often be adequate, in a particular case, with respect to a matter which the jury may reasonably regard as an indispensable intermediate fact.”


	
	I am satisfied that the trial judge directed the jury sufficiently as to the onus and standard of proof such that the direction was not required in any event.
	


Whether the trial judge was obliged to direct the jury that before they were entitled to use the provision of the firearm by Mr Hristovski to the shooter to draw the inference of guilt they needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it had occurred


	
	Ms Rigg provided a draft direction in support of her submission that it would not have been confusing to provide a direction to the jury. It is not necessary to set out the terms of the draft direction since I am satisfied that it would not have been confusing to provide such a direction.
	
	
	It would, in my view, have been open to the trial judge to direct the jury that if they were to use the provision of the firearm as a basis for inferring Mr Hristovski’s criminal involvement they would need to be satisfied of that fact beyond reasonable doubt. However I do not consider that the trial judge was obliged to give such a direction because of the way the Crown had put its case against Mr Hristovski, which highlighted the provision of the gun. As the facts against Mr Hristovski were relatively few in number, I do not consider that a direction was required in addition to the standard directions as to onus and standard of proof which have not been challenged.
	


Hearsay warning (Mr Bubanja’s ground 3) and the adequacy of the trial judge’s warnings regarding Mr Taylor’s evidence and Mr Radz’s evidence (Mr Koloamatangi’s ground 1)


	
	It was accepted that a request had been made for warnings in respect of Mr Taylor’s evidence, on the ground that he was criminally involved, and in respect of Mr Radz’s evidence, on the ground that he was a prison informer and that his evidence comprised admissions and hearsay. Accordingly, the trial judge was obliged to give warnings under s 165(1)(a) and s 165(1)(d) in respect of Mr Taylor’s evidence and under s 165(1)(a) and (e) in respect of Mr Radz’s evidence.
	
	
	Section 165 of the Evidence Act provides in part:
	


“165   Unreliable evidence

(1)   This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence:

(a)   evidence in relation to which Part 3.2 (hearsay evidence) or 3.4 (admissions) applies,

. . .

(d)   evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding,

(e)   evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness who is a prison informer,

. . .

(2)   If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to:

(a)   warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and

(b)   inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and

(c)   warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.

(3)   The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.

(4)   It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information.

(5)   This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury.

. . .”


	
	Each of the applicants relied on the trial judge’s warning relating to Detective Ritchie’s evidence as an error which was relevant to the general ground that the summing up was unbalanced. It was identified as a ground only by Mr Bubanja. The passages from the summing up in which the warning was given (SU 15-16 and 104) are set out above.
	
	
	The evidence the subject of the warning was Detective Ritchie’s note in which he had recorded that Mr Taylor had said, on 1 June 2012, that he had picked up the gun from Mr Hristovski’s place before driving to Sydney with Mr Koloamatangi and his girlfriend to drop her off before returning to Wollongong with Mr Koloamatangi on the evening of 7/8 September 2007. Although no order was made to limit the use of the evidence to its non-hearsay purpose, the evidence was not relied on by the Crown (or any of the applicants) at trial for the hearsay purpose.
	
	
	There were several reasons why the Crown did not contend for the truth of the version recorded by Detective Ritchie that Mr Taylor had collected the gun before the first trip to Sydney. First, it was inconsistent with Mr Taylor’s evidence that they had collected the gun after he and Mr Koloamatangi after they had spent an hour at Mr Popovic’s place following their return to Wollongong from Sydney. Secondly, the possibility of such a visit had not been explored in the evidence of Ms Ewen, who would have been up and awake at that time. Thirdly, it would also have substantially undermined Mr Taylor’s evidence that he was unaware of the potential criminality of the venture until his hour-long visit to Mr Popovic’s place when he was asked to collect “something” from Mr Hristovski’s place.
	
	
	The evidence of what was recorded in the note was elicited by defence counsel in cross-examination and was relied on by the applicants as a prior inconsistent statement by Mr Taylor, whose evidence at trial was that he and Mr Koloamatangi had collected the item from Mr Hristovski’s place after their return to Wollongong after delivering Mr Koloamatangi’s girlfriend to Sydney. It was, accordingly, evidence which was adduced for the benefit of the applicants.
	
	
	The only reference to the note being used for a hearsay purpose was in the summing up where his Honour said (in the passage at SU 109 set out above) that if Detective Ritchie had recorded Mr Taylor’s version of 1 June 2012 correctly and Mr Taylor had in fact collected the gun from Mr Hristovski before his first trip to Sydney then the criticisms made by Ms Davenport based on timing could be put to one side. Notwithstanding a complaint by trial counsel for Mr Popovic about this aspect of the summing up in the adjournment immediately following his Honour’s comment, the trial judge neither corrected nor amended what he had said.
	
	
	The applicants contended that the effect of the warning was to undermine the significance of Detective Ritchie’s note to the applicants’ challenge to Mr Taylor’s credibility by suggesting that the note was not accurate. The Crown accepted before this Court that no hearsay warning was appropriate because the evidence was not relied on by anyone for a hearsay purpose. It contended that, although the giving of the warning was not necessary, and although it was expressed as a “warning”, it amounted to no more than a comment.
	
	
	Mr Gartelmann SC, who appeared for Mr Koloamatangi, submitted that the request for the warning was plainly a request for the trial judge to warn the jury of matters that may cause the evidence of Mr Taylor and Mr Radz to be unreliable. In so far as that evidence was evidence of admissions said to have been made by any of the applicants to Mr Radz, it was hearsay evidence, in respect of which the trial judge was obliged to give a warning, if it was requested. Mr Gartelmann contended that the effect of the trial judge’s warning to the jury regarding “hearsay” evidence was to identify reasons why the evidence of police that Mr Taylor had made prior inconsistent statements may be unreliable, and thus to inform the jury of reasons why Mr Taylor’s and Mr Radz’s evidence was reliable. Far from giving a warning which would protect the interests of the applicants, the trial judge, so it was argued, gave a warning which was not only adverse to their interests, but which also did not correspond with the warning sought.
	
	
	The first point is that the hearsay rule did not apply to the contents of Detective Ritchie’s note since it was admitted because it was relevant for a non-hearsay purpose: s 60(1) of the Evidence Act. Although the effect of s 60 was to make the evidence admissible for the hearsay purpose as well, since it was relevant to a non-hearsay purpose (Adam v The Queen [2001] HCA 57; 207 CLR 96 at [37]), this potential effect was, in fact, irrelevant in the trial since no one relied on the evidence for its hearsay purpose. I reject the submission made by the Crown that the trial judge’s warning was no more than a comment. In my view, its context in the summing up and the fact that it was listed at the end of a three other warnings which amounted to directions, was sufficient to indicate that the jury could reasonably have understood it as being a warning rather than merely a comment.
	
	
	Moreover the distinction between “comment” and “direction” is, at times, illusory from the jury’s perspective since it may not be clear whether what the judge says is, at any given point in the summing up, a direction or a comment. If the jury regards what is being said as a direction, they may feel bound to abide by it; however, even if the relevant matter is purely a comment, it might have a tendency to “overawe” the jury because, unlike counsel’s submissions, a comment by the judge carries with it the weight of judicial office.
	
	
	The warning in terms was not only erroneous as a matter of law, but it did not correspond with the request (and was inimical to the purpose of the request). It was plainly adverse to the applicants’ interests (since it diminished the reliability of the evidence of the prior inconsistent statement) and had not been sought by the Crown: R v Salama [1999] NSWCCA 105 at [86]-[87] (Kirby J, Wood CJ at CL and Ireland J agreeing) and DPP v Ramlagun [2014] VSCA 68.
	


The “why would he lie?” question


	
	The applicants relied on several passages in the summing up in support of the submissions relating to this ground and in particular SU 21, 106-107.
	
	
	Mr Game SC, who appeared with Mr Lange on behalf of Mr Bubanja, submitted that the effect of the trial judge’s summing up was to invite the jury to start with the assumption that Mr Taylor was a truthful witness and tell them not to displace that assumption without cause. He contended that the rhetorical question, “why would Mr Taylor lie?” was even more prejudicial to the accused than the situation considered by the High Court in Palmer v The Queen (1998) 193 CLR 1 when the accused had been asked when he was giving evidence why the complainant would lie. Mr Game submitted that the Crown would not have been entitled to ask Mr Taylor the question when he was giving evidence. He contended that it was even more prejudicial for the trial judge to ask it in the course of the summing up because the judge’s asking the question endowed it with a judicial imprimatur and its timing deprived defence counsel of an opportunity to respond.
	
	
	The question of motive to lie tends to arise in two situations: first, where there is a witness in respect of whom there is no evidence to suggest a motive to lie; and secondly, where the evidence reveals such a motive. In the first case, the jury ought not be asked to consider why the witness would lie because the question tends to suggest that the jury ought believe the witness in the absence of evidence suggesting a motive to lie. However in the second case the jury is entitled to be asked to consider the validity of the motive to lie that has been asserted. In such a case, the jury ought be directed that, even if they reject the motive to lie put forward by the accused, that does not mean that the witness is necessarily telling the truth: see R v Jovanovic (1997) 42 NSWLR 520 at 521-522 per Priestley J and at 535 per Sperling J.
	
	
	Mr Game submitted that the present case belongs to the second category, since Mr Taylor plainly had a motive to lie: to minimise his own criminality; and exaggerate that of the applicants for the purpose of the reward and his indemnity. Mr Game contended that, notwithstanding the warning (about Mr Taylor’s criminal involvement) the trial judge was effectively telling the jury that they needed to be satisfied that Mr Taylor had a motive to lie (which was presumably additional to the one about which a warning had been given) before they disbelieved him.
	
	
	The relevant principles were summarised by Hunt AJA (Simpson and Whealy JJ agreeing) in South v R [2007] NSWCCA 117 in the following passage:
	


“[43]   Both the Crown prosecutor and the accused are entitled to put arguments to the jury relating to the evidence of a motive to lie which has been asserted in relation to a witness in the particular case, and a satisfactory summing-up should include reference to those arguments: R v Uhrig at 16–17; Palmer v R at [10]–[11]. To invite the jury to go beyond both the evidence supporting the asserted motive on which the accused relies and the evidence denying it on which the Crown relies, and to ask ‘Why would the complainant lie?’ is to suggest to the jury that, in the absence of any other evidence beyond that on which the accused relies, they should accept the complainant’s evidence.

[44]   The jury should never be asked to go beyond the evidence on which both parties rely to establish or refute a motive to lie and to consider the question ‘Why would she lie? Such a question simply should never be asked.”


	
	In my view, the effect of the trial judge’s asking, rhetorically, why Mr Taylor would lie was not only to deprive the earlier warning under s 165(1)(d) of the Evidence Act (that he was criminally concerned) of any substantial force, but also to give the jury the impression that if they could not identify another reason why he would lie, they should accept his evidence. This is an error which, in my view, could give rise to a substantial miscarriage of justice.
	


Whether the summing up was so lacking in balance as to deprive the applicants of a fair trial


	
	Before turning to the particular matters identified by the applicants as indicating that the summing up was unbalanced I propose to summarise the purposes to be served by a summing up in a criminal trial and the way in which these purposes are conventionally fulfilled.
	


The purposes of a summing up and the applicable principles


	
	The purposes of a summing up are:
	



	
	to direct the jury as to the law (including the elements of the offence; the onus and standard of proof and give warnings regarding unreliability of particular evidence) which it needs to know in order to fulfil its duty as the tribunal of fact;
	
	
	to summarise the evidence germane to the issues;
	
	
	to summarise fairly the way in which the Crown and the defence put their respective cases, including the inferences for which each contends;
	
	
	if a possible defence, or alternative verdict (such as manslaughter) is available on the evidence and has not been referred to by counsel, to instruct the jury in relation to it; and
	
	
	to comment on any obviously untenable submission which has been put by either the Crown or counsel for the accused.
	



	
	This is not to say that there must always be a clear demarcation between (2) and (3). However, if the inferences for which the Crown or the accused contend are interleaved in the summary of evidence, there is a risk that the jury will gain the impression that the judge is contending for a particular inference. Although there is considerable leeway in the way in which the summing up can be structured, it is an essential element of a summing up that the competing cases of the Crown and the accused be summarised fairly and adequately.
	
	
	It is particularly important that the judge does not raise in the summing up matters which have not been raised by the Crown but which advance the prosecution case since this could amount to a denial of natural justice as the accused will, in that event, have no opportunity to respond: R v Meher [2004] NSWCCA 355 at [87]-[88] per Wood CJ at CL (Buddin and Shaw JJ agreeing). Furthermore, the raising by the trial judge in the summing of matters not put by counsel in address tends to compromise the appearance of impartiality: R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442 at 455D-E per Wood CJ at CL.
	
	
	Although a trial judge may, within limits, comment on the evidence the assessment of which is purely a matter for the jury as the tribunal of fact, it is generally unadvisable to do so, except in instances of which Tsigos v R (1965) 36 ALJR 76, to which his Honour referred after the jury had been sent out to deliberate, is an example. Thus, if the defence case in a murder trial was run on the basis of manslaughter by reason of provocation, it is open to a trial judge to direct the jury not to bring in an irrational acquittal since the only rational choice is between murder and manslaughter. Except in this instance, Tsigos does not provide any support for the proposition that it is appropriate for a trial judge to comment on the evidence in such a way as to steer a jury to a particular verdict.
	
	
	The restrictions on comment in a summing up were addressed by the High Court in B v The Queen (1992) 175 CLR 599 where Brennan J (Mason CJ and Deane J agreeing) said at 605-606:
	


“A trial judge has a broad discretion in commenting on the facts and in choosing the strength of the language employed in commenting on the facts, but the comment must stop short of overawing the jury. It must exhibit a judicial balance so that the jury is not deprived ‘of an adequate opportunity of understanding and giving effect to the defence and the matters relied upon in support of the defence’. I agree with the observations of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Reg. v Hulse:

‘[T]o use the words of the Privy Council in Broadhurst’s Case, there is a danger of the jury being overawed by the judge’s views, where, even though the jury are told that the decision on the facts is for them, the language of the judge is so forceful that they may be under the impression that there is really nothing for them to decide or that they would be fatuous or disrespectful if they disagreed with the judge's views’.”


	
	Where more than one accused is tried, the trial judge is obliged to identify the separate position of each accused, both as to the evidence, the Crown case and the accused’s own case: R v Towle (1954) 72 WN 338 at 340; followed in R v Masters (1992) 26 NSWLR 450. In R v Towle Street CJ said, at 340, that, except in unusual cases, where two or more persons are being tried together:
	


“… it is the clear duty of the trial judge to separate for the jury's consideration the evidence properly relevant and material in the case of each, and to present the case made against each of the accused separately. The jury should be specifically told of the evidence which they may consider against each individual accused, together with appropriate directions as to the legal principles involved. In this connection it is insufficient to rest such a direction on the formula that each case must be considered separately, without further explanation.”


	
	This obligation can, however, be discharged in different ways. Where the whole of the evidence is relevant to each of the accused, it may not be necessary, and could be artificial, to segregate the position of each accused in the orthodox way. Thus, in Huynh v The Queen [2013] HCA 6; 87 ALJR 434, the High Court dismissed an appeal brought, in part, on the basis that the summing up failed to distinguish between the cases of the accused. The Court said at [49]:
	


“It was the responsibility of the trial judge to structure the summing-up in a way that he assessed would most effectively distil the issues for determination in each case and, to the extent that it was necessary to do so, to remind the jury of the evidence bearing on the determination of those issues. Given that the whole of the oral evidence was common to the three cases, and that many of the factual issues were common to liability in each case, the approach that his Honour adopted was one which avoided a deal of needless repetition. Critical to the appellants’ separate cases were the suggested weaknesses in the evidence that implicated each as engaged in the assault on the deceased and in other acts of violence at the scene. The trial judge drew attention to these criticisms of the evidence and to their significance to the case against each appellant in the course of reviewing the evidence.”


	
	The importance of preserving the division of functions between the judge as the tribunal of law and the jury as the tribunal of fact was addressed by the High Court in RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3; 199 CLR 620 (Gaudron A-CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne JJ) as follows:
	


“41   Before parting with the case, it is as well to say something more general about the difficult task trial judges have in giving juries proper instructions. The fundamental task of a trial judge is, of course, to ensure a fair trial of the accused. That will require the judge to instruct the jury about so much of the law as they need to know in order to dispose of the issues in the case. No doubt that will require instructions about the elements of the offence, the burden and standard of proof and the respective functions of judge and jury. Subject to any applicable statutory provisions it will require the judge to identify the issues in the case and to relate the law to those issues. It will require the judge to put fairly before the jury the case which the accused makes. In some cases it will require the judge to warn the jury about how they should not reason or about particular care that must be shown before accepting certain kinds of evidence.

42   But none of this must be permitted to obscure the division of functions between judge and jury. It is for the jury, and the jury alone, to decide the facts. As we have said, in some cases a judge must give the jury warnings about how they go about that task. And, of course, it has long been held that a trial judge may comment (and comment strongly) on factual issues [the footnote referred to Tsigos]. But although a trial judge may comment on the facts, the judge is not bound to do so except to the extent that the judge's other functions require it. Often, perhaps much more often than not, the safer course for a trial judge will be to make no comment on the facts beyond reminding the jury, in the course of identifying the issues before them, of the arguments of counsel.

43   To attempt to instruct the jury about how they may reason towards a verdict of guilt (as distinct from warning the jury about impermissible forms of reasoning) leads only to difficulties of the kind that have arisen in the present case.” (Footnotes omitted.)

The challenges to the summing up


	
	Ms Rigg identified several factors which she contended established that the summing up was so unbalanced as to deprive the applicants of a fair trial and amount to a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). These factors, which are listed below, will be considered in turn:
	



	
	The trial judge contrasted the defence submissions about the unreliability of Mr Taylor with possibilities that he might be telling the truth;
	
	
	The trial judge focussed on the differences between eyewitnesses which had the effect of detracting from their unanimity that the gun was black or dark;
	
	
	The trial judge undermined other evidence which was capable of casting doubt on the reliability of Mr Taylor’s account that Mr Hristovski had supplied the gun;
	
	
	The trial judge gave the hearsay warning in connection with Detective Ritchie’s notes of what Mr Taylor had said on 1 June 2012;
	
	
	The trial judge’s suggestion to the jury that they could use Detective Ritchie’s note for a hearsay purpose;
	
	
	The trial judge’s criticism of the defence submission that Mr Popovic would not have asked Mr Taylor to pick up ‘something’ by reference to matters which were not established by the evidence or which were incorrect;
	
	
	The trial judge’s summary of Mr Taylor’s evidence relating to the call at 00.49.58 on 8 September 2007;
	
	
	The trial judge posed the rhetorical question in respect of Mr Taylor’s evidence: ‘why would he lie?’ and minimised the effect of errors made by Mr Taylor by inviting the jury to characterise them as ‘matters of detail’; and
	
	
	The trial judge failed to summarise the respective defence case adequately and failed to distinguish between the cases of each of the applicants.
	



	
	Mr Game adopted Ms Rigg’s analysis. Mr Game submitted that the effect of the summing up was not only to weaken the effect of the warnings given about the reliability of Mr Taylor’s evidence (arising from his criminal involvement and the indemnity) but also to reverse the onus of proof. He also relied on the occasions on which the trial judge had encouraged the jury to accept Mr Taylor’s evidence on bases not raised by the Crown.
	
	
	As Mr Game and the other applicants’ counsel also made submissions with respect to the points raised by Ms Rigg, it is convenient to refer to them by reference to these matters although the question whether the summing up was so unbalanced as to deprive the applicants of a fair trial is one to be approached by considering the summing up as a whole.
	


(1)   The trial judge contrasted the defence submissions about the unreliability of Mr Taylor with possibilities that he might be telling the truth


	
	Ms Rigg relied on the extract set out above from SU 21 where the trial judge asked several rhetorical questions which were prefaced with the phrase, “if Mr Taylor is going to concoct a completely cock and bull story”. She submitted that what followed was the trial judge’s prolonged critique of the reliability of defence counsel’s arguments in which his Honour urged that they be approached with caution, if there were possibilities consistent with guilt. She contended that his Honour embarked on a detailed analysis of the differences between observations made by eyewitnesses at Splashes which were largely, if not wholly irrelevant, such as the position of the deceased at the time of the first shot.
	


(2)   The trial judge focussed on the differences between eyewitnesses which had the effect of detracting from their unanimity that the gun was black or dark


	
	The defence counsel made much of the difference between Mr Taylor’s description of the gun as silver and the descriptions given by all eye witnesses, which was that it was black or dark. Ms Rigg contended that the trial judge undertook a detailed review of the evidence of the lighting and inconsistencies in evidence regarding the circumstances of the shooting which had the effect of diminishing the force of the evidence of the eyewitnesses that the gun was black or dark. If the jury accepted that the weapon used in the shooting was black or dark, this would substantially undermine the Crown case against Mr Hristovski as well as damage Mr Taylor’s credibility, since he swore that the gun he collected from Mr Hristovski for Mr Koloamatangi to use to shoot the deceased was silver.
	


(3)   The trial judge undermined other evidence which was capable of casting doubt on the reliability of Mr Taylor’s account that Mr Hristovski had supplied the gun


	
	Ms Rigg contended that Ms Ewen’s estimates of how often she had seen the gun were not only relevant to whether her observation of a firearm supported Mr Taylor’s version of being provided with the gun by Mr Hristovski. She submitted that Ms Ewen’s evidence was also capable of raising a real possibility that the gun to which Mr Hristovski had access in August and early September 2007 did not leave his possession on 8 September 2007, since its appearance was so unlike the gun described by the eyewitnesses at Splashes. Ms Rigg pointed to the following passage in the summing up (SU 38) in which the trial judge said:
	


“May I say, if, one, you treat those estimates of once a fortnight, etcetera, as approximately accurate, and two, you accept Miss Ewen’s evidence of commencing to cohabit with Mr Hristovski in late August, and three, make the assumption that she only ever saw the one gun, that gun was not that about which Mr Taylor gave evidence. However, there is no challenge to her evidence that Mr Hristovski had possession of a silver revolver, so you may think it clear therefore that, providing Mr Hristovski co-operated, there was a silver revolver available to anyone who desired to use it, and one available when Mr Taylor said he and Mr Koloamatangi required it.”


	
	Ms Rigg submitted that the effect of what the trial judge said was that the benefit of Ms Ewen’s evidence was completely lost to the defence, since his Honour postulated that there might have been another gun. She contended that the Crown had not put the argument advanced by the trial judge in the passage set out above and that its inclusion in the summing up had deprived the applicants’ counsel of the opportunity of responding to it.
	


(4)   The trial judge gave the hearsay warning in connection with Detective Ritchie’s notes of what Mr Taylor had said on 1 June 2012


	
	Ms Rigg contended that it was erroneous to give such a warning, which was adverse to the interests of the defence, when it had not been sought, and tended to undermine the evidence relied on by the defence and the defence case.
	
	
	This matter has already been addressed to some extent above. However, its relevance to the unbalanced summing up ground is that it was a warning given against the interests of the applicants, which had not been sought.
	
	
	For reasons given above, s 165(1)(a) did not apply to Detective Ritchie’s note of what Mr Taylor said on 1 June 2012 since it was not tendered or used for a hearsay purpose and was not an admission (since Mr Taylor was not an accused). It was common ground that no party had requested a warning under s 165(2) in respect of the evidence. Nonetheless, the trial judge’s power to give a warning to the jury or inform the jury of matters is preserved by s 165(5). Accordingly, the question is whether a warning was appropriate and, if not, whether it was productive of a miscarriage of justice: Restricted Judgment [2016] NSWCCA 44 at [57] (R A Hulme J, Basten JA and Johnson J agreeing).
	
	
	The weight to be given to evidence is pre-eminently a matter for the jury as the tribunal of fact. The warnings for which s 165 and the common law provide have been developed as a matter of fairness to accused persons because certain evidence has been found to be unreliable in a way which may not be known to the jury as a tribunal of fact. As this Court said in Kanaan v R [2006] NSWCCA 109 at [182]
	


“Section 165(2)(b) requires the warning to inform the jury of matters which may cause the evidence to be unreliable. The purpose of doing so is to provide the jurors with knowledge of matters not within their general experience and understanding (see par [166] supra). Those matters need be stated only with such detail as is required to achieve that purpose. A trial judge in any criminal case is required to do no more than put the respective cases for the Crown and the accused accurately and fairly to the jury; the conduct of the case necessarily bears on the extent to which the judge is bound to comment on and discuss the evidence: Domican v The Queen at 561. The High Court in that case (at 561-562) went on to say, however, that because the seductive effect of identification evidence had so frequently led to proven miscarriages of justice special rules apply in relation to that evidence. In the case where the issue of identification plays any significant part of the Crown case, the judge must isolate and identify for the benefit of the jury any matter of significance which may reasonably be regarded as undermining the reliability of the identification evidence — whatever the defence raised and however the case is conducted.”


	
	It is difficult to see how Detective Ritchie’s evidence of the contents of his note could properly call for a warning. The only aspect of it which might tend to undermine its accuracy was that Detective Ritchie did not make a note of what Mr Taylor said at the time of the interview, but made the note shortly thereafter by way of a summary rather than a word-for-word account. However this was something of which the jury could be taken to be well aware. It is a matter of common experience that a note taken of something someone said at the time the words were spoken is likely to be more reliable than one produced even relatively soon afterwards.
	
	
	It is generally undesirable for a trial judge to give a warning in the case of evidence of a person other than the accused that evidence is unreliable where the evidence favours the accused: see, in the context of negative identification evidence, R v Rose [2002] NSWCCA 455; 55 NSWLR 701 at [297] (Wood CJ at CL and Howie J) and Kanaan v R at [128]. This is particularly where no such warning has been sought by the Crown such as would give defence counsel an opportunity to respond to the application.
	
	
	In my view the effect of the trial judge’s warning was to elevate a matter of common experience to a warning or direction, which thereby attracted the status of the trial judge’s office and served to substantially undermine the probative value of Detective Ritchie’s note, which was to impugn Mr Taylor’s credibility. The warning was both erroneous as a matter of law and inappropriate. Whether it was productive of a miscarriage of justice does not need to be considered in isolation, by reason of the number of other matters relied on.
	


(5)   The trial judge’s suggestion to the jury that they could use Detective Ritchie’s note for a hearsay purpose


	
	Ms Rigg also relied on the passage reproduced above from SU 109 in which the trial judge said that, even if Ms Davenport’s calculations about time were correct, Mr Taylor might have picked up the gun before the first trip to Sydney anyway, in which case “that attack . . . fails”.
	
	
	For the reasons given above, the trial was not conducted by any party on the basis that the version of Mr Taylor’s movements recorded by Detective Ritchie (that he collected the gun before the first trip to Sydney) was true. Counsel would not have been entitled to raise it as a possibility in final address because it had not been put to relevant witnesses: see the discussion of Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 686-692 (Gleeson CJ). It is generally inappropriate for the trial judge to make what is effectively a submission to a jury in the summing up that it could reason to a version of the facts which is inconsistent with the way the case was conducted at trial. Exceptions such as the obligation to address defences or alternative verdicts which have not been raised are not presently relevant. It is even more inappropriate for a trial judge to raise such a matter in a way which is adverse to the interests of accused persons, particularly where, if the Crown had made the submission, the defence would have had a chance to respond.
	
	
	I am persuaded that his Honour’s remarks in SU 109 were inappropriate since they raised a matter adverse to the interests of the accused persons which had not been relied on by the Crown and which had not been explored with the relevant witnesses and in respect of which defence counsel had not had an opportunity to address the jury. Having regard to the importance of Mr Taylor’s evidence to the Crown case they had the potential to cause a miscarriage of justice.
	


(6) The trial judge’s criticism of the defence submission that Mr Popovic would not have asked Mr Taylor to pick up ‘something’ by reference to matters which were not established by the evidence or which were incorrect


	
	At trial, the applicants relied on Mr Taylor’s evidence that Mr Popovic asked him to “pick up something” as a powerful indication that he was seeking to minimise his own responsibility and exaggerate the role of others (the applicants) in the murder of the deceased. They submitted, in effect, that it was implausible that Mr Taylor would not have been aware from the outset that the “something” was a gun. This was, accordingly, another matter which, on the defence cases, served to impugn Mr Taylor’s credibility and was, according to defence counsel, in a similar category to Mr Taylor’s evidence that he was to receive no reward or other remuneration for his part in the killing, which included (on Mr Taylor’s version) going to Mr Hristovski for a reconnoitre with Mr Popovic; going again later to collect the gun; dropping Mr Koloamatangi’s girlfriend in Sydney; providing clothing for Mr Koloamatangi; providing transport for him to and away from Splashes; and delivering the cash to Mr Koloamatangi for the killing.
	
	
	Ms Rigg argued that the passage from SU 120 (reproduced above) not only did not refer to the submission made by the defence at trial but provided no less than the following four reasons why Mr Taylor’s version of the conversation ought be believed:
	



	
	On 20 October 2007, Mr Popovic’s telephone was being bugged;
	
	
	Mr Popovic had been in gaol;
	
	
	Mr Popovic was “friendly with the drug dealing Mr Taylor”; and
	
	
	Mr Popovic was “friendly with the kneecapping Mr Radz”.
	



	
	Ms Rigg submitted that it would have been preferable for the trial judge to summarise the evidence without interleaving it with the Crown case. She also submitted that, if the trial judge included submissions within the summary, they should be balanced and refer to the defence case as well. Further, she submitted that: (1), though true, was irrelevant since the conversation occurred on 7 or 8 September 2007 and took place in person rather than on the phone; there was no evidence of (2); and, as to (3) and (4), although there was evidence that Mr Popovic knew both Mr Taylor and Mr Radz, there was no evidence that he knew of their criminal records or conduct. Although it was accepted that the trial judge had corrected (2) (at SU 127), his Honour left the other matters uncorrected.
	
	
	In my view, what his Honour said at SU 120 was not only incorrect (as to (2), (3) and (4)) and irrelevant (as to (1)) but it was also inappropriate. It was highly prejudicial to the interests of the applicants since it tended to support Mr Taylor’s credibility by reference to matters which had not been established or were irrelevant. Had such matters been relied on by the Crown, defence counsel would have had an opportunity to respond in their respective addresses to the jury. That the trial judge saw fit to correct one out of the four matters but leave the remainder uncorrected would have had a tendency to give the jury the impression that the remaining three could properly be taken into account. Having regard to the importance of Mr Taylor’s evidence to the Crown case this aspect of the summing up had the potential to cause a miscarriage of justice.
	


(7)   The trial judge’s summary of Mr Taylor’s evidence relating to the call at 00.49.58


	
	The defence case was that Mr Taylor’s evidence that the call at 00.49.58 from Mr Koloamatangi to Mr Popovic was made from Warrawong outside Mr Hristovski’s house could not possibly be true, having regard to the objective evidence of the call and the fact that it passed through telephone tower Wollongong CBD-3 which was some distance north from Warrawong, which was not covered by the tower. The defence also relied on the evidence, with other evidence, to show that Mr Taylor’s version that he and Mr Koloamatangi stayed at Mr Popovic’s unit for an hour after the first trip to Sydney was also untrue and that a call at that time from Mr Koloamatangi to Mr Popovic tended to suggest that they were not together at the time.
	
	
	At SU 60-61, the trial judge, after referring to that evidence, postulated (in the passage set out above) that sometimes people ring in advance and that the jury was entitled to take into account their experience of life that this can occur. As set out above in the narrative of the summing up the trial judge refused the consequential application for a discharge of the jury and refused to accede to the request that he ask the jury to disregard all that he had said about Exhibit G and start again. At SU 83, his Honour told the jury (in terms extracted above) that what he had said about people ringing in advance did not amount to a direction of law but could be taken into account by them if they had had general experience of people ringing in advance.
	
	
	Ms Rigg submitted that the effect of what the trial judge said was to support Mr Taylor’s credibility in a way that was unbalanced and not warranted by the evidence.
	
	
	Mr Game relied on the fact that it had never been suggested that a call had been made on the way to Mr Hristovski’s place (which would have been inconsistent with Mr Taylor’s evidence that it was made when they were outside his place at Warrawong). He contended that the proposition removed the inconsistency between Mr Taylor’s evidence that a call had been made from the particular location, and the objective evidence which showed that it was impossible for the call to have been made at that time from the location identified. Mr Game submitted that the inconsistency was powerful because Mr Taylor’s evidence was given at a time when he did not appreciate that it could be disproved (because he did not understand the coverage of the towers and how it related to the telephone records). Mr Game submitted that this aspect of the summing up demonstrated that the trial judge was, effectively, strongly encouraging the jury to accept Mr Taylor’s evidence by arguments which were not explored in the evidence and not advanced by the Crown.
	
	
	Although there is much room for variation in the way a summing up ought be given, I am persuaded that his Honour’s remarks were inappropriate and tended to create a miscarriage.. By interleaving the summary of evidence with remarks such as the one referred to above, his Honour tended to upset the balance of the summing up in favour of the Crown.
	


(8)   The trial judge posed the rhetorical question in respect of Mr Taylor’s evidence: ‘why would he lie?’ and minimised the effect of errors made by Mr Taylor by inviting the jury to characterise them as ‘matters of detail’


	
	This matter has, to a large extent, been dealt with in the context of the separate ground addressed above. However, the applicants submitted that the trial judge had engaged in such a persistent attempt to “resurrect” and “rehabilitate” Mr Taylor’s evidence throughout the course of the summing up and that this question was posed in a number of ways to the same effect. They submitted that this had the effect of skewing the summing up against their interests and in favour of the Crown, having regard to the importance of Mr Taylor’s evidence to the Crown case.
	
	
	As referred to above, Mr Game submitted that, in effect, the trial judge told the jury that the “default assumption” was that Mr Taylor was truthful which was tantamount to asking why Mr Taylor would lie. Mr Game referred to SU 21 and the reference to the implausibility of Mr Taylor providing detail that was incorrect if he were “going to concoct a completely cock and bull story”. He also referred to SU 61 and the “calling ahead” scenario that had not been put by any party. Mr Game directed attention to SU 85-86 and in particular the passage at SU 86 where the trial judge outlined the following four “possibilities” with respect to Mr Taylor’s evidence:
	



	
	he is wholly untruthful (his whole account is “cock and bull”);
	
	
	his version is wholly correct;
	
	
	the inconsistencies in his evidence are such that one could not rely on him; and
	
	
	the inconsistencies in his evidence relate to “matters of detail” which do not throw doubt on the substance of his version.
	



	
	Mr Game submitted that the effect of the trial judge’s summing up was to promote the fourth possibility and thereby neutralise or minimise the errors and inaccuracies that defence counsel had exposed in Mr Taylor’s evidence.
	
	
	Mr Game referred to SU 93-94 in which the trial judge described the following three pieces of evidence given by Mr Taylor as the only “vital bits”: first, that he and Mr Koloamatangi obtained the gun from Mr Hristovski; secondly, that the gun was provided pursuant to an arrangement with Mr Popovic; and, thirdly, that he drove Mr Koloamatangi to Splashes, waited for him and drove him away.
	
	
	Mr Game referred to the trial judge’s treatment of the gathering in the Woolworth’s car park at SU 102 and his Honour’s reference to the inconsistencies in Mr Taylor’s account of being present. He submitted that the trial judge’s reference to the jury’s difficulties in remembering events five years previously (in Mr Taylor’s case, the statements were made in 2012 about the events in 2007) was an impermissible attempt to persuade the jury of the fourth possibility: that he made errors in matters of detail but was correct in the “vital bits”.
	
	
	Mr Game contended that the trial judge’s warning about Detective Ritchie’s note (at SU 102-104) should be seen in the context of the theme developed by his Honour that, although Mr Taylor was incorrect about matters of detail, he was a reliable witness. Mr Game also relied on the circumstance that the trial judge’s suggestion that the statement could be true (that the gun was collected before the first trip to Sydney) removed the forensic force of the defence submission that the events could not have occurred as Mr Taylor described in his evidence.
	
	
	Mr Game referred to SU 105-106 in which the trial judge raised the question whether, if Mr Taylor was wrong about his location when the call at 00.49.58 was made, “any untruthfulness was deliberate”. Mr Game also drew the Court’s attention to SU 105-106 where the trial judge addressed Mr Taylor’s evidence that he was with Mr Popovic for an hour and that he was told that the deceased was at the North Gong Hotel. The trial judge described his evidence as “not only wrong, but inexplicable”. The passage at SU 106 set out above that commences, “One could speculate” was relied on by Mr Game as an illegitimate invitation by the trial judge to engage in speculation in the absence of evidence. He also contended that the trial judge’s comments, at SU 106-107, that there was no apparent reason for Mr Taylor to make up the evidence provided further illustrations of the trial judge’s contravention of “the principle that truthfulness is not to be inferred from the absence of an apparent motive to lie”: R v Jovanovic at 535G per Sperling J. Further examples were pointed out at SU 118-119. Mr Game submitted that, in effect, the trial judge was inviting the jury to use the discrepancies between Mr Taylor’s evidence and the objective evidence and the inconsistencies within his evidence, to bolster his credibility.
	
	
	I am persuaded by the submissions which were made, or adopted, by all counsel for the applicants which I have set out above. It was not appropriate for the trial judge to pose the rhetorical question, why would Mr Taylor lie. There were several reasons why he might have lied which derived from the evidence (that he was criminally involved, a reward was offered and that he had been indemnified) but it was not for the trial judge to invite the jury to speculate as to whether there was any other reason or to understand that they ought believe him unless they were able to identify a reason why he would lie.
	


(9)   The trial judge failed to summarise the respective defence case adequately and failed to distinguish between the cases of each of the applicants.


	
	Although the way in which a summing up is constructed and delivered is a matter for the discretion of the trial judge, the summary of the Crown case and the case for each accused is, as referred to above, necessary. In the present case, the trial judge commented on the evidence, principally of Mr Taylor, in the summary of the evidence, which effectively incorporated the inferences for which the Crown contended as well as inferences which were in favour of the Crown but for which the Crown had not contended. Because this process had been undertaken as part of the summary of evidence, the outline of the Crown case and the applicants’ cases was done in a general way which did not distinguish between the cases for and against the respective applicants. I do not regard the trial judge as having put fairly to the jury the case which was made on behalf of each of the applicants.
	
	
	The present was not a case where the evidence for all of the applicants was the same. The role of each was separate and distinct. The trial judge was obliged to distinguish between their respective positions and the evidence relevant to each.
	
	
	Although it is necessary for a trial judge to summarise the cases of each accused in any case, it was particularly important that it be done in case such as the present where the conduct said to implicate each accused, and their roles as contended for by the Crown, were so different. This was not a case such as Huynh v The Queen where a trial judge was entitled to depart from the conventional process of addressing the case for each accused separately. Although the trial judge referred briefly to the Crown case against each accused separately, his Honour did not adequately address the fact there was significantly more evidence to implicate Mr Koloamatangi and Mr Popovic than to implicate Mr Hristovski and Mr Bubanja, which was potentially very much to the detriment of Mr Hristovski and Mr Bubanja.
	
	
	The trial judge did not summarise the defence cases individually at all. Indeed, at SU 155 the trial judge referred to “the defence case” as if there was only one. This may have led the jury to consider that all the accused were in the same position notwithstanding the standard direction given by the trial judge at the commencement of the summing up at SU 3 that they needed to consider the case of each accused separately and bring in separate verdicts. For the reasons given by Street CJ in R v Towle at 340, a general direction that each case be considered separately is insufficient to discharge the obligation to put the case of each accused separately to the jury in the summing up.
	


Conclusion on unbalanced summing up ground


	
	I am satisfied, on the basis of the cumulative effect of the matters listed above, that the trial judge impermissibly instructed the jury as to how they could reason towards a verdict of guilt for each of the applicants by accepting the evidence of Mr Taylor. The effect of the summing up effectively deprived the applicants of the benefit of the warning to which they were entitled under s 165(1)(d) of the Evidence Act in respect of Mr Taylor’s evidence. The trial judge failed to distinguish between the cases made by each applicant in summarising “the defence case”.
	
	
	For the reasons set out above, I am satisfied that the summing up was such as to deprive each of the applicants of a fair trial.
	
	
	In these circumstances it would be inappropriate to apply the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act since, for the reasons given above, the applicants have been, in important respects, denied procedural fairness: Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300 at [45]. They have not had the benefit of a fair trial.
	
	
	In light of my conclusion, it is not necessary to deal with the additional ground raised on behalf of Mr Popovic: that a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the failure of the trial judge to discharge the jury after the trial judge’s comments at SU 119-120.
	


Unreasonable verdict grounds


	
	Two of the applicants, Mr Bubanja and Mr Hristovski, press unreasonable verdict grounds, which, if made out, would result in a verdict of acquittal being entered in each case.
	


The relevant principles


	
	The principles which must be applied in determining whether a verdict “is unreasonable or cannot be supported” within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act were authoritatively determined by the majority in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493. The question the court must ask itself is:
	


“… whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.”


	
	In answering that question:
	


“… the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.”


	
	The majority also said in M v The Queen at 494-495:
	


“In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Although the propositions stated in the four preceding sentences have been variously expressed in judgments of members of the Court in previous cases, we have put aside those differences in expression in order to provide authoritative guidance to courts of criminal appeal by stating the propositions in the form in which they are set out above.”


	
	The majority view in M v The Queen has been reiterated and applied by the High Court and remains the law: MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [55]-[58]; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [11]-[14]; and Filippou v The Queen at [12].
	


The weight to be given to the jury’s advantage


	
	The passage set out above from M v The Queen requires an appellate court to consider whether a jury’s advantage is capable of resolving any doubts which the appellate court might have. This consideration is more complicated in the present application because of the number of grounds of appeal. Where the sole ground of appeal is that the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported and there is no challenge to the directions given by the trial judge, the weight to be given to the jury’s verdict may be considerable: R v Baden-Clay [2016] HCA 35 at [65]-[66]. But where an appellate court finds that a jury has been misdirected or that there has been a relevant miscarriage of justice, the position is otherwise since the assumption is to be made that the jury follows the directions of the trial judge: Demirok v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 20 at 22 per Barwick CJ.
	
	
	In such circumstances, the weight to be attributed to a jury’s verdict may be relatively slight (SKA v R (No. 2) [2012] NSWCCA 205 per Adams J at [311], Hislop J agreeing, Beazley JA dissenting on other grounds). In some circumstances, the jury’s advantage ought be excluded from consideration in this exercise altogether, as was found to be appropriate in R v Ortega-Farfan [2011] QCA 364; 215 A Crim R 251 where Fraser JA said at [75] (Chesterman JA and Mullins J agreeing):
	


“I am not persuaded that the doubt is one which is capable of resolution by reference to the advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the complainant and the other witnesses give evidence. The jury must have found that the complainant was a reliable and credible witness. Her demeanour might well have suggested to the jury that she was a truthful witness. But her demeanour could not resolve the doubt about the reliability of her account which arises from the inconsistencies and weaknesses apparent on the face of the record. In any event, the jury’s verdict should not be taken into account in this exercise because the jury might have attributed substantial weight to the evidence of the covert conversations which should not have been admitted.”

[Emphasis added.]


	
	There are common elements to the determination whether a verdict was unreasonable and the task of determining whether there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice (Weiss v The Queen at [41]). The limitations on the use to be made of a jury’s verdict in determining whether there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice are also relevant to an unreasonable verdict ground. In Cesan v The Queen [2008] HCA 52; 236 CLR 358 the plurality (Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ; Gummow J agreeing) said at [129]:
	


“In many cases where the proviso is to be considered, the fact that the jury returned a guilty verdict will indicate rejection of any explanation proffered by the accused in evidence. In the present cases, however, the relevant hypothesis is that the jury did not pay attention to all of the evidence led at trial. In particular, the jury was distracted when one of the two accused persons was giving his evidence. In those circumstances, it is not possible, in these cases, to place any weight upon the fact that the jury returned its verdicts of guilty.”

The task of the appellate court in the present case


	
	The task of this Court is to consider the whole of the evidence against Mr Hristovski and Mr Bubanja and decide whether it thinks that, upon the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the particular applicant was guilty. If this Court experiences a doubt in that process, it is required to consider whether the doubt is one that the jury, too, ought to have experienced. It is only when the Court considers that the doubt could have been resolved by the jury by hearing and seeing the witnesses that it may conclude that there has been no miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	In respect of the last-mentioned matter, Ms Rigg and Mr Game submitted that, although the jury had the advantage of seeing and hearing Mr Taylor, they were, in effect, misdirected by the trial judge in the summing up and therefore no, or little, weight ought be given to their verdict in the event that this Court experiences a doubt as to Mr Hristovski’s or Mr Bubanja’s guilt. Accordingly, they contended that any allowance made by this Court for the jury’s advantage ought also take into account the disadvantage to which they were subjected by reason of the unbalanced summing up and erroneous direction as to the hearsay matter.
	


The evidence against Mr Hristovski


	
	Apart from the telephone records, the evidence against Mr Hristovski was largely comprised of Mr Taylor’s evidence that he and Mr Koloamatangi had gone to his house at Warrawong on the night of the murder, after their first trip to Sydney, and collected a gun, which was used by Mr Koloamatangi to shoot the deceased. Mr Taylor’s credibility was the principal issue as far as Mr Hristovski was concerned.
	
	
	Although this Court does not have the advantage of seeing and hearing Mr Taylor give evidence or observing his demeanour, it is not thereby precluded from making any assessment of his credibility, in the sense of reliability. Lord Pearce said in Onassis & Calogeropoulos v Vergottis [1968] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 403 at 431:
	


“‘Credibility’ involves wider problems than mere ‘demeanour’ which is mostly concerned with whether the witness appears to be telling the truth as he now believes it to be. Credibility covers the following problems. First, is the witness a truthful or untruthful person? Secondly, is he, though a truthful person, telling something less than the truth on this issue, or, though an untruthful person, telling the truth on this issue? Thirdly, though he is a truthful person telling the truth as he sees it, did he register the intentions of the conversation correctly and, if so, has his memory correctly retained them? Also, has his recollection been subsequently altered by unconscious bias or wishful thinking or by over much discussion of it with others? Witnesses, especially those who are emotional, who think that they are morally in the right, tend very easily and unconsciously to conjure up a legal right that did not exist. It is a truism, often used in accident cases, that with every day that passes the memory becomes fainter and the imagination becomes more active. For that reason a witness, however honest, rarely persuades a Judge that his present recollection is preferable to that which was taken down in writing immediately after the accident occurred. Therefore, contemporary documents are always of the utmost importance. And lastly, although the honest witness believes he heard or saw this or that, is it so improbable that it is on balance more likely that he was mistaken? On this point it is essential that the balance of probability is put correctly into the scales in weighing the credibility of a witness. And motive is one aspect of probability. All these problems compendiously are entailed when a Judge assesses the credibility of a witness; they are all part of one judicial process. And in the process contemporary documents and admitted or incontrovertible facts and probabilities must play their proper part.”


	
	Several of the matters referred to by Lord Pearce arise for consideration when Mr Taylor’s evidence is assessed, including: motive in minimising his involvement and exaggerating that of others; antipathy towards Mr Hristovski arising from the assault in April 2009; his own criminal involvement in respect of which he sought indemnity; the passage of time since the events occurred; inconsistencies between his statements at various times and his sworn evidence; inconsistencies between his evidence and objective or incontrovertible evidence; and inconsistencies between his evidence and contemporaneous notes made by others.
	
	
	The evidentiary matters particularly relied upon by Ms Rigg as bearing on whether it was open to the jury to find Mr Hristovski guilty beyond reasonable doubt are addressed in turn below.
	


When the gun was collected


	
	Mr Taylor gave evidence that Mr Hristovski was not involved in the dinner at Kings Chinese Restaurant in Wollongong on the evening of 7 September 2007. However, Detective Ritchie recorded in a note made on 1 June 2012 after meeting with Mr Taylor that Mr Hristovski was at the dinner and that he and Mr Koloamatangi went to Mr Hristovski’s house after dinner to collect the gun before they delivered Mr Koloamatangi’s girlfriend to Sydney that even",2016-09-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2700975,Rothe v Scott (No. 5) [2016] NSWDC 225,"Judgment


	
	In Rothe v Scott (No. 4) [2016] NSWDC 160, the plaintiff was awarded $150,000 damages following publication of grave allegations about the plaintiff on Facebook. The plaintiff now brings applications for:
	



	
	Interest on the damages awarded;
	
	
	Costs on an indemnity basis; and
	
	
	Interest on costs.
	



	
	These are my reasons for making the orders sought by the plaintiff.
	


Interest on the damages awarded


	
	The plaintiff claims pre-judgment interest pursuant to s 100 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). The entitlement of a plaintiff to claim interest on defamation damages is of long standing (John Fairfax & Sons v Kelly (1987) 8 NSWLR 131) and while s 100, by use of the word “may”, conveys discretion, interest is almost invariably awarded, as Applegarth JA (setting aside a refusal by the first instance judge to award interest) explains in Cerrutti v Crestside Pty Ltd [2016] 1 Qd R 89 at [93] – [102].
	
	
	The appropriate rate for non-economic loss has been accepted as being 4%: MBP (SA) Ltd v Gogic (1991) 171 CLR 657. Awards of 4% in defamation are rare, as the 4% figure is reduced to take into account that the damage has been spread over the period from publication to judgment: Grattan v Porter [2016] QDC 202 at [113].
	
	
	In Grattan v Porter the amount awarded was 3%. Where the damage is evenly spread, a rate of 2% is mathematically appropriate, but if the evidence demonstrates that significant damage occurred soon after publication (continuing at a lesser intensity over the subsequent period) the rate of 3% is applied: McGaw v Channel Seven Sydney [2006] NSWSC 1270 per Rothman J; Davis v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 946 per McLellan CJ at CL. As that is generally the case in defamation actions, interest of 3% has become the common figure, as Robertson DCJ notes in Grattan v Porter at [112] – [113].
	
	
	The evidence in this case supports the finding of significant damage shortly after publication. Mr Dibb also points out that the matter complained of was removed from the internet soon after publication, which supports the inference that most of the damage was suffered early on, and submits that the 3% rate should be awarded.
	
	
	This brings me to a consideration of the defendant’s submissions in reply. The defendant, although previously represented by two legal firms with experience in defamation, represented himself at the hearing. He also represented himself (by telephone link) on this application and made submissions in reply to Mr Dibb, who had served on him written submissions in support of all the plaintiff’s applications.
	
	
	It is the obligation of the judge hearing applications such as these to set out fully and frankly the submissions of both parties. This is particularly the case where a party is a litigant in person. However, the defendant’s submissions had nothing to do with the legal issues the subject of these applications, in that they consisted solely of allegations of an inflammatory nature about a wide range of persons. For this reason, Mr Dibb, in his client’s interests, submitted that if I were to set out in my judgment what the defendant had said, this would merely multiply the defamatory publications by giving the defendant a further platform with which to attack the plaintiff.
	
	
	While this request may appear to be contrary to open justice as well as being contrary to the interests of the parties in litigation, it is the course that I propose to take. The judicial process should not be used (or perhaps I should say misused) by a party to make public statements of the kind the defendant made to the court today. I take into account that his accusations went beyond the plaintiff and amounted to slurs upon a wide range of groups of people, none of whom would be able to answer the defendant’s claims. Accordingly, I do not propose to refer to the content of the defendant’s submissions in any further detail.
	
	
	I accept Mr Dibb’s submissions made as to the rate of interest. The date of publication was 12 March 2014. Mr Dibb estimates that the pre-judgment period is one year and 143 days (1.392 years) and the appropriate calculation, if the court awards interest at 3%, is: $150,000 x 3% x 1.392 years = $6,264.00.
	


Costs


	
	To promote settlement of defamation proceedings, s 40 of the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) provides for indemnity costs where no offer of settlement has been made. Section 40 provides:
	


“40 Costs in defamation proceedings

(1) In awarding costs in defamation proceedings, the court may have regard to:

(a) the way in which the parties to the proceedings conducted their cases (including any misuse of a party’s superior financial position to hinder the early resolution of the proceedings), and

(b) any other matters that the court considers relevant.

(2) Without limiting subsection (1), a court must (unless the interests of justice require otherwise):

(a) if defamation proceedings are successfully brought by a plaintiff and costs in the proceedings are to be awarded to the plaintiff—order costs of and incidental to the proceedings to be assessed on an indemnity basis if the court is satisfied that the defendant unreasonably failed to make a settlement offer or agree to a settlement offer proposed by the plaintiff, or

(b) if defamation proceedings are unsuccessfully brought by a plaintiff and costs in the proceedings are to be awarded to the defendant—order costs of and incidental to the proceedings to be assessed on an indemnity basis if the court is satisfied that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to accept a settlement offer made by the defendant.

(3) In this section:

settlement offer means any offer to settle the proceedings made before the proceedings are determined, and includes an offer to make amends (whether made before or after the proceedings are commenced), that was a reasonable offer at the time it was made.”


	
	The plaintiff relies on s 40(2)(a) to seek an order that costs be paid on an indemnity basis. The only offer ever made by the defendant was by a letter from the defendant’s solicitor received on 28 August 2015. That letter was couched in combative terms:
	


“Dear Sir

…

We refer to our client’s further amended defence filed on 20 August 2015.

Our client contends that, having regard to the matters pleaded, your client’s claim will fail. Indeed, for the reasons pleaded, our client contends that your client’s claim simply lacks merit.

As your client will not doubt appreciate, both parties have incurred legal costs to date and, inevitably, further substantial costs will be incurred if the matter proceeds to trial.

Against that background, our client invites your client to discontinue his proceedings at this time. If he agrees to do so, our client will agree to there being no order as to the costs of the proceedings but subject to any previous costs orders being vacated.

Our client contends this offer to be a generous one, given the costs that our client has already incurred. Our client appreciates that some costs orders have already been made in favour of your client and he further appreciates that even if he is successful in defending these proceedings, certain costs would not be recoverable in any event, being those costs associated with the various versions of our client’s defence, and the application for leave to file a further amended defence.

This letter is written in accordance with the principles enunciated in Calderbank v Calderbank [1975] 3 All ER 333.

This offer is open for acceptance for a period of 7 days from the date of this letter and, if the offer is not accepted by that time, it is withdrawn, given that we will need to continue to undertake further work on the matter.”


	
	Mr Dibb submits that this “offer” is in no sense an offer of compromise: Leichhardt Municipal Council v Green [2004] NSWCA 341. The offer from the defendant actually would have required the plaintiff to abandon the benefit of the costs orders that had already been made in his favour. As such, this is not an offer that meets the requirements of s 40(2)(b), as the offer is, on its face, unreasonable: Davis v Nationwide News [2008] NSWSC 946 at [27] – [30].
	
	
	The plaintiff, by contrast, sought a retraction and apology from the very beginning, as the correspondence tendered by the defendant during the hearing (which he acknowledged receiving) demonstrates. Once the plaintiff contacted the defendant and explained the errors in the Facebook post, it should have been obvious to the defendant (and to his solicitors when he consulted them) that there was no real defence available for this gravely defamatory publication.
	
	
	The history of these attempts to plead a defence of justification by successive solicitors, in circumstances where that defence was incapable of any proper particularisation, is further evidence of the combative approach taken by the defendant and of his failure to engage with the need to consider an appropriate settlement. Mr Dibb submits, and I agree, that this is the purpose to which s 40 is directed. The plaintiff should therefore be awarded his costs of and incidental to the proceedings on the indemnity basis.
	


Interest on costs


	
	The plaintiff also claims interest on costs. As these provisions have been the subject of recent amendment, I will first set out the two regimes which govern the awarding of interest on costs under the Civil Procedure Act 2005.
	
	
	Prior to 24 November 2015, s 101 subs (4) and (5) of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 provided:
	


“(4) The court may order that interest is to be paid on any amount payable under an order for the payment of costs.

(5) Interest under subsection (4) is to be calculated, at the prescribed rate or at such other rate as the court may order, as from:

(a) the date or dates on which the costs concerned were paid, or

(b) such later date as the court may order.”


	
	By reason of Courts and Other Justice Portfolio Legislation Amendment Act 2015 (NSW), which came into operation on 24 November 2015, s 101 subs (4) and (5) were amended as follows:
	


“(4) Unless the court orders otherwise, interest is payable on an amount payable under an order for the payment of costs.

(5) Interest on an amount payable under an order for the payment of costs is to be calculated, at the prescribed rate or at any other rate that the court orders, as from the date the order was made or any other date that the court orders.”


	
	The savings provisions, which is now incorporated into Schedule 6 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005, at s 21 provides:
	


“Part 8 - Provisions consequent on enactment of Courts and Other Justice Portfolio Legislation Amendment Act 2015

21 Pending proceedings

The amendments made to this Act by Schedule 1.2 to the Courts and Other Justice Portfolio Legislation Amendment Act 2015 do not extend to proceedings commenced before the commencement of that Subschedule and those proceedings may continue as if those amendments had not been enacted.”


	
	The statement of claim in these proceedings was filed on 12 March 2014, well before the cut-off date of 24 November 2015. That means that the entitlement to interest on costs falls under s 101 in its previous form, and that the plaintiff must demonstrate an entitlement to such costs. Interest on costs was not commonly awarded under s 101, and this includes defamation proceedings: Polias v Ryan (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1 at [63] to [65] per Rothman J.
	
	
	In seeking the order for interest on costs, Mr Dibb draws to my attention the statement by Gleeson JA (with whom Ward and Emmett JJA agreed) in Doppstadt Australia v Lovick & Son Developments [2014] NSWCA 158 at [403]:
	


“Thus in the absence of any countervailing discretionary factor, it is appropriate that an order for interest on costs be made to compensate the party having the benefit of a costs order for being out of pocket in respect of relevant costs which it had paid. There is no requirement to establish that the circumstances of the case are out of the ordinary: Drummond and Rosen Pty Ltd v Easey & Ors (No 2) [2009] NSWCA 331 at [4] per Macfarlan JA (Tobias JA agreeing) citing Lahoud v Lahoud [2006] NSWCA 126 at [82] - [83] per Campbell J.”


	
	Mr Dibb submits that, conformably with this reasoning, unless some countervailing factor is identified by the defendant, the plaintiff should be entitled to interest on costs. Such factors would be vacated hearing dates, unsuccessful interlocutory arguments, or other factors resulting in adverse costs orders (Doppstadt Australia v Lovick & Son Developments at [405]), which did in fact occur in these proceedings, but solely as a result of the conduct of the defendant and not the plaintiff. In particular, the defendant sought to vacate a hearing date, had his defence of justification struck out and applied unsuccessfully to have it reinstated, and failed to comply with orders for discovery.
	
	
	Taking all of the above into account, I am satisfied that the plaintiff should be entitled to interest pursuant to s 101, and that such should run from the dates on which the plaintiff made each payments of costs. While I note that actual evidence of payment was provided in Doppstadt Australia v Lovick & Son Developments at [404]), it is not necessary for the court to receive actual evidence that payments of costs have been made, or that the costs have been ‘’fructifying in the wrong pocket”: Polias v Ryan at [63] to [65] per Rothman J. Nor is it necessary for me to set out the details of when any such payments occurred in the interest on costs order that I propose to make, as any dispute as to quantum on assessment of costs can be dealt with by the costs assessor on the basis of the statements to this effect in this judgment.
	


Orders


	
	The plaintiff is awarded interest on costs at 3% from 12 March 2014, making a total of $6,264 and increasing the judgment sum to $156,264.
	
	
	The defendant is to pay the plaintiff’s costs of these proceedings on an indemnity basis pursuant to s 40(2)(a) of the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	The plaintiff is entitled to an order for interest on those costs at the prescribed rate pursuant to s 101 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005.

2700980,Garth v R [2016] NSWCCA 203,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The applicant was charged by indictment with an offence under s 25A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (Crimes Act) (Count 1). Section 25A(2) makes it an offence to unlawfully assault another person by intentionally hitting the other person and thereby causing their death, while intoxicated. Section 25B of the Crimes Act mandates that a court is required to impose a sentence, and non-parole period, of not less than eight years on a person guilty of an offence under s 25A(2).

The applicant sought an order that the indictment be quashed on the ground that Count 1 did not disclose an offence known to law. He contended that the offence created by s 25A(2) and s 25B was constitutionally invalid. The primary judge dismissed the motion, finding that s 25B could be severed from s 25A and that, in those circumstances, it was unnecessary to determine the constitutional question. The applicant appealed.

The issue on appeal was whether Count 1 disclosed an offence known to law and whether that required determination of the constitutional question.

The Court held (Bathurst CJ, Beazley P and Simpson JA agreeing) dismissing the appeal:

(i)    It is settled practice across all courts in the judicial hierarchy to decline to deal with a constitutional question unless there exists a state of facts which makes it necessary to decide such a question in order to do justice in the given case and to determine the rights of the parties: [19]-[22] (Bathurst CJ); [36] (Beazley P); [37] (Simpson JA).

Lambert v Weichelt (1954) 28 ALJR 282; Universal Film Manufacturing Company (Australasia) Limited v State of New South Wales (1927) 40 CLR 333; [1927] HCA 50; Wurridjal v The Commonwealth (2009) 237 CLR 309; [2009] HCA 2 applied

(ii)   An offence under s 25A(2) of the Crimes Act is punishable by s 25A(2), which provides for a maximum penalty of 25 years. Section 25B of the Crimes Act does not impose a punishment, it operates to impose a constraint on the sentence which can be imposed. Even if the constraint is constitutionally invalid, an offence under s 25A(2) remains an offence punishable by law. Section 25B does not operate as a penalty-creating provision: [24], [29] (Bathurst CJ); [36] (Beazley P); [37] (Simpson JA).

Ngo v The Queen (2013) 233 A Crim R 121; [2013] NSWCCA 142 considered

(iii)   The structure of ss 25A and 25B of the Crimes Act indicate a legislative intention to separate the offence-creating provision from the constraint. The offence is created by s 25A alone, not in combination with s 25B: [30] (Bathurst CJ); [36] (Beazley P); [37] (Simpson JA).

(iv)   The issue of severance only arises once a provision has been determined constitutionally invalid; it does not arise in determining whether a constitutional issue should be addressed: [33] (Bathurst CJ); [36] (Beazley P); [37] (Simpson JA).

Tajjour v State of New South Wales (2014) 254 CLR 508; [2014] HCA 35 applied

(v)   An offender’s inability to properly assess his or her decision to plea does not justify the court dealing with a constitutional issue that does not arise in the proceedings: [34] (Bathurst CJ); [36] (Beazley P); [37] (Simpson JA).

Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: By an indictment presented at the District Court at Parramatta on 15 October 2015, the applicant, Hugh Baccalla Garth (the applicant), was charged with the following offences:
	


“1.   On the 3rd day of May 2014, at Rooty Hill in the State of New South Wales, did when intoxicated and over the age of 18 years, unlawfully assault Ray Manalad by intentionally hitting Ray Manalad with a clenched fist, thereby causing the death of Ray Manalad.

S 25A(2) Crimes Act 1900 Law part code 81829

2.   On the 3rd day of May 2014, at Rooty Hill in the State of New South Wales did cause grievous bodily harm to Myrik ONG and was reckless as to causing actual bodily harm.

S 35(2) Crimes Act 1900 Law part code 77098”


	
	The applicant was not arraigned on the indictment and the copy of the indictment provided to the Court has not been signed by a Crown Prosecutor. No point was taken as to these matters.
	
	
	By notice of motion filed on 9 November 2015, the applicant sought an order that the indictment be quashed on the ground that Count 1 did not disclose an offence known to law. In the alternative, an order was sought that the indictment be permanently stayed as an abuse of process of the court. The application for a permanent stay was ultimately abandoned.
	
	
	The basis of the application was that the offence created by s 25A(2) and s 25B of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (Crimes Act) was unknown to law. The argument, broadly speaking, was that s 25B was repugnant to the judicial process in a fundamental degree and that it distorted the institutional integrity of the court by requiring the court to proceed in a manner that does not ensure equality before the law and in a manner that involves arbitrary and non-judicial punishment.
	
	
	The primary judge dismissed the motion. I have dealt with her Honour’s reasons in more detail below but her conclusion was that s 25A of the Crimes Act could be severed from s 25B and that, in those circumstances, the indictment disclosed an offence known to law irrespective of the constitutional validity of s 25B.
	


The relevant legislation


	
	Section 25A of the Crimes Act provides as follows:
	


“25A   Assault causing death

(1)   A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if:

(a)   the person assaults another person by intentionally hitting the other person with any part of the person’s body or with an object held by the person, and

(b)   the assault is not authorised or excused by law, and

(c)   the assault causes the death of the other person.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 20 years.

(2)   A person who is of or above the age of 18 years is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (1) when the person is intoxicated.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 25 years.

(3)   For the purposes of this section, an assault causes the death of a person whether the person is killed as a result of the injuries received directly from the assault or from hitting the ground or an object as a consequence of the assault.

(4)   In proceedings for an offence under subsection (1) or (2), it is not necessary to prove that the death was reasonably foreseeable.

(5)   It is a defence in proceedings for an offence under subsection (2):

(a)   if the intoxication of the accused was not self-induced (within the meaning of Part 11A), or

(b)   if the accused had a significant cognitive impairment at the time the offence was alleged to have been committed (not being a temporary self-induced impairment).

(6)   In proceedings for an offence under subsection (2):

(a)   evidence may be given of the presence and concentration of any alcohol, drug or other substance in the accused’s breath, blood or urine at the time of the alleged offence as determined by an analysis carried out in accordance with Division 4 of Part 10 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002, and

(b)   the accused is conclusively presumed to be intoxicated by alcohol if the prosecution proves in accordance with an analysis carried out in accordance with that Division that there was present in the accused’s breath or blood a concentration of 0.15 grams or more of alcohol in 210 litres of breath or 100 millilitres of blood.

(7)   If on the trial of a person for murder or manslaughter the jury is not satisfied that the offence is proven but is satisfied that the person has committed an offence under subsection (1) or (2), the jury may acquit the person of murder or manslaughter and find the person guilty of an offence under subsection (1) or (2). The person is liable to punishment accordingly.

(8)   If on the trial of a person for an offence under subsection (2) the jury is not satisfied that the offence is proven but is satisfied that the person has committed an offence under subsection (1), the jury may acquit the person of the offence under subsection (2) and find the person guilty of an offence under subsection (1). The person is liable to punishment accordingly.

(9)   Section 18 does not apply to an offence under subsection (1) or (2).

(10)   In this section, cognitive impairment includes an intellectual disability, a developmental disorder (including an autistic spectrum disorder), a neurological disorder, dementia, a mental illness or a brain injury.”


	
	Section 25B provides as follows:
	


“25B   Assault causing death when intoxicated—mandatory minimum sentence

(1)   A court is required to impose a sentence of imprisonment of not less than 8 years on a person guilty of an offence under section 25A (2). Any non-parole period for the sentence is also required to be not less than 8 years.

(2)   If this section requires a person to be sentenced to a minimum period of imprisonment, nothing in section 21 (or any other provision) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 or in any other Act or law authorises a court to impose a lesser or no sentence (or to impose a lesser non-parole period).

(3)   Nothing in this section (apart from subsection (2)) affects the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act 1999 or any other Act or law relating to the sentencing of offenders.

(4)   Nothing in this section affects the prerogative of mercy.”


	
	These sections were inserted into the Crimes Act with effect from 31 January 2014. In the Second Reading Speech that introduced the legislation, the following remarks were made:
	


“A person will be guilty of the new offence of assault causing death as proposed by new section 25A (1) in this legislation if he or she unlawfully assaults another person by intentionally hitting the other person with any part of his or her body, or with an object he or she is holding, causing the death of the other person. The offence will carry a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. A person will be criminally responsible for the offence even if the person does not intend or foresee the death of the other person, and even if the death was not reasonably foreseeable. If the offender was intoxicated by alcohol or drugs at the time of the assault, a minimum mandatory sentence of eight years imprisonment and a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment apply. A ‘drug’ includes a drug under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and a poison, restricted substance or drug of addiction in the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act. This will capture steroids as well as psychoactive substances.”

The primary judgment


	
	The primary judge referred to the generally settled practice of declining to answer constitutional questions where it was unnecessary to do so. She stated that, in her view, it was difficult to see how the applicant would suffer significant prejudice if it was determined that s 25B could be severed from s 25A and that, if s 25A standing alone disclosed an offence known to law, the trial could proceed.
	
	
	The primary judge concluded, relying on s 31(2) of the Interpretation Act 1937 (NSW) (Interpretation Act), that s 25A(2), which her Honour described as the offence creating provision, was capable of standing alone irrespective of any separate section providing for a mandatory minimum penalty. In those circumstances, the primary judge dismissed the notice of motion without finding it necessary to consider the constitutional question.
	
	
	The applicant contended the primary judge was in error in adopting this approach.
	


The applicant’s submissions


	
	The applicant submitted that the question of whether it is necessary to determine a constitutional issue depends on whether there exists a state of facts which makes it necessary to decide the question in order to do justice and determine the rights of the parties. He submitted that “necessary” means material to the determination of the controversy and that it was not unnecessary simply because the issue could be determined at a later point in time.
	
	
	In that context, the applicant submitted that it was necessary to identify the justiciable controversy. He submitted that, in the criminal jurisdiction, the particular controversy is not split into the trial and sentencing hearing. He submitted that the punishment of offences encompasses both the trial and the imposition of sentence in a single judicial controversy.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that, in the present case, the Crown alleged that he was guilty of an offence against s 25A(2) of the Crimes Act and liable to punishment in accordance with s 25B of that Act. He submitted that the justiciable controversy therefore encompasses the assertion by the Crown that the applicant is guilty and liable to punishment under s 25B. He submitted that that assertion is implicit in the indictment. The applicant submitted that the primary judge proceeded on an erroneous basis, namely that the accused must be convicted before there is a justiciable controversy about his liability to punishment.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the applicant submitted, in effect, that an indictment which only relied on s 25A to the exclusion of s 25B would be a different indictment although “it may look the same”. She submitted that an indictment not relying on s 25B would mean that the substance and character of the offence changed completely because the accused would be going to trial for an offence that did not contain a mandatory minimum sentence and was thus in a different position in terms of appreciating and determining what his or her plea might be. She submitted that s 25B was inextricably entwined with s 25A and with the creation of the offence.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the applicant placed some reliance on that passage of the Second Reading Speech to which I have referred above at [8]. She submitted that, in the present case, it was not the intention of the legislature that s 25A(2) would stand alone. She submitted that the minimum penalty was inseverable from the offence.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the applicant also submitted that the primary judge was in error in relying on s 31(2) of the Interpretation Act, submitting that it would only arise if s 25B of the Crimes Act was held to be constitutionally invalid.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the applicant also submitted that the constitutional question should be determined as a matter of procedural fairness and, more broadly, that it was in the interests of justice and the administration of the criminal law for offenders to understand their liability to punishment.
	


Consideration


	
	The practice of declining to deal with a constitutional issue unless it is necessary to do so is well established. In Lambert v Weichelt (1954) 28 ALJR 282, Dixon CJ stated that “[i]t is not the practice of the Court to investigate and decide constitutional questions unless there exists a state of facts which makes it necessary to decide such a question in order to do justice in the given case and to determine the rights of the parties”: at 283. Although his Honour was referring to the High Court, that practice is common to all courts in the judicial hierarchy.
	
	
	In Universal Film Manufacturing Company (Australasia) Limited v State of New South Wales (1927) 40 CLR 333; [1927] HCA 50, Isaacs ACJ stated that “[a] Court will not proceed to declare a statute invalid unless that be necessary as a step in determining the rights of parties”: at 342.
	
	
	More recently, in Wurridjal v The Commonwealth (2009) 237 CLR 309; [2009] HCA 2, Crennan J referred to the settled practice to which I have referred: at [355].
	
	
	In that context, it must be remembered that the issue between the parties in the present case is whether Count 1 on the indictment discloses an offence known to law. If this can be determined without having to consider the constitutional challenge to s 25B of the Crimes Act, then the latter issue should not be considered.
	
	
	As the applicant pointed out, an indictment must identify the nature of the offence and the manner in which it has been committed and the indictment must disclose an offence punishable by law: R v Mai (1992) 26 NSWLR 371 at 377; Doja v The Queen (2009) 198 A Crim R 349; [2009] NSWCCA 303 at [5].
	
	
	The essence of the applicant’s argument was that, as s 25B was constitutionally invalid, the offence charged was not one punishable by law. The difficulty with this argument is that the offence is punishable by s 25A(2) itself, which provides for a maximum penalty of 25 years. Section 25B does not impose a punishment. Rather, it operates to impose a constraint on the sentence which can be imposed. Even if the constraint is constitutionally invalid, an offence under s 25A(2) remains an offence punishable by law.
	
	
	A somewhat similar situation was considered by this Court in Ngo v The Queen (2013) 233 A Crim R 121; [2013] NSWCCA 142, an appeal by Mr Ngo against a life sentence imposed on him for the murder of Mr John Newman, an elected Member of the Legislative Assembly of NSW. At the time of the offence, s 19A of the Crimes Act provided as follows:
	


“19A   Punishment for murder

(1)   A person who commits the crime of murder is liable to penal servitude for life.

(2)   A person sentenced to penal servitude for life for the crime of murder is to serve that sentence for the term of the person's natural life.

(3)   Nothing in this section affects the operation of section 442 (which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than penal servitude for life).

(4)   This section applies to murder committed before or after the commencement of this section.

(5)   However, this section does not apply where committal proceedings (or proceedings by way of ex officio indictment) for the murder were instituted against the convicted person before the commencement of this section. In such a case, section 19 as in force before that commencement continues to apply.

(6)   Nothing in this section affects the prerogative of mercy.”


	
	Section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (Sentencing Procedure Act) came into force after the date of Mr Newman’s murder, but before Mr Ngo was sentenced for the offence. The section was in the following terms:
	


“61   Mandatory life sentences for certain offences

(1)   A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.”


	
	The appellant in that case sought to argue that the sentencing discretion miscarried on the basis that the sentence was imposed pursuant to s 61(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act and that that provision did not have retrospective effect.
	
	
	The argument was rejected. In the course of her judgment, Simpson J (as her Honour then was), with whom the other members of the bench agreed, made the following remarks concerning the interaction of s 19A of the Crimes Act and s 61(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act (at [64]-[65]):
	


“[64]   The first was that the sentencing alternatives were (i) sentencing the applicant ‘under s 61(1)’ and (ii) sentencing the applicant ‘at common law’. That is to misunderstand the role of s 61(1). It assumes, wrongly, that s 61(1) is a penalty-creating provision in the same way as s 19A(1) is a penalty creating provision (although the applicant’s argument ignored s 19A(1)). It is incorrect to treat s 61(1) as a penalty-creating provision. While s 19A(1) renders a person convicted of murder liable to imprisonment for life, s 61(1) does no such thing. It is a provision that directs a court (although, perhaps, superfluously) that, in the circumstances it specifies, a life sentence must be imposed.

[65]   Any sentence imposed in respect of a conviction for murder is imposed under s 19A(1), even where, by reason of the application of s 21(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, it is a sentence for a determinate period.”


	
	Section 25B of the Crimes Act, in my opinion, similarly does not operate as a penalty-creating provision. Any punishment is imposed by s 25A(2).
	
	
	The applicant sought to overcome this difficulty by submitting that, as a matter of construction, s 25B was inextricably intertwined with s 25A(2) and with the creation of the offence. The difficulty with this argument is that it does not reflect the structure of the legislation. The legislature deliberately separated the offence creating provision from what I have described as the constraint. To read the section in the manner suggested by the applicant would be contrary to that express legislative intention.
	
	
	Little assistance is to be gained from the Second Reading Speech. The passage to which I have referred above at [8] does no more than summarise the effect of the legislation. It says nothing as to whether the punishment is imposed by s 25A(2) or s 25B.
	
	
	In those circumstances, the primary judge was correct in concluding that the indictment, so far as it related to Count 1, disclosed an offence known to law.
	
	
	I should add two matters. First, although the primary judge placed some reliance on s 31(2) of the Interpretation Act, that section and the principles relating to it would only fall for consideration if it was concluded that any part of the legislation was invalid: Tajjour v State of New South Wales (2014) 254 CLR 508; [2014] HCA 35 per Gageler J at [168]-[178]. Having regard to the view I have taken, no question of severance or of reading down the legislation arises in the present case.
	
	
	The second matter is this: the applicant complained that, absent determination of the constitutional validity of s 25B, he has been unable to properly assess whether he should plead to the offence or otherwise. Whether or not this is the case, it does not provide a justification for dealing with an issue that does not arise in the proceedings, even if the Court had power under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (Criminal Appeal Act) to do so. Further, this decision does not preclude the applicant from seeking relief other than an order quashing the indictment. It may be that the applicant would have standing to seek declaratory relief as to the constitutional validity of s 25B: see CGU Insurance Ltd v Blakeley (2016) 90 ALJR 272; [2016] HCA 2 at [102] and the cases there cited. However, this Court, constituted as a Court of Criminal Appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act, has no jurisdiction to hear proceedings for such relief. Its only jurisdiction is to hear the appeal under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act seeking an order that the indictment be quashed.
	
	
	In these circumstances, leave to appeal should be refused.
	
	
	BEAZLEY P: I agree with Bathurst CJ.
	
	
	SIMPSON JA: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

		22 September 2016",2016-09-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701004,Regina v DJH [2016] NSWDC 211,"Remarks on Sentence

1             On 14 October 2015 the offender pleaded guilty before a Magistrate to numerous child sexual assault offences.  The matter involves seven different complainants and offences that spanned approximately twenty years. Pleas of guilty were adhered to in the District Court and, accordingly, the offender is entitled to the full 25% discount for the utilitarian pleas of guilty.

2             In respect of a number of the complainants there is a Form 1 document relating to other offending involving that same complainant.  In dealing with the Form 1 matters I acknowledge that I will need to apply and give proper effect to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in The Attorney General’s Application Under section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 otherwise known as the Guideline Judgment on Form 1 matters.  Given the nature of the offending to which the matters on the Form 1 documents relate is serious in itself, taken with the number of matters on the Form 1 documents, the matters on the Form 1 documents must have some meaningful impact on the sentence that is ultimately imposed.

3             A number of the offences on which I am passing sentence carry standard non-parole periods.  I will set out the maximum penalties in respect of each offence when dealing individually with the seven victims.  In the cases where a standard non-parole period is applicable I acknowledge that I am engaged in a one-step instinctive process where the principle guideposts are the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period.

4             At the sentence hearing on 9 June 2016 I indicated to counsel that it was my intention to, at the conclusion of these remarks, invoke section 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 and impose an aggregate sentence.  Although I will deal with the facts in respect of the victims in the order in which they appear on the papers, I will set out the indicative sentences (and also indicate the “starting point”) in a table at the conclusion of these remarks shortly before setting out my formal orders. I will deal with the issue of the maximum penalty and if applicable the relevant standard non-parole period and I will make an assessment of the seriousness of the offence at the time of dealing with the facts.  Given that some of the matters on which the offender appears for sentence carry a standard non-parole period, for the sake of consistency I will use the scale usually utilised in assessing the seriousness of matters that carry standard non-parole periods.

5             The relevant legislation requires that I make an order that none of the victims be identified and that no information tending to identify them be published.  Given the familial relationship between many of the victims and the offender I direct that there be no publication of the name of the offender.   I will refer to the victims generally by initials.  This is not to depersonalise them but to ensure that they remain anonymous.

Matter involving LF – H55495379 sequence 2

6             The one charge on H55495379 is one that avers an indecent assault between 10 July 1993 and 31 December 1993 at Dubbo on a child under 10 years of age.  The victim LF was 7 years of age.  There are no Form 1 matters in respect of this victim. The victim’s father is an uncle of the offender, making the victim and the offender cousins.  When the victim’s parents separated, the offender and the victim’s father shared a flat in Dubbo, which the victim visited on weekends.  

7             The offending occurred on a weekend when the victim was visiting her father when she was seven years of age.  The offender was alone in the flat with the victim.  The offender showered and after doing so sat on a lounge chair behind her while she was playing with a super Nintendo.  The offender said, “Come here and give me a hand job”.  The offender told her that her father would be angry if she did not comply.  Believing this she complied, kneeling between the offender’s knees and following instructions when he told her to “grab it [his penis] with your hand”. She was guided by the offender, who was naked.  The victim masturbated the offender for about five minutes while the offender had his eyes shut.  She was crying throughout.  The offender suddenly jumped off the chair and ran to his bedroom.  The victim’s aunty arrived at the house but she was afraid to complain.  

8             The victim’s contact with the offender lessened.  In about 2002 she was living with her aunt Judy and the offender was also living at the same premises.  She avoided being alone in his company.

9             LF was the first of the victims to complain.  She told a friend at about the time of her sixteenth birthday that the offender had assaulted her when she was younger.  In early 2014 LF made a formal statement to the police.  A surveillance device warrant was issued on 6 June 2014 and LF assisted police in participating in an intercepted call.  The offender made admissions, including, “I used to be a sick cunt and I wish, I’m not very proud of it and I wish I was never born….I used to wish I was dead actually…I tried a couple of times and I just can’t understand why I did some fuckin’ stupid thing like that in my entire life.  Pathetic gross and I just honestly, you know, I wish I died.  My sicker self when I was young…yeah it’s not your fault”.  

10          The maximum penalty for the offence at the relevant time was ten years imprisonment.  At the relevant time a standard non-parole period did not apply. The complainant was seven years of age.  The offender was naked.  The incident went on for some five minutes.  The complainant was crying. The matter is a serious example of an indecent assault on a child under 10 which I would assess as being slightly above the mid-range of objective seriousness.

Matter involving TB – H5506554 sequence 2

11          There is one offence involving the victim TB, namely an offence of sexual intercourse with a person between 10 and 16 years by a person in authority, contrary to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act, 1900. The offence occurred between 23 January 1992 and 22 January 1994 at Dubbo.  The victim was 10 or 11 years of age at the time.  The maximum sentence applicable at the time of the offence was ten years imprisonment.  There was no applicable standard non-parole period.

12          TB lived with her parents in Dubbo.  The next door neighbour was the aunt and uncle of the victim LF referred to above within these remarks. The offender babysat TB and her sister.  Just after Christmas when the victim was aged 10 or 11 she was at the offender’s flat.  She discovered that her pushbike had been stolen.  She was unable to return to her home as her pushbike had been stolen.

13          Later in the evening the victim was lying on the bed in the offender’s room wearing a nightdress and underwear.  The offender entered the room and closed the door behind him.  He had just come from having a shower and was dressed only in a towel.  The offender approached the bed, leant over the complainant and spread her legs apart, and took the towel from around his waist.  

14          The offender then placed his hand under the victim’s nightdress and moved her underwear to one side.  He put his penis into the victim’s vagina.  The victim said it felt hard and rough and it was painful.   She told him to stop and to get off of her to which he replied that it would be right.  The victim felt the offender trying to force his penis even further inside her vagina.  A portion of her statement is extracted in the facts, namely,

“The pain was unbearable.  It was hurting and couldn’t go all the way into my vagina.  I began to cry.  It was like he didn’t care.  It felt like this went on for about ten minutes.  When I got the chance I got up off the bed away from D [the offender]…I was still crying.  I can remember seeing blood around my vagina and underwear”.

15          The victim was 10 or 11 years of age and accordingly very much towards the lower age limit of the charge.  There was some degree of force.  The intercourse was penile/vaginal, was understandably very painful and continued for some time.  There was bleeding.  In these circumstances the offence is a particularly serious example of the offence and towards the upper end of the range of seriousness. Lack of consent is not an element of the offence.

16          The victim also gave an account of the offender placing a rubber band type object around his genitals, grabbing a large knife from a drawer, placing his penis on to the bench and saying “Cut it”.  The victim said no; she took the knife for a short period of time but declined to cut the offender.  She saw the offender using the knife in a cutting motion but did not recall seeing blood.

17          The offender attempted from August 2013 to February 2014 to contact the victim via Facebook but she did not reply.  In February or March 2014 the victim became aware of the police investigation and told a friend and then her mother of what had occurred.  A formal statement to police was made in March 2014.

Matters involving MH – H55898653

18          MH is a nephew of the offender.  The agreed facts recite that MH was indecently and sexually assaulted by the offender on numerous occasions from the age of five until about twelve or thirteen years of age.  The offender appears for sentence in respect of two charges of sexual intercourse with a person under 10 contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act (sequences 2 and 8), one count of sexual intercourse with a person between 10 and 14 contrary to s 66C(1) of the Crimes Act (sequence 7) and one count of indecent assault on a person under 10 years contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act (sequence 1).  In addition there are two charges of sexual intercourse with a person under 10 (sequences 4 and 5) and a count of sexual intercourse with a person between 10 and 4 years (sequence 6) on a Form 1 document to be taken into account.  

19          The maximum penalty for the offences of sexual intercourse with a person under 10 was 20 years imprisonment.  The maximum penalty for the offence of sexual intercourse with a person between 10 and 14 was 16 years imprisonment.  The maximum penalty for the aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act was ten years imprisonment.  None of the matters involving the complainant MH carry a standard non-parole period.

20          The agreed facts detail what are described at the “First Charged Episode”, “Second Charged Episode” and “Third Charged Episode”.  Going to the first episode the facts recite that the offender first assaulted the complainant MH when the complainant was five years of age in the period May to July 1997 at Stockton near Newcastle.  The complainant was with the offender in the offender’s bedroom.  The offender called the complainant to over to the bed.  The complainant, who had been playing a video game, turned around to see the offender’s shorts and underpants pulled down exposing his (the offender’s) erect penis.  The complainant complied when the offender said “Come here”.  The offender took the complainant’s hand and placed it over his erect penis moving the complainant’s hand up and down his penis for a few minutes before removing his hand so that the complainant was masturbating him unassisted. This is the conduct which relates to Sequence 1, which is a count of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act. Given the conduct and the complainant’s age, I assess this matter as being slightly above mid-range.

21          After this the offender grabbed the complainant around the back of his head forcing the complainant’s head to the offender’s groin and said, “Suck on it”.  The offender held his penis upright as it went into the complainant’s mouth and directed the complainant to go up and down to which the complainant complied for about thirty seconds.   

22          The complainant’s teeth apparently made contact with the tip of the offender’s penis to which the offender said, “Stop, your teeth hurt”. The offender motioned with his lips over his teeth demonstrating to the complainant how he wanted him to continue.  He told the complainant to “go again”. The complainant complied, taking the offender’s penis in his mouth for about five minutes and moving his mouth as directed.  It is this incident to which sequence 2, ie the first count of sexual intercourse with a person under 10 relates. The complainant was quite young, being five years of age. The offence involved persistence on the part of the offender.  Although a standard non-parole period did not apply, I would assess this matter as being slightly above mid-range, the factor taking it above the mid-range being the age of the complainant.

23          After that conduct the offender pulled down the complainant’s shorts and underpants and knelt over the complainant after which he placed the complainant’s penis in his mouth and sucked on it for about two minutes.  The complainant’s penis did not become erect.  The offender got off the bed and pulled up his pants.  The offender told the complainant to get up, which he did and he gave the complainant about $5 in change.  This conduct is that to which sequence 4 on a Form 1 document relates.

24          The next (second) episode relates to when the complainant was seven or eight years of age and in about 1999 when the offender was living in a flat attached to the complainant’s family home at an address in Cunningham Street, Dubbo.  The offender and the complainant were home alone, the complainant’s family being in Sydney in respect of medical treatment for one of the complainant’s siblings.  The offender, who was about 33 or 34 years of age, called the complainant to his bedroom and removed his own shorts and underpants, exposing his penis.  He told the complainant to get on his knees and he complied.  The offender took the complainant’s head and forced his head to his groin and put his flaccid penis in the complainant’s mouth.  The complainant began to suck on the offender’s penis which within a short time became erect.  This is the conduct to which sequence 5 relates and is one of the Form 1 matters.

25          Once the offender’s penis was erect he told the complainant to stand and pulled down the complainant’s pants and underpants.  Both stepped out of their clothing.  The offender pulled the complainant towards the bed and told him to kneel on the bed.  He knelt on the bed showing his bottom to the offender who obtained some lubricant from a cupboard.  The facts then recite part of the complainant’s statement, which I will also include within these facts as it graphically indicates what then occurred:

“He grabbed me from behind my waist and pulled me back towards him.  He then said, ‘this is going to feel weird’.  I felt his penis press up against my anus.  I felt D [offender] pushing his penis slowly into my anus.  I could feel what I now know to be lube on his penis as it was cold and wet.  As he did this, I felt pain to my anus and I began to scream.  He tried to push his penis even further into my anus and I continued to scream from the pain.  I started to cry and was screaming out repeatedly ‘Ow’.  D [offender] tried to push his penis into my anus for a matter of seconds before he pulled it out.  He grabbed me by the right shoulder and yelled at me, ‘You’re a wuss’.  I fell off the bed onto the ground.  I picked up my clothes and put them back on.  He then yelled at me, ‘Get out of the room’.  I ran from the room”.

26          This conduct is that which relates to sequence 8, a charge of sexual intercourse with a person under 10, and is one of the substantive matters for which the offender appears for sentence.  The complainant was seven or eight, the intercourse was penile/anal and involved some degree of force and persistence by the offender. The complainant was screaming in pain.  In these circumstances I am of the opinion that this is a serious example of sexual intercourse with a person under 10.  Although the matter does not carry a standard non-parole period, I would find the offending is above mid-range, given the factors to which I have just referred.

27          The third episode relates to conduct that occurred in the latter part of 2004 when the complainant was 13 and in Year 7 at High School.  From about 2001 the offender lived in a number of homes in Dubbo that he shared with his mother.  The complainant went to an address in East Street Dubbo where his grandmother and the offender lived.  The complainant went to the downstairs area, which was occupied by the offender, to play on one of the offender’s computers.  The offender was sitting on a chair in the room watching television.  He called the complainant over to him and said, “Drop your dacks.  I want to see if you’ve changed down there”.  The complainant said no and went back to the computer.  The offender pulled him back and said in a firmer voice, “Drop them”.

28          The complainant made no oral reply but lowered his pants and underpants exposing his penis.  The offender took hold of the complainant’s penis, put it in his mouth and began sucking on it and after a few minutes the complainant’s penis became erect.  Sequence 6 on a Form 1 document relates to this conduct.

29          After some few minutes the offender went to the bathroom and obtained some hair conditioner which he rubbed on the complainant’s erect penis.  The offender removed his shorts and underpants, knelt on a chair and said, “Stick it in”.  He complainant angrily replied, “No” to which the offender replied in an angry tone, “Do it”.  The complainant then inserted his penis into the offender’s anus. The offender told the complainant to go in and out.  The complainant complied for a few minutes but felt increasingly upset and sick.  He removed his penis and told the offender that he could not do it anymore.  This is the conduct to which sequence 7 (sexual intercourse with a person between ten and 14) relates.  The matter is within the mid-range of objective seriousness.

30          The complainant apparently recalls telling his step-mother in 2011 that the offender had assaulted him from about the age of five.  A further complaint was made to his stepmother and father after other family members had come forward.

Matters involving SH – H 55115903

31          SH was born on 8 December 1997 and is the niece of the offender.  The facts recite that the offender indecently and sexually assaulted SH on numerous occasions when she was between the ages of three or four to 10 with the indecent conduct ceasing with the onset of puberty.  SH often slept over at the house of the offender and his mother who looked after her while her parents were away seeking medical treatment for a younger sibling. Even after the complainant moved from Dubbo she still returned to spend time in the school holidays. There are four substantive matters for which the offender appears for sentence and two additional matters on a Form 1 document.

32          The first of the substantive matters (sequence 1) relating to SH occurred when she was about five years of age between December 2002 and December 2003 and is a count of sexual intercourse with a person under 10.  The maximum penalty was increased from 20 to 25 years during the period covered by the charge and Parliament specified a standard non-parole period also during the period covered by the charge.  As I understood the submissions, it was the joint position of the parties that I should sentence on the basis that the maximum penalty was 20 years and that a standard non-parole period did not apply.  Independently I have reached the conclusion that this is the basis on which I should deal with the matter.

33          The complainant was five years of age and the offender was 37 or 38.  At the offender’s suggestion the complainant was sleeping in the offender’s bed on the bottom floor of the house.  The complainant woke to find herself laying face down with her knees tucked up under her stomach and her bottom up in the air.  Her pants and underpants had been pulled down to her ankles by the offender.  She felt the offender pressing his body up against her from behind and “something hard and warm being pushed in and out of her vagina”.  Clearly, she is describing penile/vaginal intercourse.  The complainant felt pain but did not call out. She saw the offender kneeling behind her.  She said that it felt like that it went on “forever” but acknowledges that it may have been for a few minutes.  The complainant rolled up into a ball crying and the offender returned to bed and went to sleep. The intercourse was penile/vaginal.  The complainant was about five and therefore very young.  The intercourse was painful and continued for several minutes.  These factors in combination put the matter above the mid-range of seriousness.

34          The second episode involving SH involves one count of indecent assault on a person under 10 contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act (sequence 2 on a Form 1 document) and one count of sexual intercourse with a person under 10 contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act, which is one of the substantive matters (sequence 3). The maximum penalty for the matter contrary to s 66A is twenty five years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 15 years applies to that matter.  The aggravated indecent assault, although on a Form 1 is serious in itself noting that the maximum penalty for that offence was 10 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of eight years.

35          When the complainant was six, ie between December 2003 and December 2004, she was at home alone with the offender in his flat in East Street, Dubbo on an occasion after school.  The offender was 38 or 39. The offender inquired of the complainant if she wanted to do him a favour.  She agreed and walked toward him, the offender as she did so undid his pants and exposed his penis and said, “Touch it for me”.  She said “Why”, with which the offender grabbed her am and placed her hand on his penis and moved it up and down for about five minutes.  The offender’s penis became erect.

36          The offender told the complainant to open her mouth. He grabbed the back of her head, pushing his erect penis into her mouth, the complainant describing it as nearly choking her.  The offender moved his penis in and out of her mouth.  This continued for about ten to fifteen minutes.  The complainant was crying.  The complainant “thinks” that the offender ejaculated on his stomach.

37          The sexual intercourse is fellatio.  The complainant was six.  There was some degree of force involved and the intercourse continued for 10 to 15 minutes.  In these circumstances I am of the opinion that the matter is slightly above the mid-range of objective seriousness.  If necessary I would also make the same assessment of the aggravated indecent assault.

38          The third episode so far as SH is concerned is a count of indecent assault on a person under 10 years, contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act and is sequence 4.  It occurred between December 2003 and December 2004.  It carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of eight years applies.

39          This occurred the day after the events of the second episode – ie the counts to which sequences 2 and 3 relate.  The complainant was alone with the offender in the lounge room of his flat.  He called her over to where he was seated.  When she approached he unzipped his pants and exposed his penis.  He then grabbed her hand and put it on his penis.  He kept his hand on hers moving it up and down.  His penis became erect.  The complainant was crying.  The conduct continued for ten to fifteen minutes before the offender ejaculated onto the complainant’s hand.  This was skin on skin contact with the complainant grabbing the complainant’s hand.  It lasted for ten to fifteen minutes and the complainant was crying.  In these circumstances I assess the matter as being slightly above the mid-range of objective seriousness.

40          On an occasion after the events that I have just recited, the complainant was at the home of the offender and she sat on a chair in the lounge room.  The offender asked her to get a sharp knife.  Confused, she did so and handed the knife to the offender.  The offender lowered his pants exposing his genitals and told her to “cut it off”.  He grabbed her hand, forcing it so the knife was touching his penis.  She cried.  The offender’s penis was apparently not cut.  There is no charge relating to this incident.

41          The next matters for which the offender appears for sentence are sequences 5 and 6 in what is described as the fourth charged episode in respect of SH.  Sequence 5 is a count of sexual intercourse with a person under 10 contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act on a Form 1 and sequence 6 is also a count of sexual intercourse with a person under 10. This offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years applies.

42          These offences occurred when the complainant was eight years of age between December 2005 and December 2006.  The complainant was visiting her grandmother and the offender.  The complainant and her younger cousin (JH) had agreed to spend the night.  The two girls were in a back sun room playing with dolls.  The grandmother had gone out and, accordingly, the girls were home alone with the offender.

43          The offender called out to SH, saying that he needed to talk to her.  She went to his bedroom.  Once there the offender closed the door behind her and lifted her onto the bed.  He removed her pants and underpants while she sat on the side of the bed. He exposed his erect penis through the fly in his pants.  He grabbed the complainant’s head, pulled her face towards him and placed his penis into her mouth.  He held the complainant’s head while he moved his penis in and out for about five minutes.  This conduct relates to sequence 5 which is on a Form 1 document.

44          The offender then rolled the complainant face down on to the bed. He pulled her legs under her chest and inserted his penis into her vagina, which caused immediate pain.  The offender had one hand on one of her shoulders and his other hand on her back, pushing her down into the bed. He moved his penis in and out of her vagina for about half an hour.  This stopped when the complainant’s grandmother pulled up outside.  The complainant went to her grandmother straight away told her that she was unwell and went home.  JH remained.

45          This matter involves penile/vaginal intercourse that continued for about half an hour in circumstances where the offender was in effect holding the complainant on the bed. I am of the opinion that the matter is slightly above the mid-range of objective seriousness.

46          The facts recite that SH made a generalised complaint about the offender in 2008 but in 2010 and 2011 the complainant denied any wrongdoing against her in a conversation between her and JH. In 2011 SH made a complaint to her step mother and the abuse was disclosed to a counsellor.  She was interviewed by police on 28 October 2011 and initially did not want to name the offender.  She later did so but did not proceed any further with her complaint.  She gave a detailed statement to police on 9 April 2014.

Matters involving JH – H55085021

47          There are two charged episodes, one between June 2003 and August 2003 and another between June 2006 and December 2006. JH is also a niece of the offender.  The facts recite that the offender indecently assaulted JH on numerous occasions when she was aged between seven and 13 with the improper activity ceasing when she reached puberty.  

48          Sequence 2 is a charge of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act.  The maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of eight years applies to this charge. Sequence 4, which is the other substantive matter for which the offender appears for sentence in respect of JH, is a charge of sexual intercourse with a person between 10 and 14 contrary to s 66C(1) of the Crimes Act.  The maximum penalty is 16 years imprisonment.  There is no standard non-parole period applicable to the matter to which sequence 4 relates.

49          The first charged episode relates to an occasion a few weeks after the complainant’s seventh birthday, which was on 17 June 2003.  The complainant was visiting her grandmother and the offender was living downstairs.

50          The offender was showering while the complainant was watching the television in the offender’s room.  After showering, the offender went to the room wearing a towel around him.  He said something to the effect of, “have you ever tried this before” or “Have you ever seen someone doing this?”  He removed the towel and threw it on his bed and began masturbating.  The offender then approached the complainant, took her hand and placed her hand on his erect penis in a masturbating motion.  She tried to remove her hand but the offender held it firmly in place. This continued for about two minutes after which he went to the bathroom and returned to the bedroom naked.  The complainant heard her grandmother call out and she went back upstairs but did not complain. The facts recite part of the complainant’s statement to the effect that she could recall the offender repeating over time that what they were doing was not a bad thing.  

51          The complainant was seven years of age.  The act went on for a couple of minutes and involved the offender taking the complainant’s hand and placing it on his erect penis after he had masturbated.  The matter is within the mid-range of objective seriousness, but towards the upper end of the mid-range.

52          The second charged episode relating to JH occurred sometime after the complainant’s tenth birthday, ie 17 June 2006, but before Christmas Day of 2006.  The complainant was at her grandmother’s home for a sleep over with her cousin SH.  The grandmother went out and the offender returned from visiting a local fast food outlet.  The complainant and SH (who incidentally, is one of the other victims of the offender’s improper sexual conduct) played with dolls in a back room.  The offender took SH to his room and sexually assaulted her.  SH asked to be taken home but the complainant JH remained at the house.  

53          Later that evening the grandmother went to bed.  JH was playing on a computer.  The offender told JH that she could sleep in his room.  They both got into the bed and the offender turned on the television.  After a short time the offender took the complainant’s hand and placed it on his penis on the outside of his clothing and forced her hand in a masturbating motion while he held her hand in place.  This went on for some few minutes after which the offender’s penis became erect.  This conduct relates to a charge of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act which is on Form 1 document which attaches to sequence 4.

54          Following the conduct outlined in the paragraph immediately above, the offender removed his lower clothing and the complainant’s boxer shorts and underpants.  He said, “It’s OK, don’t worry about it”.  He rolled the complainant on to her stomach lying on top of her.  He then inserted his penis into the complainant’s anus, which caused the complainant immediate pain.  She began to cry into a pillow.  The intercourse continued for about five minutes before the offender abruptly got up, wrapped a blanket around him and ran from the room. The complainant, sobbing, went to her grandmother’s room.  This act of intercourse relates to sequence 4.  

55          The intercourse went on for some minutes and caused pain.  The complainant was ten and therefore towards the lower end of the age range covered by the charge.  The matter is in my opinion above the mid-range of objective seriousness.

56          The facts record that prior to making her police statement the complainant had not detailed these assaults to anyone.  She spoke to SH.  In 2013 she was contacted by LF and made a complaint in general terms.

Matters involving EH – H55619169

57          Sequence two relates to a charge of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment and to which a standard non-parole period of eight years applies.

58          The complainant lived at another country centre.  On an occasion when she was eight – ie between February 2007 and January 2008 – she visited the offender’s home, which he shared with his mother. In the evening the complainant was playing on a computer in the offender’s bedroom.  The offender exposed his penis to her and asked her to, “play with it and like suck on it and all that”.  He showed her how to touch his penis, which she did with her hand.  This stopped when there was a noise from the stairs.

59          This matter involved skin on skin contact with the offender’s exposed penis.  The conduct did not continue for very long.  On the facts before me there was no degree of force.  The matter is towards the lower end of the mid-range of objective seriousness.

60          There is a matter on a Form 1 document which is exhibit a classified RC or X18 movie to a minor contrary to s 14(1) of the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Enforcement Act, 1995. This carries a fine of 100 penalty units.  On a visit at the Christmas school holidays, again while the complainant was eight, the offender was home alone with the complainant.  He told her to come to his room and she did so.  Once there the offender showed the complainant photographs of adults having sex and later a movie showing adults having sex.  The offender said, “We should try that”.  The complainant refused despite a number of requests.  The grandmother arrived home and the complainant left the room.

61          A complaint was made when the complainant was about nine years of age.  The complainant’s mother was, according to the facts, too shocked to do anything about it and also thought that none of the complainant’s father’s family would believe it against a background of some difficult relationships. EH also complained to her stepmother in 2011. The complainant was interviewed by police in April 2014.

Matters involving KB – H59226949

62          The complainant was born on 8 February 1983 and had a number of siblings.  In about 1986 the complainant and her family moved to an address in Yarunga Street, Dubbo.  The offender was the nephew of a neighbour who lived across the road.  The families became friendly with each other.  The offender committed offences against KB between February 1989 and December 1995.  There are four substantive matters in respect of which the offender appears for sentence, namely, one count of indecent assault contrary to s 61E(1) of the Crimes Act which at the relevant time carried a maximum penalty of four years imprisonment, two charges of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act which at the time carried a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment and one count of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act which carried a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment.  There is a charge of commit act of indecency contrary to s 61N which is on a Form 1 document.  Standard non-parole periods did not apply at the time.

63          Going to sequence 1, a charge of indecent assault contrary to s 61E(1) of the Crimes Act, the offender’s parents moved into a caravan which was in the yard of the home occupied by the offender.  The complainant lived with other family members in Wellington because of the lack of room.  The complainant was visiting her parents on an occasion when she was six – ie between February 1989 and February 1990.  The complainant went into the house where she was alone with the offender.  He stood naked in the doorway of his bedroom, called the complainant over and said, “Can you play with my doodle”.  She said that she did not want to. The offender took the complainant’s hand and placed it over his penis and moved her hand in order that it masturbated him.  The complainant maintained this continued for about twenty minutes.  The offender ejaculated into a towel.  I assess this matter as being above mid-range given the age of the complainant, the time for which the conduct continued and the fact of ejaculation.

64          The next incident involving KB occurred between February 1992 and February 1993 when she was nine years of age.  This is sequence 3 and is a charge of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act, 1900, the complainant being under 10 years of age.  On an occasion just before Christmas the complainant went to the offender’s home.  He was 26 or 27 years of age at the time.  The complainant was in his bedroom.  He pulled down his shorts and underpants, standing in front of the complainant and asked her to play with his penis.  She felt she had no choice.  He took her hand and placed it on his penis and moved it so it masturbated him.  The complainant recalled this continued for twenty to thirty minutes and the offender ejaculated into a towel.  The offender told the complainant not to tell anyone.  I assess this matter as slightly above mid-range noting the complainant was eight, the length of time for which the conduct continued and the fact that the offender ejaculated.

65          Sequences 5 and 6 are the next matters involving KB, with sequence 5 being a matter on a Form 1 that attaches to sequence 6.  Sequence 6 is a charge of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(2), the complainant being under 10 years of age and the Form 1 matter (sequence 5) is a charge of commit act of indecency. These incidents occurred when the complainant was eight or nine years of age.

66          The complainant was alone with the offender at his home. The offender was about 26 or 27.  He gave the complainant some money to go to a nearby shop and she went and bought some lollies.  She returned and began to eat the lollies. The offender got up, went to his bedroom and then called out to the complainant.  She went to the offender’s room to find the offender naked from the waist down, masturbating. This act is the commit act of indecency on the Form 1.  The offender then took the complainant’s hand and placed it on his penis and he moved her hand back and forth so as to masturbate his penis. This continued for about 20 to 30 minutes and the offender ejaculated into a towel.  This is the conduct to which sequence 6 relates.  I assess the matter as being slightly above mid-range given the nature of the conduct, the time for which it continued and the ejaculation.

67          The remaining matter involving KB occurred in the Hunter Valley region to where the offender moved in the mid 1990’s.  He was aged 29 or 30 years. The complainant was 11 or 12. The offender took the complainant to visit his parents.  The complainant walked down the hallway and the offender who was in his room called on her to come into his room.  She went into the room and he was naked from the waist down.  He asked her did she want to play with his doodle.  She did not reply. The offender took the complainant’s hand and placed it on his penis and moved it up and down so as to masturbate him. He told her that it was okay and that he would not hurt her.  The offender ejaculated into a towel and told the complainant not to tell anyone.  This is the conduct to which sequence 7 relates, which is a charge of Aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act, 1900 the complainant being under 16 years.  I assess the matter as slightly above mid-range (for an offence contrary to s 61M(1) noting the age of the complainant, the conduct and the ejaculation.

68          The complainant made a brief disclosure to her mother in about 2013 and then to other family members.  During the police investigation a surveillance device warrant was obtained.  LF spoke to the offender and asked about KB.  The offender’s response could only be construed as an admission.

Arrest

69          The offender was arrested on 20 August 2015 and declined to be interviewed.

70          The facts in places recite in respect of some of the complainants that apart from the specific matters for which the offender appears for sentence that there was other conduct.  In those cases the offender is sentenced on the basis that the specific offences in respect of which sentences are imposed, are not isolated incidents.

71          This matter involves seven different complainants and offending that occurred over a period of approximately twenty years. The offender repeatedly took advantage of the complainants who were members of his extended family.  The offending for which the offender now appears for sentence demonstrates a very significant breach of trust.  

72          Given what can accurately be described as the enormity of the truly abhorrent  offending, it is neither exaggeration nor hyperbole to observe that the offender over many years put his own depraved sexual gratification before the welfare of his young victims.  All too often the offender was supposed to be caring for or looking after those young children who he violated.

Criminal History

73          The criminal history appears at tab 5 of the Crown tender bundle, exhibit A.  The offender was born in 1965 and accordingly is now almost 51 years of age.  He has no matters recorded against him, however, given the nature of the offending the lack of record carries less weight than it would in other matters. As much was accepted by counsel for the offender in the course of the sentence hearing.

74          The offender has been in custody referable to these matters since 16 June 2014 and it is accepted that any sentence date from that date.

General Deterrence

75          The need for general deterrence when sentencing for child sexual assault offences is undoubted and goes back to at least the Crown appeal in the matter of R v Muldoon unrep. NSWCCA 13.12.1990.  See also decisions such as R v Burchell (1987) 34 A Crim R 14, R v BJW (2000) 112 A Crim R 1, R v CMB [2014] NSWCCA 5 at [46]-[48] and more recently R v Van Ryn [2016] NSWCCA 1 at [187]. The successful appeal to the High Court in R v CMB does not impact on what the Court of Criminal Appeal said on the issue of general deterrence.

76          The Crown Prosecutor reduced most of his submissions to writing – see MFI 2 on sentence.  In those submissions the Crown Prosecutor deals extensively with the issue of need for general deterrence.

77          Apart from the very important aspect of general deterrence there is also the need to give proper regard to s 3A(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, namely to take into account when passing sentence the need to protect the community.  I emphasise that this comment is directed solely towards sub-paragraph (c) of s 3A of the Act and I am certainly not suggesting that the principles enunciated by the High Court in Veen v The Queen (No 2) 164 CLR 465 are enlivened.

Victim Impact Statements

78          Exhibit B on sentence is a victim impact statement from LF. Exhibit C on sentence is a victim impact statement by JH.  Exhibit D on sentence is a victim impact statement by TB and exhibit E on sentence is a victim impact statement by MH.  LF read her victim impact statement to the Court.  Those statements speak eloquently of the long term harm that is done to victims of child sexual assault.  The victims speak openly of the anger, anxiety and emotional harm that the offender’s conduct has caused them. The effect of the offender’s conduct is taken into account by giving appropriate regard to s 3A(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which provides that one of the purposes of sentencing is to recognise the harm done to the victim and the community.

79          However, without deprecating the undoubted serious effects the offender’s conduct has had on his victims, given the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Tuala [2015] NSWCCA 8, especially at [51]-[76], I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the victims have suffered substantial emotional harm such that it is taken into account as a matter of separate aggravation pursuant to s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act..

Case for the offender

80          The offender gave evidence at the sentence hearing, although his evidence was relatively short.  He said that he had read the agreed facts and the Form 1 documents and he accepted that he would be sentenced on those facts.  He maintained he was truthful with the two psychologists who have provided reports. Ms Caroline Hare of Lennings Seidler Collins Psychologists has provided a report dated 5 April 2016, which is exhibit 1 on sentence. Mr Patrick Sheehan of “Big Picture” Psychology has provided a report of 26 May 2016 which is exhibit 2 on sentence.

81          The offender gave evidence that he had thought about his conduct since he had been arrested and he had thought of the conduct before his arrest.  He heard some of the victim impact statements being read to the court.  When asked what he wanted to say about his conduct he said that he was sorry, that he wished it had never happened, all he can say is that he sorry, he accepted that he has caused a lot of pain and he was sorry for what he had done.

82          Counsel then took the offender to paragraph 24 of Mr Sheehan’s report and in particular the offender slamming his penis in a door in an attempt to stop him from offending.  The offender said in evidence that he did that so that he would not do it again.  The offender also said (my memory is that it was under cross-examination) that he has been able to stop offending by using pain.

83          Further under cross-examination the Crown Prosecutor asked a number of questions in particular on the conduct relating to the male victim MH.  The offender acknowledged that he had molested seven children.

84          Given the evidence of the offender and the pleas of guilty, taken with the contents of the two psychological reports, I am prepared to find on balance that the offender is remorseful.  In particular, I note that Mr Sheehan (in exhibit 2) at paragraph 24 sets out that the offender showed some empathy for the victims, which was unusual at the pre-sentence stage of proceedings in matters such as this. Mr Sheehan also observed that the offender became tearful when describing the offences against his niece.  

85          There is a considerable body of material that is repeated in the psychological reports.  The offender’s father was of Anglo-Saxon heritage whereas his mother is of aboriginal descent.  His father was a strict disciplinarian who enforced discipline by significant corporal punishment in the home.  His father was violent towards his mother.  His father worked on the railways and was required to be absent from Dubbo for several weeks at a time.  The offender had a physical confrontation with his father when the offender was in his late twenties.  It seems that the relationship between the offender and his father improved after this confrontation.  His parents separated when he was in his mid-thirties.  The offender maintains telephone contact with his father.

86          The offender suffered significant physical health issues throughout most of his life.  These were primarily asthma and rheumatic fever.  His recurrent illnesses forced him to be absent from school for extended periods.  He completed Year 10 and commenced Year 11 but was advised not to continue with Year 11.  He was bullied and isolated at high school and became somewhat of a loner.  He has had very few friends throughout his life.

87          The authors of both exhibits 1 and 2 refer to the offender himself being the victim of sexual abuse in his childhood.  Ms Hare (at paragraph 11) sets out that an identified person, who it seems is probably an uncle, fondled him and fellated him.  Ms Hare said this occurred when the offender was five years of age.  Mr Sheehan (paragraph 7 exhibit 2) gives an account of similar conduct but maintains that it occurred when the offender was seven years of age.  Apart from this conduct there was also another male who would speak of ejaculation and matters sexual with the offender when he was a child, including exposing the offender to pornography, but this did not progress or develop into any sexual conduct.   Mr Sheehan observes that that the offender could see no connection between these experiences and his own sexually abusive behaviour.

88          Both reports (exhibits 1 and 2) set out that the offender has worked in retail, printing and the security industry.  He accepts that given the conviction for these matters he can never work in the security industry again.  

89          The offender reached puberty at about thirteen years of age but was sexually aware well before that because of the inappropriate experiences with adult men.  The offender identified as heterosexual but has never had a long-term intimate partner.  His intimate encounters seem to have been limited and fleeting.  

90          Mr Sheehan (at paragraph 16 of exhibit 2) sets out that the offender acknowledged repeated sexual behaviour towards young children but denied a dominant sexual interest towards children, feeling more naturally sexually attracted to an adult somatotype.  He goes on to observe that the offender was unable to reconcile his account of his sexual interests with his offending behaviour other than to offer that he had experienced longitudinal sexual frustration and that it was somehow easier for him to have approached children for a sexual outlet than adults.

91          Ms Hare and Mr Sheehan both diagnose a Persistent Depressive Disorder (see for example paragraph 20 of exhibit 2).  Mr Sheehan (paragraph 20 of exhibit 2) also diagnoses Paedophilic Disorder (non-exclusive, interest in males and females).  He goes on to note that to a large extent the offender’s pathway towards sexual offending against children would appear to be an artefact of a self-imposed blockage of sexual expression towards peer aged partners, not due to a disinterest in peer aged sexual partners.

92          There is nothing within either of the reports to suggest that there is a causal connection between any mental condition or psychiatric condition or low intellectual functioning with the offending.  I note that Ms Hare declined (see paragraph 29 of exhibit 1) to give an overall IQ score because of the somewhat rare difference between the verbal comprehension and non-verbal comprehension scores.  However, she was definite that there is no evidence to suggest that the offender has an intellectual disability.  

93          The authors of both exhibits 1 and 2 go into some detail on the issue of the likelihood of the offender re-offending.  At paragraph 34 of exhibit 1 Ms Hare opines that given the offender’s score of three on the STATIC-99 test he is in the moderate-low risk category.  However at paragraph 40 she opines that using the Risk for Sexual Violence Protocol (RSVP) the offender’s level of dynamic risk is moderate and that he requires offence-focussed treatment to effectively manage his risk of sexual re-offending in the future. At paragraph 44 she says that on review of the current static and dynamic risk and protective factors the offender presents an overall combined risk of sexual re-offending that is moderate-low.

94          Mr Sheehan, it would appear, used the same diagnostic tools.  At paragraph 36 of his report he concludes that, “…the overall totality of information would suggest that his risk of re-offending would be somewhere in the Moderate category.  Mr Sheehan goes on to observe that:

“He [the offender] has significant psychosocial dysfunction, but no characteristics of antisocial orientation.  He also acknowledges his behaviour, is remorseful and wants to overcome his behaviour.  At the age of 50 years, he is moving into a period of life where offending becomes increasingly less likely”

95          The last matter to which Mr Sheehan alludes is significant on the issue of whether the offender is likely to re-offend. The sentence that will be imposed at the conclusion of these remarks will be particularly significant. Given the opinions of the authors of exhibits 1 and 2 and what will be the age of the offender at his release, I am prepared to find on the balance of probabilities that the offender is unlikely to re-offend.

96          On the issue of rehabilitation, it will depend to a very large extent whether the offender actively participates in treatment programmes that are available to him in custody.  Mr Sheehan (paragraph 39) sets out that the offender expressed a desire to participate in a sex offender treatment programme. Ms Hare recommends (paragraph 47) that the offender receive treatment to manage his risk successfully.  Ms Hare also recommends various courses and activities upon release.  Given what is to be the length of the sentence that is premature.  

97          Mr Nash of counsel submitted that, unusually, the offending conduct stopped before the offender was apprehended in respect of these matters.  The early signs of the offender wishing to participate in an appropriate sex offender programme are certainly promising.  However, it is the fact that the conduct ceased in 2009 well before the offender’s arrest that entitles the offender to a finding on balance that there are good prospects of rehabilitation.  There is one reservation to this finding.  Long term rehabilitation will depend very much on the sincerity of the offender’s stated intention and his participation in any programme.

Submissions made by each counsel

98          Mr Nash submitted that the biggest task will be making an appropriate assessment of totality.  In respect of the matters that carry a standard non-parole period, I went through and made preliminary indications to counsel in the sentence hearing.  I made notes on a table at the time and so far as I am aware the findings made as to the objective seriousness of each of the matters is consistent with the indication given in the sentence hearing.

99          Mr Nash submitted on the issue of contrition and remorse.  The submissions continued that the offender indicated from the very beginning that he intended to plead guilty.  A quick review of the papers at committal would indicate that this submission is well founded.  I have already made a finding that the offender is entitled to a finding on balance that he is remorseful.

100       Submissions were then made relating to statistics.  Mr Nash reminded me that I will need to give proper regard to the sentencing patterns that were applicable at the time, given that some of the offending occurred in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s. Although I have no recollection or note of the decision being referred to by either counsel in oral submissions, the table annexed to the decision of PWB v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 84 will be of considerable assistance.  On the issue of statistics, the limitation on the use of the statistics was again made clear by Bathurst CJ (Schmidt and Wilson JJ agreeing) in SS v The Queen [2016] NSWCCA 197.  Also see for e.g. Brown v The Queen [2014] NSWCCA 215 at [80]-[81] per Garling J.

101        Mr Nash also submitted that since the time of the offending there has been an upward movement in the sentences imposed for this type of offending.  That is undoubtedly the case and I note that the maximum penalties have also increased.  I have set out the relevant maximum penalty at the time when dealing with each of the offences.

102       Mr Nash went on to concede in his submissions that the offending in many instances involves a breach of a position of trust in that the child victims had been left for him to care for.  As I have already observed in the course of these remarks, this offending is demonstrative of a very significant and persistent breach of trust.

103       It was then submitted that there a number of matters in mitigation.  Initially, there is the plea of guilty; the offender is entitled to the full 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty.  At the sentence hearing I indicated that it was my intention to invoke s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and impose an aggregate sentence.  Part of what must occur is that I have to indicate the indicative sentences in respect of each matter.  I will indicate the starting point, ie the sentence before the 25% discount for the plea of guilty is applied in each matter.

104       The offender has no criminal record, however, given the nature of the offending that matter assumes less significance than it might otherwise;  Counsel for the offender conceded as much.  Mention was made in submissions of s 21A(5A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  According to a note I made at the time, Mr Nash submitted that that provision does not preclude some consideration being given to the offender for his lack of record.  In the matter presently under consideration I could not find that the offender’s character assisted him in the commission of the offences.  This is particularly so given the familial connection with the offender and the victims.  I also note in this regard the decision of AH v The Queen [2015] NSWCCA 51 at [20]-[25] per Hidden J. Although of less weight, some consideration must be given to the offender for his lack of record.

105       Mr Nash went on to submit that there were two further matters that argue for some leniency to be extended to the offender.  The first of these were that unusually the offending stopped before the offender was apprehended.  In this regard I was reminded of the offender’s evidence that he used pain to assist him stop offending.  I am of the opinion that there some substance to this submission.

106       The other matter that entitled the offender to some leniency was the issue of remorse.  In this regard Mr Nash reminded me of the evidence of the offender and he further submitted that what the offender said in his oral evidence was supported by the reports of Ms Hare and Mr Sheehan.  In that regard I was reminded in particular of paragraphs 23 and 24 at page 11 of Mr Sheehan’s report.  I have already found on balance that the offender is remorseful.

107       I have also made findings favourable to the offender on the issue of prospects of rehabilitation and that he is unlikely to re-offend.  

108       Mr Nash submitted to the effect that the matters on the various Form 1 documents would not significantly impact on the ultimate sentence to be imposed.  The argument continued that this was essentially because the matters on the Forms 1 were generally another offence committed within the one episode.  The issues of partial accumulation and totality are all part of the applicable sentencing patterns of the time at which the offending occurred.  Given the nature of the offending and the sheer number of offences on the Forms 1, the matters on the Forms 1 must have some meaningful impact on the sentence that is to be imposed. Likewise I will need to give proper regard to the issues of the need for partial accumulation given the number of victims, the number of offences and the period over which the offending occurred and of course, the issue of totality.

109       Mr Nash submitted that given the totality of the offending an appropriate sentence would be one within the vicinity of a non-parole period of 15 years with the total sentence of 20 years, or perhaps a little less.  Mr Nash did not argue for a finding of special circumstances.  Given what will be the sentence, the statutory ratio will still provide ample time for the authorities to supervise the offender on his release. The parties had paid me the courtesy of making the material available before the sentence hearing and accordingly, I was able to make some preliminary assessment of the matter.  I indicated towards the end of the sentence hearing that the non-parole period would be no less than 15 years. This was in response to the submission by Mr Nash and was not intended as an indication to the offender that I would impose a non-parole period of 15 years.

110       Clearly, proper and careful attention will need to be given to the issues of partial accumulation and totality.  There are seven different victims and the offending occurred over a period approaching twenty years.  These factors alone indicate that there must be some meaningful accumulation.

111       The Crown Prosecutor helpfully reduced most of his submissions to writing, those submissions being marked MFI 1 on sentence.  They were supplemented by brief oral submissions.  The Crown Prosecutor reminds me of the need for general deterrence.  I have already dealt with that issue and referred to a number of authorities.

112       Further, the Crown Prosecutor’s written submissions deal with the issue of sentencing for offending that occurred many years earlier.  At pp 2 and 3 of his submissions a number of authorities are referred to, including PWB v The Queen to which I have already referred.  The decision of R v MJR (2002) 130 A Crim R 481 at [107] was also referred to.  Sully J (with the other members of the Court agreeing) said:

“The nature of the criminal conduct proscribed by an offence and the maximum penalty applicable to the offence are crucially important factors in the synthesis which leads to the determination of the sentence to be imposed upon the particular offender for the particular crime committed.  Even after taking into account the subjective features of the offender and all the other matters relevant to sentencing such as individual and general deterrence, the sentence imposed should reflect the objective seriousness of the offence…and be proportional to the criminality involved in the offence committed…Whether the sentence to be imposed meets these criteria will be determined principally by a consideration of the nature of the criminal conduct as viewed against the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence.

When sentencing an offender for offences committed many years earlier and where no sentencing range current at the time of offending can be established, the court will by approaching the sentencing task in this way effectively sentence the offender in accordance with the policy of the legislature current at the time of offending and consistently with the approach adopted by sentencing courts at the that time”.

113       The Crown Prosecutor also very helpfully set out a table of comparable cases at the conclusion of his written submissions.  In his oral submissions the Crown reminded me of the lengthy period over which the offending occurred and the tender ages of the child victims.  He also reminded me that the offences included several forms of penetrative sexual conduct.  Further, the Crown submitted that the offending conduct would have had adverse effects on the victims.  It is accepted that the type of conduct for which offender appears for sentence has long term effects on the victims.

General Remarks

114       In passing sentence the court must give proper regard and effect to sections 3A and 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  Section 3A sets out the purposes of punishment, namely:

(a)          to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

(b)          to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,

(c)          to protect the community from the offender,

(d)          to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,

(e)          to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,

(f)           to denounce the conduct of the offender, and

(g)          to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.

I have already referred to a number of these issues in the course of these remarks.

115             Section 5(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that a court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.  I have already made it plain that there must be a very substantial sentence of full time imprisonment in this matter.

116            As previously indicated I invoke section 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and propose to impose an aggregate sentence.  These remarks have been reduced to writing and a copy will be provided to the parties immediately following the pronouncement of sentence.  As I am imposing an aggregate sentence it is necessary for me to give indicative sentences.

Indicative sentences            

117            I will adopt the very helpful table provided by the Crown which is part of the Crown tender bundle, exhibit A on sentence, and include the indicative sentence in the last column.

Formal Orders

1             In respect of each of the matters to which the offender has pleaded guilty he is convicted.

2             Taking into account the various Form 1 matters, I impose an aggregate sentence of a non-parole period of sixteen years and six months to commence on 16 June 2014 and which will expire on 15 December 2030. There will be a balance of term of five years and six months from 16 December 2030 to 16 June 2036.  The total sentence is therefore one of twenty two years. For reasons given earlier in these remarks I decline to make a finding of special circumstances.

3             The offender will be eligible for release to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period and I recommend that release.

		13 September 2016",2016-09-12 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2701016,R v MD [2016] NSWSC 1286,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The accused was arraigned before me this morning and entered a plea of not guilty to a charge that she murdered her 6 week old daughter (""FD"") at Wallsend on 24 July 2015.
	
	
	The law provides that nothing may be published or broadcast in a way that would identify the child: s 15A of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW). To that end there can be no reference to the names of members of her family including the accused.
	
	
	The accused applied for an order that she be tried without a jury and the Crown consented. Accordingly I made a trial by judge alone order pursuant to s 132 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).
	


Crown case


	
	Evidence in the Crown case establishes the following matters; none of which are disputed.
	
	
	The accused was born in a small village in Senegal in 1989. She married her husband (""OD"") in Senegal in April 2007. OD travelled to Australia alone in late 2007. Their daughter (""AD"") was born the following March. She has significant congenital neurological abnormalities and she is deaf and cannot speak. The accused and AD were not reunited with OD until they moved to Australia on 3 April 2014.
	
	
	In 2015, the accused lived with her family in Wallsend. OD's brother (""MS"") and sister (""KD"") also lived with them.
	
	
	The deceased was born at John Hunter Hospital on 9 June 2015. The pregnancy was planned. Both the pregnancy and the delivery were uneventful. The baby was not afflicted with the same genetic condition as her sister and she was brought home after two days.
	
	
	The family home at Wallsend had three bedrooms. MS and KD each had their own room and the accused, OD and their two daughters slept in the third bedroom. OD and AD slept in the bed while the accused and the baby slept on a foam mattress on the floor.
	


Observations of the accused after the birth


	
	OD reported that following the birth of the baby his wife was happy and had no problems. The first time he noticed any changes was two days before the child died.
	
	
	MS observed that the accused was “not one hundred per cent herself” when she came home from hospital. He noticed that she wore many layers of clothes and complained of being cold. He asked her about it and she replied, “When you give birth you need to stay away from the wind. The wind is not good for you.” He also said that before the birth the accused was always talking and laughing but not afterwards. However she was breastfeeding the baby and was described as a “normal mother”.
	
	
	KD, who had known the accused since they were children and had considered her to be a close friend, did not notice anything amiss. The accused never said anything to her about her mental state.
	


Tuesday 21 July 2015


	
	On Tuesday 21 July 2015 MS took a sick day and stayed home from work. At around midday he saw the accused sitting on the lounge with the baby in her arms. They had the following conversation in the Pulaar language:
	


“Accused:    I am not okay.

MS:       Why?

Accused:    I am just not okay.

MS:    It happens sometimes because you sometime people come here and get very bored and they even feel like they want to go back home.

Accused:   I’m not feeling that way like I want to go home. But I am not okay.

MS:   Did you tell it to [OD]?

Accused:   Yes.

MS:   Sometimes it is good to get out and do something. It’s good to get out of the house.

Accused:   I don’t know.”

Wednesday 22 July 2015


	
	At some point the following day the accused told her husband that she did not feel happy and that she felt unwell. She said that she felt unhappy in her heart and that she was feeling very low. OD became worried and suggested that they visit their doctor to see what the problem was. The accused said that she did not feel like going anywhere so OD offered to go to the doctor for her.
	
	
	That evening there was a conversation about an upcoming baby naming ceremony. According to MS, the accused seemed to be alright and spoke about getting her hair done for the occasion.
	


Thursday 23 July 2015


	
	On Thursday 23 July at about midday the accused was in the living room with the baby. According to MS, she seemed cold and not herself.
	
	
	OD attended Dr Rita Singh’s general practice at Mayfield that afternoon. He told Dr Singh that the accused did not want to do anything inside the house and, in response to questioning, he said that he thought his wife might be depressed. Dr Singh made an appointment for the accused to see a mental health nurse at 4.00pm on Monday 27 July and wrote a prescription for the anti-depressant medication, Lexapro (one 10mg tablet per day). Dr Singh told OD to take the accused to the hospital if he was worried.
	
	
	OD filled the prescription at a chemist on his way home. When he arrived home he gave the accused instructions about taking the medication and she took a tablet at around 4.00pm. After a while the accused seemed to OD to be very happy. The couple then spoke on the telephone with some friends in Sydney. They were organising the baby naming ceremony. The accused continued to appear happy throughout the evening.
	
	
	At some point the accused phoned her friend, Maimouna Camara, and told her about the party for the baby which would be held on 1 August 2015. Ms Camara described the accused as sounding “very happy” about the upcoming celebration and sounded normal.
	


Friday 24 July 2015


	
	OD woke on Friday 24 July 2015 at 2.00am. His shift at the factory where he worked started at 3.00am. The baby was crying and he picked her up. The accused told him that she had pain in her body and she was not feeling well. OD phoned his supervisor and said that he was not coming into work because he had to look after his wife.
	
	
	The accused breastfed the baby. OD then looked after the child until the accused fell asleep. OD laid the baby alongside the accused on the mattress. He returned to bed but did not sleep as he was worried about his wife.
	
	
	OD got up at 7.00am in order to take his eldest daughter to an 8.00am medical appointment at the Royal Newcastle Centre next to the John Hunter Hospital at New Lambton. The accused was awake and the baby was asleep next to her. OD asked the accused how she was and she replied that she was okay.
	
	
	The accused fell asleep. At this time she was naked and the baby was wearing baby clothes. They were both on the mattress covered by blankets.
	
	
	OD left with AD to attend the appointment. They arrived home shortly before 9.00am. They entered the bedroom where the accused and the baby were together. OD saw a wooden-handled knife near the baby’s head. He recognised it as one that was usually kept in the kitchen. He approached the mattress and saw that there was blood coming from a cut on the baby’s neck and blood on the mattress. He picked up the knife because he did not want the accused to hurt herself. She was still lying on the mattress and the baby was lying next to her.
	
	
	OD ran from the bedroom carrying the knife. AD left with him. He ran into KD’s bedroom and woke her. He was holding the knife and screamed out that the accused had killed the baby. He threw the knife into the bathroom.
	
	
	KD went to the doorway of the accused’s bedroom and saw her and the baby on the mattress. She said to the accused, “Why did you do this?” The accused replied, “I am depressed”. The accused remained under the blankets and did not move.
	
	
	KD went into MS' bedroom where she woke him up and told him what had occurred. OD and KD went into the lounge room with AD. OD was screaming and crying. MS rang triple 0.
	
	
	Police attended very quickly and they were directed to the accused’s bedroom. Before entering they saw the knife on the bathroom floor. In the bedroom the accused was still lying on the mattress on the floor. The baby was also lying on the mattress and police saw she was clothed and half wrapped. There was blood around her neck and head. There were no signs of life. An ambulance was called.
	
	
	Police lifted up the sheet and the accused just lay there. She was dressed in black and white pants, a long sleeved shirt and a pair of socks. She had blood stains on the back of her left arm.
	
	
	Senior Constable Burton said, “Get up, you’re under arrest for murdering your baby.” The accused did not respond. The direction was repeated and again the accused continued to lay there with no response.
	
	
	More police arrived. The accused was handcuffed and lifted from the mattress. She remained unresponsive. She was taken outside and placed in a police vehicle.
	
	
	When ambulance officers arrived they found the baby lying on the mattress on her back. There was a small pool of blood around her neck and on the mattress. She was not breathing and there was no pulse. She was still very warm to the touch. It was found that her head was almost decapitated. There was no other blood around the room. The paramedic advised police that the baby was dead and there was nothing that could be done.
	
	
	The accused was taken to Waratah Police Station. Arrangements were made for an interpreter and a support person to attend.
	
	
	Ms Camara attended and was present as police explained to the accused that they intended to seize her clothing. The accused had a blanket over her face and her head was down on the table. The accused told Ms Camara that she was tired. They then went into another room with police so that the accused’s clothing could be taken. The following conversation occurred in the Pulaar language:
	


“Camara:   Hello.

Accused:   Mmm. Did they bury the baby?

Camara:   What baby?

(The accused did not respond)

Camara:   Do you even know how you got here?

Accused:   No.

Camara:   Are you okay?

Accused:   I am tired. I want to sleep. I haven’t slept since having the baby. I am not happy.”


	
	A Pulaar interpreter arrived and the accused was brought into an interview room. When asked to state her name and spell her family name she replied, “No I can’t”. Police said that they were investigating the murder of the baby and asked if she understood. She replied, “I don’t know that”. She confirmed that she had received legal advice and did not want to be interviewed. Police asked her whether she murdered her child and she replied, “No I didn’t”. Police asked if she could tell them anything that could assist their investigations into the murder of her daughter and she replied, “I don’t know nothing about it”. Police asked who murdered the child and she replied, “I don’t know”. They then asked whether she was willing to say where she was or what happened that morning and she said, “no”.
	
	
	Crime scene officers attended the home and conducted a forensic examination. They found the wooden handled knife on the bathroom floor. It was about 25cm long with the blade being about 15cm long and there were blood stains on both the handle and the blade. Another knife was found underneath the foam mattress. It was 24cm long but there were no blood stains on it.
	
	
	Subsequent DNA testing revealed that blood staining on the handle and blade of the knife located in the bathroom matched the DNA profile of the deceased. Swabs taken from blood staining on the leg of the pants and the sleeve of the top worn by the accused matched the DNA profile of the deceased. The deceased’s DNA was not located on the second knife which was found underneath the foam mattress or on any of the clothing worn by OD, MS or KD.
	
	
	An autopsy examination was conducted on 27 July 2015. The forensic pathologist concluded:
	


“This infant died from the effects of partial decapitation due to an incised wound to the front of the neck. There was complete transection of the trachea, spinal column and spinal cord, major vessels and all muscles of the neck. There were microscopic evidence of blood aspiration in the lungs and fresh bleeding around the deep wound edges, in keeping with the infant being alive at the time the wounds were inflicted.

The mechanism of death due to transection of the major neck vessels is difficult to determine and may be exsanguination (blood loss) or air/gas embolism as air is ‘sucked’ into the transected major veins, circulates in the vessels and accumulates in the heart or brain causing acute heart failure or a massive stroke. In either scenario, death would have been rapid and inevitable once the vital vessels of the neck were transected.”

Defence case


	
	The accused does not dispute that her deliberate act caused the death of the deceased. She contends that at the time she did so she was mentally ill so as not to be responsible for her actions according to law. She invites me to return a special verdict pursuant to s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) that she is not guilty by reason of mental illness.
	
	
	In these circumstances it is necessary for her to establish on the balance of probabilities (Mizzi v The Queen (1960) 105 CLR 659; [1960] HCA 77) that at the time of killing her child she was labouring under such a defect of reason, from a disease of the mind, as not to know the quality and nature of her act, or, if she did, that she did not know what she was doing was wrong: R v M’Naghten (1843) 8 ER 718. See also R v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182; [1933] HCA 1.
	
	
	The various authorities in this area of the law, which I will not pause to further cite, establish that a “disease of the mind” may be literally a state of disease or it may be a disorder or disturbance arising from some condition which could be temporary or could be of long standing and it does not matter whether it is curable or incurable. It may arise from some mental malfunction with no apparent organic basis or from a cause which is unknown. What is important is that it results in the function of the reason, memory or understanding of a person being thrown into a state of derangement or disorder. A defect of reason, memory or understanding involves a disorder of the capacity to reason such as one that prevented the accused from knowing what she was doing in that she did not know the physical nature or quality of the act or she did not know that it was wrong according to the ordinary standards of reasonable people in our community.
	
	
	Where it is claimed that an accused did not know the act to be wrong the issue is whether because of a disease, disorder or disturbance of the mind the accused could not think rationally of the reasons which, to ordinary people, would make the act right or wrong. If the accused could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it would be open to find that the person did not know that what they were doing was wrong.
	
	
	The consequence of finding a person not guilty on the ground of mental illness is that the presiding judge must then consider whether the accused’s safety or the safety of any other member of the community would be seriously put at risk by the person’s release. If it would not, the judge may order the release of the accused into the community either unconditionally or upon conditions that are thought to be necessary for the welfare of the accused and that of the community. On the other hand if it is not appropriate to release the accused immediately an order can be made that the accused be detained in custody until released by due process of law. That would mean not only that the accused remains in custody until a decision is made to release her but also that she would become a forensic patient and fall under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. If there was a jury determining this matter I would ordinarily explain the composition of the Mental Health Review Tribunal and its various functions. However I am well aware of those matters and I do not think it is necessary to recite them.
	


Dr Richard Furst


	
	Dr Richard Furst is a consultant forensic psychiatrist who has a considerable degree of experience in this field. He saw the accused at Silverwater Women’s Correctional Centre on 16 March 2016 with the assistance of a Pulaar interpreter. He also reviewed relevant documents before preparing his report dated 1 April 2016.
	
	
	Dr Furst took a detailed history from the accused. In short it is of some significance that prior to the birth of the deceased she did not experience any symptoms of mental illness. She told Dr Furst that she did not suffer any problems during her pregnancy and described feeling happy. She had a normal delivery. There was an onset of depression in the weeks following the birth. The accused described feeling depressed, having difficulty thinking straight, not sleeping adequately and feeling anxious. Her mood continued to deteriorate to the point that she felt despondent, hopeless and suicidal. She felt more anxious and threatened. She told Dr Furst that she also began to hear voices stating, “I was hearing people calling me. Weird voices.” 
	
	
	The accused said she came to believe that her baby was “something else”, like it was “not my baby, something else I was holding and had to deal with. It was quite scary. More like a devil thing I was holding.” She said she became convinced that it was not her baby and was a “devil thing”. Dr Furst noted that this was highly suggestive of Capgras’ delusion. He said her “voices” were also telling her it was not her baby.
	
	
	The accused said she became highly anxious, worrying that something bad would happen to herself and her baby. She described this as a “bad feeling”, which was reinforced by the voices she was hearing. She was unable to sleep. She was thinking a lot about death and believed she was not existing. Dr Furst noted these were apparent nihilistic delusions. The accused also said that she felt hopeless and useless.
	
	
	Dr Furst noted that the medical records from Justice Health were consistent with the accused being in a state of severe depression and psychosis after her arrest. This included her being unresponsive at times, confused, hopeless, suicidal, hearing voices, struggling to think clearly, and tearfulness. She said the voices had been telling her to hurt her baby prior to the offence.
	
	
	Dr Assad Saboor assessed her on 27 July 2015, three days after the offence, and found her to be apparently humming continually to herself but otherwise was unresponsive.
	
	
	When assessed with the assistance of an interpreter on 28 July 2015 she said that her life was “meaningless”; she said she could “feel nothing”; and said she was hearing voices that were trying to “switch her off”. Dr Furst again said that this was suggestive of nihilistic delusions and auditory hallucinations which were fairly typical of a severe melancholic and psychotic depression.
	
	
	Dr Furst also noted an assessment made by a psychiatrist on 8 September 2015. At that time she remained withdrawn, had signs of psychomotor retardation, and was thought to be pervasively depressed. The psychiatrist on that occasion diagnosed a severe depressive episode with psychotic symptoms which had its onset in the immediate post-partum weeks, making it more likely than not her severe depression and psychotic symptoms were present at the time of the alleged offence.
	
	
	Dr Furst said that the accused met the criteria for a diagnosis of “Major Depressive Disorder (melancholic and psychotic features) – post-partum onset”. He said that the accused had a history of severe depression of post-partum onset associated with melancholic features and mood-congruent psychotic features. She continued to manifest features of a severe depressive disorder.
	
	
	Dr Furst said that at the time of his assessment the accused remained depressed in mood, anxious and despondent. Her sleep remained poor. She was able to recall being “very sick” after her arrest, including not talking. She had been managed in the Mental Health Screening Unit (MHSU) throughout her incarceration, with unsuccessful attempts to manage her in the “step-down” unit, where she had apparently been prone to threats by other inmates as a result of her alleged offence. She was agreeable to further psychiatric treatment.
	
	
	Dr Furst assessed the accused as being fit to be tried on the standards referred to in R v Presser [1958] VR 45 and Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230; [1994] HCA 41. However on the question of a mental illness defence he said:
	


“In my opinion, [MD] was suffering from a disease of the mind in the form of a severe major depressive disorder with melancholic and psychotic features of postpartum onset. The combination of nihilistic delusions, Capgras’ delusions [belief that her baby had been replaced, was some type of ‘devil’ and was not her baby] and associated auditory hallucinations means that she was suffering from a defect of reason in the McNaughton’s sense as a product of her underlying severe depressive disorder.

In my opinion [MD] did not understand that her actions were wrong as she was driven by her severe depression and psychotic symptoms and was unable to reason about the wrongfulness of her actions with a moderate degree of sense and composure. She has the mental illness defence available to her.”


	
	Dr Furst concluded his report by indicating that the accused should remain under the care of mental health clinicians/psychiatrists working for Justice Health, probably involving further treatment at the MHSU. Transfer to the Bunya Unit at Cumberland Hospital may well offer the best psychiatric care in a multi-disciplinary setting in his view. An alternative placement would be to the Forensic Hospital at Malabar. He also indicated that she would benefit from ongoing treatment with a combination of antidepressant and antipsychotic medication. Psychological input would also be of benefit to her in addressing her grief issues and adjustment issues over the longer term.
	


Dr Jonathon Adams


	
	Dr Jonathon Adams was engaged by the Crown to assess the accused and provide a report. He saw the accused on 14 May 2016 and reviewed relevant documents. His report of 9 June 2016 was tendered.
	
	
	Dr Adams’ report is lengthy and useful. The history he obtained from the accused is consistent with that obtained by Dr Furst.
	
	
	Dr Adams was also of the view that there was no evidence to suggest that the accused suffered from any major mental illness prior to giving birth to the deceased. The deterioration in her mental health followed that birth.
	
	
	At the time of assessment, Dr Adams considered the accused to be manifesting ongoing symptoms of major depression. She endorsed continuing concerns about the deceased with the possibility of the baby being replaced and resembling a devil. In Dr Adams’ view this was indicative of a residual delusional belief.
	
	
	Dr Adams confirmed the opinion of Dr Furst that the accused was fit to be tried. However in relation to the defence of mental illness it was his view that at the relevant time the accused was suffering from a major depressive illness with psychotic symptoms. He referred to this also being known as post-partum psychosis.
	
	
	Dr Adams felt that, on balance, it was reasonable to conclude that the accused was suffering from symptoms of a major mental illness at the time of the alleged offence which, on his understanding, would fall into the legal category of a “disease of the mind”. (Whether it does is a question of law: R v Falconer (1990) 171 CLR 30 at 49; [1990] HCA 49).
	
	
	It was Dr Adams’ view that it was reasonable to conclude that the accused’s continuing symptoms of a severe mental illness would have impacted upon her capacity for rational thought, and could be considered a “defect of reason”.
	
	
	He considered it was also reasonable to suggest that the accused endured concerns regarding her newborn daughter around the time of the alleged offence that were based in mental illness, including that the child had been replaced, and she resembled the devil. He considered it plausible from a psychiatric perspective that these symptoms acted as motivating factors for the alleged offence.
	
	
	Dr Adams believed that the accused could be considered not to have had the capacity to reason about the alleged offending behaviour with a moderate degree of composure given the likelihood that she was experiencing ongoing symptoms of mental illness at the material time. He said that if it was accepted, and I interpolate that I do, that the accused was likely acting upon her delusional concerns that her newborn daughter had been replaced and resembled the devil it was reasonable to suggest that she did not have the capacity to reason about the moral quality of what she was doing.
	
	
	As a consequence of the foregoing matters Dr Adams believed that the defence of mental illness was available.
	
	
	Dr Adams concluded his report by indicating that the accused requires ongoing assertive input from mental health services. He considered she would benefit from continuing psychiatric medication, and psychological and social management strategies, together with placement in an area where she can receive the most appropriate care in the correctional setting.
	


Determination


	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was a deliberate act of the accused that caused the death of the deceased. Before considering the further essential element the Crown is required to establish to make good a charge of murder, that the accused intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, I am required to consider the mental illness defence: Hawkins v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 500 at 517; [1994] HCA 28; R v Minani (2005) 63 NSWLR 490; [2005] NSWCCA 226.
	
	
	I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind in the form of a major depressive illness with psychotic features. Whilst I am satisfied that she appreciated the nature and quality of her act, her reasoning as a result of this disease of the mind was certainly defective in the sense that her ability to think rationally was significantly impaired; for example, her belief that her baby had been replaced by the devil. I am also satisfied that she did not know that what she was doing was wrong in that she was deprived of the ability to reason with even a moderate degree of sense and composure.
	


Verdict


	
	I find the accused not guilty by reason of mental illness.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	


1.   The accused be detained pursuant to s 39(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW).

2.   The accused be detained at such place and in such manner as may be determined from time to time by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until she is released by due process of law.

3.   The Registrar is to notify the Minister for Health and the Mental Health Review Tribunal as soon as practicable of the terms of these orders and is to provide the Mental Health Review Tribunal with copies of the transcript of the proceedings, the exhibits and this judgment.

2701029,Application of Dragan Cvetkovic pursuant to Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (No 2) [2016] NSWSC 1301,"Judgment

Procedural background


	
	On 17 March 2016, I delivered a judgment with regard to an application by Mr Dragan Cvetkovic (the applicant) for referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal of his conviction and sentence for wound with intent to murder. The application was refused, except with regard to the issue of whether a “Muldrock error” affected the sentence at first instance, and whether that question had already been determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal: see Application of Dragan Cvetkovic pursuant to Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2016] NSWSC 260.
	
	
	With regard to that issue, I invited counsel for the Attorney-General (the respondent) to provide my Associate and the applicant with a complete copy of the transcript of the proceedings on sentence and the remarks on sentence: at [115] of my judgment. Once those documents were received, further submissions focused only upon the question of “Muldrock error” were to be provided within four weeks: at [115] of my judgment.
	
	
	On 31 March 2016, Legal Aid sent a letter to my Associate on behalf of the applicant requesting an extension of time so that private solicitors could be engaged in the matter. On 5 April 2016, the solicitor for the respondent sent correspondence explaining that there was no objection to such an extension being granted. On 8 April 2016, it was conveyed to the parties that I was not opposed to that course; no formal orders were made.
	
	
	On 22 April 2016 and again on 17 May 2016, my Chambers were advised electronically by the respondent that there was some difficulty in obtaining the materials to be provided; it was anticipated, however, that they would be provided on 20 May 2016.
	
	
	On 13 May 2016, Part 1 of the submissions of the applicant of 15 April 2016 (accompanied by a covering letter of 1 May 2016) was received. Those submissions were prepared by the applicant himself.
	
	
	On 18 May 2016, my Associate received correspondence to the effect that the applicant had instructed solicitors; however, further time was requested in order to file submissions.
	
	
	A further extension was granted, with all materials with regard to the matter to be provided on or before 14 June 2016.
	
	
	On 20 May 2016, the following documents were received electronically in my Chambers from the solicitor for the respondent: the transcript of proceedings after conviction of 22 July 2009; the transcript of proceedings after conviction of 7 August 2009; the remarks on sentence of 7 August 2009; a “Crown sentencing summary”; the Crown’s written submissions on sentence of 5 August 2009; the exhibits tendered at the sentencing hearing (they being the criminal history of the applicant and a victim impact statement); and a copy of the judgment in R v Macadam-Kellie [2001] NSWCCA 170.
	
	
	The respondent’s submissions were filed on 9 June 2016.
	
	
	Finally, submissions prepared by counsel for the applicant were filed on 14 June 2016.
	


A foreshadowed issue, subsequently abandoned


	
	As I have said, the only part of the application that I reserved for consideration was whether there was a “Muldrock error” at first instance. And that was the only topic upon which I invited further submissions. Without invitation from me, however, the applicant made submissions about other topics in his document of 15 April 2016. In particular, the applicant made the following submission (it appears verbatim and as formatted):
	


“1. The Not Addressed Issue: Verdict of Not Guilty Due to Mental Illness

[4] In para 65 of my application to the NSWSC, for the 1st time, I have asked a Court to consider my defence and a verdict of Not Guilty Due to Mental Illness, based on the following facts.

[5] Dr Westmore’s evidence: That was primary, firm, and unshaken opinion of Dr Westmore:

A: “The very fact that this incident occurred in a public car park, in front of so many witnesses, automatically suggests to me that this is not the ordinary crime, this is a most unusual event,…” (T:1856; 2-5)

Q: But if he had been unable to get her in a private place and if this is one of the few option he’s got for access to her then it is a fairly logical place to do it?

A: Not if he wanted to get away. Not if he really wanted to commit a crime and not to be detected, not at all, … (T:1856; 8-12).

[6] Dr Westmore held,

“… that’s further evidence of his distorted thought processes… there was probably a compulsive component to it as well and so at same [sic] stage he’s snapped in my view, probably the precipitant of the breakdown relationship, irrevocable. That on top of all his other sorrows and woes, the business, the finance and all those other things, and his depression has finally caused him to lose control to a degree, and that’s what I believe has happened,” (T:1856; 12-18)

[7] Dr Westmore, unreservedly, disagreed with the prosecutor’s proposition that I,

“was aware that [my] actions in stabbing [my] wife were morally wrong”, and

did not believe that I,

“was able to reason with a sufficient degree” and

“understand the rightness and wrongness of what [I] was doing at that time” (T:1887; 30-39).

[8] Dr Nielssen’s evidence: “Insane automatism” was secondary opinion of Dr Nielssen. I have quoted that evidence in para 20 of my application. Dr Nielssen, in his second report of 15 March 2009, wrote:

“However, any loss of voluntary control would have been at least partly due to the effect of an underlying depressive illness and would hence be considered an “insane automatism.” (Transcript:page-s;line-s, T:1539; 1-18).

[9] Please note that this Dr Nielssen’s opinion was not a result of cross-examination, but existed in his report, and was just confirmed in the cross-examination.

[10] Thus, both expert witnesses in psychiatry gave evidence from which a verdict of Not Guilty Due to Mental Illness should be available to me.

[11] Further support for that verdict is in facts of my behaviour before, during and after the incident. In particular, in the evidence of my twilight state of mind in the weeks before the incident:

[a] On one side, I was thinking of ending my life by overdose, drowning, jumping out of my hotel window and stabbing myself, and

[b] On the other side, I was doing all I could do to reorganise my life – not to end my and my wife’s lives, or to harm my wife and end in prison.

[12] I plead to your Honour and the Court to refer my case to the CCA for consideration of substituting my verdict of guilty by verdict of Not Guilty Due to Mental Illness, based on:

[a] Medical opinion and support for that verdict by both psychiatrists;

[b] The fact that, at the time of the offence, not only that I was suffering from major depressive illness, but that I caused to me life-threatening injuries too;

[c] Extensive exonerating facts of my behaviour before, during and after the incident;

[d] The fact that not considering verdict of Not Guilty Due to Mental Illness, on the face of the evidence, would result in substantial injustice to me.”


	
	I came to the view that those paragraphs appeared to be a submission by the applicant that the conviction should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal on the basis that a verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness should be substituted for the verdict of guilty entered in the District Court.
	
	
	I formed the view that the question of referral on this separate basis should be clarified and determined before any final decision was made by me about referral of the sentence, in order to avoid yet further delay and duplication attaching to this extended litigation arising from an incident that occurred in 2007.
	
	
	On 10 August 2016, my Associate therefore, at my request, sent an email to the parties and, among other things, asked that the lawyers for the applicant confirm whether the submission was maintained: apart from anything else, in light of the consequences of a verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness. If it was to be maintained, I invited detailed submissions from both parties, including detailed analysis of the trial transcript, with regard to it.
	
	
	On 19 August 2016, the solicitor for the applicant sent an email to my Chambers. He informed me that the applicant abandons any submissions with respect to his conviction being referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal on the basis that a verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness should be substituted for the guilty verdict.
	
	
	As a result of that correspondence, I put the submission to that effect from the applicant to one side, and proceed to resolve the question that I reserved six months ago.
	


Test to be applied


	
	I am to apply the same test as I detailed in [3]-[4] of my earlier judgment. It is as follows:
	


[3] With regard to the test that I am to apply to the material placed before me, in Application of Peter James Holland under s.78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251, Johnson J said at [6]:

The test is whether it appears that there is a doubt or question as to guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case: s.79(2). With respect to repealed s.475 Crimes Act 1900 (which used similar words), it was said that this view may be formed where the material causes the person considering the matter unease or a sense of disquiet in allowing the conviction or sentence to stand: Varley v Attorney General (NSW) at 48; Application of Rendell (1987) 32 A Crim R 243 at 245. This formula has been applied since the repeal of s.475 and its replacement by the provisions now contained in s.79(2): Application of Pedrana (2000) 117 A Crim R 45 at 463 [28]; Application of Suey [2001] NSWSC 543 at [18].

[4] I respectfully adopt that formulation. I have therefore approached my task on the basis that, having read all the material with which I have been provided, I should ask myself whether I feel a sense of unease or disquiet about the conviction entered, or the sentence imposed, or both.

The relevant portion of the remarks on sentence


	
	It will be recalled that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was a head sentence of imprisonment for 17 years and 4 months, with a non-parole period of 13 years, to commence on 6 June 2007.
	
	
	As I have said, I have now been provided with her Honour’s complete remarks on sentence.
	
	
	The relevant passages are as follows (at pp 12 and 15):
	


I assess this offence as in the high range of seriousness, at the higher end of the scale of offences of this kind. As the Court of Criminal Appeal observed of a similar, though less serious, stabbing in R v Macadam-Kellie [2001] NSWCCA 170 the offender’s culpability falls little short of the complete crime.

…

Having assessed the offence as in the high range of seriousness, and noting the standard non-parole period prescribed at 10 years for an offence in the mid range of seriousness after trial, and there being no reasons which have been advanced to me or are apparent from the circumstances of the offence or offender to depart from the standard non-parole period, the non-parole period I fix must be more than the standard non-parole period of 10 years.

The relevant portion of the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal


	
	The relevant passage of the judgment of McCallum J in Cvetkovic v R [2010] NSWCCA 66 (in which Price and Schmidt JJ agreed), is at [74], where the following was said:
	


[74] The six cases identified by the applicant in support of this ground must be considered with those principles in mind. Each was a case of wounding with intent to murder, carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. It may be noted, however, that five of the six were determined prior to the introduction of standard non-parole periods, which came into force on 22 November 2002: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002, schedule 1[4]. The standard non-parole period of 10 years for the offence of wounding with intent to murder now stands as a second legislative guidepost (in addition to the maximum penalty of 25 years) to which the court must have regard among the full range of factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence: Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [27].

Submissions of the applicant


	
	As I have said, the further submissions prepared by the applicant personally were received on 13 May 2016. The submissions prepared by his counsel were received on 14 June 2016. As one would expect, the latter focus more tightly upon the particular legal issue that was the solitary matter about which I invited further submissions. As well as that, in his own submissions the applicant has frankly said “…I do not understand the Muldrock’s case…”. In the circumstances, I have regarded the submissions of the applicant about that topic as having been superseded by those of his counsel, and have confined my attention to the latter.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant made the following submissions.
	
	
	First, he submitted that the use of the word “depart” and the phrase “must be more” in the second of the extracted passages from the remarks on sentence demonstrates that Sweeney DCJ gave determinative significance, or at the least primary significance, to the standard non-parole period. That approach is contrary to the approach founded upon instinctive synthesis discussed in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120; [2011] HCA 39.
	
	
	Secondly, counsel submitted that one can infer that her Honour adopted an impermissible two-stage approach, in that the non-parole period exceeded the standard non-parole period of 10 years because the objective seriousness of the offence was found to be above the middle of the range, and no subjective material was put before her Honour by the applicant that reduced that “starting point”.
	
	
	Thirdly, counsel for the applicant submitted that there was no submission about “Muldrock error” by the then self-represented applicant made before the Court of Criminal Appeal. And although the judgment cites Muldrock v The Queen, there is no consideration by that Court of this aspect of the approach adopted by her Honour.
	
	
	As such, in accordance with [15] of the judgment of R A Hulme J in Darush Majid pursuant to Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2016] NSWSC 561, he submitted that the absence of comment by the Court of Criminal Appeal could have the effect of implicitly endorsing the erroneous approach of the primary judge.
	
	
	In short, counsel for the applicant submitted that the test had been made out with regard to the question of whether a “Muldrock error” occurred at first instance that has not been corrected on appeal: I would experience a sense of disquiet that that had indeed occurred.
	


Submissions of the respondent


	
	In response, counsel for the respondent made the following concessions.
	
	
	First, he accepted that the remarks on sentence of Sweeney DCJ may show that her Honour adopted a two-stage analysis founded upon R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168; [2004] NSWCCA 131, in that her Honour used the standard non-parole period as a starting point before considering departure from it based upon aggravating or mitigating circumstances. In light of the decision in Muldrock v The Queen, the respondent conceded that her Honour was in error in doing so.
	
	
	The respondent further conceded that the 2013 decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal did not directly deal with the process adopted by her Honour in setting the head sentence and non-parole period.
	
	
	Consequently, counsel for the respondent accepted that there may be sufficient material to raise a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance in the applicant’s case which may warrant further review.
	
	
	In short, I regard the written submissions of counsel for the respondent as being a concession, after reflection, that he accepts: that there may have been “Muldrock error” at first instance; that it may be that the Court of Criminal Appeal did not deal with that error; and that it may well be appropriate for me to refer the matter to that Court for those reasons.
	


Determination


	
	It was the passage at p 15 of her Honour’s remarks on sentence that led me in my first judgment to invite further submissions from the parties, in combination with the fact that recourse to the 2013 judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal does not clearly demonstrate that that Court dealt with the current issue.
	
	
	In the circumstances, I consider that the concession made by counsel for the respondent after a period of reflection on his part is soundly based. In other words, I experience a sense of unease or disquiet about whether her Honour committed an uncorrected “Muldrock error” when sentencing the respondent.
	
	
	I have come to that view for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, the second passage that I have extracted from the remarks on sentence is inherently suggestive of that.
	
	
	Secondly, the fact that the remarks on sentence were delivered on 7 August 2009 (that is, after the decision R v Way had been handed down, but before the decision in Muldrock v The Queen had been handed down), and after a trial had been conducted, “circumstantially” supports the proposition that her Honour may have approached the question erroneously.
	
	
	Thirdly, a written concession delivered after a period of reflection by counsel, experienced in criminal matters, has been made that the relief sought should be granted.
	
	
	Fourthly, my own reading of the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, gives rise to, at the least, a state of uncertainty about whether that Court dealt with this question.
	
	
	Fifthly, as I remarked in my earlier judgment at [110], it would hardly have been surprising if the Court of Criminal Appeal did not deal with any question of “Muldrock error”. That is so for the simple reason that, despite pressing a large number of grounds of appeal against sentence, the applicant (who at that stage was appearing for himself) pressed no ground focussing upon this question.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, I consider that the test has been made out. Accordingly, pursuant to s 79 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), I propose to refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal as an appeal against sentence.
	
	
	To be clear: the only aspect of the matter with regard to which I experience a doubt or question is the question of “Muldrock error”. As I hope is obvious from the combined effect of this judgment and my earlier judgment, I do not possess that state of mind with regard to any aspect of the plethora of other submissions made by the applicant about his conviction and sentence.
	


Order


	
	I make the following order:
	



	
	Pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal And Review) Act 2001 (NSW), the whole case is referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal against sentence pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).

		23 September 2016",2016-09-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701041,Daher v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2016] NSWDC 203,"Judgment

The application before the court


	
	These are my reasons for refusing to strike out imputation (iv) in each of three claims for defamation alleged to arise from the following publications:
	



	
	A newspaper publication in the Daily Telegraph headed “Guns N’ Posers: Assad’s fans turn a NSW farm into animal killing ground”;
	
	
	A website publication on www.dailytelegraph.com.au headed “Guns n’ Posers. Pro-Assad game hunters pose with highpowered rifles and dead deer in rural NSW”; and
	
	
	A website publication on www.news.com.au headed “Guns n’ Posers. Pro-Assad game hunters pose with high-powered rifles and dead deer in rural NSW”.
	



	
	Although there are minor differences between the three publications, it is agreed between the parties that the contents of these publication are substantially the same. The imputations pleaded to arise from each of these publications are also the same. The matters complained of are attached to this judgment (Annexure A).
	
	
	The imputations set out in the statement of claim filed on 8 June 2016 alleged to arise in each of the publications are as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff is a staunch supporter of Syrian dictator President Bashar Al-Assad (the entire matter complained of but especially paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10);
	
	
	The plaintiff is a supporter of the terrorist activities of Hezbollah (the entire matter complained of but especially paragraphs 1, 3, 8, 16 and 17);
	
	
	The plaintiff condones the terrorist activities of Hezbollah (the entire matter complained of but especially paragraphs 1, 3, 8, 16 and 17);
	
	
	The plaintiff is a terrorist (the entire matter complained of but especially paragraphs 1, 3, 8, 16 and 17);
	
	
	The plaintiff condones the killing, by Syrian dictator President Bashar Al-Assad, of hundreds of his own civilians in chemical attacks in 2013 (the entire matter complained of but especially paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 19);
	
	
	The plaintiff supports the evil regime of Syrian dictator President Bashar Al-Assad (the entire matter complained of but especially paragraphs 1, 3, 8, 16 and 19).
	



	
	Objections were taken to the pleading of imputations (i), (ii), (iii) and (vi), as well as (iv), but only the challenge to imputation (iv) has proceeded to argument, the plaintiff conceding challenges to the other imputations in circumstances which are reflected in the costs order set out below.
	


Capacity issues in relation to imputation (iv)


	
	The relevant principles in relation to the threshold issue of capacity are set out in Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 227 at [135]-[136], namely that the determination of capacity at the threshold level is “an exercise in generosity not parsimony”, as well as being a “matter of impression… the impression is not of what the words mean but of what a jury could sensibly think they meant”. That test differs from the consideration of such issues at the trial.
	
	
	The difficulty faced by the court in applications of the kind brought by the defendant here is that the matter complained consists of alternating sections of what is known as “bane and antidote”: Morosi v Broadcasting Station 2GB Pty Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 418(n) (at 419), namely statements making allegations which are followed by what is asserted to be a refutation of those allegations.
	
	
	In the present case, the matters complained of alternate between allegations about the plaintiff’s asserted support for organisations carrying out terrorist attacks (the “bane”) followed by the “antidote”, namely statements that there is “no suggestion” (paragraph 18) that the plaintiff and his friends “engaged in or planned terror activities”, and that the police do not regard their photographed activities as illegal (paragraph 14). These mixed messages are further complicated by the attempted use of satire (“GUNS N’ [sic] POSERS” being an attempt at a pun on the name of the rock group “Guns ‘n’ Roses”) and use of dramatic language such as “bloody and confronting images”.
	
	
	The issues for determination where there is an imputation involving the reconciliation of “bane and antidote” are explained by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd at [143]-[146]:
	


“[143] The general view is that the jury is the proper tribunal for determining whether the antidote has overcome the bane: Sergi v Australian Broadcasting Commission [1983] 2 NSWLR 669 (at 674) per Glass JA; see also Hutley JA (at 670) referring to Morosi v Broadcasting Station 2GB Pty Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 418(n) (at 419). There, Samuels JA said:

“ … cases (i.e. when a publication which seeks to refute a calumny which it expressly states may be held incapable of conveying any defamatory meaning) must be comparatively rare.”

[144] Thus, it is rare to conclude that the antidote of the matter complained of swamps its bane at the capacity stage: Bik v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1979] 2 NSWLR 679(n) (“Bik”); see also Cruise v Express Newspapers Plc [1999] QB 931 (at 939–941); Mark v Associated Newspapers Ltd [2002] EWCA Civ 772; [2002] EMLR 38 (at [25]–[44]) per Simon Brown LJ (Mummery and Dyson LJJ agreeing).

[145] The facts of Bik illustrate the singularity of the application of the bane and antidote principle in that case. The matter complained of was a newspaper report of a parliamentary sitting in which the Minister of Justice informed the House that the plaintiff had been “completely cleared” of any involvement in the design of a faulty crane that led to a fatality, or of giving instructions in relation to the temporary repair of the crane which proved inadequate. Herron CJ (Manning JA agreeing) held (at 682) that the whole tenor of the article was.

… to inform the reader that Mr Bik was wholly cleared, and no fair-minded reader could imply that Mr Bik bore any responsibility for the fatality. He would read that an injustice had been done by having had for eight years wrongful acts attributed to him, and now he has been cleared of it. So far from being defamatory, the article is laudatory of the plaintiff.

[146] The bane and antidote theory reflects the fundamental proposition the “reader is entitled to give some parts of the article more weight than other parts”: Rivkin (at [50] per McHugh J). To apply, however, something “disreputable to the plaintiff” must be “removed by the conclusion“: see Chalmers v Payne (1835) 2 Cr M & R 156 (at 159); 150 ER 67 (at 68); Ahmed v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 6 (at [16]) per McColl JA (Santow and Basten JJA agreeing).”


	
	The defendant’s submission is that the references to “Hezbollah”, “martyrs”, “Islamic State”, “Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad”, the publication of “bloody and confronting images from the Syrian warzone” on social media and references to “Hezbollah” as a terror organisation are overcome by the following antidote:
	



	
	The statement from the NSW Police that although the photographs published are “tasteless”, they “do not appear to show illegal activities” (paragraph 14) and by Shooters and Fishers MP Robert Borsak that the guns appeared compliant (paragraph 15).
	
	
	The statement in paragraph 17 that although Hezbollah (the organisation whose flag the plaintiff and his children posed with) had been responsible for terror attacks in the past, it was now seeking to strengthen its public image.
	
	
	The statement that “There is no suggestion the men, who The Daily Telegraph has made repeated attempts to contact for comment, engaged in or planned terror activities” (paragraph 18).
	
	
	References in the matter complained of to the men being “fiercely opposed” to the Islamic State and being staunch supporters of the Syrian President, Mr Assad, whose photograph appears in the article (paragraphs 6 and 10).
	



	
	However:
	



	
	Although NSW Police do not consider the conduct illegal, the PETA spokesperson says that any compassionate person would be “disturbed” by the photographs of the men posing with animal body parts (paragraph 12) and a game hunting property owner said he would not allow such activity on his farm (paragraph 15);
	
	
	The context of the statements about Hezbollah seeking to strengthen its public image is put forward in a context where the ordinary reasonable reader would be invited to draw inferences as to whether this was in fact the case, given that it was still listed as a terror organisation by the Australian Government (paragraph 16).
	
	
	The statement in paragraph 18 immediately follows the reference to the plaintiff and his children posing with a Hezbollah flag, in circumstances where those photographs are clearly part of the series of photographs of bloody and confronting images of decapitated soldiers.
	
	
	While the men are portrayed as supporting “Syrian dictator” (paragraph 4) President Assad rather than Islamic State, that does not necessarily mean they are not terrorists or terrorism supporters, as the article concludes by pointing out that President Assad’s government “killed hundreds of his own civilians in chemical attacks in 2013”.
	



	
	Unlike the matter complained of in Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd, this is not a book which the ordinary reasonable reader would read with care, but a newspaper article which, thanks to its sarcastic heading and lurid language (“animal killing ground”, “bloody and confronting images from the Syrian warzone”, “decapitated soldiers”, “martyrs”) and reference to terror organisations, is open to a degree of loose thinking.
	
	
	Ms Barnett’s second argument was that identifying the plaintiff as supporting a terrorist organisation does not mean that he is a terrorist and imputation (iv) was not capable of being conveyed.
	
	
	Again, this is a matter for the jury, particularly in circumstances where the plaintiff is identified as someone whose Facebook profile photograph depicts him wearing camouflage, posing with a dead animal wearing sunglasses and carrying a bolt action gun with a precision scope and arranging for his children to be photographed with him while carrying a Hezbollah flag. Again, for the reasons explained by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd, these are matters for determination by the jury.
	


Costs


	
	By reason of the plaintiff’s concessions in relation to other matters not the subject of argument, the appropriate costs order is that the defendant pay half of the plaintiff’s costs of the application today.
	


Orders


	
	Grant leave to the plaintiff to file an amended statement of claim, such amendment to include the amendments agreed to in correspondence.
	
	
	Defendant’s objections as to imputation (iv) in each of the matters complained of dismissed; this imputation will go to the jury.
	
	
	Amended Statement of Claim to be filed and served in 14 days.
	
	
	Defence by 15 September 2016.
	
	
	Plaintiff’s Reply by 29 September 2016.
	
	
	Matter listed in the Defamation List for further directions on Thursday 6 October 2016.
	
	
	The defendant pay half of the plaintiff’s costs of the application today.

2701050,Jacobs v Levitt [2016] NSWDC 202,"Judgment


	
	The plaintiff by notice of motion filed in court on 18 August 2016 seeks orders as follows:
	



	
	That leave be granted to file this Notice of Motion in Court.
	
	
	That this Notice of Motion be returnable instanter.
	
	
	That leave be granted under s 56A of the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) for an extension of the limitation period for the institution of an action for damages for defamation of the Applicant [plaintiff] by the Respondent [defendant] in accordance with the Statement of Claim filed 2nd August 2016 herein.
	
	
	That these proceedings be case managed concurrently with District Court proceedings No 2016/175994, and that proceedings numbered 2016/175994 be stayed pending the judgment of this Honourable Court in respect of this Motion.
	
	
	With such further and alternative remedies that it may please this Honourable Court to give the Applicant [plaintiff].
	
	
	The Costs of this Motion be reserved.
	



	
	The application is supported by the following affidavits:
	



	
	Affidavit of Malcolm Serman, the plaintiff’s solicitor, sworn 23 August 2016; and,
	
	
	Affidavit of Geoffrey Anthony Shannon sworn 22 August 2016.
	



	
	The defendant, rather unusually, neither consented to nor opposed the application and submits only that it is a matter for the court to determine whether an extension of time should be granted pursuant to the provisions of s 56A Limitation Act 1969 (NSW). As is set out below in more detail, the plaintiff encountered difficulties in the Registry in the bringing of this application, which I heard urgently and on the basis that I would provide reasons for my granting the extension at a later date, there being other applications in the list with priority. These are the reasons for the orders made on 25 August 2016.
	


The circumstances in which the matter complained of came to the plaintiff’s attention


	
	The circumstances in which the matter complained of came to the attention of the plaintiff are set out in the affidavit of Mr Shannon, who manages website enquiries for the advocacy group “Unhappy Banking”, a consumer advocacy organisation specialising in mortgage disputes arising from bank loans, mainly to farmers.
	
	
	Mr Shannon was informed in about June 2016 of defamation proceedings commenced by the defendant against the plaintiff, when he was sent a copy of the statement of claim in those proceedings (District Court file 2016/175994). On reading that document, he recalled receiving an email from Mr Levitt, the defendant in these proceedings, some time during 2014, which he considered might be relevant.
	
	
	Mr Shannon had some difficulty locating the defendant’s 2014 email, which had been sent to an email address he had stopped using some time ago. Having located his now inactive email account on his mobile telephone, he found the email in question, which he sent to the plaintiff on 12 June 2016.
	
	
	Mr Shannon sets out in his affidavit that the contents of this email had been a substantial factor in his authorising the defendant to lodge disciplinary complaints on behalf of himself and his wife against the plaintiff. Although Mr Shannon and his wife later withdrew their complaint against the plaintiff, the matter complained of was not shown to the plaintiff at any time during this complaint, or prior to Mr Shannon sending it to the plaintiff on 12 June 2016.
	
	
	As soon as the matter complained of came to the plaintiff’s attention, he consulted his solicitor, Mr Serman, who sets out in his affidavit the circumstances in which he attended the Registry on 18 July 2016 for the purpose of bringing this application. There were some misunderstandings in the Registry, apparently due to the similar names in use in proceedings 2016/175994. It was by reason of the confusion caused, which was not the error of any of the parties, that I dealt with this application as a matter of urgency on 25 August 2016.
	
	
	The period of extension of time is from 23 January 2015, which is approximately one year and eight months.
	


The legislation and relevant principles


	
	Section 56A Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) provides:
	


“56A Extension of limitation period by court

(1) A person claiming to have a cause of action for defamation may apply to the court for an order extending the limitation period for the cause of action.

(2) A court must, if satisfied that it was not reasonable in the circumstances for the plaintiff to have commenced an action in relation to the matter complained of within 1 year from the date of the publication, extend the limitation period mentioned in section 14B to a period of up to 3 years running from the date of the publication.

(3) A court may not order the extension of the limitation period for a cause of action for defamation other than in the circumstances specified in subsection (2).”


	
	The test posed by s 56A was described by Malcolm CJ in Rayney v State of Western Australia (No 3) [2010] WASC 83 as “a difficult hurdle for a plaintiff to overcome unless there are some unusual circumstances” (at [41]). What “unusual circumstances” may constitute grounds for extension are referred to by Simpson J in Ahmed v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 676 at [52], and include circumstances where the plaintiff is “unaware of the publication”.
	
	
	In Cassar v Network Ten Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 680, Hislop J stated that the grant of an extension is not a matter for the discretion of the court but is mandatory if the plaintiff can satisfy the relevant criteria. In Sun v Hojunara International Group (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1050, Campbell J summarised Hislop J’s principles concerning the criteria for s 56A as being the following six factors:
	



	
	The burden that must be discharged is to establish that it was not reasonable in the circumstances for the plaintiff to have commenced an action in relation to the matter complained of within one year from the date of the publication;
	
	
	The onus rests with the plaintiff;
	
	
	The test is objective;
	
	
	It is a difficult hurdle for a plaintiff to overcome unless there are some unusual circumstances;
	
	
	If the plaintiff proves the fact then the court is obliged to extend time. Extension in these circumstances is mandatory; and
	
	
	Section 56A limits the period of extension to an extension “of up to three years running from the date of publication”. This has been described as involving the exercise of discretion in the sense of involving a normative judgment.
	



	
	Campbell J goes on to note that, while the test is an objective one, a consideration of the circumstances required by s 56A includes an inquiry into the plaintiff’s reasons for not commencing proceedings within the limitation period, which may involve consideration of some subjective aspects of the case.
	
	
	However, there can be no doubt that it would not be “reasonable” in the circumstances for the plaintiff to have commenced an action in relation to a publication he knew nothing about. While the principles expressed in s 56A must be proved to the satisfaction of the court in the same type of evaluative exercise required for the decision of any contested issue of fact, there are effectively no facts in dispute in the present case, in that there is no challenge to the plaintiff’s claim of lack of knowledge until 16 June 2016 of the matter complained of. In those circumstances, the plaintiff’s application for an extension of time must be granted.
	
	
	I have deferred the application for these proceedings to be case managed concurrently with proceedings 2016/175994 until the pleadings in these proceedings have closed.
	


Orders


	
	Pursuant s 56A Limitation Act 1969 (NSW), extend time for the commencement of these proceedings to 2 August 2016.
	
	
	Costs to be costs in the cause.
	
	
	Any Defence to be filed within 28 days.
	
	
	Any Reply 14 days thereafter.
	
	
	Matter stood over to Thursday 10 November 2016 in the Defamation List, on which date any application for an extension of time for the filing of the Defence may be made.
	
	
	Somerset Ryckmans are to notify the defendant of these orders.

2701076,GAR – Application for an inquiry into conviction pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2016] NSWSC 1205,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	By application dated 2 March 2016 and submitted on 14 March 2016, the applicant sought, pursuant to Division 3 of Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), a further inquiry into his conviction in 2002 for the offence of sexual intercourse without consent. The applicant was sentenced in respect of that offence to imprisonment for a term of six years commencing on 5 April 2002 and expiring on 4 April 2008, with a non-parole period of four years and six months. The present application was lodged 7 years and 11 months after the applicant had served his sentence.
	
	
	The applicant’s appeal against his conviction was dismissed and leave was refused to appeal against his sentence: GAR v R [2003] NSWCCA 224 (the Original Appeal). In February 2009, Barr J referred the case pursuant to s 79 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the appeal: GAR v R (No. 1) [2010] NSWCCA 163 (the Review Appeal).
	
	
	The applicant seeks a further direction under s 79(1)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act that an inquiry be held, or in the alternative, an order under s 79(1)(b) that the matters be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act. The Court’s discretion to make a direction under s 79(1) arises only “if it appears that there is doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case”.
	
	
	The present application is based on what is said to be “fresh evidence”, being statements apparently made by the applicant’s former wife, ER, and their daughter, E. The statements appear on a single page which reads as follows:
	


IN THE MATTER OF [GAR]

“Under the inducement that the evidence will not be used to prosecute any offence against me

I [E] state the following:-

My mother, [ER] did ask me to falsely corroborate her evidence that she had called out. “Please don’t, [GAR] please don’t,” or similar.

When I made my statement to police and gave evidence, it was false.

	There is another page relied upon on which the following appears in handwriting:
	


“I, ER state.

The words “[GAR] please don’t” were my first words uttered as [GAR] placed his hand over my mouth & nose – he then said “you make one fucking sound, I will snap your f…. neck – he waited for my daughter to be asleep – the crime did occur – I stand by my statement.

ER

	Mr West’s signature appears on the bottom right hand corner of this page.
	
	
	The applicant contended that the effect of the typed statements was to undermine the credibility of both E and ER, who gave evidence for the prosecution. He contended that the handwritten statement, dated 2 October 2015, was, in effect, superseded by the later typed statements.
	
	
	In order to assess the relative importance of these items it is necessary to consider the factual background, what occurred at the trial and subsequently. As I have already addressed these matters in a previous application under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, I propose to reproduce the summary from my reasons for refusing that application: GAR – Application for an inquiry into conviction pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 1734.
	


The trial


	
	The applicant was charged on indictment as follows:
	


1.   That he on 13 January 2002 at Doonside did without consent detain ER with the intention of obtaining an advantage, namely to keep the said ER in his custody and under his control.

2.   Further that he on or about 14 January 2002 at Doonside did have sexual intercourse with ER without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting.


	
	On 21 October 2002, the trial commenced in the District Court before Judge Naughton and a jury. On 1 November 2002, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the first count and guilty on the second count.
	


The Crown case at trial


	
	The complainant, ER, and the applicant were divorced shortly before 13 January 2002, after having been married for approximately 20 years. They had a son and a daughter, E, who, in January 2002, was 12 years old and lived with ER at Doonside. On the morning of 13 January 2002, the applicant went to ER’s home. E was at home when he arrived. ER arrived later in response to a phone call.
	
	
	When ER arrived home, the applicant swore and shouted at her. After they went inside, he pinned her against the kitchen sink for about an hour and a half, during which time he moved back and forth approximately a foot and a half away. ER remained in the kitchen for a further period, during which the applicant did not allow her to move from the area. They moved into the dining room. Throughout this period, the applicant was abusive and made threats against her and a man referred to as RM.
	
	
	Between lunch time and approximately 5 pm, the applicant was alternatively calm and abusive. He refused ER’s request that he leave and, when she wanted to go for a walk with E, he said they could only go if he went with them.
	
	
	At about 11 pm, E went to bed. ER again asked the applicant to leave and he refused. At around midnight ER went to bed. She remained fully dressed.
	
	
	About 15 minutes later, the applicant came into ER’s bedroom. ER said “Don’t do this to me [GAR]. Please don’t do this to me.” The applicant responded by threatening to silence ER, and then threw her back on the bed, removed her clothing and had forced penile intercourse with her. Afterwards, he threatened her and followed her to the bathroom. On returning to the bedroom, the applicant set ER’s alarm clock and lay on the bed next to her. When the alarm sounded at 4 am, the applicant left, but threatened to return.
	
	
	After the applicant left, ER went to the bathroom where she vomited and then showered. After she had dressed she sat in the dining room for some time, before calling RM. At about 6 am, E came into the dining room and spoke to ER. She then rang the police who came to her home at approximately 11.20am. One of the officers gave evidence about the content of the conversation with ER. Later that afternoon, ER attended Westmead Hospital, where Dr Sterrett took a history from her, examined her and prepared a report which was tendered.
	
	
	The evidence in the Crown case was given by ER, E and the police officers who attended the Doonside home and carried out the investigation. The Crown also relied on the report of Dr Sterrett. Photographs of ER’s injuries were admitted into evidence. RM was not called as a witness. Detective Senior Constable Crompton gave evidence that he had been unable to contact him for a statement.
	


The defence case at trial


	
	The applicant, who gave evidence, said that he went to ER’s house for the purpose of inviting his daughter on an outing, and that he became concerned about what she told him about herself and RM, who was much older that she was. When ER returned home, the applicant discussed his concerns with her. He acknowledged that the discussion was at times heated, particularly in relation to RM (whom he suspected of abusing his daughter). He neither restricted ER’s movements nor prevented her from leaving. As the afternoon wore on, the applicant and ER became more conciliatory. When E went to bed ER invited him to have intercourse with her in her room. Consensual intercourse then took place several times. The applicant left early in the morning.
	


Original Appeal


	
	One of the grounds in the Original Appeal was that the trial judge erred in law in directing and/or failing to direct the jury adequately or properly as to complaint and/or the effect of complaint. In addressing that ground, Miles AJ (with whom Spigelman CJ and Bell J agreed) referred to the following aspects of the evidence that the trial judge summarised, in his directions, as complaint evidence:
	


1.   ER’s evidence in relation to ringing RM, and, in cross-examination, that she had “told him what had happened.”

2.   The evidence of the daughter, E, that after she woke and saw her mother in the dining room, she said “Mum I’m calling the police.” ER replied “No, don’t.” The daughter responded “I know he raped you.” ER replied “Yes he did.” The daughter then rang the police.

3.   Evidence about which his Honour said there was no dispute, namely that the police “received a complaint from the complainant that morning she had been raped by the accused.”

4.   Evidence of Constable White, who accompanied Constable Wharfe to the house about 11.30 am on 14 January 2002 and heard ER say to Constable Wharfe, “He wouldn’t let us leave the house, and I couldn’t call anyone, when I went to bed, he came in and raped me”. This evidence was also not challenged.

5.   A certificate admitted under s 177 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) signed by Dr Sterrett, recording that ER arrived at the Westmead Hospital on 14 January 2002 and gave a history of abuse by her ex-husband including “threats against her life, holding her down with physical force (hand on face and throat) and vaginal rape with penile penetration and, she believed, ejaculation”.


	
	The Court concluded that the trial judge’s directions in relation to the evidence of ER said to amount to a complaint to RM were inaccurate. Miles AJ referred to relevant authorities, and said: “evidence of complaint is no longer admitted in effect to bolster or strengthen the credit of the complainant, but as evidence of the facts intended to be represented”. Miles AJ said further at [47]:
	


“The fact of the telephone call in itself was irrelevant. Arguably it might have been relevant for her to say in evidence that she ‘told him what happened’, but the probative value of her telling RM ‘what happened’ was well outweighed by the likelihood of unfair prejudice, the jury being invited in effect to speculate upon what it was that she said to RM. Hence evidence that she told him ‘what happened’, if it had been objected to, was likely to have been rejected on discretionary grounds under s 135 or 137 of the Evidence Act.

Since the evidence went no higher than establishing that the complainant told RM ‘what happened’. The jury should not have been left in the situation where they had been instructed that the complainant had made a complaint to RM.”


	
	Notwithstanding Miles AJ’s conclusion that the directions on the complaint evidence were inaccurate in so far as ER’s statements to RM were concerned, rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules was applied and leave was refused in respect of that ground on the following bases:
	



	
	the evidence was not objected to;
	
	
	ER was cross-examined about her statement to RM, presumably to impugn her credit by investigating possible inconsistency; and
	
	
	no direction was sought at the end of the summing-up.
	


Review Appeal


	
	The basis for Barr J’s referral of the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal for the Review Appeal was a statement that E was said to have made to her father, on a visit to Long Bay Gaol (in the company of a friend of her father’s, John Carroll), that she had not heard anything that night and that her mother had told her to say that she had on the grounds that that the police “wouldn’t believe her [ER] by herself”. It was also alleged that E had made a similar statement to the applicant’s sister, JC, and to a former friend of ER.
	
	
	The applicant initially contended that ER had procured E to give fabricated evidence at the trial which implicated him. However, following E’s oral evidence on the appeal, the applicant reframed this ground to allege that E had given false evidence against the applicant “at the behest of” ER. He argued that in light of the fresh evidence about E having lied in her evidence, the Court should be satisfied as to his innocence or at least entertain a reasonable doubt about his guilt so as to warrant quashing the verdict and ordering a retrial. The applicant contended:
	


(i)   E’s evidence on which reliance was placed, was “fresh”;

(ii)   E’s evidence was credible, cogent and plausible;

(iii)   in the context of the evidence given at trial, the fresh evidence was likely to have caused the jury to entertain a reasonable doubt as to the applicant's guilt;   

(iv)   alternatively, there was a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, may have acquitted the applicant on the basis of the evidence as a whole, including the fresh evidence.


	
	Both E and ER gave evidence at the hearing of the Review Appeal.
	
	
	At the Review Appeal, E recanted her evidence at trial that she had heard noises at 2am, including her mother saying, “Please don’t [GAR], please don’t”. The Court noted that the applicant’s counsel did not put to E at trial that she had not heard her mother say those words. At the Review Appeal E also recanted her evidence at trial that she had heard her father say to her mother: “I don’t care what you call it but I call it revenge” and that she had also heard her father say at 4am before slamming the front door, “Well, I’m fucking going”. E also recanted the evidence she had given at trial that when E had got up the following morning she found her mother in the dining room, crying, and told her mother that she was calling the police. E’s evidence at trial was that her mother said, “No, don’t” to which E responded, “I know he raped you”, to which her mother responded, “Yes, he did.” E’s evidence at trial was that, after this exchange, she called the police immediately.
	
	
	At the Review Appeal, E gave evidence that she discussed the contents of her police statement with her mother and that she had felt pressured to help her mother at trial.
	
	
	The Court on the Review Appeal found the evidence that E gave in the Review Appeal (which, if accepted, would have seriously undermined the Crown case and ER’s credibility), to be “neither cogent, credible nor plausible” (at [151] (c)). The Court considered that E was prepared to agree to anything that was put by the applicant’s counsel which reflected favourably on the applicant. In any event, the Court considered that, even without E’s evidence, there was sufficient evidence to satisfy the jury of the applicant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	By contrast, the Court found ER’s evidence given on the Review Appeal that she did not know what her daughter had, or had not, heard in the early hours of 14 January 2002 and denied having seen E’s statement or discussed its contents with her “not only credible but cogent” (at [151] (c)).
	
	
	The Court addressed the evidence of E and ER in the following terms at [151]:
	


(c) In our view, the evidence given before this Court by ER was not only credible but also cogent. On the other hand, that of her daughter, E, was neither cogent, credible nor plausible. In particular:

(i) were it not for the fact that in her evidence before this Court she accepted, indeed practically volunteered, that her evidence at trial as to what she had heard in the early hours of the morning of 14 January was untrue, we would have regarded her admission to her father in April 2005 as well as her statements to her aunt and Ms Toobey that she had lied in giving that evidence as explicable by her desire to placate her father and, as she said, to give him “some hope”;

. . .

(iii) as to the retraction by E of her answer to Q7 in her ERISP when, without warning, she said that that answer to Q7 was untrue, applying, as it did, to the answers in her evidence-in-chief at trial which we have emphasised at [50] above, we would not regard that retraction as plausible or capable of belief given our conclusion, referred to at [94] above, that it was clear from the evidence that she gave before this Court when cross-examined on behalf of the appellant, that she was prepared to agree to anything that was put to her by her father’s counsel and which reflected in the appellant’s favour;

(iv) in any event, there were a number of inconsistencies or unsatisfactory aspects in her evidence given before this Court first, with respect to whether or not she had told her mother on the morning of 14 January that she had not heard anything in the early hours of that morning; and, second, with respect to her evidence that her mother was aware that the contents of her statement to the police, as well as the evidence that she proposed to give at trial, was false to her mother’s knowledge.

[Emphasis added.]


	
	The Court dismissed the appeal.
	


Relevant legislation


	
	Section 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act provides for applications to be made to this Court by a convicted person. Section 79 relevantly provides:
	


(1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:

(a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or

(b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

(2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

(3) The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

(a) it appears that the matter:

(i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or

(ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or

(iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or

(iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and

(b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.

. . .

(4) Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application.


	
	In Application of Peter James Holland under s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 252 Johnson J summarised the relevant authorities and referred at [8] to the need for there to be “available material which, as a matter of practical reality, gives rise to a relevant sense of unease or disquiet”.
	


Previous applications for review of conviction


	
	The present application is the third application to the Court pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act for a review of the conviction.
	


The present application


	
	As referred to above, the present application is based on the contents of the two documents reproduced in full above. The first apparently comprises statements by E and ER, both dated 2 December 2015, in which: E said that her mother asked her to falsely corroborate her evidence and that her statement to police and evidence was false; and ER said that E’s statement is true. The second is ER’s handwritten statement dated “2.10.15” which was apparently signed by Mr West in the bottom right hand corner.
	
	
	There is no evidence as to how these statements came into being and no explanation to illuminate how, or why, ER’s typed statement dated 2.12.15 and her handwritten statement dated 2.10.15 came into being. Nor is there any explanation as to the opening words of the typed statements:
	


“Under the inducement that the evidence will not be used to prosecute any offence against me”


	
	The Crown submitted in its written submissions dated 27 June 2016 that it was necessary for the Crown to investigate the provenance of the documents in order to ascertain whether they were verifiable and argued that the purposes of ss 78 and 79 could appropriately be served by such an inquiry. To that end, the Crown Solicitors Office arranged for a private investigator to interview Mr West to ask whether he witnessed the signatures of E and ER on the typed document and signed the bottom right hand corner of the handwritten document. Mr West signed a statement dated 15 June 2016 which the Crown has attached to its submissions.
	
	
	Mr West’s statement reads as follows:
	


“1. This statement made by me accurately sets out the evidence that I would be prepared, if necessary, to give in court as a witness. The statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I will be liable to prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything that I know to be false, or do not believe to be true.

2. I am a registered Justice of The Peace within NSW.

3. My JP number is 134279.

4.   I have examined the attached document marked Annexure 'A' [the document that contains the typewritten “induced” statements of E and ER dated 2 December 2015]. The Justice of Peace details and signatures written on the document are legitimate and were signed by myself.

5. I have examined the attached document marked Annexure 'B' [the document which contains the handwritten statement of ER dated 2 October 2015]. I do not remember previously sighting the document.

6. I do not remember the documents or the persons mentioned within the documents.

7.   I sign all documents relating to Justice of Peace at my residential address.

8. I do not read the contents of documents prior to witnessing the signatures.”


	
	The applicant contended that the effect of the new typewritten statements of E and ER was to undermine the reasons of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the Review Appeal and undermine the credibility of the evidence of E and ER, on the basis of which he had been convicted by the jury. He argued:
	


“It is submitted, the findings of the Court in GAR (1) 2010 [the Review Appeal] are acutely flawed as they critically relied on the credibility of ER, her credibility now devastated by the 2015 fresh evidence. This is particularly with respect to the Court’s findings regarding ER’s complaint, and the corroboration of the medical evidence.”


	
	The Attorney-General on behalf of the Crown submitted that: the statements do raise a doubt or a question as to the applicant’s guilt and as to the evidence of E and ER; there do not appear to be any reasons for this Court to refuse to consider or otherwise deal with the application; and the application discloses sufficient information to enable the conviction to be properly considered. The Crown submitted that Mr West’s statement establishes, “at a fundamental level” that the Court can act on the statements. It also submitted that the new material relied on by the applicant, in light of Mr West’s statement, gives rise to a relevant sense of unease or disquiet about the applicant’s guilt. The Crown contended that, on this basis, it could appear to the Court that there is a “doubt” or “question” about the applicant’s guilt within the meaning of s 79(2) and that, accordingly, it would be appropriate for the matter to be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal for the whole of the case to be dealt with as an appeal.
	
	
	In his submissions in reply the applicant referred this Court to M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 and the applicable test for determining whether a verdict returned by a jury ought be set aside as unreasonable or not able to be supported having regard to the evidence. He submitted as follows:
	


“. . . ER stage-managed her 12 year old daughter (E) to falsely corroborate her account of what she swore at trial she had said to the applicant, “please don’t [GAR] please don’t,” at the time she was allegedly being sexually assaulted.

…

It is submitted that The CCA is compelled to consider that if the jury had the knowledge of ER’s conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by manipulating E in the way ER has now admitted with the 2015 fresh evidence, how would that evidence impact on the jury members minds.

…

It is submitted that the Court is required to recognise that if ER is prepared to concoct and promote a false version of events and pressure a child to commit the criminal offence of perjury to bring them into play, then it is also possible, indeed likely, that ER would concoct her own version of events offered in her statements, the witness box at trial and the Court of Criminal Appeal.”

Consideration


	
	The particular factual matrix presented by the new material relied on by the applicant is new, in that, previously, he relied on oral statements made by E to himself and to third parties to the effect that her evidence at trial was false. This matter was extensively investigated in the course of the Review Appeal, in which E gave evidence and was not believed for the reasons extracted from the Court’s judgment set out above. Although E’s statement dated 2 December 2015 is typewritten, whereas the earlier statements were oral, the effect of several statements made by E since the applicant’s conviction is to undermine the evidence she gave at the trial and concessions she made in the Review Appeal. Although there are some differences between the recent statement and earlier statements, they are substantially similar in that they support the applicant’s innocence and are inconsistent with E’s evidence at trial.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal in the Review Appeal had an opportunity to hear and see E’s evidence and assess her credibility. Its finding that she was not to be believed because she was prepared to say anything that would advance the applicant’s position reflected that advantage.
	
	
	What is apparently new is the statement by ER that E’s statement was true. This statement is inconsistent with ER’s evidence at trial and her evidence at the Review Appeal. It is also, in some respects, inconsistent with the handwritten statement dated 2 October 2015 although the inconsistency is not direct (since the earlier statement relates to the incident itself whereas the typed statement relates to what ER said to E).
	
	
	In my view, the question whether E and ER were telling the truth about the incident and its immediate aftermath has already been fully investigated both at the trial and on the Review Appeal. That a witness or victim might, after an offender has been released from custody, appear to recant from evidence given at a trial or on an appeal, does not necessarily create a doubt about the offender’s guilt. Such recanting could also be explained by other factors. In the case of E, her relationship with her father, the applicant, is likely to be substantially affected by what E says or said about his conduct. ER, too, might be inclined to say other than the truth in order to assist E, or in the belief that nothing is to be gained by not providing a statement that the applicant has requested, since he has already served his sentence. Nonetheless, whatever ER said in the “induced” statement, she adhered to her evidence that the offence occurred, as appears from her handwritten statement dated 2 October 2015.
	
	
	That E and ER were apparently prepared to sign these statements in the presence of Mr West, as a Justice of the Peace, does not make their statements credible. It merely tends to prove that there were not fabricated by the applicant. The statements appear to have been made by E and ER, after their having received an “inducement that the evidence will not be used to prosecute any offence” against either one of them.
	
	
	It does not appear to me that there is a doubt or question as to the applicant’s guilt, or any doubt as to the evidence of E and ER in the trial. Any doubt which existed prior to the Review Appeal has, in my view, been removed by that appeal. I am not persuaded that it is necessary to consider the application further. Accordingly the application is dismissed.

2701082,Abdulrahman v R [2016] NSWCCA 192,"Judgment


	
	1   BATHURST CJ: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Price J in draft. Subject to what I have written below, I agree with his Honour’s reasons. However, I am of the opinion that the appropriate order of the Court is that leave to appeal be refused.
	
	
	Although, like his Honour, I am of the view that in the circumstances of the present case no lesser sentence than that imposed by the sentencing judge is warranted in law, I do not believe it is necessary for me to indicate the sentence which I would have imposed.
	
	
	It seems to me that what is required by Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 is that once error on the part of the sentencing judge has been established, it is necessary to re-exercise the sentencing discretion to determine whether a lesser sentence is warranted in law. The Court, however, made it clear it was not necessary to resentence the applicant if it determined that no lesser sentence was warranted, although if it determined to resentence in those circumstances, it should inform the applicant so that he or she had an opportunity to withdraw the appeal: see also Neal v The Queen [1982] HCA 55; 149 CLR 305 at 308; Parker v Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 282 at 290.
	
	
	In these circumstances, if on such a re-exercise the Court is of the view that no lesser sentence is warranted but determines not to resentence, then in my view it is sufficient to simply state this rather than indicating the hypothetical sentence which would have been imposed as a result of the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	In those circumstances, leave to appeal should be refused.
	
	
	HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Price J.
	
	
	PRICE J: The applicant, Badar Abdulrahman, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Hosking SC ADCJ on 7 July 2015. He had pleaded guilty to a count of aggravated break and enter of a dwelling house at Moorebank on 2 April 2014 and then in the dwelling house, committed a serious indictable offence, namely larceny in circumstances of aggravation, being in company contrary to s112(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty in relation to this offence is 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 5 years.
	
	
	The applicant asked the judge to take into account on sentence a matter on a Form 1 being an offence of aggravated break and enter a dwelling house at Campsie on 6 April 2014 with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, namely larceny in company, contrary to s113(2) Crimes Act. The maximum penalty in relation to this offence is 14 years imprisonment.
	
	
	Taking into account the offence on the Form 1, the judge sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 3 years 6 months consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 5 July 2015 and expiring on 4 July 2017, with a balance of term of 18 months commencing on 5 July 2017 and expiring on 4 January 2019.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court and adhered to his plea in the District Court. The judge reduced the sentence by 25% for the utilitarian value of the plea.
	
	
	The Notice of Appeal identifies seven grounds, namely:
	



	
	the sentencing process miscarried;
	
	
	the sentencing judge erred in his finding as to the objective circumstances of the offence;
	
	
	the sentencing judge erred in sentencing on the basis that the Form 1 offence added significantly to the inherent criminality;
	
	
	the sentencing judge erred in sentencing on the basis that the offence was further aggravated;
	
	
	the sentencing judge erred in sentencing on the basis of retribution;
	
	
	the sentencing judge erred in failing to correctly apply principles appropriate for sentencing of youthful offenders; and
	
	
	the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
	


Facts


	
	The facts of the principal offence and the Form 1 offence were not in dispute and the agreed facts were recounted by the judge in his remarks on sentence (ROS 1-3):
	


“1. At approximately 4am on Wednesday 2 April 2014 the victim… left her home at an address in Moorebank to go on a four week holiday, having carefully locked and secured it before leaving. This property is a single-storey three bedroom brick veneer home.

2. At approximately 12.20pm on the same day, 2 April 2014, the offender, Badar Abdulrahman, and two unknown male offenders, forced open the side gate of the premises. They then forced open the locked rear-glass sliding door to gain entry to the premises.

3. The offender and two other unknown males then ransacked two of the bedrooms, leaving items from the drawers and cupboards thrown all over the floor.

4. The offender and the other two unknown males stole the following property from the premises; [sic] $200 in cash, two Apple iPhone 4 mobile phones (valued at approximately $400) and a jewellery box containing approximately $31,300 worth of the following jewellery, which had the [sic] significant sentimental value to the victim, [sic] a gold bracelet, a gold charm bracelet, a gold necklace, a gold chain with a gold religious pendant, a gold christening charm chain, four traditional Irish wedding rings belonging to the victim’s parents, the victim’s mother’s engagement ring, [and] the victim’s mother’s eternity ring.

5. The offence was recorded by a motion-activated camera that was installed in the dining room of the premises.

6. The offender and two other unknown males saw the camera, unplugged it from the wall, and smashed it on the ground. They also unplugged the victim’s Wi-Fi device and put it in the sink in the kitchen before leaving the property through the front door with the items listed above.

7. The victim’s ex-partner attended the property later that day and the police were notified. An SD memory card was recovered from the smashed camera on which footage of the incident was recorded.

8. The offender attended Campsie Police Station on 23 May 2014 and was arrested, cautioned, and charged in relation to this offence. He declined to participate in an electronically recorded interview.

Form 1 offence:

9. The victim… resides at an address in Campsie with his wife, two children, his nephew and a friend. The property is a single story [sic] brick home surrounded by a two-meter [sic] high colorbond fence.

10. At approximately 3pm on Sunday 6 April 2014, the victim left his house locking the front and back doors as well as the windows and securing the gate at the front of the house with a padlock.

11. At approximately 3.30pm on that same day, 6 April 2014, the offender Badar Abdulrahman and another unknown male offender jumped over the fence at the front of the victim’s property.

12. They went to the front door of the property before walking to the rear of the premises where to gain access to the premises they damaged the rear wooden door by breaking off the top half of the door and damaging the timber doorframe.

13. A civilian witness, who had seen the offender and the other unknown male jumping the fence of the property, called police who attended and saw the offender and the other unknown male jumping the side fence of the property and fleeing down a canal that runs along the side of the property.

14. Having run from the location the offender entered the garden of the property at 8 Page Street, Canterbury, and concealed himself in a skip waste bin that was located on the property. The offender also removed his red t-shirt and concealed that amongst the material in the bin.

15. Police located the accused hiding in the skip bin at 8 Page Street, Canterbury, where he was arrested, cautioned, and conveyed to Campsie Police Station. He participated in an electronically recorded interview in which he denied the offence.”

Subjective circumstances


	
	The applicant did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence but two character testimonials were tendered as was a Community Corrections pre-sentence report. It is from this material that the applicant’s background is derived.
	
	
	He was born on 8 March 1994 and was 20 years old when the offence was committed. The applicant told the author of the pre-sentence report that he resided with his father and older brother in Sydney with whom he had a supportive and stable relationship. He claimed to be married; however, his wife resided separately from him and there were no dependent children.
	
	
	The applicant was employed on a full-time basis. A character testimonial from the Managing Director of Professor Sparkz Electrics stated that the applicant had been employed by that company since October 2014. He had entered the company as an electrical trade assistant and was assigned to an advanced technology role with the Building automation team based, the Managing Director wrote, “on his high level of intelligence and I.T knowledge” (Ex 1). The applicant went on to manage the team and excelled within the company in a short time. He was described as a hard worker and always punctual, taking personal responsibility for his work and always getting the job done.
	
	
	As to a history of abusing illicit drugs which the applicant disclosed to the author of the pre-sentence report, the applicant denied his use was problematic. Whilst the applicant stated he was using illicit drugs, namely cocaine two to three times per week around the time of the offences, he said this was not a contributing factor to his offending behaviour. He claimed to have been abstinent from all illicit drugs since his arrest for the present offences.
	
	
	The applicant told the author of the report that he committed the offences as a means to obtain money and attributed the offending behaviour to poor decision-making influenced by negative associates.
	
	
	In a character testimonial, a Youth worker employed by Youth Off The Streets stated that he had known the applicant for almost three years as they had worked together as part of the Outreach program. The applicant was described as being reliable, hard-working and honest.
	
	
	In oral submissions, the applicant’s legal representative told the judge that he had been instructed to say (Tcpt, p 6(35)):
	


“… that [the applicant’s] poor decision making influenced by his negative associates in order to obtain quick money being the motivational factor yet the money at the end of the day was also used to support the drug habit.”

Prior criminal history


	
	The applicant’s prior criminal history reveals that at the Parramatta Children’s Court on 21 June 2011, he had been placed on probation for 15 months with supervision for an offence of robbery in company. For a second offence of robbery in company, he was ordered to perform 100 hours of community service work. He was called up for this offence and placed on 9 months’ probation on 2 October 2012.
	
	
	On 11 May 2010, at the Parramatta Children’s Court, he was placed on 12 months’ probation with supervision for an offence of aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence in company. He was called up for this offence and on 6 July 2011 was placed on probation with supervision for 12 months.
	
	
	On 26 October 2010, for an offence of affray, he was placed on a 6 month control order at the Parramatta Children’s Court which was suspended on conditions. When called up for this offence on 6 July 2011, he was placed on a 6 month control order commencing 21 March 2011.
	
	
	Another 3 month control order was imposed at the Parramatta Children’s Court on 26 August 2011 for entering a building with intent to commit an indictable offence.
	
	
	All of these offences were committed whilst the applicant was a juvenile. The only relevant offence that appears on his criminal history as an adult was that of goods in custody for which he was convicted and fined.
	


Sentencing remarks


	
	Following sentencing submissions from the applicant’s legal representative and the Crown, the judge adjourned until 2:00pm. After the adjournment the applicant was sentenced.
	
	
	During his remarks on sentence, the judge said that the matter on the back of the Form 1 was “another matter of aggravated break and enter with intent in company contrary to s 113(2) of the Crimes Act… which adds in view significantly to the inherent criminality of the s 112(2) charge.” (ROS 1.) [Emphasis added.]
	
	
	After reading the agreed facts, his Honour stated (ROS 3):
	


“In my view the Form 1 matter, as I indicated, adds significantly to the criminality of the principal offence that I am to sentence the offender for.” [Emphasis added.]


	
	When referring to the applicant’s prior criminal history, the judge remarked that at the time of the commission of the offence, the offender already had a significant criminal record, mainly as a juvenile. After detailing the applicant’s prior offending, the judge said (ROS 4):
	


“That record in my view, as the Crown has submitted, disentitles the offender to any leniency before this Court today. It also demonstrates that as a recidivist, as the Crown accurately describes the offender, that [sic] important component of his sentence here is the issue of personal deterrence.”


	
	The judge said that objectively viewed, this was a very serious offence and was inherently serious from the very fact that it carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment with a 5 year standard non-parole period. His Honour acknowledged that under s112(2) Crimes Act there were various circumstances of aggravation of which being in company was not the worst. His Honour accepted as correct the Crown’s submissions on the objective gravity of the offence, which were:
	


“The offence is objectively serious in that it involved considerable ransacking of the victim’s premises. The items stolen have not been recovered and were of considerable sentimental value. The money value was also significant and is valued as being in excess of $30,000. The offenders have gone to some length to avoid being detected by disabling the security camera and also the Wi-Fi.”


	
	His Honour referred to the guideline judgment in R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327; [1999] NSWCCA 435 (“Ponfield”). He said (ROS 6):
	


“In terms of factors identified in Ponfield as making a break, enter and steal type offence worse there are in the present case these three factors: 

Firstly, that this offender has a prior record, particularly for similar offences;

Next, that this offence was accompanied by what I regard as gratuitous vandalism; and

Thirdly, that the value of the stolen property to the victim was not only substantial in money terms but also in terms of sentimental items which have been lost to the victim for ever [sic] and I have little doubt their loss caused the victim significant distress.” [Emphasis added.]


	
	The judge considered that general deterrence was a very important factor as was specific deterrence because of the applicant’s significant criminal record. His Honour remarked (ROS 6):
	


“So too is the factor of retribution. The victim is at least entitled to feel, at the end of all this, that the Court has imposed an appropriate punishment on the offender for violating the integrity of her home and her property.” [Emphasis added.]


	
	Having regard to the applicant’s extensive criminal history, the judge was very guarded about his prospects of rehabilitation and expressed the view that unless the applicant had a major change in attitude, his past behaviour showed that upon release he was likely to reoffend. The judge did not find that the applicant was remorseful because there was no real evidence of remorse. As to rehabilitation and the likelihood of reoffending, the judge said that he simply did not know what was likely to happen in the applicant’s case.
	
	
	His Honour said (ROS 8):
	


“The offender is now 21. At the time of the offence he was just 20. In my view that is a major factor in his sentencing in the offender’s favour.” [Emphasis added.]


	
	When dealing with the submission that the applicant be referred for an intensive corrections order assessment, the judge said that was “completely impossible” (ROS 8). His Honour accepted the Crown’s submission that the only appropriate sentence was full-time custody. His Honour said (ROS 8-9):
	


“The plain fact is that people cannot thumb their noses at the criminal law for years and then, when charged with a serious offence like this, come before the Court and expect to receive a lenient penalty such as an intensive corrections order.”


	
	The judge expressed the view that without a plea of guilty, the overall sentence, even in this case, with a man who was 20 years old at the time of the offence, would have been an overall sentence of 4 years 8 months which when discounted by 25% translated to an overall sentence of 3 years 6 months.
	
	
	Special circumstances were found, being the applicant’s need for the assistance of the Community Corrections Service upon release to reintegrate himself into the community and his first time in custody. The non-parole period was reduced to 2 years.
	
	
	His Honour referred to the standard non-parole period of 5 years and said (ROS 9):
	


“… I do not consider that a standard non-parole period should be imposed on a young man of 20 because experience in sentencing shows that a five year sentence is completely crushing and in my view it is not appropriate to impose such a crushing sentence even on an offender with the background of [the applicant].”

Ground 1: The sentencing process miscarried


	
	At the commencement of the proceedings on sentence, the applicant sought an adjournment for the purpose of obtaining a psychological report. The application was refused.
	


Submissions


	
	The applicant submitted that the judge should have adjourned the sentence hearing and, apart from the fact that the report had not yet been obtained, there was no evidence that the applicant was not seeing a psychologist nor did not genuinely wish to obtain such a report. It was submitted that although the matter had been listed once before, no prejudice would have been caused to the Crown by an adjournment. Such a report was likely to obtain information supplementing the pre-sentence report, particularly in relation to the applicant’s drug use, remorse and likelihood of reoffending.
	
	
	The Crown argued that the applicant had the opportunity to obtain a psychologist report during the adjournment and that the onus was on the applicant to persuade the judge that an adjournment was appropriate in the circumstances. The applicant did not give or call evidence on the application for the adjournment as to why he had been unable to obtain the relevant report and, in any event, any such report would have been of limited assistance given the applicant’s admitted financial motivation for the offences.
	


Consideration


	
	This was the second time that the proceedings had been listed for sentence. On the first occasion (30 April 2015), the applicant sought an adjournment for the purpose of cross-examining the author of the pre-sentence report and to put further material before the court. The application was granted and the proceedings were re-listed for sentence on 7 July 2015.
	
	
	On that day, the judge was informed that the author of the pre-sentence report was no longer required for cross-examination. The applicant’s legal representative applied for a further adjournment so that a psychologist’s report could be obtained. The Crown opposed the adjournment but accepted that a psychological report might assist the court in some way. However, the material that was placed before the judge in support of the application was confined to the applicant’s legal representative informing the judge that the applicant had seen a psychologist about one and a half months ago.
	
	
	The applicant was not called to give evidence nor was an affidavit tendered in support of the application. The applicant had done little, if anything at all, to obtain the report and his solicitors had not taken the preliminary step of writing to the psychologist.
	
	
	It is hardly surprising that the judge was not satisfied that the applicant had made a genuine attempt to obtain a psychologist’s report and refused the application. Courts are entitled to expect that matters for sentence will proceed on the date listed for hearing, particularly when an adjournment application has previously been granted. Parties cannot expect that applications to adjourn will be readily granted without evidence supporting a conclusion that it is in the interests of justice to do so.
	
	
	In any event, I am not persuaded that a psychologist’s report would have assisted the applicant on sentence. He committed the offences as a means to obtain money and attributed his offending behaviour to poor decision-making influenced by negative associates. Furthermore, it is difficult to accept the applicant’s argument when there is no reliance upon a psychological report in the event of re-sentence by this Court.
	
	
	The judge did not err in the exercise of his discretion to refuse the application for an adjournment. It follows that Ground 1 of the appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in his finding as to the objective circumstances of the offence

Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in sentencing on the basis that the Form 1 offence added significantly to the inherent criminality

Ground 4: The sentencing judge erred in sentencing on the basis that the offence was further aggravated


	
	It is convenient to deal with these Grounds together as they relate to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.
	


Submissions


	
	The applicant submitted that the objective circumstances and criminality of the offence did not warrant the judge’s finding that, “… this was a very serious offence indeed.” (ROS 4.) The applicant contended that his offending was a standard break, enter and steal offence and that the judge had exaggerated its objective seriousness. The applicant argued that the judge erred in finding that the offence was aggravated by the offender having a prior criminal record as:
	



	
	the judge’s reliance on Ponfield was said to be of limited utility as that case has largely been overtaken by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act”), and Mapp v R [2010] NSWCCA 269; (2010) 206 A Crim R 497 was cited.
	
	
	the principle of proportionality required that the upper boundary of a sentence be set by the objective circumstances of the offence, and that these circumstances do not include prior convictions: R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566; [2006] NSWCCA 242 (“McNaughton”).
	
	
	the applicant’s prior criminal record did not require or justify his being dealt with on the basis of Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465; [1988] HCA 14 (“Veen (No 2)”).
	



	
	Another submission was that the judge was wrong to describe the applicant’s conduct as “gratuitous vandalism” and to regard this as an aggravating factor. Although the applicant accepted that the offence on the Form 1 was a matter to be taken into account, he argued that it should not have been regarded as a matter which ‘significantly’ increased the criminality of the principal offence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there was no error in the judge’s finding as to the objective seriousness of the offence. The offence was inherently serious having regard to the maximum penalty and standard-non parole period and the judge was obliged to assess the objective seriousness of the offence by purely objective criteria. His Honour’s assessment of the objective gravity was open, as was the finding of “gratuitous vandalism”, given what he and the other two co-offenders did in the home and the stealing of property of considerable monetary and sentimental value.
	
	
	The Crown argued that the judge did not treat the applicant’s criminal record as elevating the objective seriousness of the offence. Rather, his Honour correctly reasoned that the applicant’s record disentitled the offender to any leniency and that there was a need for personal deterrence. The Crown acknowledged that the offence on the Form 1 did not increase the criminality of the principal offence.
	


Consideration


	
	The judge did not err in considering that the objective seriousness of the offence of aggravated break and enter contrary to s112(2) Crimes Act was reflected by the maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and 5 year standard non-parole period. Offences contrary to s112 Crimes Act have long been regarded as very serious: Ponfield per Grove J at [45]. It was open to his Honour to find that the applicant’s offending was objectively serious as he and two unknown males ransacked two bedrooms, leaving items from the drawers and cupboards over the floor, had smashed the motion-activated camera on the ground and disabled the Wi-Fi device. Items stolen from the property included two Apple iPhone 4 mobile devices and a jewellery box containing jewellery of significant sentimental value to the owner with an estimated worth of $31,300. None of the property has been recovered. This was more than a standard break, enter and steal offence and there is no merit in the applicant’s complaint of the judge’s description of his conduct being accompanied by “gratuitous vandalism.”
	
	
	In my respectful opinion, his Honour’s statement in the passage quoted at [27] above, as to the significance that the Form 1 offence had, when taken into account on sentence for the principal offence, was wrong. It did not in any way add to the criminality of the principal offence, but greater weight could be given to the need for personal deterrence and retribution: Attorney-General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146; [2002] NSWCCA 518 per Spigelman CJ at [42]. His Honour was not entitled to increase the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending on 2 April 2014 (the principal offence) because of the offence on 6 April 2014 (the Form 1 offence). The applicant’s conduct in damaging the rear wooden door of the home at Campsie in order to gain access, two days after breaking into the home at Moorebank, indicated that greater weight should be given to personal deterrence.
	
	
	Another matter that points to error in his Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence is his reference in the passage quoted at [30] above to the offender’s prior criminal record, particularly for similar offences, being one of three factors identified in Ponfield that made a break, enter and steal type of offence worse. Guideline (iii) in Ponfield at [48] – “The offender has a prior record particularly for like offences” – was disapproved and not followed in McNaughton. Prior offending has no part to play when assessing the objective seriousness of the crime: McNaughton per Spigelman CJ at [23] – [24] and Grove J at [66] – [76]. His Honour was entitled to take into account the applicant’s prior record as disentitling him from considerations of leniency and in giving more weight to personal deterrence, but not as enhancing the seriousness of the principal offence.
	
	
	As error has been demonstrated, Grounds 2, 3 and 4 of the appeal have been established.
	


Ground 5: The sentencing judge erred in sentencing on the basis of retribution


	
	The applicant was critical of the judge’s reference in the passage quoted at [31] above to retribution being an important factor in the sentence imposed upon him. It was submitted that retribution was not part of the purposes of sentencing as there was nothing in s3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which would support sentencing on such a basis.
	
	
	Another submission was that the judge was incorrect to rely on R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 as authority for the importance of retribution, as there is no mention in this case of retribution. However, as the Crown pointed out, this case was incorrectly cited during the sentence proceedings, and the correct citation of this case does in fact refer to the decision in Veen (No 2).
	
	
	There is no merit in this Ground of Appeal. Although there is no mention in s3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act of retribution being a purpose for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender, retribution has long been held to be an important aspect of sentencing: R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 459 per Hunt CJ at CL at 468. In Veen (No 2), the High Court (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) said at 476:
	


“The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions.”


	
	In Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120; [2011] HCA 39, the High Court (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) observed at 129:
	


“It should also be noted that the introduction of standard non-parole periods was accompanied by the incorporation of a statutory statement of the purposes of sentencing. The purposes there stated are the familiar, overlapping and, at times, conflicting, purposes of criminal punishment under the common law. There is no attempt to rank them in order of priority and nothing in the Sentencing Act to indicate that the court is to depart from the principles explained in Veen v The Queen [No 2] in applying them.” [Emphasis added.] [Footnotes omitted.]


	
	In the present case, the judge was entitled to consider that retribution was an important factor, particularly having regard to the offence on the Form 1. Ground 5 of the appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 6: The sentencing judge erred in failing to correctly apply principles appropriate for sentencing of youthful offenders


	
	The applicant complained that the sentence should have been mitigated by the application of sentencing principles appropriate to young offenders, principally rehabilitation, as he was just less than one month past his 20th birthday at the time of the commission of the offences. It was contended that the judge placed unduly strong emphasis on both specific and general deterrence and in doing so failed to give emphasis to his ongoing rehabilitation or whether that could best be achieved by a sentence other than full-time custody.
	
	
	Another complaint was that although some allowance was made for the applicant’s youth in finding special circumstances, the judge made no such allowance in setting the overall sentence.
	
	
	There is no merit in this Ground of Appeal. The judge gave careful consideration to the applicant’s relative youth at the time of his offending. His Honour expressly stated that it was a major factor in the applicant’s favour and a reason for not imposing the 5 year standard non-parole period because it would be “completely crushing”.
	
	
	In finding special circumstances, it is plain that the judge had regard to the applicant’s age. As a result, the non-parole period was reduced to 57.1% of the head sentence. Ground 6 of the appeal has not been made out.
	
	
	As specific error has been established, the applicant is to be sentenced afresh in the exercise of this Court’s independent discretion: Kentwell v R (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37 at [42]. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to consider Ground 7.
	


Further evidence


	
	Two affidavits have been tendered on re-sentence. The affidavit of the applicant’s solicitor annexes certificates of completion received by the applicant on 10 June 2016 in relation to the Gurnang Life Challenge ‘Equips Foundation Program’, including courses relating to positive lifestyle, job preparation skills and money management. Also annexed is a letter from the applicant’s wife who has regularly been visiting the applicant in custody. She recounts being impressed by the change in her husband, who has learnt the hard way and has successfully completed courses. She expresses her belief that the applicant will stay out of trouble and do everything it takes to rehabilitate himself.
	
	
	Mrs Abdulrahman describes the applicant as being influenced a lot by people who would come to his house, especially as he was the youngest in the group. She states that there is no way she would let him near those people again, but she does not have to worry about that because it is the applicant’s decision as well. She says that upon release, the applicant could live with her. A family friend, who owns a tiling business, has agreed to employ the applicant full-time when he gets out. Mrs Abdulrahman asks that the applicant be given another chance.
	
	
	An affidavit tendered by the Crown annexes the applicant’s updated custodial history which shows two custodial infringements, including having in his possession a television and fan belonging to another inmate.
	


Re-sentence?


	
	The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s112(2) Crimes Act is 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 5 years. These two legislative guideposts are to be borne in mind when I come to consider the appropriate penalty, having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective features of the applicant.
	
	
	Two factors that enhance the objective seriousness of the offence are the monetary and sentimental value of the stolen jewellery (none of which has been recovered) and the damage to the property that accompanied the offence: Ponfield at [48]. Objectively viewed, this is a serious offence committed to gain money.
	
	
	Greater weight is to be given to personal deterrence and retribution because of the Form 1 offence which indicates that the applicant’s criminal behaviour continued two days after the principal offence.
	
	
	The applicant was 20 years old at the time of his offending. His criminal history reveals serious offences, including robbery in company and aggravated break and enter. His criminal antecedents do not entitle him to leniency but they are not such that they are a matter of aggravation. Although these offences were committed whilst he was a juvenile, they are of a like nature to the present offences and I give more weight to personal deterrence and protection of the community.
	
	
	As the applicant’s plea of guilty was entered in the Local Court, he is entitled to a 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the plea.
	
	
	The judge did not find that the applicant was remorseful. This finding has not been disputed on appeal. On all of the material before this Court, I am unable to find evidence of remorse. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he is remorseful. His sentence is not to be increased for that; however, no allowance can be made for remorse.
	
	
	I am unable to make a positive finding on the balance of probabilities that the applicant is unlikely to re-offend or has good prospects of rehabilitation. His prior criminal history, the call ups for offences that are detailed in that criminal history and the custodial infringement involving another inmate’s property do not encourage the taking of an optimistic view. On the other hand, the courses completed, his wife’s support, his employment with Professor Sparkz Electrics at the time of sentence and the prospect of employment upon release suggest that he has the potential to be rehabilitated. Much will depend on his ability to avoid relapsing to drug misuse upon release from custody.
	
	
	The applicant was a young adult when he committed the offences and is now 22 years old. That does not mean that the principles relevant to sentencing a young offender are irrelevant, but I am unable to conclude that the applicant’s behaviour had much to do with immaturity, as it was motivated by the desire to obtain money which was subsequently used to purchase illicit drugs. As has been said, youth is not a cloak of convenience behind which those who commit serious crimes can shelter from the consequences of their conduct: R v Mastronardi [2000] NSWCCA 12; (2000) 111 A Crim R 306 per Sully J at [20].
	
	
	I take into account that the applicant is a young adult in giving weight to his need for rehabilitation.
	
	
	I am mindful that the need for general deterrence has been emphasised for break and enter offences, so as “to send a very clear message to others who may be minded to conduct themselves in a similar fashion that if they come before the courts they will be punished severely”: R v Maher [2004] NSWCCA 177 at [44].
	
	
	A submission was made to the judge by the applicant’s legal representative that he should not be sentenced to full-time imprisonment but an intensive correction order should be made. In this Court, it was submitted that the applicant should have been dealt with by way of a good behaviour bond under s9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Another alternative was said to be a suspended sentence under s12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	I agree with the applicant’s submission that as he has been assessed as suitable for a community service order, it is likely he would be assessed as suitable for an intensive correction order.
	
	
	In written submissions, the applicant referred to Judicial Commission sentencing statistics (JIRS) for a s112(2) Crimes Act offence that were said to show for 2,112 offenders dealt with in the higher courts from July 2008 until December 2015, some 149 offenders received s9 bonds. However, the JIRS statistics handed up to this Court revealed for 2,163 offenders dealt with in the higher courts from October 2008 to September 2015, 151 offenders received s9 bonds, whereas 1,384 offenders received full-time prison sentences. Another table disclosed that for the same period when 93 offenders pleaded guilty and a Form 1 offence was taken into account with priors of the same type, 5 offenders received s9 bonds whereas 57 were sentenced to full-time imprisonment. 30 offenders received either suspended sentences or intensive correction orders.
	
	
	Sentencing statistics have a part to play in consistency in sentencing, but they do not disclose anything about why the sentences were passed, particularly the objective seriousness of the offending and the subjective features of the offender. Sentences imposed in other cases “do not mark the outer bounds of the permissible sentencing discretion. They stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence”: MLP v R [2014] NSWCCA 183 at [42].
	
	
	Making my own independent assessment, bearing in mind the legislative guideposts of the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period, the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective features of the applicant, there is no alternative to full-time imprisonment.
	
	
	The undiscounted starting point of the sentence I would impose is 5 years, which is more than the undiscounted starting point of the sentence imposed by the judge of 4 years 8 months. Furthermore, a non-parole period of less than 2 years would not appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence. As a consequence, I conclude that no lesser sentence should have been passed.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

		29 August 2016",2016-08-28 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701100,Regina v Mufiz Rahaman [2016] NSWDC 205,"Judgment


	
	Mufiz Rahaman (the offender) appears for sentence after pleading guilty before his Honour Judge Lakatos SC on 28 January 2016 to one count of sexual intercourse with a person aged between 10 and 14 years, contrary to s.66C(1) Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is 16 years imprisonment. At the time of the offence there was no standard non-parole period prescribed.
	


Facts


	
	An agreed statement of facts was tendered which can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The offender is presently 20 years old. He arrived in Australia as a refugee from Myanmar in 2012.
	
	
	The complainant and his father are also refugees from Myanmar. They arrived in Australia in 2013.
	
	
	At the time of the offence the complainant was 10 years of age. He lived with his father in shared accommodation that was formerly an RSL club (the premises). They shared a room with another adult male. The complainant and his father slept in a double bed and their roommate had his own single bed.
	
	
	The offender had previously lived at the premises, but by the time of the offence had moved out.
	
	
	On 8 January 2015 the complainant’s father woke at about 5:00am to attend a local mosque for prayers. He returned home, went back to bed and slept until about midday. He then got up, showered and went to the kitchen to prepare lunch. He left the complainant asleep in the room. Their roommate was not present.
	
	
	While the complainant’s father was out of the room, the offender entered and approached the complainant. The complainant was still in bed. The offender pulled down the complainant’s underpants. He then pulled down his own trousers and underpants. The offender then inserted his penis into the complainant’s anus.
	
	
	The complainant’s father returned from the kitchen to the room. He noticed that the door was now shut. As he approached he could hear a voice that he recognised as the offender’s coming from inside the room. He heard the offender say “I’ll give you money to do this”. He heard his son say “My dad will hit me”.
	
	
	The complainant’s father entered the room and saw the complainant lying face down on the double bed with his pants around his knees. The offender was on top of the complainant. The complainant’s father said to the offender “what are you doing to this little boy, you are an adult, what are you doing?”
	
	
	The offender got up and as he did so, the complainant’s father could see his erect penis as he pulled up his pants. The offender said “I’m not doing anything to your son”. The complainant’s father replied “I saw you doing these things to my son”. He asked the complainant “what did this man do to you”. The complainant replied “he inserted his dick in my anus”.
	
	
	The complainant’s father argued with the offender before asking him to leave. The offender then left the premises.
	
	
	A few hours later the complainant’s father telephoned his brother-in-law, Aziz Alam. Mr Alam knew the offender as they had previously lived together. Mr Alam reported the incident to the police.
	
	
	At around 7:20pm on 8 January 2015 police arrived and spoke to Mr Alam. Mr Alam showed police a photograph of the offender that was saved on his phone.
	
	
	The complainant was taken to Westmead Children’s Hospital and medically examined. Rectal and anal swabs were taken for analysis. No anal injuries were observed.
	
	
	The complainant was interviewed the police on 9 January 2015 with the assistance of an interpreter.
	
	
	On 9 January 2015 the offender was arrested and has been in custody since that time. The offender provided a buccal sample of his DNA to police.
	
	
	Semen was detected on the anal and rectal swabs taken from the victim. The DNA recovered from these swabs matched the DNA profile of the offender.
	


The offender’s case on sentence

Evidence at the hearing


	
	The offender gave evidence before me and was cross-examined on 11 August 2016 with the assistance of a Rohingyan interpreter. His evidence can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The offender was born and raised in a remote village in Myanmar, a considerable distance from the capital Yangoon. The roads in the village were made of dirt and the houses constructed from bamboo. The offender used a pit toilet and had to walk for about 15 minutes to obtain clean water. He was raised on a mainly vegetarian diet because his family could not afford to buy meat. They occasionally ate fish they caught in the river and ate beef about once per year. The offender and his family did not own a car or travel by motor transport.
	
	
	The offender is Rohingyan. He gave evidence that the Rohingyan people are a cultural minority in Myanmar who are not considered to be citizens and are often the subject of persecution of the authorities.
	
	
	The offender attended a madrassa in Myanmar where he studied the Koran and languages including Arabic, Urdu, Farsi and Hindi. He lived in the madrassa for part of his studies. When the offender was aged about 8 years, an older boy aged about 16 approached him at night and told him that if he did not have sex with him that he would kill him. The offender gave evidence that the older boy had penile anal intercourse with him on that night and that it was very painful.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence of other occasions when he was forced to have sexual intercourse with older boys in Myanmar either as a result of threats and or physical violence. He gave evidence that he did not tell anyone about these attacks because the boys would threaten to kill or beat him. As result he was afraid and gave evidence that he was ashamed.
	
	
	The offender’s brother came to Australia in about 2009. In 2012 there was civil unrest in Myanmar resulting in riots. His parents advised him to leave because they believed he could be killed if he remained in Myanmar. The offender had previously observed people from his village being taken by the police and later being returned dead to their families. To his observation young people aged between 13 and 15 years were easy targets for the police. The offender had been stopped by the police in his village and they slapped him. On other occasions, the police had come to his home and his parents had hidden him.
	
	
	The offender came to Australia from Myanmar in about 2012 as a refugee. He arrived on Christmas Island by boat. He was relocated to Darwin and then to Tasmania. He was released from immigration detention and settled in Sydney with his brother. He attended an English language school for one year before attending Bankstown High school and enrolling in year 10 for about the last 3 months of 2014.
	
	
	On 8 January 2015 the offender was living with his brother. He attended the premises to meet his friend Ibrahim to help him purchase a plane ticket to Melbourne. He arrived about 11:45am to find Ibrahim sleeping. Ibrahim told the offender that he wanted to sleep for a while longer. The offender then went to another friend’s room, Yahiya. Yahiya was not there, but the complainant was.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence that he asked the complainant jokingly “will you allow me to do the thing you did the other day with the other man?” This was a reference to the complainant having sex with another man at the premises on an earlier occasion. The offender gave evidence that the complainant replied, “yes if you want to do it, I will allow you to do it, but not in my anus just between the thighs”.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence that he did not think that what he asked was a bad thing or a crime and believed that males had sex with each other as occurred in Myanmar. The offender said that he did as the young boy requested and did not put his penis into his anus, however he accepted that he did touch his anus but did not insert his penis fully. The offender gave evidence that he was not forceful, he did not hit the complainant and he did not threaten him.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence that he would now solemnly apologise to the complainant and to his family. He said that no human being should be treated in that way.
	
	
	In about mid-July 2016 the offender was informed by his family that his brother had been taken by the police in Myanmar and had been killed. His family was told that his brother had been buried at a place and that they were not permitted to retrieve his body. The offender was informed that his brother’s organs had been removed.
	
	
	The offender has managed to remain in contact with his family in Myanmar despite being in custody. They own a mobile telephone and use a sim card from Bangladesh, which is illegal. He cannot always get through to his family because they often switch off the mobile telephone to avoid detection by the authorities. He did not have contact with his family for the first 4 to 5 months that he was in custody. After that, the longest period for which he was not in contact with his family was approximately one month.
	
	
	In cross-examination, the offender accepted that he had signed the agreed facts after he had been taken through them with the assistance of an interpreter. He accepted that he had been given legal advice prior to doing so. He accepted that the agreed facts were true. He accepted that he told Dr Chew that the agreed facts were true.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor then took the offender through the agreed statement of facts. The offender sought to dispute some of the matters set out in th agreed facts. He accepted that he did insert his penis into the complainant’s anus but said that he did not do it fully. He maintained that the complainant had consented.
	
	
	He gave evidence that he “had to sign the facts” because he had agreed that he was guilty. He said that at the time he was devastated, guilty and sorry and that his mind was not in the right place.
	
	
	He did not accept what the agreed facts stated about the involvement of the complainant’s father. He maintained that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong and said that if he thought it was wrong then he would have apologised at the time to the complainant’s father. He said that he did not deny the sexual act because he did not think it was wrong.
	
	
	He accepted that the complainant was very young, but did not exactly know how old he was. He gave evidence that he had seen the complainant have sex with an older, larger man on a prior occasion.
	
	
	After seeing and hearing the offender’s evidence I do not accept the offender’s version of events. The offender did not tell Dr Chew or the author of the Pre-Sentence Report that he had observed the complainant having sex with another man prior to the offence or that he agreed not to fully penetrate the complainant at the complainant’s request. It appears that the first time these matters were raised was when he gave evidence before me. The Crown was not in a position to lead evidence on those matters. It seems highly unlikely that the complainant’s father would not have involved the police if there had been other allegations of interference with the complainant. A number of the offender’s answers to questions in chief were volunteered and not responsive to the questions that he was asked; in particular, when he gave evidence that he was unaware that his conduct was crime in Australia and that he did not fully penetrate the complainant. The evidence that he did not fully penetrate the complainant is inconsistent with the psychical evidence. Those answers and the way that they were given lead me to the conclusion that the offender was trying to minimise his participation in the offence and was not being completely truthful. I do not accept the offender’s explanation that the content of the agreed facts was forced upon him by reason of his admission of guilt. He gave a number of contradictory answers about whether various parts of the agreed facts were true. For these reasons, where there is any dispute between the offender’s evidence and the agreed facts, I would prefer the version provided for in the agreed facts.
	


Psychological report of Dr Gerald Chew


	
	The court received a psychiatric report of Dr Chew dated 1 March 2016. Dr Chew was present in court, gave evidence and was cross-examined. The report can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The offender is a single, 20 year old man with no dependent children. Prior to his incarceration he was residing in the Lakemba area. The offender told Dr Chew that he had been in Australia since 2012 and had spent one year in immigration detention before residing in the community on a bridging visa. The offender told Dr Chew that it was his understanding that the bridging visa had been cancelled. The offender told Dr Chew that he was “stateless” and could not return to persecution in Myanmar. He had been receiving Centrelink benefits.
	
	
	The offender gave a history of significant sexual abuse as a child between the ages of 8 and 14. He told Dr Chew that young males aged about 20 would force him to have anal and oral intercourse with them. He suffered regular physical beatings from the older children in the village to the point where he feared for his life.
	
	
	The offender reported to Dr Chew that his mood had been depressed for at least a year, becoming worse since his entry into custody. The offender slept poorly, woke early of a morning and had poor concentration. The offender stated that he often felt hopeless about the future, that he had ruined his life and that he contemplated thoughts of guilt regarding his offence on a daily basis.
	
	
	The offender told Dr Chew that he had thought about suicide, but that he did not have a clear plan, citing the need to stay alive for his mother as a major protective factor.
	
	
	Dr Chew diagnosed the offender with major depressive disorder as well as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Dr Chew recommended antidepressant medication and cultural and language appropriate psychological therapy. Dr Chew referred the offender for further treatment by Justice Health and the Forensic Mental Health Network. Dr Chew noted that the offender requires ongoing treatment for his sexual offending, considering the offender’s lack of prior criminal history as a very good prognostic factor.
	
	
	Dr Chew opined that the fact that the offender had been informed about what happened to his brother was likely to exacerbate his PTSD, although he had not examined him after he was told. Dr Chew did not believe the offender was depressed at the time of the offence and that his depression was linked to his incarceration. Dr Chew did not believe that there was a causal connection between his mental condition and the offending conduct. It was more likely that the cultural acceptance of sexual abuse in Myanmar led to the offence. Dr Chew described this as part of the offender’s psychological schema; that he had adjusted to the world by reference to his experience of it. At some level he understood that what he was doing was wrong, but his actions were guided by his experience.
	


Department of Corrective Services Case Note


	
	A case note was prepared by Mr Andrew Reddon, psychologist, of the Department of Corrective Serviced. I will not repeat matters already referred to in Dr Chew’s report.
	
	
	The psychologist assessed the offender as a moderate to high risk of re-offending. The psychologist opined that the offender displayed little insight into the need for treatment and management of his offending behaviour.
	
	
	The psychologist suggested that further education in the English language and other basic facets of schooling would benefit the offender. He also suggested that access be given to the offender to sexual offending programs within the Corrective Services system should he be sentenced to full-time custody of 2 or more years. He noted that the waiting list for inclusion in such programs is quite lengthy.
	
	
	He indicated that the offender would benefit from community based supervision and continued psychological counselling to address his level of risk and to develop a risk management plan.
	


Pre-sentence report (PSR)


	
	The Court received a Pre-Sentence Report dated 9 March 2016.
	
	
	The offender gave the author of the PSR a history consistent with the prior reports which I will not repeat.
	
	
	The author of the PSR assessed the offender as a medium risk level of re-offending. The author acknowledged the offender’s difficulties with the English language, his low level of education, the fact that this is the first time the offender has been in custody, his isolation and his lack of support and family contact, in addition to the matters identified by Dr Chew and the psychologist.
	
	
	The offender has been placed in protective custody. He has had one minor assault charge whilst in custody.
	
	
	The offender’s bridging visa has been cancelled. The offender had a lack of insight into his actions, normalising them as culturally acceptable to excuse his offending behaviour. The offender maintained that the complainant consented and was a willing participant.
	


Consideration


	
	I must have regard to the objects of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as set out in section 3 and the purposes of sentencing set out in section 3A, together with the aggravating and mitigating factors provided for in section 21A, such as are established by the evidence to the requisite standard of proof.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	The courts take an extremely serious view to matters of this kind. The most significant factor that determines the objective seriousness of the offence is the extent to which the offender exploited the youth of the victim: R v Sea unreported NSWCCA 13 August 1980 per Badgery-Parker J. It is generally considered that the younger the victim the more serious the offence: R v KNL (2005) A Crim R 268 at [42].
	
	
	The victim in this matter was 10 years of age. The complainant was vulnerable by reason of his age. The victim did not consent and believed that he would get in trouble with his father. The offender was 19 years of age.
	
	
	The nature and extent of the sexual intercourse was significant. The penile penetration of a young child’s anus is of significant gravity. Semen belonging to the offender was detected in both the anal and rectal smears taken from the complainant.
	
	
	The offence was opportunistic and not did not involve any planning, coercion or grooming of the victim. The offence is above the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	


Deterrence


	
	The abhorrence with which the community regards the sexual molestation of young children and the emphasis attached to general deterrence in sentencing offenders is reflected in the judgment in R v BJW (2000) 112 A Crim R 1 at [20] where Sheller JA stated
	
	
	the maximum penalties the legislature has set for child sexual assault offences reflects community abhorrence of and concern about adult sexual abuse of children. General deterrence is of great importance in sentencing such offenders and especially so when the offender is in a position of trust to the victim.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal has stated that that heavy custodial sentences are essential if the courts are to play their proper role in protecting young people from sexual attacks by adults: see R v Fisher (1989) 40 A Crim R 442 at 445.
	
	
	General deterrence may be attributed less weight in cases where the offender suffers from mental condition because such an offender is not an appropriate person to be made an example of: Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [53]-[54]. The authorities do not mandate an entire disregard of general or specific deterrence by the sentencing judge. The extent of the reduction depends on the circumstances of the case: Palijan v R [2010] NSWCCA 142 at [27], R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81, R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 and R v Lawrence [2005] NSWCCA 91.
	
	
	The factors that are relevant to the assessment include the nature and extent of the mental condition suffered, the causal connection between the mental condition and the offending conduct, whether the offender acted with knowledge of what they were doing and the gravity of their actions, and whether the community requires protection from the offender by reason of the mental condition suffered.
	
	
	The offender has been diagnosed as suffering from PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder. The PTSD arose as a result of being physically and sexually abused as a child and as a result of witnessing other violent acts including killings. His major depressive disorder seems to have developed whilst he has been in gaol. There does not appear to be a causal connection between the offender’s PTSD and the commission of the offence. Rather, the cultural acceptance of such behaviour was the causal factor. I accept that his mental condition will make his time in prison more difficult.
	
	
	I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender did not understand that his actions were wrong. Even if I was, it would not significantly reduce the need for general deterrence in this matter because the courts have a role to play by sending a clear message that these types of offences will attract substantial punishment irrespective of the offender’s cultural background: R v Reynolds NSWCCA unreported 7 December 1998.
	
	
	As a victim of child sexual assault himself, the offender knew that the offending conduct was likely to cause the complainant pain, distress, humiliation and shame. However, counsel for the offender submitted and I accept that the community from which the offender came had a demonstrated lack of proper morality. In all of the circumstances the moral culpability of the offender was slightly reduced.
	
	
	There is a need for specific deterrence in the present case. The offence appears to have been committed as a result of it being culturally acceptable conduct in the offender’s childhood. The offender has shown little insight into his offending behaviour. He has been assessed as being a medium to high risk of reoffending. It is therefore necessary for the punishment imposed to deter him from such conduct in the future.
	


Aggravating factors


	
	The offence was committed in the victim’s home: section 21A(2)(eb) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Mitigating factors


	
	The offender has no prior convictions: section 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The offender was a person of good character: section 21A(3)(f) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The offender contended that I could be satisfied that he had demonstrated remorse sufficient to establish the mitigating factor provided for by section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In order to make that finding I would have to satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender accepted responsibility for his actions. In his history given to Dr Chew and to the author of the pre-sentence report the offender maintained that he did not believe that what he did was a crime and that it was culturally acceptable in Myanmar. In his evidence before me he expressed an apology. At no time, other than in cross-examination, did he grapple with the plain fact that the offence was likely to physically injure and psychologically affect the complainant. I am unable to find on the balance of probabilities that the offender has accepted responsibility for his actions and accordingly I do not find the mitigating factor established. I accept that the offender now has a better understanding of the laws applicable in Australia and that he has learnt a difficult lesson by reason of his actions.
	
	
	The offender entered a plea of guilty at a time when his trial was listed before Judge Lakatos SC: sections 21A(3)(k) and 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The appellant is entitled to a discount on penalty that reflects the utilitarian value of that plea. The extent of the discount should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25%, but that is only a guide. The primary consideration in determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount: R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]. The plea also indicates remorse: Borkowski at [32]. The appropriate discount is one of 10%.
	
	
	I have considered the circumstances of the offender’s upbringing and his life before coming to Australia. He was subjected to physical and sexual abuse as a child. He grew up in poverty with little or no education or employment opportunities. He was persecuted as Muslim member of a minority group in Myanmar. The offender’s deprived background is a matter that should be considered as a matter that mitigates the sentence imposed: Bugmy v R (2013) 249 CLR 571.
	


Penalty


	
	I have considered section 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and I am satisfied that having considered all possible alternatives that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.
	
	
	The appropriate term of imprisonment is one of 5 years and 6 months that will be discounted by 10% to reflect the plea of guilty.
	
	
	I find that there are special circumstances. It is the offender’s first time in custody, he speaks very little English and has only one brother in Australia. He is unlikely to be able to access any educational or rehabilitation courses in custody because of his lack of English and the fact that he belongs to a minority group.
	
	
	The offender is convicted.
	
	
	The offender is sentenced to 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months to date from 9 January 2015.
	
	
	The offender will be eligible to be released on parole on 8 May 2018.

		07 September 2016",2016-08-30 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2701112,R v Hetherington [2016] NSWCCA 165,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Button J and the orders which he proposes.
	
	
	BUTTON J: This is a Crown appeal against a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Williams in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney on 6 May 2016. The charge of which Mr Paul Hetherington (the respondent) was convicted was that on 17 July 2014 at Blacktown he committed a robbery armed with a dangerous weapon; namely, a firearm. The sentence imposed was an intensive correction order (ICO) of 2 years to commence on 6 May 2016.
	
	
	The offence of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon appears in s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years, and no standard non-parole period. It is, of course, an aggravated version of the offence of armed robbery that appears in s 97(1) of the Crimes Act (which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years). That offence is in turn an aggravated version of the offence of robbery simpliciter (which is contained in s 94 of the Crimes Act, and carries a maximum term of imprisonment for 14 years).
	


Objective features


	
	The following matters were undisputed, both at first instance and before us.
	
	
	At about 3.30 PM on 17 July 2014, the respondent entered a short term loans office in the Sydney suburb of Blacktown. He was alone. Concealed under a high visibility vest was an unloaded semi-automatic .22 pistol in working order.
	
	
	The respondent produced the pistol, and demanded $5,000 cash. He pointed the pistol at a staff member, who was put in fear and called out to another staff member, who came to the teller area from the rear office. The respondent then made an implicit threat, saying “Don’t call anyone, or press any buttons”. The staff offered no resistance, and promptly provided him with the sum of $7,500 contained in a cloth bag.
	
	
	The respondent ran off, and staff immediately raised the alarm. Police attended, the respondent was located, and, after a short chase on foot, he was apprehended. In response to the police asking where the pistol was, the respondent said “It’s in the bag, it’s got no bullets, I did it, I did it, you got me”. Police duly located the pistol and the cash, and arrested and charged the respondent.
	
	
	As can be seen from the above, the actions of the respondent were unsophisticated: he did not make use of gloves to protect against scientific inculpation, or even a getaway car.
	


Subjective features


	
	The respondent pleaded guilty to the offence in the Local Court at Penrith. He received a discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of that plea as a result.
	
	
	Separately, his Honour accepted that the respondent was remorseful for what he had done, and that the respondent had good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The respondent was aged 58 at the time of the offence, and 60 at the time of the imposition of sentence.
	
	
	He had endured a very troubled childhood, which featured him living in a number of foster homes. As a child, he had been subject to physical abuse while in the temporary care of a foster parent.
	
	
	At the time of the offence, he was living with his romantic partner, her daughter (his step-daughter) and their 22-year-old daughter. He was in a stable relationship, with a settled home life. Although his partner was receiving a disability pension at the time, the respondent was working full-time. Indeed, very impressive work references were placed before the learned sentencing judge. As well as that, although his employer was well aware of the commission of this serious offence, the respondent was so highly thought of that his employment had not been terminated between the revelation of the offence and the date of imposition of sentence.
	
	
	The respondent placed remarkable evidence on oath before his Honour as to how the offence came to be committed. His position was that he had been using cannabis for many years, without the knowledge of those who were close to him or his employer. Not only that, he had been obtaining that prohibited drug on credit from a supplier for literally 20 years. Eventually, the debt needed to be repaid, and the respondent took out a loan from a financial institution to permit him to do so. With interest, that loan ballooned to the point where it became the sum of $19,000. The offence was committed in order to repay some at least of that loan.
	
	
	As for the pistol, the evidence of the respondent was that he had simply found it contained in a bag lying in a park while walking home after work. Rather than providing it to the police, or getting rid of it, he kept it in his possession for three weeks before the offence, for reasons that were unexplained. At some stage he inspected it, and was quite aware that it was unloaded when he used it to commit the armed robbery.
	
	
	I interpolate that I regard the versions of events of the respondent about receiving a prohibited drug on credit for 20 years and finding a pistol (a valuable piece of contraband) in a park and keeping it for no good reason as bordering on the preposterous. However, because they were accepted by the learned sentencing judge, and no ground of the Crown appeal impugns that acceptance, I would determine the appeal on the assumption that they are true.
	
	
	In the weeks and months before the commission of the offence, the respondent had been diagnosed as suffering from depression; indeed, he was for a time suicidal. Although he had been taking medication to deal with that illness, his position was that his prescription had run out and he had not got around to refilling it. For a period of time, therefore, before the commission of the offence, he was unmedicated. The respondent gave evidence before his Honour that his mind was “all over the place” before the incident.
	
	
	As for his physical health, as I have said, the respondent is not a young man and had previously suffered from a drinking problem. As well as that, due to an assault some years ago, he had suffered from complete deafness in one ear and 40% loss of hearing in the other ear for quite some time, and the condition will not improve.
	
	
	The partner of the respondent gave evidence before his Honour of how upset and angry she had been with him for what he had done, but that she was prepared to continue to support him.
	
	
	Subsequent to the offence, the respondent had declared bankruptcy and ceased the use of cannabis. He had not committed any offences between the date of the armed robbery and the date of the imposition of sentence.
	
	
	As for the criminal record of the respondent, it was not unblemished. 45 years ago he had been placed on probation for stealing by the Children’s Court. Throughout the 1970s, he was imprisoned for very short periods for a number of offences of dishonesty. In the 1980s, he was placed on a bond for possessing and using prohibited drugs. On two occasions in 1989, he had been fined for less serious offences.
	
	
	In other words, this mature man had not intersected with the criminal justice system for a period approaching 30 years when he committed this serious offence. Not only that, much of his previous offending had been well towards the less serious end of the spectrum.
	


Procedural history


	
	As I have said, the respondent admitted his guilt immediately to police on his arrest on 17 July 2014. He also made a series of full admissions in a recorded interview with police.
	
	
	The respondent was granted bail by police on the day of his arrest, and was still on bail when sentenced.
	
	
	He pleaded guilty in the Local Court at Penrith on 17 April 2015, and the matter was committed to the District Court for sentence. It was adjourned more than once before the proceedings on sentence commenced.
	
	
	The matter first came before his Honour on 10 February 2016. On that occasion, all evidence was received, and submissions were made by both parties. The prosecutor made it reasonably clear that anything other than full-time imprisonment was opposed by the Crown. His Honour gave detailed reasons for the decision to refer the respondent for assessment of his suitability for an ICO. For convenience, I shall refer to those reasons as the “first remarks on sentence”.
	
	
	When the matter came before his Honour again on 6 May 2016, the respondent had been found to be suitable for an ICO. The prosecutor restated his opposition to the proposed sentence, and this time made it clear that, in his submission, the imposition of an ICO would constitute appellable error. His Honour imposed the sentence under appeal on the same date, and gave brief reasons for doing so. For convenience I shall refer to those reasons as the “second remarks on sentence”.
	
	
	The respondent commenced to be subject to the ICO on 6 May 2016, and has been progressing well with regard to it.
	
	
	The Crown notice of appeal against sentence was served on 19 May 2016, relying at that stage upon the single ground of manifest inadequacy.
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	The following grounds were notified and pressed by the Crown at the hearing of the appeal:
	


Ground 1: The learned sentencing judge erred in finding that the objective gravity of the offence was at “the lowest end of the range of seriousness”.

Ground 2: The learned sentencing judge erred in his use of sentencing statistics.

Ground 3: The learned sentencing judge erred in treating other cases as being ‘comparable’ to the present case.

Ground 4: It was not open to the learned sentencing judge to find exceptional circumstances.

Ground 5: The sentence pronounced was manifestly inadequate.


	
	It is convenient to deal with the grounds in the order in which they appear above.
	


Ground 1


	
	This ground was founded upon the following portions of the first remarks on sentence:
	


It is, of course, objectively more serious to use a firearm than a knife because fear is instilled into the victims of the robbery but as [the advocate for the respondent] points out, the firearm was not loaded, there were no bullets found and even though the fact that it is a firearm, attracts the higher penalty under s 97(2). In many cases, the use of a knife can have many devastating consequences. The offence, I find, is towards the lower end of the range of objective seriousness for this type of offence, notwithstanding the significant amount of money of $7,500 that was involved (First Remarks on Sentence at 9).

…

I have taken into account his [that is, the advocate for the respondent] citation from what Justice Maxwell said in Redman [sic] that robberies can be viewed in escalating seriousness of carrying a firearm, of a firearm being loaded, of the loaded firearm being discharged and of the discharge being deliberately aimed at a victim or important target so that this case is at the lowest end of that escalating spectrum and the lowest end of the range of seriousness (First Remarks on Sentence at 10).


	
	The Crown submission in this Court may be very concisely stated. It was simply that it cannot be the case that an armed robbery with a dangerous weapon that is a pistol and that involves the offender gaining $7,500 (albeit very briefly) can be characterised as being at the lower end or lowest end of the range of objective seriousness of offences of this kind.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent made a number of submissions in response to that submission.
	
	
	She submitted that, objectively speaking, an unloaded firearm is indeed incapable of inflicting serious physical harm. In that sense, there was no error in his Honour drawing a contrast between a knife (which, at all times, has the potential to cause death) and a firearm (which, if unloaded, cannot cause death or serious injury).
	
	
	She submitted that the crime, although not entirely spontaneous, was hardly premeditated. She submitted that there was indeed a substantial sum taken; on the other hand, it was retained very briefly by the respondent, as a result of his thoroughly amateurish modus operandi.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent also submitted that the use of the phrase “lowest end” as opposed to “lower end” was a mere infelicity, and that the Crown had conceded at first instance that the more favourable of the assessments was open to the evaluative judgment of the sentencing judge.
	
	
	Turning to my determination of this ground, I approach the ground on the basis that the reference to “lowest end of the range of seriousness” was a restatement of the submission of the advocate for the respondent, not a characterisation by his Honour. For that reason, I shall approach the ground on the basis that his Honour characterised the offence as being “towards the lower end of the range of objective seriousness for this type of offence”.
	
	
	Separately, I fully accept that the characterisation of the objective seriousness of an offence is very much vouchsafed to a sentencing judge, and that this Court is notoriously slow to overturn such findings: see Mulato v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37], [46]. Nevertheless, having sounded that loud note of reticence, I cannot accept that this offence was able to be characterised as being at the lower end of the spectrum of objective seriousness. That is so for five reasons.
	
	
	First, a pistol in working order was used to effect the armed robbery. It is useful to analyse the breadth of the items that fall within the definition of a dangerous weapon for the purposes of an offence contained in s 97(2) of the Crimes Act. 
	
	
	The definition is set out in s 4 of the Crimes Act. That definition includes a “firearm” or “imitation firearm” as defined in the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW), which leads one to the definitions to be found in s 4 and s 4D of the Firearms Act. Those definitions include air guns and items that substantially duplicate the appearance of a firearm without being a toy.
	
	
	The definition in the Crimes Act also includes a “prohibited weapon”, as defined by the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW). That further definition is to be found in s 4 of that Act, and includes all items contained in Sch 1 of that Act. As a result, the term “dangerous weapon” includes such things as slingshots, nunchaku, side-handled batons, and certain kinds of knives such as flick knives.
	
	
	Finally, the definition in the Crimes Act includes spear guns.
	
	
	Bearing in mind the breadth of implements that fall within the definition of a dangerous weapon, I cannot accept that an armed robbery effected by way of the presentation of a real pistol, even if unloaded, can be characterised as falling at the lower end of the spectrum of such offences.
	
	
	Secondly, it is true that the presentation of an unloaded pistol does not of itself give rise to a risk of physical harm (unless, perhaps, it is used as a club, or its presentation induces a heart attack, or injury while the victim retreats or flees). But it almost always gives rise to a fear of death on the part of any victim. I cannot accept that an offence that features that attribute can be characterised as being at the lower end of the objective spectrum.
	
	
	Thirdly, the offence was targeted, in the sense that the respondent chose to commit it upon premises that he (correctly) inferred would have a large sum of cash present. The sum taken, albeit fully recovered by police, was very substantial. A marked contrast can be drawn between those proceeds, and the paltry sums of cash that are often obtained by desperate drug addicts who commit armed robberies upon places such as newsagents, service stations, and the like.
	
	
	Fourthly, his Honour referred to the decision of this Court in R v Readman (1990) 47 A Crim R 181 when describing in the first remarks on sentence the submission of the advocate for the respondent that the offence was at the “lowest end of the range of seriousness”. In that case, it was said at p 185:
	


In the present case the gun the respondent used was loaded. As to this, this Court indicated in Dicker (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 3 July 1980) that robberies can be viewed in escalating seriousness of carrying a firearm, of a firearm being loaded, of the loaded firearm being discharged, and of discharge being deliberately aimed at a victim or important target.


	
	So much is uncontroversial. But I respectfully think that that analysis tells one, in a general way, where an offence sits in terms of objective seriousness when one considers a large range of offences, up to and including murder. It tells one little or nothing about where an offence of armed robbery with a pistol sits within a range of seriousness of the particular offence of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon.
	
	
	Fifthly and finally, events in foreign countries that, unlike Australia, have not set their face against the possession of pistols by members of the community, demonstrate the thoroughly pernicious effect that widespread possession and use of such items can have. For that reason, speaking very generally, it is very hard to accept that any criminal offence that features the presentation of a pistol can be characterised as towards the lower end of objective seriousness of examples of that offence.
	
	
	In short, for five reasons I consider that it was not open to the evaluative judgement of the sentencing judge to characterise this offence as being at the lower end of the range of objective seriousness of offences committed against s 97(2) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	I consider that ground 1 should be upheld.
	


Grounds 2 and 3


	
	For convenience, I repeat grounds 2 and 3:
	


Ground 2: The learned sentencing judge erred in his use of sentencing statistics.

Ground 3: The learned sentencing judge erred in treating other cases as being ‘comparable’ to the present case.


	
	It is convenient to deal with these two grounds together, because each of them focuses upon the way in which his Honour dealt with legal materials with which he had been provided by the parties.
	
	
	In support of these grounds, the Crown has undertaken a detailed analysis of the statistics from the Judicial Commission of New South Wales that were placed before his Honour, and the comparative cases with which his Honour was provided. It was said that one can infer from what was said in the first and second remarks on sentence that his Honour misunderstood or mistook those materials. For example, it was said that, when his Honour said in the first remarks on sentence “I have taken into account a range of statistics which [the advocate for the respondent] helpfully isolated for offenders over 50 in relation to s 97(1) offences demonstrating that some eight per cent of the cases received a non-custodial sentence out of a fairly significant range”, his Honour misunderstood that the position is quite different in relation to the greater offence actually committed by the respondent contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	It was also said that references were made by his Honour to “comparable” cases that resulted in a sentence that was not one of full-time imprisonment. The Crown submitted that those cases show that, in compelling and unusual circumstances, a merciful sentence can be granted, and that those circumstances are not present in this case. The Crown further submitted that those cases were significantly different to the present case. Finally, the Crown relied on the authority of Bao v R [2016] NSWCCA 16 at [70] to support the proposition that “it is impermissible to reason by reference to the result of a limited number of cases that do not form a comparable range of sentences”.
	
	
	Turning to my determination of these grounds, in light of my determination of the first ground and the fourth and fifth grounds, I shall not deal with them at any length.
	
	
	Suffice to say, I think that this Court should be slow to engage in a punctilious analysis of the approach taken by sentencing judges to the materials with which they are provided. It is clear from the combined force of the two remarks on sentence that his Honour was well aware that exceptional circumstances would need to be established by the respondent in order for him to avoid a period of full-time imprisonment. His Honour clearly found that that “onus” had indeed been discharged (of course, that finding is impugned by a separate ground of appeal).
	
	
	I am not persuaded, as a discrete ground, that his Honour somehow separately misunderstood the meaning of the statistics, or somehow misinterpreted the authorities with which the parties provided him. To the contrary, I respectfully think that his Honour was well aware of the analysis that needed to be undertaken, and the evaluative judgments to which he would need to come, before declining to impose a sentence of full-time imprisonment.
	
	
	In short, because I do not believe that his Honour misapprehended the evaluations that confronted him, I would not uphold grounds 2 and 3.
	


Ground 4


	
	Ground 4 is as follows:
	


Ground 4: It was not open to the learned sentencing judge to find exceptional circumstances.


	
	As I have said, his Honour was well aware that it was a practical precondition to declining to sentence the respondent to a substantial period of full-time imprisonment that the matter be characterised as exceptional. His Honour found that the combination of objective and subjective features led to that precondition being fulfilled.
	
	
	Again, to recount the submission of the Crown before us concisely, it was simply that, although this matter has its unusual and sad features, it was not open to his Honour to characterise the matter as exceptional.
	
	
	In this Court, counsel for the respondent placed great weight on the mental condition of the respondent at the time of the offences, and the fact that this was an isolated event. She submitted that the unmedicated and unresolved depression of the respondent, featuring as it did suicidal ideation, played the well-established role of meaning that the respondent was a less appropriate instrument for expressions of general and personal deterrence. She submitted that the finding by his Honour in relation to deterrence was not the basis of a ground of appeal. Minds may legitimately differ about the characterisation by his Honour of the matter as being exceptional; but, she submitted, that characterisation was open, and accordingly should not be disturbed on appeal.
	
	
	Further, she submitted that the sentencing judge had correctly adopted the approach to exceptional circumstances identified by Simpson J in EF v R [2015] NSWCCA 36, and used s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) as a starting point, in considering whether an ICO was an appropriate sentencing option.
	
	
	Finally, counsel for the respondent made it clear that she was relying upon the combined force of all of the objective and subjective features to submit that the finding about exceptional circumstances was open to his Honour.
	
	
	Turning to my determination of this ground, it is true that the respondent was suffering from depression for which he was not medicated. And it is also true that that played a role in mitigating his offending and reducing the importance of both forms of deterrence. But the fact is that the respondent was working full-time; indeed, as the references showed, he was capable of discharging his duties very well. As well as that, the decision to target a financial institution had a distinct flavour of rationality about it. So did hiding the pistol under a piece of clothing until its presentation. So did, of course, the fact that the respondent sought to escape from police as they were trying to apprehend him. And so did his immediate (and truthful) exculpatory statement that the pistol was not loaded.
	
	
	Seen as a whole, there is no doubt that this matter has its strange and sad aspects. But it can also readily be recast as simply an example of a drug dependent person, suffering from emotional problems, and not having intersected with the criminal justice system for many years, committing an armed robbery with a pistol, in an attempt to pay off a significant debt arising from that dependence. Regrettably, such circumstances are hardly exceptional.
	
	
	To my mind, this matter had its noteworthy, even odd features. But I respectfully consider that it was not open to the evaluative judgment of his Honour to characterise the matter as exceptional.
	
	
	Accordingly, I consider that ground 4 should be upheld.
	


Ground 5


	
	Ground 5 is as follows:
	


Ground 5: The sentence pronounced was manifestly inadequate.


	
	Yet again, the submission of the Crown may be shortly stated. It was that the sentence imposed simply fails to reflect all of the relevant objective and subjective features of the matter, and that the sentence is unreasonable and plainly unjust.
	
	
	Reliance was placed by the Crown on the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346, without, of course, it being said that that guideline provided some sort of mandatory prescription with regard to sentencing for armed robbery.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, when one considers the five factors enumerated in that judgment, one sees that the factors present in the case of the respondent were either equal to, or more aggravated than, those attaching to the putative offender who would receive a head sentence of imprisonment in the order of 4 to 5 years (admittedly after a late plea). And yet, here, not only was a head sentence of 2 years countenanced, but it was to be served without any period of full-time imprisonment whatsoever. In a nutshell, the Crown analysis was that the respondent was in a worse position than the hypothetical offender considered in R v Henry.
	
	
	It was also emphasised that the guideline judgment in that case was for the lesser offence under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act, as distinct from s 97(2) of the Crimes Act, which was the offence committed by the respondent.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent submitted that the sentencing judge had the benefit of assessing the credibility and vulnerability of the respondent in the witness box. She submitted that the respondent was depressed, unmedicated, and suicidal at the time of the commission of the offence. She submitted that this Court ought to be mindful of the sensitive discretionary decision of the sentencing judge.
	
	
	She submitted that it was relevant that the Crown had not demonstrated that this matter calls for the “guidance and governance” of this Court necessary for a successful Crown appeal, and that the sentence imposed does not have any precedential value.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent also submitted that the case was indeed comparable to the guideline judgment of R v Henry, and that it was actually less serious in some ways, in that the respondent produced an unloaded pistol that was not capable of doing physical harm.
	
	
	Turning to my determination of this ground, it is the case, of course, that what was said in the guideline judgment of R v Henry is just that: a guideline. It is not to play some sort of mandatory or automatic role in leading inevitably to the imprisonment of persons once a number of “boxes are ticked”. Nor is it to play such a role with regard to the length of sentences of full-time imprisonment that may be imposed for armed robbery and related offences.
	
	
	Separately, of course, it is well-known that the guideline judgment is founded upon a late plea; here, a 25% discount was applied in recognition of a plea being entered in the Local Court.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the maximum penalty for this offence was imprisonment for 25 years, not 20 years as in the guideline judgment. It is noteworthy that there is no greater maximum penalty for an offence in New South Wales other than life without possibility of parole.
	
	
	Furthermore, the offence featured presentation of a pistol; although unloaded, such offences must surely be denounced and deterred. The offence was not at the lower end of the objective range of offences committed against the section. Nor did the combination of objective and subjective features mean that the matter was exceptional.
	
	
	Finally, the guideline judgment posits a young offender with little or no criminal history; the use of a weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; a limited degree of planning; limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof; a victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver; a small amount taken; and a plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case. In those circumstances, the guideline judgment speaks of a head sentence of imprisonment of between 4 and 5 years.
	
	
	Here, the respondent was not a young offender (though he is an older man who suffers from a serious physical deficit). He had little criminal history. The weapon was incapable of causing harm, but could instil fear of death and was inherently egregiously anti-social. There was a limited degree of planning. There was no actual violence, but a threat of it. The victims were vulnerable. A large amount was taken (albeit for a brief period). There was an early plea as opposed to a later one. Finally, the respondent was to be sentenced for a more serious offence than that discussed in R v Henry.
	
	
	That thumbnail comparison very powerfully suggests that the sentence actually imposed by his Honour of an ICO for two years was not available to the sentencing discretion reposed in him.
	
	
	I respectfully think that this ground has been made out. In all the circumstances, I consider that the sentence imposed was unreasonable, and plainly unjust.
	


Discretion not to intervene


	
	It is now well-established that, even if error is established in a Crown appeal, it is incumbent upon the Crown to establish that this Court should not exercise its discretion not to intervene. To express that more comprehensibly, the Crown must affirmatively demonstrate that this Court should resentence.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent read a number of affidavits with regard to the questions of discretion and any re-sentence. She submitted that it would have been open to the Crown, even before sentence had been imposed, to seek judicial review of the decision to have the respondent assessed for his suitability for an ICO (that is, after the delivery of the first remarks on sentence). She also submitted that there had been something of a shift in the position of the Crown between the time of the first remarks on sentence and the second. She emphasised that the point of Crown appeals is to correct errors of principle; except in truly egregious cases, it is not to correct errors in outcome.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent invited our attention to the difficult life of the respondent, both now and in the past, and the hardships that would be occasioned to him and others if he were imprisoned now, after all that has happened. She also invited our attention to the distress and uncertainty that has been caused to the respondent as a result of the procedural history of the matter. Finally, she submitted that he is progressing well with regard to the ICO, and that progress should not be interrupted.
	
	
	Turning to my determination of this question, I accept the force of the submissions of counsel for the respondent that he remains in full-time employment, that there has been no further trouble since the incident, that the respondent has been progressing well whilst subject to the ICO, and that he is regularly seeing a psychologist.
	
	
	However, I do not accept that it was in any sense incumbent upon the Crown to commence proceedings for judicial review in the New South Wales Court of Appeal when his Honour referred the respondent for assessment. Even assuming (for the sake of argument only) that such proceedings may have succeeded, I would regard such a step as unnecessary and burdensome, in light of the fact that the respondent may have been assessed as unsuitable, and the ready availability of a statutory remedy in the form of a Crown appeal. The fact that it was not undertaken does not tell in favour of the respondent with regard to the discretion not to intervene.
	
	
	Nor does the position adopted by the Crown before the first remarks on sentence and the second remarks on sentence argue in that way. Although it is true that its opposition may have intensified as things proceeded, I think that at all times the Crown made it clear that it opposed what his Honour was proposing; by the time of the second remarks on sentence that preceded the actual imposition of sentence, the Crown had made its position crystal clear.
	
	
	Thirdly, it is true that Crown appeals are about correction of errors of principle. But there comes a point where an error with regard to disposition inherently demonstrates such an error, to the point at which it requires correction.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, not least of which is what I respectfully think is the clear wrongfulness of this sentencing outcome, I consider that the Crown has established that this Court should intervene and re-sentence.
	


Re-sentence


	
	A number of matters should be briefly noted.
	
	
	First, I consider that no sentence other than full-time imprisonment is appropriate in this matter.
	
	
	Secondly, I consider that the respondent should have full credit for the time he has spent subject to the ICO. Accordingly, the sentence I propose would commence on 6 May 2016.
	
	
	Thirdly, the discount of 25% should, of course, be maintained.
	
	
	Fourthly, in resentencing I take into account the distress and uncertainty that has been occasioned to the respondent and those close to him by this very unfortunate procedural history.
	
	
	Fifthly, in light of that history and the unusual objective and subjective aspects of the matter, I think that the sentence imposed should be well towards the more lenient end of the spectrum of sentences imposed for offences of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon that is a pistol.
	
	
	Sixthly, I would readily find special circumstances in this case, based upon the need for the respondent to be assisted in his reintegration into the community after his release; the difficulty that imprisonment with much younger men will occasion to a hearing-impaired older man; and the fact that, for several decades, the respondent overcame very considerable difficulties in his background to lead a hardworking and law-abiding life.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I consider that the respondent should be re-sentenced to a head sentence of 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months. In accordance with s 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the respondent will be released to parole upon the expiry of his non-parole period.
	


Orders


	
	For the foregoing reasons, I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	The sentence imposed in the District Court on 6 May 2016 is quashed.
	
	
	The respondent, Paul Hetherington, is sentenced to a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months to date from 6 May 2016. That will be followed by a parole period of 1 year and 6 months, which will expire on 5 May 2019.
	



	
	The date upon which the respondent will be released to parole is 5 November 2017.
	
	
	To express my proposed orders another way, I would impose a head sentence of imprisonment of 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months to date from the commencement of the quashed ICO.
	
	
	N ADAMS J: I agree with Button J.

		31 August 2016",2016-08-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701116,AK v R [2016] NSWCCA 175,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I have read the first draft judgment of Adams J and am grateful for his Honour’s review of the evidence and issues in the trial. I have also read his Honour’s further draft judgment. Regrettably, however, I am unable to agree with his Honour’s conclusion. There is nothing in his Honour’s further draft judgment which would lead me to change my judgment.
	
	
	The issue on appeal is the admissibility of expert evidence from a gynaecologist to the effect that it was unlikely that the complainant was pregnant in late 2011. It was not the Crown case that the complainant was pregnant or miscarried, or believed at the time of the heavy bleeding, that she was pregnant or miscarried. The complainant’s evidence was that when she gave a recorded interview in October 2012, and recounted an episode of heavy menstrual bleeding in late 2011, she wondered retrospectively whether the bleeding might have been a miscarriage.
	
	
	Second-hand hearsay evidence was led from Detective Jelsma that the complainant’s mother told her (in September 2012) that the complainant had told her mother the previous week that she had been pregnant in late 2011, that the appellant knew of the pregnancy and that he aborted the baby. Detective Jelsma’s account was denied by the complainant. The complainant’s mother said that she could not remember saying any such thing to Detective Jelsma. The evidence of Detective Jelsma was admitted as relevant only to the credit of the complainant and her mother. It was not admitted as evidence of the truth of the representation and the jury were so directed.
	
	
	The evidence of an incident where particularly heavy bleeding occurred (which was part of the recorded interview, MFI 9) was only led by the Crown at the request of the defence. It was defence counsel in cross-examination who introduced the word “foetus” and expressly cross-examined the complainant on the basis that she had told her mother that she had had a miscarriage (which was not her evidence nor that of her mother but that of Detective Jelsma). It is clear from that cross-examination of the complainant (T.130.19) that she adhered to her account in the recorded interview, MFI 9, and that she was referring to the “black lumpy blood” which she described cleaning up.
	
	
	Adams J in his judgment expressed some scepticism about the evidence of the complainant’s mother that she did not recall telling Detective Jelsma that which had been attributed to her. His Honour extended that scepticism to the evidence of the complainant on that issue. While I accept his Honour’s conclusions as to Detective Jelsma and the complainant’s mother, there was nothing inherently unlikely in the evidence of the complainant on this issue.
	
	
	Detective Jelsma made a contemporaneous note of her conversation with the complainant’s mother and given the seriousness of the issue, that note is likely to be accurate. That being so, I agree that it is inherently unlikely that the complainant’s mother would not remember providing information of such significance to the detective. Accordingly, this reflects unfavourably on the credibility of the complainant’s mother. It does not necessarily follow that if the complainant’s mother gave this information to the detective that this is what she was told by the complainant. Witnesses have been known to exaggerate, particularly if they are emotionally involved and otherwise under stress, which was something Detective Jelsma commented on in relation to the complainant’s mother.
	
	
	When these matters were put to the complainant in cross-examination she explicitly denied them, i.e. she denied telling her mother that she knew she was pregnant, that she had been pregnant at the same time as her mother, that the appellant had deliberately aborted the foetus and that the appellant did anything to terminate a pregnancy (T.129.22 – T.130.15). The complainant’s protest during the course of this cross-examination that “I’m sorry I don’t know where you’re getting this from, but that’s not accurate” carries with it the ring of truth.
	
	
	Accordingly, while the evidence of Detective Jelsma was capable of impugning the complainant’s credit, as a practical matter I doubt very much whether it did.
	
	
	The resolution of this appeal really depends upon a proper understanding of what was the complainant’s evidence on the issue of a possible pregnancy. At no point in MFI 9 did the complainant say that in 2011 she thought that she was pregnant or that she had a miscarriage. She did not at any time refer to an abortion. The highest the interview went was the observation that in October 2012 she “realised it could have been something”. Her evidence as to what she thought in 2011 was:
	


“I didn’t think anything of it at the time … I didn’t think anything of it, just thought I had my period.” (MFI 9, A122, A123, A125)

At no time during her cross-examination did the complainant resile from that position.


	
	The fact in issue in the proceedings was whether the appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant as she alleged. Because the case depended almost entirely upon an acceptance of the complainant’s evidence, her credit was a fact in issue for the purpose of the determination of any question of the possible relevance of Dr Lyneham’s opinion. The only question for the trial judge was whether Dr Lyneham’s opinion could rationally affect the jury’s assessment of the complainant’s credit. I have concluded that his opinion was incapable of rationally affecting the jury’s assessment of the complainant’s credit where the only evidence from her on this issue was that in 2012 she wondered whether she might have been pregnant and miscarried in 2011.
	
	
	Dr Lyneham’s opinion was qualified. He could not rule out the possibility that the complainant had been pregnant in late 2011. All he could say was that in his opinion this was unlikely. The importance of the complainant’s evidence on this issue from the point of view of the Crown was not whether as a fact she had been pregnant or had had a miscarriage, but whether the jury would accept that in October 2012 when MFI 9 came into existence, she held a genuine belief that she may have been pregnant in late 2011. Such a belief, if genuine, was consistent with and supported her allegations that sexual intercourse with the appellant had occurred. Whether or not she had in fact been pregnant, or had in fact had a miscarriage, was irrelevant to the issue of whether she genuinely held such a belief.
	
	
	Put at its highest, the effect of Dr Lyneham’s opinion was that the complainant’s belief, as set out in MFI 9, was unfounded or had no basis in fact. It said nothing, nor could it say anything, about whether that belief was genuinely held by the complainant at the time she expressed it. Dr Lyneham’s evidence could play no part in assisting the jury in determining whether they should accept the complainant’s evidence in relation to the charged act.
	
	
	Even if one moves away from the actual detail of the complainant’s evidence on this issue, and takes into account whether the opinion of Dr Lyneham might have a potential adverse effect on the complainant’s credit, it remains irrelevant. An attack on the complainant’s credit could only rationally involve attacking her retrospective suspicion that her bleeding may have been as a result of a miscarriage. Expert opinion evidence that her suspicion was probably unfounded was irrelevant to that issue.
	
	
	It is for the above reasons that I am unable to agree with the conclusion of Adams J. The order which I propose is that the appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	ADAMS J:
	


Introduction


	
	The appellant was convicted in the District Court of 17 counts of sexual offences of various kinds on an indictment containing 20 counts. The appellant was acquitted on count 20 and the jury was unable to reach a verdict on counts 14 and 15 but he was otherwise convicted. An aggregate sentence of 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years commencing 17 April 2014 was imposed. The offences were allegedly committed against the appellant’s step-daughter between October 2008 and May 2012 when she was between 12 and 15 years of age. A number of the counts alleged acts of unprotected sexual intercourse. The prosecution case was entirely dependent on the evidence of the complainant (Ms X) with the exception of count 2, which was witnessed by Ms X’s mother (Mrs D).
	
	
	The appellant ran a positive case at trial including calling evidence as to opportunity in respect of certain counts and evidence of good character. He gave evidence denying the allegations made by Ms X but accepted that Ms X had caught him masturbating on occasions, explaining that he did not continue to masturbate after he noticed her presence.
	
	
	The appellant appeals from his conviction on the sole ground that the trial judge erred in ruling that evidence he sought to lead in his case of a gynaecologist, Dr Lyneham, was irrelevant and therefore inadmissible. This concerned the significance of an episode of heavy menstrual bleeding to which Ms X had referred to in her evidence. Since it is submitted for the appellant that the evidence of Dr Lyneham as to this matter had the capacity to undermine Ms X’s credibility as to other counts, it is necessary, albeit briefly, to outline the evidence in the trial.
	
	
	There is no appeal in respect of the sentences.
	


Ms X’s evidence


	
	The first suggestion of the appellant’s allegedly inappropriate behaviour occurred between 21 October 2008 and 15 March 2009 when Ms X was aged 12 years (count 1). The appellant and Ms X were watching television together in the lounge room. Whilst hugging her, his hand moved to her right breast under her nightgown. On an evening some days later, the appellant and Ms X were watching television on the bed in the main bedroom and the appellant again put his hand on her breast (count 2). Mrs D entered the room and saw the appellant remove his hand “like he was touching a hotplate” when he noticed her. There was a brief confrontation in which he denied any inappropriate touching. She told him to get his belongings and leave the house. He did so. At Mrs D’s request the appellant then underwent a lie detector test (the result of which was not tendered in evidence) and, a week later, the appellant was allowed to return to the house. Unbeknown to Mrs D, further alleged sexual misconduct ensued on many occasions, as charged in the indictment, the details of which are not presently relevant, except to note that these came to light on 6 May 2012 following Ms X telling her mother that the appellant was “doing it again” after the appellant had masturbated in her presence (count 20, of which the appellant was acquitted). Mrs D confronted the appellant about what happened. He denied any wrongdoing. The next day Ms X disclosed a number of incidents to her mother and, when the appellant arrived home from work, he was told to leave. He did so and never returned.
	
	
	Ms X participated in five recorded interviews with police between 14 May and 7 October 2012, each giving further details in various ways of the appellant’s alleged misconduct. Edited copies of the recordings were played to the Court and she was cross-examined. In Ms X’s first interview on 14 May 2012 the allegations were limited to Ms X having seen the appellant masturbate and placing his hand on her breast (counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 20). In her second interview on 9 July 2012, Ms X alleged that the appellant had also engaged in acts of sexual intercourse (counts 10, 12 and 19), had indecently assaulted her (count 9) and had physically assaulted her on two occasions when they were walking the dogs (counts 14 and 15). On 16 August 2012 Ms X was interviewed for a third time and asked to clarify some matters. During that interview she alleged that the appellant had shown her a butterfly knife and it had made her feel uneasy. In Ms X’s fourth interview on 31 August 2012, she alleged that the appellant inserted his finger into her vagina and placed her hand on his penis while driving home after a school awards’ ceremony (counts 6 and 7), he made her sit on his lap and she could feel his erection pushing into her back (count 11), he ripped off her dressing gown one night and had sexual intercourse with her twice (counts 16 and 17) and he had sexual intercourse with her after he returned from the cricket grand-final one night (count 18). Ms X’s fifth and final interview on 17 October 2012 contained allegations that the appellant took her measurements whilst she was naked (count 8). In this interview she also described a very heavy period that she had after her 15th birthday (19 October 2011) but before she started taking birth control pills. (A prescription for the pill dated 19 January 2012 was tendered). It is submitted by Mr Boulten SC that this interview clearly implied that she had, or claimed to believe she might have, been pregnant and had a miscarriage. The evidence about this matter is dealt with in some detail below but it should be observed at the outset that Ms X’s credibility about thinking she might have been or become pregnant is of crucial importance since, obviously enough, such a concern could only have arisen if sexual intercourse was taking place
	
	
	In her second interview Ms X said there were things that she had not disclosed in her first interview, explaining that she did not raise them because she felt embarrassed and was worried she would be judged. Whether this explanation was credible in light of the significant development of the allegations as the interviews progressed was, of course, an issue that the jury needed to consider. The verdicts show that the jury accepted Ms X’s evidence as truthful and reliable on all important points.
	


Allegations of sexual intercourse and concerns about pregnancy


	
	The first reference by Ms X to pregnancy was contained in her interview of 9 July 2012 (the second) in which the officer asked (following some introductory matters) –
	


“Q49.    …Tell me what you’ve come to talk to me about today?

A.    Since the previous interview I don't know exactly why but I refrained from telling you certain information because I felt embarrassed and I felt that I would be judged but and after thinking about it for a while I have realised that you know, I wouldn't be judged and it's a really good thing for me to overcome because it's been bothering me for a realty long time.

Q50   [09:51:17] O.K. And what's that certain information about?

A   It's about the sexual nature that [AK] acted on and there was a lot more, there was also physical violence as well.

Q51   O.K. And when you say, [AK], who, who is [AK]?

A   My previous step-dad [AK].

Q52   O.K. And you've said some things about of a sexual nature - - -

A   Yep.

Q53   - - - can you tell me sort of everything from the beginning to the end about, about that?

A   Do I say like what I've already told you or - - -

Q54   Well we have, we - - -

A   - - - or just the new things?

Q55   We talked about some things back in May - - -

A    Yeah.

Q56   or you spoke to Jean about those and we've got those recorded

so really if there's any other information - - -

A   Yep.

Q57   - - - that you had for us?

A   Yeah, O.K. ... I went on a trip into Japan. April on the 7th and before that there was, [AK] came to my bed and had intercourse with me and most of the time I pretended to be asleep but when he noticed that I was awake he would grab the back of my head and, and put it in the pillow and I would start to suffocate and so I wouldn't make any noise. I was always lying on my side and he, he was always behind me ...

Q58   O.K.

A   Yeah, we did lots of play fighting but it wasn't really play fighting he would really hurt me really bad. When I'd have a shower he'd wait outside the door and I would be in my towel and then he would start wrestling me and, and he would push, and he pushed me down onto the, the bed and, sorry.

Q59   It's ail right. We might go back to the first thing you said about just before you went to Japan on the 7th of April.

A   Mmm.

Q60   [09:57:03] O.K.

A   It was, he started it from January 'til March.

Q61   O.K. When you say, Started it, what do you mean?

A   He would come, he'd tell mum he would go downstairs and watch TV but he wouldn't and he would come to my bed.

Q62   O.K. So that's January to March---

A   Yeah.

Q63   — in what year?

A   This year.

Q64   So 2012?

A   Yep. And I got the pill because I thought that I was pregnant and I told my dad that I was having like irregular periods and stuff and my step-mum said that it was good for your skin or something to have the pill, which I think was really stupid but, anyway I convinced them to buy it for me and you know I thought, I really did think I was pregnant but I'm not 'cause I took a pregnancy test.

Q65   O.K. When did you do that?

A   Urn.

Q66   Do you remember when?

A   A week ago. But like I've been so stressed that I haven't had my period for a long time 'cause I've been so stressed.”


	
	During later questioning Ms X disclosed that the first time the appellant had rubbed his penis against her whilst she was in bed at night was in January 2012 (Q175). This was repeated and he “would just go further” (Q182). She said, “It happened, it just happened frequently … and it just got further and further and then when I came back from Japan nothing happened because I was having nightmares and … I told mum and then she kicked him out …” (Q222-3). However, during cross-examination she gave the following evidence –
	


“Q. As I understand your evidence from the interviews that we’ve watched, the accused came into that room, the front room where you were sleeping, whenever it was that he had sex with you in the night-time. Is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. Is it correct that that pattern became more frequent in March 2012?

A. Yes.

Q. How often did it happen in March 2012?

A. Actually, I withdraw that. I remember it became more frequent after the Japan trip. The Japan trip was in April.

Q. Are you sure about that?

A. I’m not a hundred per cent sure. I gave my evidence two years ago.

Q. We have just watched it in the last few days and I --

A. Yes, sir, but I am a human being and I don’t recall everything.

Q. That’s all right, but I thought you did suggest in your interviews that he did not have sex with you, sexual intercourse with you, after you returned from Japan?

A. I may have.

Q. I will check that and we will come back to that. But are you saying now that he was having sex with you more frequently in the period following your return from Japan or not?

A. Sir, to be honest, I think you’ve confused me. I am not quite sure but I am saying that it got more frequent, yes.

…

Q [Quoting the answer to Q 222-3], do you see that?

A. Yes. I do.

Q. Is it the case that when you came back from Japan, no sexual intercourse happened?

A. Sir, that’s correct but I think you’ve just tried to confuse me and that’s why I answered because I was just very confused.”

Ms X was taken again to her previous answer about increased frequency after the Japan trip and said this was wrong. It should be noted that, in her interviews, Ms X stated on many occasions, in effect, that intercourse commenced in January 2012 and ended just before she went to Japan.


	
	(As can be seen, Mr Boulten’s questions were quite simple and direct and the suggestion that he had attempted to confuse the witness was unwarranted. This is not to deny that for some reason, which she attributed to the questions, Ms X was in fact confused).
	
	
	During the rest of this extensive interview Ms X related various particular occasions upon which intercourse occurred and also alleged physical assaults when she threatened to tell her mother what he had been doing.
	
	
	The question of pregnancy gained particular poignancy because of the evidence of Senior Constable Jelsma, one of the officers investigating Ms X’s allegations, concerning an extraordinary conversation she had with Mrs D on 19 September 2012. Her note of this conversation was embodied in an email that she shortly after sent to the officer in charge, Detective Senior Constable Beecroft. She told Officer Beecroft –
	


“[Mrs D] said that last Wednesday night 12 September 2012 [Ms X] disclosed that she had been pregnant at the same time as [Mrs D] between 22 October 2011 and 19 January 2012. [Ms X] stated that the pregnancy had resulted from the abuse she had received from [AK] and that she [Ms X] was very distressed about it.

[Ms X] said that [AK] was aware of the pregnancy and that he had deliberately aborted the foetus. [Mrs D] said that [Ms X] did not elaborate on how he had done this at all. [Ms X] told [her] that she had missed three to four periods and that she recalls when it was aborted. There was a lot of blood. Afterwards [Ms X] wrapped the foetus in paper towels and a plastic bag and placed it in the bin. She did not go to hospital or receive any medications. [Mrs D] had no idea that it had occurred.”

The subject was introduced into evidence by Mr Boulten’s cross-examination of Ms X and then Mrs D. Officer Jelsma was (by agreement) called as part of the Crown case after the appellant had concluded his evidence and gave evidence of the conversation as recorded in her email.


	
	On 17 October 2012, about a month after Mrs D’s conversation with Officer Jelsma, the fifth interview between police and Ms X took place. This also happened to be a few weeks after Mrs D noticed a blood stain which she assumed to be her daughter’s on the bed. Following introductory matters the interview continued –
	


“Q28   O.K. Tell me what you've come to talk to me about today.

A   Um, I've come to talk about, well, my mum found, like, a piece of paper with measurements on it and, um, I sort of, well, this whole situation I've tried to walk out really and when she, like, discovered it and asked me about it I actually, like, remembered that there was something about that. But, like, I didn't, in the scheme of things, I didn't really think that it was, like, a big deal compared to everything else, but apparently it is. Um, I also, like, had, like, a really bad, like, period and, um, like, just after this is all, like, arisen, like talking about everything I realised that I didn't think it was a normal period, like, I don't know, like, if it was something or, or not.

…

Q74   O.K. Is there anything else that you wanted to speak about today?

A   Um, yeah.

Q75   And what's that?

A   Um, the second thing that, um, I think my mum informed you about is

the, um, period.

Q76   Ah hmm.

A   Um, well, I, 'cause I have, like, really heavy periods, I just, um, like, it's actually quite common for me to, like, wake up in the middle of the night and have, like, the bed, like, soaked in blood.

Q77   O.K.

A   But I realised that this time was a bit different, and that I woke up with,

like, a pain, like, here.

Q78   So you're indicating across —

A   Abdomen.

Q79   Abdomen, yeah.

A   Yeah. And it wasn't like a stinging pain, it was like a, like a, like a squeezing pain.

Q80   [15.06] O.K.

A   Um, and there was like a lot, a lot of blood, like, a lot. And it was really strange because there was like, this, like, lumpy black blood but it was, like, lumpy and there was, like, a lot of that in one, like, place, and I thought it was really strange. And so, like, I went to, like, the toilet and cleaned myself up and stuff, and then, um, I just, I know this is sort of gross but I just, like, slept on the other end of the bed and, um, yeah. But I don't know, like, what it was, but, um, I've never had, like, that lumpy, like, black stuff before.

Q81   O.K. And when was this?

A   Um, it was definitely after my 15th birthday but I'm not quite sure when.

Q82   Do you know if it was, um, this year, 2012, or last year 2011?

A   Mmm, not quite sure, sorry.

Q83   O.K. No, that's all right. And what makes you, um, remember that it was after your 15th birthday?

A   Mmm, well I don't know why but I just, like, after all this I just, it's really, it's been, like, connecting the dots sort of, and, like, after my 15th birthday I was having, like, intercourse, but I didn't want to obviously. But, um, you know what I mean? And it's just, I've realised that, um, it couid've been something.

….

Q89   And can you tell me, um, whereabouts you 'were when, um, this

happened, the blood?

A   I was in my bed. Um. I actually can't remember if it 'was the front room or, like, the middle room but I do remember It being very dark and i was in my big bed.

Q90   [15.09] When you say big bed, what size is that?

A   Um, it's, I had, like, a single bed but it's, like, a double bed.

Q91   O.K.

A   So not my old bed, my new bed.

Q92   And you said you. had, um, the pain across your abdomen.

A   Yeah, it was, like, sort of like a squeezing pain.

Q93   O.K.

A   But it woke me up.

Q94   O.K. So what time of the day or night was this?

A   I don't, I'm not quite sure but it was definitely, like, way, I was in a deep sleep.

Q95   O.K. So in the day or the night?

A   The night.

Q96   Yeah. O.K. And, um, what were you wearing? Do you remember?

A   Um, I think I was just wearing my blue nightie. But I, I remember taking, like, my pyjamas off because they were, like, really, like, soaked in blood.

Q97   And were you wearing any underwear?

A   Yeah. That was completely saturated, like —

Q98   Do you remember what undies they were?

A   No.

Q99   O.K. O.K. So, um, when you realised, um, that there was a lot of blood —

A   Yeah, I just, like, thought it was my period and it was really dark so I, like, took off my undies 'cause I knew they were saturated.

Q100   [15.11] Ah hmm.

A   And I pulled the covers, like, off, and I had, like, my blue reading light which is like a tiny reading light, and I, like, turned it on and I was, like, wow, that's really bad. And then I noticed, like, this really weird, like, stuff, and that was, like, it was on my undies but it, like, got onto the bed.

Q101   Ah hmm.

A   And so, like, I just basically, like, just scooped it up and, yeah, and went to the toilet and, like, cleaned everything.

Q102   Yeah.

A   O.K.

Q103   All right.

A   Like, it was just really odd. Yeah.

Q104   O.K. So, do you remember what sheets you had on your bed?

A   No.

Q105   O.K. And you said you cleaned it up.

A   Yeah.

Q106   Do you remember how you cleaned it up?

A   Well I'm, I'm, like, I can't remember but, like, what I usually do is when l have my period in the morning I say, well mum, I have my period, I got this on my sheets and so, like, she'll take it off and wash it for me.

Q107   Ah hmm.

A   And, like, whatever other clothes it's been, you know, like soiled, she'll wash it.

Q108   Ah hmm.

A   So, like, um, basically I just remember taking everything off and just, like, trying to get as much, like, blood into the toilet, like, to get rid of it and, you know, like, getting, like, a tissue and wiping it off.

Q109   Ah hmm.

A   Yeah.

Q110   [15.13] Where did you get the tissues from?

A   The toilet paper.

Q111   Oh O.K. O.K. Did you tell anyone about it, about this?

A   Um, I told mum —

Q112   Yeah.

A   — that, like, my sheets were —

Q113   Ah hmm.

A    um, like, soiled. I didn't think anything of it at the time. I just thought it was odd that, like, I had, like, so much blood. I wasn't, didn't think it was really odd 'cause of the pain because I had period pains before. But now that I think of it, like that pain was actually quite intense.

Q114   Ah hmm.

A   And it was like a one off pain, it didn't, like, come regularly, like, back or anything.

Q115   Ah hmm.

A   Um, yeah, I didn't think anything of it, just thought I had my period.

Q116   O.K.

A   It's just now, like, it seems a bit odd.

Q117   O.K. So, on this time when you thought it was your period, did your, um, period continue after this time?

A   Yeah, it went for, like, four weeks after that.

Q118   O.K.

A   It, it went for so long.

Q119   And can you describe, um, how that period was?

A   Like a really, really heavy period.

Q120   [15.14] O.K. And is that, um, normal for you?

A   Um - - -

Q121   Is that what would normally happen?

A   Well, it shouldn't be normal but in the past, like, two, two and a half years, like, I've had really long heavy, irregular periods. Um, like, I just, today I just got, like, a blood test to check and, um, the doctor was, like, quite concerned with it, so. Like, I'm gonna find out soon, like, what's going on.”

Ms X said that her periods had been regular at first but in “the last two years it’s been really, like, bad and irregular”. The interview continued –

“Q126   O.K. And before this incident do you know when your period was before that?

A   Um, I don't remember. But I'm pretty sure, like, I didn't have my period before that. Like I woke up, like, 'cause I don't know when I'm gonna get my periods. Sometimes, like, you know, accidents do happen.

Q127   Ah hmm.

A   So, um, yeah. Like I, I didn't, I probably had my period like two weeks before prior to then.”

Ms X said that she told her mother about the blood on the sheets. She said (Q131) she was not on the pill at the time.


	
	Ms X was cross-examined about this bleeding incident –
	


“Q. In that last record of interview that we watched today, the one that was taped in October 2012, you described a very nasty incident where you bled in a way that you didn't understand to be like any other occasion. Right?

A. Yes.

Q. You told the police in that interview that as a result of everything that had happened you had looked back on that particular incident and realised that you didn't think it was a normal period. Do you remember saying that?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. And that you saw your baby brother and he made you think about that. Right?

A. Yes.

Q. Before you conducted that interview with the police did you tell your mother that you believed that you had been pregnant and that you had miscarried or something like that?

A. The reason why I connected that to my baby brother is because I was in PD class and they talked about miscarriages. It wasn't because of the conversation I had with my mother. It was because of school.

Q. It's all right, but did you tell your mother that you thought that you had miscarried?

A. No. I told my mum what happened. I didn't have any preconceived notions that I had miscarried. It just occurred to me during the day because it was a Wednesday, I was having sport that day so class was early and I had PD in the morning and that was the topic, and I thought, you know, it sounds very similar.

Q. Did you tell your mother that [AK] knew that you had been pregnant?

A. I really don't recall. That doesn't sound very accurate.

Q. Well, did you tell your mother that you had been pregnant at the same time as she had been pregnant?

A. No.

Q. Did you tell your mother that [AK] was aware of the pregnancy?

A. Look, having conversations with my mum about this stuff - I didn't because my mum - I hold her in very high regard and I really didn't feel comfortable and I still don't feel comfortable telling her what has been going on. She still doesn't know my version of this, so I didn't speak to her about anything. Any time a conversation would come up about this, I would feel very uncomfortable and I wouldn't talk about it.

Q. I just wish to check a very precise form of words. Did you tell your mother that [AK] became aware that you had been pregnant?

A. I'm not quite sure.

Q. All right. Did you tell your mother that he had deliberately aborted the foetus?

A. I'm sorry, I don't know where you're getting this from, but that's not accurate.

Q. Do you deny that? Do you deny you said that to your mother?

A. I don't know where you're getting these conversations from. Look, I don't know what was said at the time. I was extremely confused. I was very, very traumatised, and I still am.

Q. I just want to check then, did you tell your mother [AK] aborted your foetus?

A. No, I didn’t tell her that.

Q. Because that certainly did not happen, did it?

A. Sir, I don't think you're in the position to say that.

Q. [AK] did not--

A. You weren't there.

Q. Did [AK] - just when you're ready. Are you okay?

A. Yes, I'm fine.

Q. I want to put this question to you: did [AK] do anything to terminate a pregnancy?

A. No.

Q. Did you tell your mother that you wrapped the foetus in paper towels and a plastic bag and placed it in the bin?

A. Yes.

Q. But that didn't happen either, did it?

A. Sir, as I said in the interviews, I put it in the toilet and it was in a plastic bag.

Q. The interview actually doesn't say anything at all about a plastic bag, I want you to accept. What--

A. Yes, but it does say that I put it in the toilet and I used tissues, which I meant toilet paper.

Q. Then just going back to the conversation with your mother, is it the case that in September 2012 you told your mother that [AK] had deliberately aborted the foetus and that you had wrapped it in paper towels and a plastic bag and placed it in the bin?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I object, your Honour.

WITNESS: I did tell her that I placed it - I disposed of it, yes.”


	
	It is important to note that the account of the bleeding incident contained two elements: the first was the description of the incident itself, including its somewhat unique character in her experience; and the second was Ms X’s concern, later raised, that she might have become pregnant and might have miscarried. In my respectful view, therefore, the conclusion of Hoeben CJ at CL, with which Fullerton J agrees, that the episode reflected nothing more than the second element is mistaken. It also overlooks the possibility that the jury may have an opinion about the import of Ms X’s description of, as distinct from her concern about, what happened. Ms X’s account in her fifth interview implied or, at least, the jury might have thought it did, the possibility of an actual pregnancy as well as a concern that she might have been pregnant. It is not to the point that the timetable of events as given by Ms X is inconsistent with such an implication although, as Fullerton J persuasively demonstrates (if I may respectfully say so), accepting that account effectively excluded the likelihood of pregnancy. The jury, however, was not bound to reason in this way, either as to the extent upon which they accepted Ms X’s chronology or what that chronology proved. Nor was the defence obliged to act on the basis that the jury must reason as Fullerton J has done. Nor is it significant that the possibility of pregnancy was only briefly and tentatively entertained, if this were the fact. The simple point is that the interview raised the issue of pregnancy and thus evidence that tended to disprove the possibility was relevant and the defence was, in my view, entitled to adduce it.
	
	
	Not surprisingly, Mrs D was cross-examined on the matter –
	


“Q. In September 2012 you had a conversation with Detective Jelsma about issues concerning what you believed to be a blood stain on the mattress that you had just noticed. Correct?

A. Yes. That's correct.

Q. Is it the case that prior to telephoning Detective Jelsma your daughter gave you an account of events that related to an incident that disturbed you? I'll start again. Prior to ringing Detective Jelsma did your daughter tell you that she'd been pregnant, she believed, at the same time that you were pregnant?

A. I don't recall the wording of that conversation. But I am aware that [Ms X] was concerned or worried that she was pregnant.

Q. Did [Ms X] tell you that the accused had become aware of the fact that she was pregnant?

A. I don't recall [Ms X] making any statements regarding the accused's awareness.

Q. Did [Ms X] tell you that the accused had deliberately aborted the foetus?

A. I don't recall [Ms X] describing what you've just stated.

Q. I'd suggest to you that that's all information that you provided to Detective Jelsma. What do you say about that?

A. I don't recall stating that information.

Q. Are you saying you don't remember whether you told Detective Jelsma that the accused aborted your daughter's baby?

A. I recall the phone call. I recall where I was standing when I made the phone call and I don't recall the exact wording or what was said during that phone call. I just recall that she was going to speak to the officer in charge or detective in charge and would be in contact with me.

Q. Did you recount to Detective Jelsma what [Ms X] had told you?

A. Could you be specific what you're referring to with [Ms X]?

Q. When you spoke to Detective Jelsma, you passed on information that your daughter had recounted to you, didn't you?

A. As I said before, I don't recall what I have said to the detective on the phone regarding what [Ms X] had told me. I recall the phone call and I recall making the phone call.

Q. But the phone call was about what [Ms X] had told you. Correct?

A. The phone call was regarding the mattress and what I had seen.

Q. You also told her things that [Ms X] had told you. Correct?

A. I don't recall anything else.

Q. In October 2012 you took [Ms X] to JIRT to participate in the fifth interview that the police conducted with her about these events, didn't you?

A. I believe I drove her to that. Yes.

Q. You knew when you took her there that she was going to talk or be questioned about, amongst other things, the stain that you had seen. Correct?

A. No. That's not correct.

Q. I want to suggest to you that you would know one way or the other if your daughter told you that your husband aborted a foetus, her foetus. What do you say about that?

A. I can't speak to what you believe I should know and not know. I can only say that I don't recall her stating those words.

Q. Nor do you recall saying those words to Detective Jelsma apparently. Is that right? You don't know whether you did or you didn't?

A. I don't recall saying those words.

Q. Did you ever exaggerate anything when you spoke to the police about these issues?

A. I believe that everything I've said to the police is the truth and I've not exaggerated anything whatsoever.

Q. You would not distort information that you got from your daughter when you recounted it to the police surely?

A. I believe that everything that I've spoken to the police about and that's in my statement is the truth.”

Dr Lyneham’s report


	
	After the Court adjourned on 4 April 2014 (day 10 of the hearing) the appellant’s solicitor served a copy of a report of Dr Robert Lyneham, gynaecologist and obstetrician, dated 17 March 2014. This was the first time the report had been provided to the prosecution. On 8 April 2014 (on the afternoon of the day on which Officer Jelsma had given her evidence and shortly after the defence had gone into evidence) Mr Boulten for the appellant indicated that he wished to call Dr Lyneham next. The Crown prosecutor indicated that he objected to the evidence proposed to be led from Dr Lyneham both on the ground of relevance and because the report was served too late for the Crown to obtain its own expert response. The report was tendered on the voir dire. Dr Lyneham had been asked by the appellant’s solicitor a number of questions of which the following was referred to by Mr Boulten, who said that he wished to elicit in evidence the answer that the doctor had given to it. The question was –
	


“4. Please let us have your professional opinion as to the question as to the cause of the event described by Ms X at paragraph 75 onwards of her record of interview on 17 October 2012, assuming that version to be true?”

Dr Lyneham set out briefly what he regarded as the relevant clinical facts to be derived from Ms X’s answers (which it is not for present purposes necessary to set out) and concluded –

“In contemplation of the clinical details that I have listed above, in my view it is more likely than not, and substantially so, that the cause of the event described by Ms X at paragraph 75 onwards of her record of interview on 17 October 2012 was a severe episode of anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding.”

In substance, it was the doctor’s opinion that, to the degree of likelihood mentioned, Ms X had not suffered a miscarriage.


	
	The Crown prosecutor said that it would not be suggested to the jury by the Crown that there was any evidence to establish that Ms X was pregnant but, at the highest, she was worried or concerned about the possibility. He submitted that the doctor’s opinion was completely irrelevant. Mr Boulten replied –
	


“BOULTEN: If the Crown is going to positively suggest to the jury that the evidence does not suggest that she was pregnant, that's one thing. If the Crown is going to leave it as it were neutral and not positively assert that she was not pregnant, then that's different. Certainly there is evidence when you join interview number 5 and what Ms X said in interview number 5 with what Ms X said to her mother about her concerns about being pregnant and being tested. There is evidence and there is evidence at 130 of the transcript, where Ms X accepted that she told her mother that she wrapped the foetus and placed it in the bin and put it in the toilet, all of that leads to an open inference, not only that she thought she was pregnant, but there's a real chance that she was. Evidence from the gynaecologist that it's entirely unlikely that what she saw was a miscarriage is necessary to put that issue to rest in my submission.

HER HONOUR: Why is it an issue?

BOULTEN: If the Crown is going to positively say to the jury she wasn't pregnant, it's not in issue.

HER HONOUR: The Crown can't say that. But the Crown can say whether she was or wasn't is not an issue that the jury has to decide. Nobody can say whether she was or wasn't.

BOULTEN: The doctor can say that her description is more likely to be something inconsistent with pregnancy.

HER HONOUR: Yes, and where does that take it?

BOULTEN: That then is evidence that the jury would be likely to accept and therefore not act upon an inference that she may well indeed have been pregnant. At the moment the evidence could lead to that inference being drawn.”


	
	The Crown prosecutor agreed with the learned trial judge that he would not say that the evidence or any concern about pregnancy established that there was sexual intercourse by the accused or that the evidence of the heavy bleeding supported her account in any way and repeated that he would not suggest that the jury could use the evidence to make a finding that she was pregnant. He submitted that, to enable the evidence to be adduced would be to distract the jury from its task because it might suggest that may be there was some real issue as to her falling her pregnant. The Crown put at its highest her concern about pregnancy as consistent with her complaints that the appellant had intercourse with her.
	
	
	The trial judge gave the following judgment –
	


“HER HONOUR: I agree with the Crown, Mr Boulten. If necessary, I will direct the jury about this. In my view, it is not a relevant issue. Certainly you have got the evidence that you're going to highlight no doubt and no doubt you will say Ms X was exaggerating, et cetera, but this issue of the blood and Ms X’s retrospective concern about having been pregnant, looking back, in my view, is not one of the matters that is even relevant for the jury. No doubt you will argue that it is relevant as to Ms X’s credit but it is not relevant to anything that the Crown has to prove, and the ultimate issue here, as I will be directing the jury, is whether they accept Ms X as a truthful and accurate witness. That's what they have to do: satisfy beyond reasonable doubt that these acts occurred. If not, they acquit the accused.”


	
	I should mention the addresses to the jury on this question although, of course, they were made in the light of the trial judge’s ruling. In his address the Crown prosecutor referred to what he described as “the situation in September 2012 where the mother has discovered some blood stain on her bed” and referred to what he described as “conversations between the mother and the daughter … consistent with some person very traumatised after the event looking back in September, which is some time afterwards and wondering whether it was possible and being concerned about the fact of whether or not she might have got pregnant at some point”. He pointed out that Ms X’s evidence was that she went on the pill because she was worried about getting pregnant with the accused and became worried about the particular period which he mentioned in her last interview. The Crown prosecutor said that she was “looking back and being concerned about certain possibilities” pointing out that she wasn’t sure when it was and she became very concerned well after the event about the possibility that she may have been pregnant because of the nature of that period. The Crown prosecutor then moved on to other matters. He did not say in terms that it was not the Crown case that she had been pregnant or that it was the Crown case that she was not pregnant in fact. He dealt with it entirely on the basis on what Ms X had said about the matter, in other words, the expression of a concern, perhaps in retrospect, emphasised by her worries about pregnancy which, upon reflection, she thought may have led to the incident of heavy bleeding. In dealing with the issue, Mr Boulten quoted Ms X’s answers in the fifth interview and said –
	


“Now, no one suggests that what she was describing in that interview indicated that she had been pregnant or she was pregnant. There is no evidence at all that would allow you to conclude that. The Crown has not suggested it. But she did have these problems that involved a lot of bleeding…”


	
	Hoeben CJ at CL and Fullerton J consider that it was significant that neither the Crown nor Mr Boulten submitted to the jury that Ms X’s belief that she might have been pregnant and might have miscarried led to a “real chance” that she was in fact pregnant. However, with respect, the defence case was, as I have pointed out, that she was never pregnant. In light of the trial judge’s ruling, Mr Boulten’s submission was forced on him; nor does the Crown’s approach illuminate the controversy.
	
	
	In the trial judge’s summing up her Honour mentioned the bleeding incident for the first time in the following terms –
	


“The evidence as to the heavy bleeding and what Ms X was concerned about is relevant evidence. Keep in mind she was looking back in the interview, at that time she was only 15. The evidence of what Detective Jelsma recorded in her notebook may be relevant to your assessment of the credibility of Ms X’s mother … because she records something that [Mrs D] said to her in a phone call at a time when she said also that [Mrs D] was very upset.”


	
	At the luncheon adjournment which occurred some little time after this passage counsel were asked by her Honour whether they had any applications. Mr Boulten said –
	


“Yes your Honour. The direction about the use of Detective Jelsma’s evidence … I would submit that Detective Jelsma’s evidence about what [Mrs D] told her in the telephone call is capable of being used as evidence that [Ms X] told her mother those things, although it can’t be and ought not to be used as evidence of the truth of what either [of them] said…”

He went on to make submissions about the application of s 60(2) about the application of the hearsay rule in the circumstances. On resumption her Honour said –

“… I just want to go back to something that I said about the use you could make about Detective Jelsma’s evidence. You will recall that [Ms X] denied in her evidence when she was cross-examined that she had ever said to her mother that the accused had aborted the foetus. This is a reference to what Detective Jelsma had recorded. So [Ms X] denied that she had ever said such a thing. You might recall her words something along the lines, ‘I do not know where you’re getting this from’. [Mrs D] gave evidence that she had no recollection of saying or telling Detective Jelsma what she had recorded in her notebook and you would recall also that Detective Jelsma had recorded that [Mrs D] was very upset or traumatised or something along those lines. If you accept that [Mrs D] did say those things to Detective Jelsma, that is that Ms X said that the accused had aborted the foetus and if you accept that [Ms X] said that to her mother then you can use that in your assessment of Ms X’s reliability, not just in respect of [Mrs D’s] reliability as I said before. I repeat that it is not the Crown case that Ms X was ever pregnant and nor is it the accused’s case.”

(As to this last observation, it was not quite accurate, though no correction was sought: the accused’s case of course was that Ms X was not and never had been pregnant).

The submissions


	
	The submissions made for the appellant commenced with the uncontroversial contention that whether evidence satisfies the test for relevance contained in s 55 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) can only be determined by analysing the facts in issue, the circumstances which bear upon the question of probability and a consideration of the process of reasoning by which the information could rationally affect the probability of the existence of a fact in issue, citing Washer v Western Australia [2007] HCA 48; 234 CLR 492 at [5] per Gleeson CJ, Heydon and Crennan JJ, which was a case under the common law but specifying the same test for relevance as contained in s 55. It is submitted that the question for the trial judge was, if the jury accepted the evidence of Dr Lyneham, whether it could rationally affect, either directly or indirectly, the evidence of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings. It is submitted, in effect, that the evidence of Dr Lyneham was relevant to a fact in issue in the proceedings in two significant ways: firstly, to rebut the implication (however oblique) in Ms X’s account in her fifth interview that she might have been pregnant and refute the honesty of the statement, to the effect that she had been pregnant and the pregnancy was terminated by the accused, made to her mother and reported to Officer Jelsma. It is submitted, so far as the first basis is concerned, it could directly affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue, namely whether the appellant had sexual intercourse with Ms X. As I understand this argument, it points to the simple line of reasoning that, as the appellant had sexual intercourse with Ms X on many occasions, there was a reasonable likelihood that she would have become pregnant and the fact that she did not suggest that intercourse had not either taken place or not taken place as frequently as she asserted, in the latter case going directly to her credit. Its significance, from the Crown’s point of view, is that it was consistent with a fear of pregnancy which would not have arisen if the allegations against the accused were false. Although it is true that the fact that Ms X did not become pregnant could not establish that sexual intercourse had not taken place, for obvious reasons, nevertheless it was logically relevant.
	
	
	It was further submitted, in developing the argument, that the case against the appellant wholly depended on the credibility of Ms X and the veracity of her evidence, so that any evidence which impugned that credibility was directly relevant to the facts in issue: R v V (1998) 100 A Crim R 488 per Smart J at 495, citing Palmer v The Queen [1998] HCA 2; 193 CLR 1, per McHugh J at [51]. It was submitted that, if the jury accepted the evidence of Dr Lyneham to the effect that the incident described by her was unlikely (perhaps extremely so) to have been a miscarriage, the jury could infer that she was not pregnant at any time leading up to or at the time of this incident. This would also cast doubt on the inference, left open on the evidence as I have pointed out, that she was in fact pregnant at that time. In turn, the jury could not use the fact that she was (or may have been) pregnant to support a conclusion that they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had sexual intercourse with her. It was submitted that the mere fact that it was not the Crown case that she was in fact pregnant and her description of the bleeding event went only to her later belief or concern that she had miscarried did not determine the relevance of the evidence about a possible pregnancy. As Mr Game SC pointed out, the only way the “belief” evidence could be used at the trial was to show consistency with her account that the appellant had sexual intercourse with her (which might have led to pregnancy). The proposed evidence of Dr Lyneham, though not conclusive, went some way to showing that what was said by Ms X as having given rise to a concern that she may have miscarried was not, in all likelihood, a miscarriage at all, even though it could not suggest that the event of heavy bleeding as Ms X described had not occurred. Counsel pointed to the fact that the issue remained alive because the Crown took the approach on the voir dire that, although it would be suggested to the jury that Ms X was pregnant, there was no concession that in fact she was not pregnant. Counsel further argued that it did not matter whether it was the Crown case that Ms X had not been pregnant. That was not a precondition of the relevance of the evidence of Dr Lyneham. The issues are those presented by the evidence, not by the Crown case theory. Once the possibility of pregnancy was raised by the implication in the account of Ms X in her fifth interview (and, as it happened, by the allegations of intercourse), the evidence of Dr Lyneham became relevant, although it only related to the account. Despite the likelihood that the jury would have rejected the startling allegation made by Ms X’s mother to the police officer that Ms X had told her that the applicant had made her pregnant and aborted the foetus, it was, in point of principle, open to them to think that Ms X had in fact said that to her mother and, given that the only possible candidate for at least part of the account was her fifth interview account, the evidence of Dr Lyneham that it was extremely unlikely that she had been pregnant at the time, was relevant to considering whether the statement to her mother was a fabrication. The mere fact, as set out in the above-quoted evidence of Ms X and pointed to by Fullerton J, that she denied ever having told her mother she had been pregnant or that the appellant had performed an abortion, does not make the evidence of Dr Lyneham irrelevant since what her mother had told Officer Jelsma was evidence of what Ms X had said to her and questions of relevance cannot depend upon assumptions about what parts of the evidence the jury might accept.
	
	
	In oral submissions at the appeal Mr Game commenced with the (perhaps deceptively) simple submission that the bleeding incident supported Ms X’s belief that she was or might be pregnant and therefore that she was telling the truth about having been subjected to sexual intercourse by the appellant or at least it being relied on as a, more or less, consistent objective fact, then the defence was entitled to deal with it and show that pregnancy either had not occurred or was most unlikely. On this analysis, Ms X’s belief that she was or might be pregnant was a fact in issue because that would inform the question whether or not sexual intercourse had occurred so that, if the bleeding could be, as it were, taken out by the doctor’s evidence that it very likely was not a miscarriage, that would leave the Crown to rely only on the expression of a belief or concern about pregnancy on the part of Ms X without any incident that might be consistent with such a belief or concern or possibly be regarded by the jury as supporting the existence of such a belief or concern. This needs to be considered, Mr Game argued, in the context of (what the jury might conclude was or might have been) the positive assertion by Ms X to her mother that she had been pregnant and that the pregnancy had been aborted by the appellant. Accordingly, as Mr Game put it, from the defence perspective it was not enough for the issue to be left in the air whether or not Ms X suffered a miscarriage but it was desired, so much as it was possible to do so, to take the question of pregnancy out of the case as an issue that might be regarded as supporting Ms X’s evidence. And this was so whatever argument the Crown might put as to its case.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that Ms X’s evidence did not suggest that she was pregnant but merely supported the inference that she later thought that she might have been pregnant. It was not the Crown case that she was pregnant nor was such an inference properly available on her evidence. That there was evidence that Ms X thought she might have been pregnant did not raise the issue whether she had, in fact, been pregnant. In its very terms, Dr Lyneham’s opinion could not rebut the evidence about what Ms X believed about being pregnant since her state of mind did not depend upon the likelihood that she was in fact pregnant. Accordingly, Dr Lyneham’s evidence was irrelevant. So far as Ms X’s credit was concerned, the only way in which it could be rationally attacked was to demonstrate that her retrospective suspicion that she may have had a spontaneous miscarriage was in fact unfounded. This would not, however, show that no such suspicion was held. It is also submitted that, although Dr Lyneham’s report dealt with the situation revealed by Ms X’s mother to the police officer that evidence was second hand hearsay admitted only for credit purposes. Counsel for the Crown pointed out (as was the case) that the evidence of the episode of heavy bleeding was led in the Crown’s case at the request of the defence and amounted to a straw man which the defence sought to use Dr Lyneham to demolish.
	
	
	Putting the Crown argument somewhat more simply, the sole issue in the trial (as to this matter) was whether Ms X believed that she might have been pregnant and suffered a miscarriage. Accordingly, the evidence as to whether in fact the bleeding incident occurred would of course have been relevant but whether it was due to a miscarriage or not was not relevant because it could not inform the question whether Ms X thought she might have been pregnant.
	


Consideration


	
	In the course of the above discussion, I have already indicated my view about the relevance of the rejected evidence. The question whether Ms X had been made pregnant by the appellant was relevant to the question whether he had, as was alleged by Ms X, frequent sexual intercourse with her, even if for a relatively short period. This would scarcely be arguable if it had been proved that she became pregnant during this time. His case necessarily implied that it would not have been possible that she had conceived by him and that the lack of any pregnancy was consistent with his denials of having sexual intercourse with her although, of course, it could not prove he had not done so. (The defence also necessarily implied that she could have had no genuine concern that she might have been pregnant, but that is a different question). To test the proposition, a question asked in cross-examination of Ms X as to whether she had ever been pregnant (at the relevant time) could not have been rejected as irrelevant. Or, assume that at some time after the sexual assaults had ended Ms X had undergone a medical procedure or examination which demonstrated that she had never been pregnant (accepting that it may be that no medical examination could ascertain whether a miscarriage had occurred). It could not be argued that evidence of that fact could not be adduced. The fact – if it were the fact – that she did not become pregnant could not of course prove that intercourse did not occur, though its significance increased in cogency with the number of occasions when a pregnancy might have occurred. I am unable to accept that it was a fact which was not capable of being significant in the sense meant by s 55. It was a fact to which the appellant was entitled to point as consistent with his denials that intercourse ever took place and, to some degree, inconsistent with the allegation that he frequently had intercourse with Ms X, hence at least that she was exaggerating and thus should not be accepted beyond reasonable doubt as truthful in respect of the allegations upon which the counts in the indictment were based. (It is also perhaps worth mentioning the rather obvious point that the more often sexual intercourse occurred, the greater the risk of pregnancy, hence of discovery, and this would be relevant in considering the weight to be given to the competing cases). It is true that Mr Boulten did not, in cross-examination, put to Ms X that she had not been pregnant or that she had not had any concerns that she might have been but, since he put to her directly that sexual intercourse had not occurred, it followed as a necessary corollary that she could not have been pregnant or had genuine concerns about the possibility and was inevitably implied in his question. It follows that I respectfully disagree with Fullerton J’s view that the failure to directly challenge Ms X on these consequential matters is significant. Moreover, the clear import of the evidence of Ms X as a whole was that she had not become pregnant and it was not necessary for Mr Boulten to ask her about it, since no question of contradiction arose. This did not mean, however, that the defence was not entitled to prove, if it could, that she had not been pregnant, in particular, that the symptoms she described in her fifth interview were not those of a miscarriage. It was to this issue that the evidence of Dr Lyneham was directed.
	
	
	It is unnecessary to draw a conclusion about the evidence given by Mrs D and Ms X about the matter stated in Officer Jelsma’s note but, given that it was contemporaneous, it is difficult to see any available conclusion except that it indeed recorded what Mrs D had said. At all events, the jury would have been entitled to reject the notion that a mother in Mrs D’s position would not recall 18 months later (Mrs D gave evidence in April 2014) that she had said what was recorded by Officer Jelsma and conclude that Mrs D had indeed told Officer Jelmsa what had been recorded. In light of her assertion that everything she had told the police was the truth, it follows that, despite her asserted inability to recall the conversation about her daughter’s complaints, acceptance by the jury that she had made the statement has the consequence that they were entitled to conclude that indeed Ms X had made the complaints. It was accepted that this conclusion was open to the jury. No objection based on hearsay could succeed in light of Mrs D’s evidence that everything she said to the police was the truth. That Ms X actually had missed four periods, had been pregnant, the appellant had aborted the pregnancy and the foetus was disposed of was hearsay, of course, and Mrs X having told her mother (if that were the fact) about these events did not prove them. But the fact that Ms X had told these things to her mother was not hearsay. That left outstanding the substantive question whether the jury would accept that the complaints were made as the mother claimed but there was ample evidence available for such a conclusion. As I have set out above, Ms X was questioned about elements of her mother’s account. It would have been well open to the jury to have concluded that she was far less categorical about a matter which would, the jury could have thought, been most unlikely to have been forgotten or the subject of confusion. They were, in my view, entitled to disbelieve Ms X’s denials.
	
	
	It matters not that the Crown had not made this part of its case. The defence was certainly entitled to adduce evidence of the Jelsma conversation and the fact that the Crown did so at the request of the defence is neither here nor there: the plain purpose of introducing the evidence was to attempt to discredit Ms X and her mother and not to prove that any pregnancy had or might have occurred and was therefore unquestionably admissible. It was the point of introducing the evidence that, since no pregnancy and no abortion had actually occurred, what the complainant said to her mother (as the jury could well accept was said) was false. It was thus relevant for the defence to prove, if it could, that this was so. The only material capable of giving rise to the possibility that Ms X may have been pregnant was the heavy bleeding incident disclosed in her fifth interview and thus capable of being linked to the Jelsma conversation). Proving an account of a witness (whose evidence is otherwise in dispute) to be a fabrication or a significant exaggeration is to prove a relevant fact. The defence was entitled to do this whether or not Ms X had disclosed the heavy bleed which caused her, at a later point, to think that possibly she may have been pregnant. The essential element in proof of the contention that Ms X had fabricated or exaggerated her complaint to her mother was, of course, that the facts were otherwise than she stated them. This inconsistency could occur at two levels: first, she was not pregnant and knowing this was so, asserted she was; or, secondly, she believed merely she might have been pregnant but asserted it as a fact. However, taking the complaint at face value (as the jury was entitled to), it amounts to a positive assertion that she was pregnant, especially given the additional features she gave that she had missed three to four periods, the accused had aborted “the foetus”, and she had wrapped “the foetus” in paper towels and placed it in the bin. Even if the fact were that Ms X was worried or speculated that she might be or have been pregnant (as distinct from knowing that she was not pregnant), her statement to her mother, if made, was nevertheless, in substance, a fabrication. On either account, the defence was entitled to adduce evidence that supported the contention that Ms X was not pregnant.
	
	
	That the Crown accepted there was no evidence that entitled the jury to conclude that Ms X had been pregnant could not preclude the defence from proving that she had not been pregnant or calling evidence to the effect that it was unlikely that she had been pregnant. It is not correct to say that there was no issue about the question between the Crown and the defence. That may have been true if the prosecutor had agreed that Ms X had not been pregnant, but he was not prepared to go so far. (Even if the concession had been made, that would not in my opinion make the evidence irrelevant, since the defence was entitled to prove the fact by evidence: the jury could not be bound by any concession made by the Crown. However, in light of the limited concession foreshadowed by the prosecutor, this question does not need to be determined).
	


Conclusion


	
	Accordingly, it seems to me that the evidence proposed to be led by the defence from Dr Lyneham was relevant and should have been admitted. It is not possible to conclude that the admission of this evidence would not have affected the verdict, in short, that the appellant has not been denied the possibility of acquittal. The Crown prosecutor did not submit that, if error were shown, the conviction should not be quashed. At all events, this not a case in which the proviso should be applied. In my opinion the appeal should be allowed, and a new trial ordered.
	
	
	FULLERTON J: I have read the judgments of Adams J and Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	I agree with the order proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL that the appeal be dismissed. I also agree with his Honour’s reasons for concluding that error has not been demonstrated in the trial judge’s refusal to permit the accused to lead evidence from Dr Lyneham concerning the likely explanation for the episode of heavy nocturnal bleeding the complainant recounted in an interview with police in October 2012. I would, however, prefer to express my own reasons for concluding that the evidence was properly excluded as irrelevant or at least not relevant in the way the argument was advanced by defence counsel at trial.
	
	
	Although it will not be necessary to refer to the evidence at trial in detail (Adams J’s summary of the evidence providing the context in which the appellant sought to have Dr Lyneham called in his case), there are features of the complainant’s evidence that do need to be emphasised including, in particular, the circumstances in which she came to recount to police the episode of heavy bleeding; her account of when the bleeding episode occurred; and her answers to questions asked in cross-examination about it. It is only by a consideration of that evidence that defence counsel’s arguments contending for the relevance of Dr Lyneham’s evidence under s 55 of the Evidence Act can be assessed.
	
	
	The effect of the complainant’s evidence was that the appellant’s sexual abuse of her changed character on the evening of 7 December 2011. On that night, as he was driving her home after an awards ceremony at her high school, he digitally penetrated her vagina. That allegation was the subject of one of six counts of aggravated sexual intercourse laid contrary to s 66C(4) of the Crimes Act, and the first in time of those six counts. The complainant’s evidence was that prior to that date, and over a period of years from 2008, the appellant’s sexual mistreatment of her was limited to repeated assaults of her with acts of indecency. That conduct was the subject of counts 1 to 8 on the indictment.
	
	
	The first complaint of penile-vaginal intercourse was made in the complainant’s second interview with police on 9 July 2012. In that interview the complainant nominated two particular occasions between 31 December 2011 and 1 March 2012 when the appellant entered her bedroom after she had gone to bed and had sexual intercourse with her. These were the subject of counts 10 and 12 on the indictment. She also nominated another occasion in the week before she went to Japan on 7 April 2012 when the appellant entered her bedroom and had sexual intercourse with her. This was the subject of count 19 on the indictment. It was her evidence that this was the last occasion sexual intercourse occurred.
	
	
	In the Crown’s Summary of Trial, the evidence in respect of those three counts is summarised as follows:
	


Count 10

During January 2012 school holidays, between 31 December 2011 and 1 March 2012 the complainant (aged 15 years) was in her bed when the appellant walked into her bedroom. He lifted up the covers and got into bed with the complainant, laying behind her and cuddling her from behind. The appellant pulled the complainant’s underpants down and from behind, he put his penis in the complainant’s vagina. The appellant moved his body back and forth, and caused pain to the complainant. The complainant believed he ejaculated in her vagina, before leaving her bedroom, without saying anything.

Count 12

Between 31 December 2011 and 1 March 2012, on an evening in February 2012 after school had resumed for the year, the complainant (aged 15 years) was in her bed asleep wearing dark blue nightie. The complainant awoke to find the appellant laying behind her in her bed, and the penis of the appellant inside her vagina. The appellant moved his body back and forth, grunting as he was doing so. The appellant then left the complainant’s bedroom without saying anything. Following this, there was blood on the complainant’s bed linen and on her nightie.

In cross-examination the complainant agreed she woke up to find the appellant’s penis inside her vagina or just inside her vagina. She agreed she must have got into her bed and pulled down her underpants while she was still asleep. She agreed she must have been in a deep sleep and all of that happened without her waking up.

Count 19

On an evening before the trip to Japan, between 1 April 2012 and 7 April 2012, the complainant (aged 15 years) was in her bed. She was still awake when the appellant walked into her bedroom. He was not wearing any pants or underwear. He lifted up the covers and got into bed with the complainant, laying behind her and hugging her. The appellant pulled the complainant’s underpants down to her ankles, and from behind, he put his penis in the complainant’s vagina. The appellant then moved his body back and forth. The complainant made noises due to the pain. The appellant pushed the complainant’s face into her pillow, in an effort to muffle her noises. This caused great discomfort to the back of the complainant’s head and neck area. The complainant described feeling like she was suffocating. The complainant believed he ejaculated in her vagina, before leaving the complainant’s room, without saying anything.


	
	The acts of sexual intercourse the subject of count 13 and counts 16, 17, and 18 were detailed by the complainant in her fourth record of interview on 31 August 2012. Save for the conduct the subject of count 13, which the complainant said occurred in the study on a day between 31 December 2011 and 1 April 2012 when she was not at school, the sexual intercourse alleged in counts 16-18 occurred in the complainant’s bedroom, on each occasion after she had retired for the night. The conduct comprehended by counts 16 and 17 was alleged to have occurred between 29 February 2012 and 1 May 2012 and the conduct the subject of count 18 between 23 and 26 March 2012.
	
	
	In the Crown’s Summary of Trial, the evidence in respect of those counts is as follows:
	


Count 16

Between 29 February 2012 and 1 May 2012 the complainant (aged 15 years) was in her bed. She was laying under the doona and was wearing her dressing gown only. The appellant walked into her bedroom, threw off the doona covers, and ripped open her dressing gown. The appellant pushed the complainant’s head down with both hands. The appellant pushed his hand down on the complainant’s left shoulder and forced his penis into her vagina. The complainant recalled a lot of pain when the appellant “pushed in and out”, referring to his penis and her vagina. The appellant then withdrew his penis, let go of the complainant’s shoulder and walked out of her bedroom without saying anything.

Count 17

The same evening, the appellant went back to the complainant’s bedroom. The appellant put the complainant’s face into her pillow, then had sexual intercourse (penile-vaginal) with the complainant. The complainant was still wearing her dressing gown, which was open, at this time.

In cross-examination the complainant agreed … she screamed but her face was in the pillow so no-one could hear her. She only screamed when he was aggressive. Her estimate was that she screamed about three times. The appellant often made grunting noises and harsh breathing noises. They were not very loud. He did not make grunting noises every time he had sex with her, but most times.

Count 18

Between 23 March 2012 and 26 March 2012 the appellant played in the Grand Final for his local cricket club. That evening, the complainant (aged 15 years) was at home with her mother. The complainant was asleep in her bed. The complainant was awoken that evening or early the following morning by feeling the appellant’s penis inside her vagina. After the appellant took his penis out of the complainant’s vagina, he left the complainant’s room and went to his bedroom to be with the complainant’s mother. .

In cross-examination the complainant agreed she only woke up when she felt the appellant’s penis inside her vagina. “Well, obviously, being woken up most nights has taken a toll. You know, I wasn’t sleeping. I didn’t sleep during the day so I had to sleep at some point”. It was put to her that there was no incident at all when he went in and commenced sexual intercourse with her while she was asleep. She disagreed, “Well there was”.


	
	The complainant told police in both the second and fourth records of interview that the appellant had sexual intercourse with her on other occasions between late December 2011 (the earliest date of the first act of penile intercourse, the subject of count 10) and 7 April 2012 (being the last act of penile intercourse, the subject of count 19). The complainant also told police that “after the school holidays [in January 2012] it got worse … most of it was in March”.
	
	
	Consistent with what the complainant told police when she was interviewed, her evidence in the trial was that during the 2011/2012 school holidays she persuaded her father to allow her to obtain a prescription for the contraceptive pill on the pretence of it assisting in the regulation of her menses. She said the real reason was she feared she could become pregnant. The prescription was issued on 19 January 2012. It was tendered by the Crown without objection. The appellant’s written submissions at [34] accept that the complainant commenced taking the contraceptive pill on or about that date. According to the complainant’s evidence, the first occasion of penile intercourse occurred no earlier than 31 December 2011. It follows that she was exposed to the risk of pregnancy for a period of weeks before 19 January 2012. To the extent that the analysis undertaken by Adams J proceeds on the assumption that the possibility of pregnancy was raised in the complainant’s evidence because of the alleged frequency of intercourse before she took her own contraceptive measures, I respectfully disagree.
	
	
	The complainant told the police in the fifth interview, on 17 October 2012, that it was after her 15th birthday in October 2011 but before 19 January 2012 (when she started taking the pill) that she experienced the heavy episode of nocturnal bleeding which, months later, she considered an unusual menstrual bleed because it was dark and heavy and accompanied by a discharge of “lumpy, like, black stuff” which she scooped into a tissue and disposed of in the bathroom (the relevant parts of that interview are extracted in the judgment of Adams J at [28]). It is also clear from the complainant’s answer to questions 28 and 74 in that interview, and her evidence in cross-examination (extracted in the judgment of Adams J at [29]), that she attended that interview because her mother had encouraged her to tell police about the handwritten note of her body measurements that her mother had found and about the episode of heavy bleeding, the complainant having apparently told her mother about it (although, according to the complainant, not her specific concerns about it possibly being a miscarriage) when that topic was the subject of discussion in a personal development class at school.
	
	
	I agree with Adams J that it is not to the point that the fifth interview was played to the jury at the request of the accused. Neither is it to the point that defence counsel asked for it to be tendered, it would appear, in some way as laying a foundation, or providing the context, within which to mount a challenge to the complainant’s credit by inviting her to confirm that she had told her mother what her mother reported to Senior Constable Jelsma. (Constable Jelsma’s evidence is extracted in the judgment of Adams J at [27].)
	
	
	There is, of course, no necessary connection between the complainant’s concerns that the unusual episode of heavy bleeding and discharge “may have been something” and what Constable Jelsma recorded of the conversation she had with the complainant‘s mother. The note makes no reference to the complainant possibly suffering a miscarriage or the episode of heavy bleeding at all. What the note records is that the complainant’s mother was told by her daughter that she had in fact been pregnant to the appellant at a time when the complainant’s mother was pregnant with her son (between October 2011 and the Japan trip in April 2012); and that the appellant had performed an abortion and disposed of the aborted foetus.
	
	
	In cross-examination the complainant’s denials that she had told her mother that she was pregnant during her mother’s pregnancy were categorical. The complainant was also categorical that she had not told her mother the appellant performed an abortion, or that he had performed an abortion knowing that she was pregnant to him. While it might not have been defence counsel’s intention to elide the complainant having told her mother she had disposed of the “lumpy black stuff” she scooped from the sheets in the episode of nocturnal bleeding by wrapping it in tissue (something which counsel appeared to accept occurred) with the proposition, he put to her, that she told her mother that she disposed of an aborted foetus by this means, on any fair reading of the cross-examination extracted below, that is what occurred.
	


Q: Well, did you tell your mother that you had been pregnant at the same time as she had been pregnant?

A: No.

Q: Did you tell your mother that [the appellant] was aware of the pregnancy?

A: Look, having conversations with my mum about this stuff – I didn’t because my mum – I hold her in very high regard and I really didn’t feel comfortable and I still don’t feel comfortable telling her what has been going on. She still doesn’t know my version of this, so I didn’t speak to her about anything. Any time a conversation would come up about this, I would feel very uncomfortable and I wouldn’t talk about it.

Q: I just wish to check a very precise form of words. Did you tell your mother that [the appellant] became aware that you had been pregnant?

A: I’m not quite sure.

Q: All right. Did you tell your mother that he had deliberately aborted the foetus?

A: I’m sorry, I don’t know where you’re getting this from, but that’s not accurate.

Q: Do you deny that? Do you deny you said that to your mother?

A: I don’t know where you’re getting these conversations from. Look, I don’t know what was said at the time. I was extremely confused. I was very, very traumatised, and I still am.

Q: I just want to check then, did you tell your mother [the appellant] aborted your foetus?

A: No, I didn’t tell her that.

Q: Because that certainly did not happen, did it?

A: Sir, I don’t think you’re in the position to say that.

Q: [The appellant] did not—

A: You weren’t there.

Q: Did [the appellant] – just when you’re ready. Are you okay?

A: Yes, I’m fine.

Q: I want to put this question to you: did [the appellant] do anything to terminate a pregnancy?

A: No.

Q: Did you tell your mother that you wrapped the foetus in paper towels and a plastic bag and placed it in the bin?

A: Yes.

Q: But that didn’t happen either, did it?

A: Sir, as I said in the interviews, I put it in the toilet and it was in a plastic bag.

Q: The interview actually doesn’t say anything at all about a plastic bag, I want you to accept. What—

A: Yes, but it does say that I put it in the toilet and I used tissues, which I meant toilet paper.


	
	The question for this Court is not what the jury might have made of Constable Jelsma’s evidence in their assessment of the credit of the complainant and her mother (the only basis upon which the police officer’s evidence was admitted and the basis on which questioning of the complainant and her mother concerning it proceeded), nor whether Dr Lyneham’s served report, which canvassed the likelihood of an abortion being performed, was relevant to that question. Neither is it the occasion to consider whether Constable Jelsma’s evidence may have been admitted as first hand hearsay. At trial, defence counsel accepted that the question whether the complainant told her mother that the appellant performed an abortion knowing that she was pregnant to him (a proposition she explicitly denied), and/or whether she told her mother that she disposed of an aborted foetus in the toilet (a proposition with which she did not in fact agree or should not be taken to have agreed since, in my assessment, the cross-examiner and the witness were clearly at cross purposes) were relevant only to the complainant’s credibility (and that of her mother), counsel having expressly disavowed any reliance on what was attributed to the complainant by her mother in what Constable Jelsma recorded the mother reported to the officer for a hearsay purpose. Despite a preliminary submission by defence counsel that the jury could reason to the conclusion that the complainant had in fact told her mother that she disposed an aborted foetus (that is, that she told her mother she had been pregnant), and that he was entitled, in those circumstances, to call evidence form Dr Lyneham as to the implausibility, from a clinician’s perspective, of an abortion being performed in the circumstances detailed in Constable Jelsma’s note, counsel did not ultimately seek to elicit that part of Dr Lyneham’s report. His application was expressly limited to adducing that part of Dr Lyneham’s report concerning the episode of nocturnal bleeding the complainant described in her fifth interview, and the improbability of that being the product of a spontaneous miscarriage. It is not for this Court to revisit the possible relevance of evidence that trial counsel did not seek to elicit, or to reconfigure the basis upon which other parts of Dr Lyneham’s evidence might have been admitted were they pressed.
	
	
	Unlike the broader approach to the question raised by the sole ground of appeal taken by Adams J in response to the wide ranging submissions advanced by the appellant’s senior counsel on the appeal, in my view whether the trial judge was in error in rejecting Dr Lyneham’s evidence concerning the issue of a miscarriage needs to be considered independently of the hearsay report in the evidence of Constable Jelsma that the complainant had been pregnant and had an abortion, and independently of whether the evidence might have been left to the jury as first hand hearsay, that is, that despite the complainant’s denials, the complainant actually said what was attributed to her.
	
	
	The question for this Court is what the jury were entitled to infer, or might have inferred, from the complainant’s account to police about the bleeding episode and her evidence about that episode under cross-examination. Despite the confluence of the “miscarriage scenario” and the “abortion scenario” in the way the cross-examiner posed his questions in cross-examination of the complainant, on the voir dire into the admissibility of Dr Lyneham’s evidence at the end of the Crown case, it was only Dr Lyneham’s opinion as to the likely provenance of the bleeding episode that counsel sought to adduce. It is the discrete question whether the trial judge was in error in rejecting that evidence as being irrelevant to any fact in issue in the proceedings that is raised on the appeal. The focus on that question will inform whether Dr Lyneham’s evidence as to the likely provenance of the uterine bleed as an episode of menstrual bleeding could rationally effect, either directly or indirectly, the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings.
	
	
	I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL that the complainant’s evidence concerning the bleeding episode, taken at its highest, reflected nothing more than a concern that before she started taking the contraceptive pill she might have become pregnant to the appellant and might have miscarried. The appellant’s submission on the appeal that the complainant’s belief that she might have been pregnant at that time led to a “real chance” that she was in fact pregnant, or that the jury might have reasoned to that conclusion, and, that being the case, that Dr Lyneham’s evidence rebutting a miscarriage as a likely explanation for the heavy bleeding was properly admissible was not open. Neither was it the way either the Crown or the accused addressed that aspect of the complainant’s evidence in final addresses. More significantly, the submission that the bleeding led to a “real chance” of pregnancy ignored the complainant’s evidence that the first occasion when she was exposed to the theoretical risk of conception was in the two or three weeks before she commenced to use contraception. On a proper analysis of all the evidence at trial, the complainant’s evidence concerning the episode of heavy bleeding and her retrospective concern about it did not, either directly or by inference, raise in any rational sense the issue as to whether she was in fact pregnant at that time. Neither did the evidence provide any support for an inference that she was or might have been or that there was “a real chance” that she was pregnant.
	
	
	On the appeal, the appellant further submitted that if it were open to the jury to reason to the conclusion that the bleeding incident supported the complainant’s concern that she might have been pregnant (as I understand the submission, so as to support her credit, her credibility being a fact in issue in the trial, since the Crown case was dependent on the jury accepting her evidence beyond reasonable doubt) then Dr Lyneham’s evidence should have been admitted on that basis alone. In my view, Dr Lyneham’s opinion that it was “unlikely and substantially so” that the complainant had spontaneously miscarried was incapable of rebutting the complainant’s concern that she might have been pregnant (and miscarried) since her concern about a possible pregnancy did not depend upon the likelihood that she was in fact pregnant but upon the fact that the appellant had intercourse with her.
	
	
	That being so, the remaining question is the capacity of Dr Lyneham’s evidence to rationally affect, either directly or indirectly, the complainant’s credit in some other way. In order to address that question, consideration needs to be given to the way in which the complainant was cross-examined.
	
	
	Save for one question directed to whether the complainant had told her mother that she thought she had miscarried (which she said she had not), defence counsel limited his questions concerning the issue of miscarriage (cf abortion) to having the complainant confirm that her retrospective concern about the bleeding episode was triggered by the birth of her infant brother and a personal development class at school. Counsel did not challenge the genuineness of her account to police that she believed she might have been (or was concerned she might have been) pregnant at the time of the episode of heaving bleeding. Neither did he put to her, as he might have, that, given her evidence as to when the heavy bleeding occurred (that is, after sexual intercourse started in late December 2011 and before she took the contraceptive pill in January 2012), it was not even remotely possible that she might have been pregnant and shed foetal tissue. Save for putting to the complainant that the appellant had never had sexual intercourse with her, counsel did not directly challenge the genuineness of her belief about the possibility of being pregnant, or the genuineness of her worry or concern when she reflected back on the bleeding episode many months later. Neither did counsel suggest to her that she had utilised the fact of a heavy nocturnal bleed to falsely implicate the appellant in order to add gravitas to her false complaint. Were the cross-examination to have extended that distance, the admission of Dr Lyneham’s evidence under s 108C of the Evidence Act as relevant to her credibility might have succeeded subject to leave under s 108C(1)(c). However, that was not the approach taken by cross-examining counsel at trial.
	
	
	On the approach taken by defence counsel at trial (as to which there is no complaint) the appellant has failed to demonstrate error in the trial judge’s ruling that Dr Lyneham’s evidence was irrelevant and inadmissible.

2701117,NSW Police v Pepper [2016] NSWLC 15,"Judgment

Reasons for decision


	
	On 1 June 2016, NSW Police served a Court Attendance Notice (CAN) on the defendant, for the offence of driving under the influence of certain prescription drugs. The incident for which the CAN was issued occurred on 29 November 2015. The CAN was created and filed on 3 June 2016.
	
	
	It is not in dispute that the prosecution was statute barred due to s 179(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	The CAN required the attendance of the defendant at Lismore Court on 11 July 2016, and she sought legal advice from Mr Riley, who appeared at court to represent his client on the set date. The proceedings were adjourned for representations to 25 July 2016. On 22 July 2016, Mr Riley wrote to the police, noting that the CAN was issued out of time and seeking that the proceedings be withdrawn. On 25 July 2016, Mr Riley again appeared for his client, and the matter was adjourned solely on the issue of costs to 8 August 2016.
	
	
	After hearing submissions I adjourned this matter on the question of costs.
	
	
	There are three issues to be determined. First, what is the appropriate dispensation of the proceedings? Second, does this court have the power to make an order for costs? Third, if the court does have the power, should an order for costs be made?
	


Authorities and Legislation


	
	The key legislative provision is s 213(3)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act (my emphasis):
	


213 When professional costs may be awarded to accused persons 

(1) A court may at the end of summary proceedings order that the prosecutor pay professional costs to the registrar of the court, for payment to the accused person, if the matter is dismissed or withdrawn.

(2) The amount of professional costs is to be the amount that the Magistrate considers to be just and reasonable.

(3) Without limiting the operation of subsection (1), a court may order that the prosecutor in summary proceedings pay professional costs if the matter is dismissed because:

(a) the prosecutor fails to appear or both the prosecutor and the accused person fail to appear, or

(b) the matter is withdrawn or the proceedings are for any reason invalid.

(5) The order must specify the amount of professional costs payable.


	
	It is important to note the Courts Legislation Amendment Act 2006 amended s 213. The second reading speech and the explanatory memoranda do not assist in the interpretation of that section.
	
	
	In DPP v Goben [1999] NSWSC 696 the Local Court was dealing with informations agreed to have been invalid. The magistrate dismissed the proceedings and awarded costs in favour of the defendant. The Supreme Court found that the Magistrate erred in dismissing the proceedings, and that the order ought to have been one of “No Jurisdiction - Struck Out”. Further, the Supreme Court found that dismissing the proceedings was a prerequisite for ordering costs under s 81 of the Justices Act 1902, and as they could not be dismissed, there was no power to make order for costs.
	
	
	The relevant portion of s 81 of the Justices Act in force at that time was as follows:
	


(1A) When making an order dismissing the information, complaint or charge against a defendant, the Justice or Justices may order that the prosecutor or complainant pay to the defendant such professional costs as the Justice or Justices consider to be just and reasonable.


	
	Section 213 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 was apparently amended to overcome this decision. This contention is raised by Luke Brasch of counsel in a paper delivered to the Legal Aid Commission in 2012 [1] , titled “Costs in Criminal Cases”:
	


Section 213 (3)(b) provides for the awarding of costs in cases where the “proceedings are for any reason invalid.” This amendment overcomes the problem that arose in DPP v Goben [1999] NSWSC 696. In Goben, the informations were found by the Magistrate to be invalid as they failed to include an element of the offences. The magistrate proceeded to dismiss the charges and award costs to the successful defendant. The DPP sought an order in the nature of certiorari and the matter was heard by Justice James in the Supreme Court. His Honour agreed that the informations were defective and consequently the charges could not be dismissed. The consequence of that was that the magistrate did not have jurisdiction to award costs.

…

As I have already stated section 213(4) overcomes the problem of Goben. For completeness it is noted that in DPP v Cakici [2006] NSWSC 454 Johnson J at [38] explicitly states that section 213(4) overcomes the difficulty caused by the decision in Goben.


	
	In Cakici, the magistrate had determined that a CAN was defective and dismissed the proceedings. The Supreme Court found that the CAN was not defective and that the court did have jurisdiction to hear the matters. Further, the Supreme Court found that the papers should have been marked “No Jurisdiction” (at [34] to [36]).
	
	
	The court found:
	


37 … I note that the practical context in which this issue was sometimes litigated in earlier cases, such as Goben, related to the power of the Local Court to order costs against a prosecutor in summary proceedings. In Goben, at paragraph 51, it was held that such a costs order could not be made unless a valid information was dismissed.

38 Section 213(4) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 expressly overcomes that past difficulty in that it permits a Local Court to order a prosecutor in summary proceedings to pay costs if the matter is dismissed, because the matter is withdrawn or the proceedings are for any reason invalid.

39 The appropriate order in this case, in my view, if the magistrate was correct in his conclusion (which he was not), was one of “No jurisdiction”.


	
	I note that for all relevant purposes s 213(3) as it presently reads is the same as s 213(4) when Cakici was determined.
	
	
	There are also two relevant Local Court reported judgments. In NSW Police v JG (No 2) [2013] NSWLC 32, Magistrate Buscombe had held that an application for a forensic procedure order was invalid and a nullity, and marked the application ""no jurisdiction"". The relevant statutory provision governing costs in application proceedings was s 69 of the Local Court Act 2007 which provides as follows:
	


(1) The Court may award costs in application proceedings at its discretion and may determine by whom, to whom and to what extent costs are to be paid in or in relation to application proceedings.


	
	After an exhaustive consideration of the authorities, Magistrate Buscombe concluded at [27]:
	


27 … In my opinion, by implication, the power to award costs in application proceedings extends to hearings where the issue of whether or not there is a valid application before the Court is determined. I arrive at that conclusion for the following reasons. The phrase “in application proceedings” is a phrase of generality and width and should be given a wide interpretation. In my opinion the jurisdiction of this Court in application proceedings extends to determining whether or not it has jurisdiction to consider a particular application. There can be no doubt that this Court has jurisdiction to consider an application under the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act which is properly brought. In my opinion “in application proceedings” this Court has implied power to consider whether its jurisdiction has been properly invoked.

28 To hold otherwise would work an apparent injustice. If the Court held that there was a valid application after hearing argument, there could be no doubt that it had power to award costs against the respondent. In my opinion, it would be unjust to give the provision a construction that would deny a successful respondent the ability to seek a costs order in such circumstances, where if the applicant had been successful in the argument, a power to award costs existed. It cannot be reasonably thought that the legislature intended such an unjust result when enacting the provision.


	
	The second decision in the Local Court is Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v McDonald, Ian; Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Maitland, John [2015] NSWLC 7. In that case Magistrate Grogin determined as follows:
	


45 I find that the purported prosecutions were invalid as there was no authority for the CANs to be issued.  There is therefore nothing before this Court to be withdrawn or dismissed.

46 As there is no valid information or matter before the Court, there is no basis or jurisdiction for making a costs order pursuant to ss 117(1)(b) or (d) of the Act as submitted on behalf of the defendants. 

47 The papers will be marked ‘No jurisdiction’.


	
	It is clear that the court was considering costs only under ss 116-117 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which relate to committal proceedings and is markedly different to s 213 quoted above. In particular, the committal costs provisions make no reference to extending costs orders where proceedings are ‘invalid’.
	


The prosecution submissions


	
	The prosecution submits that the court does not have the power to dismiss the matter on the authority of Cakici. Section 213(3) requires, as a prerequisite to an order for costs, that the proceedings be dismissed. As the court has no power to dismiss, then it has no power to make an order for costs.
	


The defence submissions


	
	The defence submits that on a correct reading of s 213, if the proceedings are found to be invalid, whatever the correct notation on the court papers, the court has the power to order costs.
	


Resolution of the Jurisdictional Issue


	
	This is a case requiring application of the rules of statutory interpretation. The prosecution has applied a literal interpretation of the section. They are correct that if such an interpretation is applied, the court cannot make an order for costs because it has no power to dismiss the proceedings.
	
	
	In my view, the strict application of a literal interpretation of the s 213 is not to be preferred. There are five reasons for this.
	
	
	First, although there is no secondary source such as the second reading speech, it is the clear intention of parliament that if proceedings are invalid, the court may make an order for costs. The court in Cakici specifically recognised the section as ‘overcoming’ the rule in Goben.
	
	
	Second, it would be an absurdity for the prosecutions literal interpretation to stand. If that were the case, then no costs award could ever be made against the prosecution for invalid information because it cannot be ‘dismissed’. What work then would s 213(3)(b) have to do? An application of the ‘golden rule’ approach is permissible to avoid an absurd result: Kingston v Keprose Pty Ltd (1987) 11 NSWLR 404.
	
	
	Third, in my view the word ‘dismissed’ in s 213 is somewhat elastic. In Goben at [30], [47], [48] and [50] there are examples where the courts have used the words ‘dismissed’ in the colloquial but not legal sense to denote the dispensation of an invalid information. With reference to those decisions James J found at [50]:
	


It is clear that their Honours were using the word ‘dismiss’ in the sense of quashing proceedings which were incompetent and were not using the word in the sense of dismissing proceedings pursuant to a statutory power to dismiss proceedings which were competent.


	
	The papers may be correctly marked as ‘no jurisdiction’, however to all but the lawyers, that is simply a choice of words. The defendant walks out, the specific prosecution is at an end, and the papers are filed, just as if there were an acquittal after a lengthy hearing.
	
	
	Fourth, there are good public policy reasons for the defence interpretation to be preferred. In costs applications, the court needs to keep in mind that where criminal charge is commenced the full power of the state is brought to bear against an individual. The consequences of not obtaining and paying for legal advice can be significant, including ultimately imprisonment. In the absence of clear, unambiguous legislative intent the court ought to be wary of applying costs limitations in such a manner that provides a bar to recovery of those costs in appropriate cases. This is in accord with NSW Police v JG above.
	
	
	I am mindful that the hurdle of showing some misfeasance still remains in s 214 of the Criminal Procedure Act, as discussed below. Further, I am mindful that whilst in this case the error was discovered early, in some cases the invalidity is only discovered after a hearing has commenced. The costs in such cases could be significant and crippling.
	
	
	Accordingly, I will mark the papers ‘No Jurisdiction’. In my view, there is a power to make an order for costs under s 213 where the proceedings are invalid.
	


The s 214 considerations


	
	The defence contends that pursuant to s 214(b) the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause. A tax invoice was tendered in the sum of $990. No issue was taken with the quantum by the prosecution. Thus, the prosecution made no submissions on the issue of reasonableness. I am satisfied that it is inherently unreasonable to institute proceedings that are out of time and thus cannot succeed. The proceedings should not have been commenced without checking the dates, and it should not have been incumbent on the defendant to incur costs to point that out. The defendant ought to be compensated the rather modest amount sought.
	


Discretion


	
	The prosecution have not tendered the allegation of fact that gave rise to the charge. In those circumstances, it is not possible to make any assessment of the extent to which Ms Pepper has, by virtue of a police error, got away with a serious or dangerous crime. In the end, costs are discretionary and in an appropriate case, it may be that the court declines to make an order for costs where justice demands. However, given the evidence before the court on this occasion, I am inclined to make an order for costs.
	


Orders


	
	The papers are marked “No Jurisdiction”.
	
	
	The prosecution is to pay the defendant’s costs in the sum of $990 within 14 days.

2701118,Olivieri v R [2016] NSWCCA 169,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: Mr Tony Olivieri and a co-defendant, Mr Mark Edward Norman, were tried together before the trial judge and a jury of 12 between 26 July and 28 August 2006. The indictment charged a single count against Mr Olivieri, namely that “[o]n 6th April 2004 at Petersham in the State of New South Wales [Mr Olivieri] did murder Thomas Williams”.
	
	
	The indictment also charged two counts against Mr Norman, namely that Mr Norman was an accessory before the fact to that murder, and that Mr Norman, being a director of M&R Norman Pty Ltd, cheated and defrauded the deceased in his dealings with M&R Norman Pty Ltd, contrary to s 176A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (now repealed). Both men pleaded not guilty. On 28 August 2006, the jury found both Mr Olivieri and Mr Norman guilty of the counts charged against them in the indictment.
	
	
	Both men were sentenced on 5 March 2007: R v Olivieri; R v Norman [2006] NSWSC 882. Mr Olivieri was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 33 years comprising a non-parole period of 28 years commencing on 3 August 2004 and expiring on 2 August 2032 with a balance term of five years expiring on 2 August 2037. Mr Norman was sentenced for a fixed term of three years commencing on 17 August 2004 for the count of cheating and defrauding, and was sentenced on the count of being an accessory before the fact to murder to a term of 35 years comprising a non-parole period of 29 years commencing on 17 August 2006 and expiring on 16 August 2035 with a balance term of six years expiring on 16 August 2041.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri seeks to appeal from his conviction for murder. There is no appeal as to the sentence.
	


Extension of time


	
	Mr Olivieri requires an extension of time in order to bring his conviction appeal, his notice of appeal having been filed on 30 September 2014, some eight years after his conviction. In an affidavit sworn 4 September 2014, Mr Olivieri pointed to his lack of legal representation, delays in his having received documents, and delays in receiving advice from senior counsel on the merits of his proposed appeal, as the explanation for his belated notice of appeal.
	
	
	The Crown conceded that:
	


“if there is any proper basis upon which the appeal ought to be upheld, then the Court would not decline to extend time for leave to appeal merely on the basis that the Applicant is so far out of time”.


	
	Given the nature of the offence for which Mr Olivieri has been convicted, and the significant sentence that was imposed (the bulk of which is yet to be served, despite the substantial delay in filing a notice of appeal), the comprehensiveness of the submissions exchanged, and the attitude of the Crown, there should be an extension of time.
	
	
	Most of the matters which Mr Olivieri wishes to raise are not questions of law, and therefore require leave under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). Once again, there should to the extent necessary be a grant of leave, so that these matters may be addressed on their merits.
	


Crown case


	
	For present purposes, it suffices to set out in general terms the Crown case against Mr Olivieri and Mr Norman at trial. Further details of the facts as established by the evidence will be given when dealing with Mr Olivieri’s submissions on appeal.
	
	
	The deceased was a solicitor, practising from an office in a detached building at his home in Petersham in inner-western Sydney. Mr Norman, an accountant, was a director of M&R Norman Pty Ltd, which carried on an accountancy practice at Burwood, also in inner-western Sydney. The deceased was a client of the practice, where his personal and professional tax returns were prepared.
	
	
	In early November 2003, the deceased drew a number of cheques on the account of his solicitor’s practice made out to the Taxation Office in amounts totalling roughly $83,500. These were delivered to Mr Norman’s office at Burwood for the purpose of meeting outstanding tax liabilities. In fact, Mr Norman deposited them into a trust account, from which he withdrew the funds for his own purposes. This gave rise to the charge of cheating and defrauding.
	
	
	By March 2004, the deceased had discovered Mr Norman’s fraud and confronted him about it. On the Crown case, instead of repaying the funds, Mr Norman arranged for Mr Olivieri to kill the deceased.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri had known Mr Norman for some years, and they were friends. He was employed as a maintenance worker on a property in Queensland which was conducted as a racehorse stable, and in which Mr Norman had an interest with his brother, Mr Grant Norman. (In fact, at least $15,000 of the funds Mr Norman received from the deceased were used in connection with this Queensland property.)
	
	
	On the Crown case, Mr Norman arranged for the deceased to be in his home office on the evening of 6 April 2004 by making an appointment with him which Mr Norman did not intend to keep. Instead, Mr Olivieri was said to have entered the deceased’s office that evening and shot him four times, killing him. It was this conduct that gave rise to the charges of murder and accessory before the fact.
	


Circumstantial case presented by the Crown


	
	There was no direct evidence presented by the Crown implicating Mr Olivieri; the case was entirely circumstantial. There was no fingerprint evidence, or forensic evidence, or DNA evidence linking Mr Olivieri to the scene of the crime.
	
	
	The deceased’s wife had been in the kitchen when her husband was shot and saw the gunman briefly running towards her from her husband’s office. She prepared two images of the gunman she had seen, using the COM-FIT and FACE systems (Exhibits B and C). She said that she was not happy with either picture. She said that she had not been involved in any identification parade or other form of photographic identification.
	
	
	In the Crown case, two witnesses walking home from a restaurant in Petersham gave evidence that they saw a man walking quickly at around 9:15-9:30pm. Neither had a good view of the man. Both said that he was relatively short, one said about 5 foot 6 inches, the other about 5 foot 3 inches to 5 foot 5 inches.
	
	
	Even so, there was a deal of evidence unequivocally linking Mr Olivieri to the scene of the crime.
	


Travel records


	
	Mr Olivieri had travelled to New South Wales on 31 March, returned to Queensland on a flight in his own name on 3 April 2004, and then returned to Sydney from Queensland under a false name on 4 April 2004. He stayed at the Sunnybrook Hotel at Warwick Farm until 7 April 2004. The duty manager said that he checked out at around 10.30am that morning. Mr Olivieri said that he stayed with his mother on the night of 7 April 2004.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri returned to Brisbane on 8 April 2004, using a ticket booked in the name of Mr Norman. Virgin Blue Airlines records showed that the person booking the ticket had supplied a mobile phone number ending in 5625. (I return to the significance of this number below.) Mr Olivieri accepted that, despite the name under which the ticket was issued, it was he who was travelling.
	
	
	Mr Norman had a “Master Rental Agreement” with a hire car company which permitted him to obtain a rental vehicle without producing identification. A vehicle was hired from Granville in western Sydney on 1 April 2004 pursuant to that agreement and returned on 7 April 2004.
	
	
	As will be seen below, Mr Olivieri accepted that he had been in Sydney in the period leading up to the death of the deceased. The false name under which he travelled, and the alibi evidence to be referred to below, are consistent only with his not wishing it to be known that he was in Sydney. On the Crown case, that was because he had undertaken to kill the deceased. According to Mr Olivieri, that was because he was dealing in illicit drugs.
	


The telephone records of 5 and 6 April 2004


	
	Mr Olivieri’s mobile phone records were in evidence. His phone number ended in 9419. (That phone had originally been subscribed to in a different name; how Mr Olivieri came to be using it is not clear.) Calls were made from or to that number on each of 5 and 6 April 2004.
	
	
	On the evening of 5 April (the day before the deceased was killed), Mr Olivieri’s number made calls of 45 seconds, 29 seconds, 5:02 minutes and 5:32 minutes between 6:42pm and 7:36pm to a number ending in 5625. In each case the call was transmitted by a base station at Petersham located around 400m from the deceased’s house. There was expert evidence (based on the time of day and apparent lack of congestion in the network) that the handset was located in the vicinity of that station when those calls were made.
	
	
	Each of those four conversations was between Mr Norman and Mr Olivieri. Each man accepted that the telephone calls were made. When asked what was discussed, over four calls on the same evening, Mr Olivieri said: “Just talking about, mostly about work, the last two conversations.” Mr Norman said that he was asking Mr Olivieri questions about work that was being done on the property in Queensland.
	
	
	The Crown case was that it had been intended that Mr Olivieri kill the deceased on 5 April. Mrs Williams gave evidence that her husband had been expecting Mr Norman that evening, but that at around 7.30pm the deceased told Mrs Williams that Mr Norman “had a flat tyre, so he can’t make it tonight”. The deceased’s secretary also said that he had made a comment about a flat tyre and was seeing Mr Norman on the evening of 6 April. A solicitor employed by the deceased gave evidence that the deceased had been expecting to see Mr Norman on 5 April, and had been told that the latter had had a flat tyre but was expected to meet him that night. Their recollection of the conversation was not put in issue by either accused. Mr Norman accepted that he cancelled the planned meeting saying that he had a flat tyre.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri was granted a certificate under s 128 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) and said that on 5 April 2004 he had travelled to Leichhardt (a suburb adjoining Petersham) from Cabramatta, by taxi, “[t]o score drugs”. Mr Olivieri said that he told his contact what he needed, “he said he’d be back in half an hour, he went and picked it up, delivered it, I gave him money and I left”. He said he had bought an ounce of “speed” to be sold later that evening, for a profit, in Cabramatta.
	
	
	Mr Norman’s telephone records were also in evidence. On the evening of 5 April 2004 he was in Richmond in far western Sydney attending a course. At 7:42pm he made a short call of 23 seconds from his handset (whose number ended in 5625) to the deceased’s office number. He accepted that it was in that call that he cancelled the meeting for that evening, saying that he had a flat tyre. It will be noted that that call was made a mere 26 seconds after the last of the four calls made by Mr Olivieri to Mr Norman that evening.
	
	
	Later that evening, at 9:08pm and 9:11pm, further calls (of 22 seconds and 1:02 minutes) were made to Mr Olivieri’s mobile phone from the same number ending in 5625. Those two calls were transmitted by a base station at Warwick Farm in south-western Sydney. Mr Norman said that he had “absolutely no idea” why he made those calls.
	
	
	The following day was the day on which the deceased was killed. Three telephone calls were made to triple 0 that evening. The first was made by an unidentified person, commencing at 9.14.30pm, lasting for 40 seconds. The second was made by a neighbour who heard shots. Although the time that call commenced is not disclosed in the appeal materials, it concluded at 9.15.40pm and the transcript suggests it too was a short call. The third call was made by the deceased’s 12 year old son, and commenced at 9.17.00pm. These calls establish that the deceased was shot shortly before 9.14pm, a time which was, as will be seen below, an important element of the Crown case.
	
	
	There was a public phone box in Charles Street, Petersham, near the deceased’s house. Two calls from that phone box were made to Mr Norman on the evening of 6 April 2004, at 8:43pm and 8:47pm, for around 70 and 78 seconds respectively. Mr Norman said that there was someone who rang him that evening asking about horses he had for sale. The coincidence was put to him in cross-examination:
	


“Q: And that was just an extraordinary coincidence that you happened to get a phone call from what happens to be the nearest public phone box to Tom Williams’ place?

A: I didn’t know it was near Tom Williams’ place.

Q: It wasn’t Mr Olivieri ringing when he was just up the street in Norton Street, was it?

A: Definitely not.”


	
	Mr Olivieri was, once again, in the Petersham area that evening. At 9:08pm on 6 April 2004, Mr Olivieri’s phone received a call from a Queensland landline in the name of David Whitehouse. The signal was transmitted, again, from the Petersham Millers base station. The call lasted 30 seconds. Mr Olivieri said he could not remember receiving a call from Mr David Whitehouse on that evening. One submission prominent in Mr Olivieri’s appeal relates to the timing of that call, some five minutes before the deceased was killed.
	
	
	Mr Whitehouse gave evidence that he was an acquaintance of Mr Olivieri who used to call him frequently (he variously said “three or four times a week and “ten or twenty times over a period of a couple of months”). Mr Whitehouse also gave evidence, admitted over the objection of counsel for Mr Olivieri, but subject to a direction in accordance with Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573, that when he met Mr Olivieri in around March 2004, he saw the butt of a pistol in Mr Olivieri’s belt (“It was a grey colour, like a square, like, being similar to the Glock pistol that the police wear”). He said that in around May 2004, Mr Olivieri said the pistol was “a piece of shit” and “it fell apart”. He was cross-examined vigorously on this aspect of his evidence. However, the cross-examiner did not dispute that the call had been made at 9.18pm from Mr Whitehouse’s landline to Mr Olivieri on 6 April 2004. There was evidence that in addition to two spent bullets and four fired cartridge cases found at the scene, there were two pieces of metal identified as a “holding open device” and a “retaining clip” of a pistol. (This is relevant to the grounds below dealing with DNA evidence and the evidence of Mr Whitehouse.)
	
	
	Mr Olivieri said that on 6 April 2004, he caught a taxi from Warwick Farm to Norton Street in Leichhardt, where (according to Mr Olivieri) he was once again travelling to enter into a drug transaction. This time he said he had arranged to buy two ounces of “speed”. Mr Olivieri said he went to the same coffee shop in Leichhardt, met the same man, waited for him to supply the drugs, and returned to Cabramatta.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri was confronted with the coincidence that he had received a telephone call, transmitted from the Petersham Millers base station, just minutes after the deceased’s death as follows:
	


“Q: And the fact that you were in the Petersham Millers area, phone call area, at 8 minutes past 9 on the night the man died, and the fact you are there the night before, is just a terrible coincidence?

A: It was not a coincidence. I had to be there to get some drugs, I told you that already.”


	
	Mr Olivieri changed his phone number shortly after 6 April 2004. According to him, that was because “I lost my phone”.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri maintained that he never met the deceased, and denied that he saw him and killed him on 6 April 2004 because Mr Norman had asked him to do so.
	


The controlled operation


	
	On and after 10 June 2004, police conducted a controlled operation, monitoring and recording telephone calls from services being used by Messrs Olivieri and Norman. The evidence obtained is important in this appeal, and much of Mr Olivieri’s submissions complain about aspects of this operation and the evidence obtained from it.
	
	
	On 9 June 2004, a Deputy Commissioner of Police gave approval to undertake a controlled operation. The authorisation appears not to have been before the jury, but was tendered on appeal. Pursuant to ss 6 and 8 of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997 (NSW), a number of police officers were authorised to conduct the following controlled activities:
	


“Conversations and any act or omission concerning the making of false statements and/or false images, the publishing or offering for publication of those false statements and/or false images to any New South Wales based media outlets including radio, television and print media in relation to the murder of Thomas Leonard WILLIAMS”.


	
	The authority was subject to a number of conditions, including, relevantly for present purposes:
	


“Conduct is NOT authorised for release in Brisbane or outside NSW (ie media releases are to be made to Sydney based outlets only).”


	
	Further, the certificate includes the following text, with the words struck-through:
	


“In so doing

(i) the following authorised law enforcement participants may operate under an assumed name”.


	
	There followed the list of the authorised officers. The form also made provision for “authorised civilian participants”, and for identifying which civilian participants could operate under an assumed name and which could not. The entirety of that section was struck through.
	
	
	It is plain that no civilian participants were authorised. Mr Olivieri made submissions in relation to the struck-through words in relation to authorised law enforcement participants, and of the restriction to Sydney based media outlets.
	
	
	A photograph and a print media article were released and published in the Daily Telegraph on 10 June 2004, under the title “Face in the frame over a murder”. The photograph that was released was one of Mr Olivieri (taken from the RTA database) but altered to make it look like a computer-generated image. The article appears not to have been tendered at the trial, but was tendered on the appeal. It stated:
	


“Detectives hunting the killer of solicitor Tom Williams yesterday released an image of a man they want to find.

The bald-headed man was seen acting suspiciously in the area at the time the 41-year-old father-of-two was gunned down.

...

Police yesterday released this image of a man acting suspiciously in Charles St – close to Petersham TAFE – shortly before the murder. They are keen to identify him.”


	
	The police obtained a series of warrants to monitor the telephone services of Mr Norman and Mr Olivieri: two on 18 May 2004, a further warrant on 11 June 2004 and a fourth warrant on 2 July 2004. Further warrants were obtained for other telephone intercepts and the installation of listening devices. It was not suggested that the warrants were invalid, as opposed to the controlled operation itself.
	
	
	A police officer gave evidence in relation to the controlled operation:
	


“Q: And your intention in doing that was to precipitate conversation about this offence which could be picked up by way of telephone intercept or a listening device that was already in place, that is right?

A: That is right.”

Conversations between Mr Olivieri and Mr Ray Johnson on 10 June 2004


	
	Two conversations were recorded between Mr Olivieri and an acquaintance, Mr Ray Johnson, on 10 June 2004, the day the article was published. Mr Johnson initiated the first call, at 12.22pm. After exchanging greetings, the conversation continued (V1 is Mr Olivieri):
	


“V1: What are you up to mate?

V2: You don’t get the Sydney papers up there do you?

V1: No.

V2: Mm.

V1: Why?

V2: Ah, (Laughs) I think your photo is in it. (Pause) Also I mean – look, try to get today’s Sydney paper and have a look through there, you know.

V1: Mm.

V2: All right mate?

V1: (Pause) Does it look like me?

V2: Oh, it’s – well yeah, spitting image, yeah.

V1: Hey?

V2: Spitting image mate.

V1: Dead set?

V2: Yeah.

…

V1: Do you think I’m in trouble mate?

V2: Ah, you’d have to read the thing, but it just says that – it says that – it just says, ‘a man answering this description is wanted for questioning...’ was seen acting, ‘this person was seen acting suspiciously near a high school.’ On that – you know about the time of this thing that happened down there and ah, whoever saw it mate, it was just like a photo, photo – you know fuckin’ unbelievable you know.

V1: Exactly like me?

V2: Yeah, bloody oath.

V1: Shit.

V2: But it’s only wanted to be spoken to about you know being in the area at the time type thing, you know.

V1: Mm. On that day?

V2: Yes, yeah at that time. Ah – well mate you weren’t there and that’s it, you know.

V1: Mm.

V2: Ah, yes.

V1: That’s bad eh (sounds like) Ray?

V2: Well you know yeah, yeah I reckon it is, yeah. But ah, but you got hair – this guy’s got – like he’s got his hair shaved, you know, head shaved, otherwise it’s the spitting image of you, you know.

V1: Oh right.

V2: Okay mate?

V1: Mm hm.

V2: See if you can get it and have a look anyway.

V1: Yeah, I will.

V2: Yeah.

V1: Okay, catch you mate.

V2: Okay, see you mate, see you later mate. (Call concluded)”


	
	The second conversation commenced at 12:35pm on the same day, and was initiated by Mr Olivieri. He said that he couldn’t get a copy of the paper. After some exchanges about the possibility of sending the page by fax, there was the following:
	


“V2: You might be better off just going and buying one mate, at the airport.

V1: Yeah.

V2: I reckon, don’t you?

V1: Yeah, but it’s too – I can’t get there. That’s the only problem mate.

V2: You can’t, I’d hire a car mate, I’d do anything, you know.

V1: Is it that bad is it mate?

V2: I reckon it is, yeah.

V1: Ah.

V2: It’s just you, you know it’s the photograph, it just looks like your photo, you know. But as I said to everyone, you’ve got hair. Like this guy’s got his hair shaved you know.

V1: Yeah.

V2: You got me? Yeah.

V1: Yeah. Fuckin’ hell.

V2: Mm, it’s on page nineteen.

V1: Eh?

V2: Page nineteen of today’s paper.

V1: Oh right mate. Is it a big picture?

V2: Oh, it’s about three by three you know.

V1: Oh right.

V2: Three inches by three inches probably.

V1: Oh, I think I’m gone then eh, Ray?

V2: Well no, I wouldn’t – well no I (unintelligible) just ‘cause it’s some photo that looks like you doesn’t mean that it’s you, you know.

...

V1: Mm, fuckin’ hell. Ah, which paper is it mate?

V2: Ah, the Tele.

V1: Fuck me dead. I can’t believe this mate.

V2: A bloke came in and said, ‘Tony’s in the paper’. (Laughs) So I got the paper and I looked. And I thought well it does look a bit like you, except you’ve got hair and this guy’s got his hair shaved you know.

V1: Oh fuck. People are going to be fuckin’ recognising me aren’t they mate?

V2: Oh, yeah. It’s unbelievable the likeness mate. I – it’s like they’ve got – found your photo and put it straight on there, you know.

V1: Oh for fuck’s sake.

V2: Mm.

V1: I’m – you know what I was worried – all I’m worried about mate um, the motel, you know what I mean, mate.

V2: Mm.

V1: You know what I’m saying don’t you, Ray?

V2: No, not really, no.

V1: Where I stayed.

V2: Well yeah, it wasn’t near there was it?

V1: Eh?

V2: When you saw your mum, that – it’s nowhere near there though?

V1: No, that’s true.

V2: Mm. Oh, yeah, mm. Anyway mate, look just take it easy, you know, you know it wasn’t you and that’s all you got to remember, you know.”

Conversation between Mr Olivieri and Mr Norman on 10 June 2004


	
	Later that evening, at 6:16pm, there was a conversation between Mr Olivieri (V1) and Mr Norman, initiated by Mr Norman. Very early on, Mr Olivieri said, “I know all about it”. When asked by Mr Norman “I wasn’t sure if you got any phone calls today or not” Mr Olivieri responded “Yeah, I got a phone call mate”. The conversation proceeded:
	


“V1: Listen, I’m going to have to go away for a while mate.

V2: I think so.

…

V1: No, ah, yeah just don’t want to um, you know what I mean?

V1: Yeah, yeah. Um, I’m (Laughs) I don’t know how to say this, but I’m going to need a little bit of money mate, you know what I mean?

V2: Yes, I know.

V1: Okay buddy.

V2: Yeah. I’ll have to – see at the moment I’m sort of fairly skint, but I’ll – yeah, we’ll get some and sort of have to fix something up.

V1: Yeah, well see I – me mate’s going to give me a ring, in about half an hour or so, he’s going to give me a phone number, then I’ve got to go see this bloke and he’s going to um, take me somewhere, you know what I mean?

…

[V2]: Yeah. Did they actually – did they actually tell you, read the article (sounds like) to you?

V1: I didn’t read it, no. I got it.

V2: Okay.

V1: I saw it, and then I burned it mate, you know what I mean? ‘Cause I didn’t want to (unintelligible)…

V2: Is it up there as well?

V1: Eh?

V2: Is it up there as well?

V1: No, I had to go to the airport and grab it.

V2: Yeah, okay, all right.

V1: So yeah.

V2: I was actually – I actually had one, I was going to see if you wanted it or not, that’s all.

V1: No, no, no. I actually went and got it mate, but I didn’t read it.

V2: Yeah.

V1: Why? Is it bad?

V2: No, no, just that it said, ‘acting suspiciously in the area’, that’s all.

V1: Yeah. Mate, well you know I mean just the similarity doesn’t mean nothing mate, you know what I mean?

...

V2: Just thinking – are you on your phone or a ...

V1: Yeah.

V2: ... Okay, that’s all right.

V1: Yeah, but it’s a new one, you know what I mean, mate?

V2: Yeah, that’s okay. So is this.

V1: Oh, okay.

V2: Um, yeah, you’ll just have to have um, slightly longer hair mate.

V1: I have.

V2: Mm?

V1: I have

V1: Okay, good.”


	
	Six days later, on 16 June, there was another conversation recorded between Mr Olivieri (V2) and Mr Norman at 2:42pm. After mentioning that two of Mr Olivieri’s acquaintances had been interviewed by police, there was the following exchange:
	


“V2: Did they um, get a statement off Pete?

V1: No they didn’t, they spoke to him on the phone.

V2: What, that I was working that week and he told ‘em I was, which I was mate.

V1: Mm hm.

V2: ‘Cause we were painting, remember?

V1: Yep, yeah.

V2: So what’s the fuckin’ problem?

V1: I don’t know, I don’t know. You know. Look, to be quite honest I’m not overly concerned about it, ‘cause it’s just going to show well yeah, you were up there, that’s all there is to it.

V2: Yeah, I know, I got witnesses mate to say I was up here.

V1: Mm hm. That’s all you need to do.”

Mr Olivieri in Queensland and Western Australia


	
	On the morning of 18 June 2004 there was a further telephone conversation recorded between Mr Olivieri (V2) and Mr Norman. Mr Olivieri gave Mr Norman details of a Suncorp Bank Account in the name of Ms Dorothy Kapor. The men then discussed what they were aware of the ongoing police investigations, and then there was the following exchange:
	


“V1: So as far as I’m concerned and as far as – you know as far as I know and you say to me that – you’re in Queensland. That’s all I need to know about it.

V2: Yeah, well I was mate.

V1: Yeah, that’s exactly right and I…

V2: And I got witnesses.

V1: Exactly right. And we’ve got people up there to say, no, you were in Queensland at the time.

V2: I was working. (Laughs)

V1: Exactly right.

V2: And I even got one from Sydney to say I was up there.

V1: Yeah, exactly.

V2: Mm. When you go – can you go put it in now for me? Um, Mark?

V1: Yep, okay. How much do you need.

V2: How much can you put in for me mate?

V1: I don’t know, I’ll have to go and find some money. I got – mate I’m talking about finding anything I can at the moment.

V2: Oh.

V1: So it’ll be next hour or so probably a gorilla, maybe fifteen hundred.

V2: Oh, can you make it at least two please, I’m – ‘cause I’ve wanted to um, keep something going, you know what I mean, mate?

V1: Okay. I’ll try and see what I can do buddy.

V2: Okay, so what, in an hour it will be there will it?

V1: Yeah, in the next hour or so.

V2: Yeah, ‘cause I got to go, I want to go get it out mate, you know what I mean?

V1: Righto buddy.”


	
	Later on 18 June, an administrative assistant in Mr Norman’s firm deposited $2,000 into an account in the name of Ms Dorothy Kapor. Ms Kapor gave evidence that she knew Mr Olivieri, that she gave him details of a bank account that she was not using that he could use, that he then gave the details of the bank account to a friend, and that he and she withdrew $2000 for him on 18 June. Ms Kapor was not cross-examined about the transaction involving the $2,000 given to Mr Olivieri, and the deposit and withdrawal slips were in evidence.
	
	
	On 21 June, Mr Norman is recorded in an intercepted telephone conversation with Mr Olivieri as saying that the police were likely to arrest Mr Olivieri and bring him to New South Wales, but then said:
	


“I think that’s what they’ll do, and then you know we’ve got the – we’ve got all the people that have got witnesses that say you went up there. You did testimony to say you were up there. So I don’t see how they’re going to be able to do that. But anyway. The problem is that um, ah, it’s a good possibility they’ll sort of take you in and then you’ll have to wait until they decided to um, run a case.”


	
	Mr Olivieri then added:
	


“V2: (Unintelligible) you know what I think I should do, I think I should leave the country for a while.

V1: Yeah, it mightn’t be a bad idea. But, you know how are you going to do that?

V2: Mm, that’s a good question isn’t it?

V1: You know? And where are you going to go? Oh, I know where you can go, you’ve got relatives over there haven’t you?

V2: I wasn’t going to go over there, but yeah, still ...”


	
	Later that evening, Mr Olivieri rang Mr Norman to say that police had taken all of his clothes and shoes and bank statements. Mr Olivieri then said “Geez I – did I get rid of – I hope I got rid of all the soaps and that that I had in there”. He then said “no, I don’t think it’s got the name of the motel or anything, no”. The men then said (Mr Olivieri is V2):
	


“V2: ... oh a sewing kit might be in there.

V1: Mm hm.

V2: I had a couple of sewing kits I used to (unintelligible).

V1: Yep yep.

V2: But I – yeah I just can’t remember now mate.

V1: Yeah.

V2: If I threw all them – all that sewing thing away or not.

V1: Yeah, I think you would have [done] that.

V2: Hey?

V1: I think you would have in this instance.

V2: Did I throw ‘em away?

V1: I think you probably would have in this instance, you know you wouldn’t have kept anything.

V2: Yeah, I think I did keep a sewing kit, but it’s just got – it’s got – it hasn’t got their name, it’s just got a pattern on it, you know what I mean, mate?”


	
	On 12 July 2004, Mr Olivieri was seen at a motel in Mount Isa in central Queensland. On 2 August 2004, Mr Olivieri was arrested at Kununurra in remote Western Australia and extradited to New South Wales. When Mr Olivieri was taken into custody at Kununurra, he had a backpack containing an amount of personal property including a sewing kit.
	


Grounds 1(i) and 4 – the Controlled Operation


	
	Grounds 1(i) and 4 of the appeal challenge the validity of the controlled operation authority. In support of these grounds, Mr Olivieri relied upon some 14 single spaced pages of submissions (apparently prepared by him): written submissions filed 30 September 2014, pp 1-11, 21-23. In what follows, I will attempt, as best I can, to identify all aspects of the complaints advanced by Mr Olivieri. Save in relation to the involvement of Mr Johnson (whose 10 June call with Mr Olivieri is set out above), Mr Olivieri did not wish to elaborate this aspect of his appeal orally.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri’s first submission was that the controlled operation certificate was invalid because it had been produced for an improper purpose. He submitted that its dominant purpose was to abrogate established rules. In particular, Mr Olivieri maintained that there was clearly sufficient evidence for his arrest (the identification evidence from Mrs Williams and the information from Mr Johnson) and in not arresting him there was a “deliberate failure to adhere to statute”. Secondly, Mr Olivieri complained of a failure to disclose the role of Mr Johnson at trial. Thirdly, he pointed to a “disregard for the safety of participants in the operation, of Olivieri and … of third parties”. Fourthly, he submitted that the controlled operation deliberately induced a “guilty state of mind” in him, designed to elicit ambiguous utterances capable of being construed as admissions.
	
	
	The operation of the Act is authoritatively stated by the High Court in Gedeon v NSW Crime Commission [2008] HCA 43; 236 CLR 120. It will not be necessary for present purposes to summarise comprehensively the legislation or the body of law relating to it. It suffices to state that the authority authorises law enforcement participants to do something which would otherwise be unlawful. Section 16 states:
	


“Despite any other Act or law, an activity that is engaged in by a participant in an authorised operation in the course of, and for the purposes of, the operation is not unlawful, and does not constitute an offence or corrupt conduct, so long as it is authorised by, and is engaged in in accordance with, the authority for the operation.”


	
	Relevantly, s 8(2) requires that an authority:
	


“(c) must identify each person who may engage in controlled activities for the purposes of the operation, and

(d) must state whether or not any such person may operate under an assumed name”.


	
	Section 7(1)(b) (coincidentally, the critical provision in Gedeon) provides that:
	


“An authority to conduct a controlled operation must not be granted in relation to a proposed operation that involves any participant in the operation:

...

(b) engaging in conduct that is likely to seriously endanger the health or safety of that or any other participant, or any other person, or to result in serious loss or damage to property”.


	
	Although he did not frame the submissions as such, it may be accepted that if Mr Olivieri could establish an invalidity in the authority, or a non-compliance with any of its conditions, then at least in principle there would be scope for a submission that evidence should have been excluded, including pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act. However, even though Mr Gedeon succeeded in the High Court, the subsequent litigation shows that invalidity of the authority does not mean that evidence will necessarily be excluded: see Gedeon v R [2013] NSWCCA 257; 237 A Crim R 326 at [179]-[181].
	
	
	The primary judge heard argument over three days in the second week of the trial and ultimately, on 8 August 2006, admitted over the objection of counsel for Mr Olivieri some 12 recordings and transcripts of intercepted telephone calls, subject to the excision by consent of some material which was, in his Honour’s view, “clearly prejudicial”. His Honour gave reasons for that ruling on 4 September 2006 (after the jury had returned a guilty verdict): R v Olivieri; R v Norman [2006] NSWSC 882. In light of the importance of the intercepted telephone transcripts to the trial, and to Mr Olivieri’s appeal, I reproduce his Honour’s reasons at [3]-[19], despite their length:
	


“All the calls were made after the publication of an article about the shooting of the deceased in the Sydney Daily Telegraph on 10 June 2004. That article followed a press release by the police, together with the release of an image said to be that of a man seen acting suspiciously in the area near the deceased’s home at the relevant time. The clear implication of the press release, and of the article, was that that man was suspected to have been the gunman. I received the press release, the article, and an article to the same effect in the Sydney Morning Herald of 11 June 2004, as exhibit G on the voir dire.

After the shooting the deceased’s widow had helped police compile a COMFIT image and a FACE image of the gunman, whom she had seen running from the office where her husband had been shot. The image released by the police for publication on 10 June was neither of those. It was a photograph of Mr Olivieri, modified to give the appearance of a computer generated image. What the newspaper articles conveyed to the reader was that that image had been able to be compiled by a witness or witnesses who had seen such a man in the area at the time of the shooting.

This was false, to the knowledge of the investigating police. It was a subterfuge for which they sought and obtained authority under s 8 of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997. I received a copy of that authority as exhibit F on the voir dire. Telephone intercepts on the mobile phones of Mr Olivieri and his co-accused, Mr Norman, were in place before the issue of the press release. The purpose of the subterfuge, no doubt, was to engender phone conversations in which the accused made statements implicating themselves in the murder.

On 10 June Mr Olivieri, then in Queensland, had two telephone conversations with a friend, Ray Johnson, in Sydney: calls D and E of exhibit CC. Mr Johnson told him about the Telegraph article and, in particular, of the publication of an image bearing a startling resemblance to him. Mr Olivieri expressed concern a number of times about this development, even saying (in call E) that he thought that he was ‘gone’. Later that same day there was a call between the two accused (call F), in which the matter was discussed and Mr Olivieri said that he would ‘have to go away for a while …’.

The remaining calls were made over the period of about two weeks thereafter. There is no need to refer to each of them. They contain further references to the newspaper article and disclose a continuing interest in the development of the investigation into the murder. Mr Olivieri on several occasions asserted that he was in Queensland at the time of the shooting, and he and Mr Norman discussed witnesses who might have given evidence to that effect. However, he also expressed concern that police who searched the property in Queensland where he had been living might find items from a motel in Sydney at which he had been staying at the time of the shooting.

Put briefly, the Crown Prosecutor relied on the calls as evidence of knowledge on the part of Mr Olivieri of the murder such as to suggest that he was involved in it, and a concern about the newspaper article and the continuing police investigation born of a fear that his involvement might be detected. She proposed to put to the jury that his apparent protestations of innocence on the basis that he was in Queensland at the time were in fact part of a process of concocting with his co-accused a false account to be given to the police.

Some of the calls contain discussions between the two accused about the payment of money by Mr Norman to Mr Olivieri. Mr Austin did not object to that material, accepting that it was admissible as evidence of their continuing relationship. Otherwise, the first basis of his objection was that the calls were irrelevant because they contained no statement by Mr Olivieri which could constitute an admission of involvement in the murder. He relied upon s88 of the Evidence Act, and I accept that that section extends to the question whether a representation is capable of constituting an admission. I would respectfully adopt the view of Greg James J in R v Hall & Ors [2001] NSWSC 827 at [27] – [29].

True it is that no explicit admission of involvement in the murder is to be found in any of the calls. Indeed, as already referred to, some of Mr Olivieri’s statements amounted on their face to protestations of innocence. Otherwise, Mr Austin argued, what was said was at most ambiguous and was consistent with the state of mind of a man wrongly suspected of a serious crime. However, I took the view that the significance of the calls was a matter for the jury and that they were fairly open to the interpretation for which the Crown Prosecutor had contended. That being so, they could be said to contain admissions, being representations adverse to the accused’s interest in the outcome of the proceeding: see the definition of ‘admission’ in Part 1 of the Dictionary to the Evidence Act. In any event, however they might be classified, I considered that the calls were relevant as part of the Crown’s circumstantial case.

Mr Austin’s second and alternative argument was that, if the calls did contain admissions, they should be rejected upon the basis that to admit them would be unfair to the accused, within the meaning of s 90 of the Evidence Act, or for reasons of public policy under s 138. Thirdly, he argued that, even if the evidence were found to be admissible otherwise than as admissions, it should still be rejected under s 138.

He submitted that the situation was analogous to that of police making a false or misleading representation to a suspect in the course of an interview, in the hope of inducing an admission: cf s 138(2)(b) of the Evidence Act. It was said that the evidence should not be allowed as admissions because it would be unfair to the accused to do so and because, in any event, the balancing act required by s 138(1) should lead to its rejection. Mr Austin emphasised that the argument was only by way of analogy, acknowledging that the evidence was not the product of a police interview (or of ‘official questioning’, as that expression is used in Part 3.4 of the Evidence Act).

The arguments are related, and both require consideration of the fact that the misleading article in the Telegraph was published pursuant to an authority under the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act. This is not the occasion to consider the rationale and legislative history of that Act, or to examine its provisions in any detail. Section 16 provides that an activity engaged in under an authority under s 8 ‘is not unlawful, and does not constitute an offence or corrupt conduct, so long as it is authorised by, and is engaged in in accordance with, the authority for the operation’. ‘Corrupt conduct’ is defined as bearing the meaning it has in the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988.

Whether the issue of the misleading press release in the present case was ‘unlawful’, or could constitute ‘an offence or corrupt conduct’, is far from clear. No basis on which it might be considered to be unlawful or to amount to corrupt conduct was articulated in argument. The question remains whether it might amount to an ‘impropriety’ within the meaning of s 138 of the Evidence Act and, if so, whether an authority under the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act is effective to deprive it of that character.

Another provision of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act which might have a bearing in the present case is s 3A, relevant parts of which are as follows:

3A Act not to affect certain matters

(1) This Act does not affect, and is taken never to have affected, the existence or exercise of any discretions (including any administrative or judicial discretions) that, apart from this Act, may lawfully be exercised in relation to the commencement, conduct or conclusion of legal proceedings.

(2) Without limiting subsection (1), the discretions referred to in that subsection include the following:

(a)…

(b) any discretion as to whether or not evidence should be admitted in legal proceedings,

(c) …

The ambit of s 3A and s 16 was raised, but not developed, in argument. The matter was not the subject of research and full argument, and it would be inappropriate for me to express any concluded view about it. I took the view that the evidence should not be rejected under s 90 or s 138 even if it were assumed, without deciding, that the publication was improper and that it was not validated by its authority as a controlled operation.

The view I took of the balancing exercise under s 138 was the same, whether or not the evidence was relevant as a series of admissions or otherwise as part of the Crown’s circumstantial case. Having regard to the matters set out in s 138(3), I assessed the evidence as important and as having substantial probative value. I did not consider any impropriety to be grave, noting that it was neither deliberate nor reckless. Indeed, there was nothing to suggest other than that the investigating police, and the senior authorising officer, saw the issue of the press release as a legitimate investigative tool, appropriately authorised as a controlled operation.

As to s 90, I saw no relevant unfairness to the accused. There is no true analogy with a misrepresentation by police to a suspect under interrogation. Certainly, the evidence might be seen as the product of a subterfuge but, like it or not, subterfuge is an accepted part of police investigation, particularly of serious crime. It is, for example, an inherent part of every undercover operation. To the extent that it led to relevant and significant evidence in the present case, it was not unfair to use it against Mr Olivieri.

Mr Austin also relied upon s 137 of the Evidence Act but, for the reasons I have already given, it could not be said that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice to his client. I should add that that argument was directed primarily to a particular matter which, in the event, was not pressed because Mr Austin decided not to adduce evidence on the voir dire about it.”


	
	First, it was entirely understandable that investigating police chose not to arrest Mr Olivieri and have him participate in an identification parade. It was clear that the only witness who might be able to identify him was Mrs Williams. She had only seen the gunman briefly. Because Mrs Williams regarded the images she had prepared as being poor, she herself might have failed to identify Mr Olivieri. Alternatively, even if she did identify Mr Olivieri as the gunman, her identification might not have been regarded as sufficiently reliable, given her own expressions of doubt. It follows that Mr Olivieri’s first complaint, that the purpose of the controlled operation was improper by reason of the availability of the conventional approach of arrest, caution, and offer of opportunity to participate in an identification parade, is not well founded.
	
	
	The purpose of the operation was precisely that anticipated by the Act. No differently from any other controlled operation, the effect of a certificate under s 27 of the Act is to authorise something which otherwise would be unlawful. The primary judge plainly appreciated the purpose of the operation (“This was false, to the knowledge of the investigating police. It was a subterfuge ... The purpose of the subterfuge, no doubt, was to engender phone conversations in which the accused made statements implicating themselves in the murder”). No error is thereby shown.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Johnson, Mr Olivieri relied on an affidavit of Mr Alec Shalala made on 8 January 2012. Mr Shalala was, when he swore that affidavit, in custody at Lithgow Correctional Centre. He deposed to a conversation he said he had had some five years earlier, in the Bandido Clubhouse at Leichhardt, with Mr  Johnson. Mr Johnson told Mr Shalala that a police officer had told him that Mr Olivieri was a person of interest in a murder of a solicitor in Leichhardt, and had said:
	


“I want you to ring Tony Olivieri and tell him to get today’s Sydney newspaper as it has a[n] identikit picture of him in it, and if [Mr Johnson] done that his charges would be dropped.”


	
	Mr Shalala then said that Mr Johnson told him:
	


“I rang Tony Olivieri about lunch time that day and asked him had he seen the Sydney newspaper as it had a[n] identikit picture of him with a shaved head and that he was wanted for questioning in relation to a murder blue in Leichhardt.

…

I thought I was doing Tony Olivieri a favour by ringing him in Queensland as he might not receive the Sydney newspaper and be aware of his predicament in relation to the Leichhardt murder investigation.”


	
	That affidavit was read as fresh evidence on the appeal. The Crown observed that it was second hand hearsay but maintained that it was not necessary to determine the credibility of Mr Shalala (who was not required for cross-examination). The Crown called evidence in response, from a police officer personally involved in the controlled operation who said of the conversations between Mr Johnson and Mr Olivieri:
	


“This conversation was at no time solicited by the investigators, the person Ray Johnson was not known to police until this telephone call was made. Johnson was never a participant in any controlled operation activities, as alleged by Olivieri. Johnson was later approached to provide a statement regarding these conversations, however he refused.”


	
	In a later affidavit, the police officer said that on 14 July 2004, he and two other detectives spoke with Mr Johnson on a hands-free speaker telephone. He said that Mr Johnson was advised that Mr Olivieri was a suspect and that he was in fact wanted for the murder of the deceased. He was also warned about the offence of accessory after the fact to murder. The police officer said:
	


“This call was made to Johnson after he was identified from a telephone intercept on Olivieri’s mobile telephone, following the publication of Olivieri’s photograph in the Daily Telegraph newspaper. Johnson was not known to the investigation prior to this. I do not recall the exact conversation. The investigation records indicate that Johnson agreed to attend the Marrickville Police Station on 15 July 2004 to speak with police. I have never met Johnson to date.”


	
	The affidavit annexed a contemporaneous record titled “Raymond Johnson spoken to re Olivieri wanted by police”, created 14 July 2004.
	
	
	The police officer was made available by the Crown for cross-examination. Mr Olivieri did not seek to cross-examine him. This took place in a way which was transparent, and reflected an appreciation by the Crown of its responsibilities to deal fairly with an unrepresented litigant, and included the following:
	


“CROWN: ... I am cautious that the applicant is unrepresented. If he is absolutely certain he doesn’t want to cross-examine them then that’s fine. Otherwise I won’t make an application.

LEEMING JA: Mr Olivieri I am not sure if you understood what was said then?

APPLICANT: I did.

LEEMING JA: My understanding is that apart from Professor Boettcher you don’t wish to cross-examine any of the witnesses who have sworn affidavits that the Crown has relied upon?

APPLICANT: No, your Honour, no.

LEEMING JA: What the Crown is then saying is rather than having these people waiting in court they should be free to go. That would be what would happen in the normal course and having identified the evidentiary matter before us we then move on to making submissions on the substance of the appeal.

APPLICANT: It sounds good to me.”


	
	Given the direct evidence of the police officer personally involved, corroborated by the contemporaneous record, and the inherently unreliable second-hand hearsay of Mr Shalala recalling what he said Mr Johnson had told him five years earlier about something which had happened in 2004, I accept the Crown submission that no cross-examination of Mr Shalala was necessary in order to find the primary facts in accordance with the officer’s account.
	
	
	The consequence is that, contrary to Mr Olivieri’s submission, Mr Johnson is not shown to have been acting as an “agent of the State” or otherwise at the request of investigating police. Instead, it is to be inferred that Mr Johnson initiated the telephone conversation on 10 June 2004 acting independently, having seen the picture and story placed in the newspaper by police.
	
	
	As the Crown submitted, while by issuing the false media release the police created an environment in which Mr Olivieri might make self-incriminatory remarks on the telephone, it was no part of that operation that Mr Johnson would speak to Mr Olivieri on behalf of the investigating police. Mr Johnson was not acting as an agent of the police.
	
	
	Neither the extracts of the conversations reproduced above, nor the balance of those two conversations, suggest that either Mr Johnson or Mr Olivieri was aware that the publication was false and that the calls were being monitored.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri submitted that on 14 July 2004 at 3:20pm, Mr Johnson called the office telephone number of the police officer in charge of the murder investigation. That takes the matter no further, save to corroborate the police record of the telephone conversation with Mr Johnson on that date.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Olivieri’s submissions based on a disregard for public safety, which rely on s 7(1)(b) of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act, Mr Olivieri’s primary focus was upon danger to Mrs Williams. His submission was that the publication would have alerted the gunman to the fact that her observation of him had enabled a good likeness to have been provided to the police. However, the media release referred to the man having been seen in Charles Street before the shooting, and gave no connection between Mrs Williams and his identification. To the extent that Mrs Williams was in danger because the gunman must have been aware that she had seen him while escaping, that was not a consequence of the controlled operation.
	
	
	Further, I accept the Crown’s submission that the controlled operation would, if anything, have served to reduce the risk to Mrs Williams, by deflecting attention away from her to a (non-existent) witness in Charles Street.
	
	
	To the extent that Mr Olivieri relies upon the controlled operation creating a risk to a member of the public seeking himself or herself to apprehend Mr Olivieri, I reject the submission. There is no reason to think that the controlled operation would lead a member of the community to attempt to apprehend Mr Olivieri.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri submitted that the controlled operation was intended to “elicit ambiguous utterances capable of being construed as ‘admission’”. I do not agree. The matters reproduced above are not ambiguous; to the contrary, I regard them as highly probative of Mr Olivieri’s guilt. But in any event, there is no sound basis for suggesting that the operation was designed to elicit ambiguous statements by Mr Olivieri, as opposed to unambiguous admissions.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri then advanced a series of submissions criticising the argument made on his behalf at trial and the ruling by the primary judge in respect of the admissibility of the telephone conversations. I deal with each in turn.
	
	
	In relation to the submissions advanced at trial, the gravamen of Mr Olivieri’s submission may be seen from his conclusion:
	


“It is the combination of inadequate argument by counsel and the lack of the most basic of forensics (Johnson call records, Detective Byrne call records which unveil Johnson’s role) together with the counsel’s failure to call Olivieri on voir dire that created the problem. Olivieri should have been called on voir dire:

(a) To establish Olivieri’s experience of being set up by police,

(b) The extent of his dealings in an unrelated matter with the police informant Johnson, and

(c) Collateral issues adverted to in the recorded calls adduced.”


	
	The reference to Mr Johnson’s call records and the need to “unveil Johnson’s role” is a reference to Mr Olivieri’s submission that Mr Johnson was an agent of the State, which has been dealt with above.
	
	
	A basal difficulty with the submission based on the evidence Mr Olivieri might have given, had he been called on the voir dire, is that he did not give such evidence when called to give evidence before the jury. Mr Olivieri’s submissions are to the effect that the seemingly incriminating conversations were in fact references to other criminal conduct. That was not the explanation given in 2006 by Mr Olivieri to the jury.
	
	
	When Mr Olivieri addressed the jury, and was asked about the two telephone conversations he had had with Mr Johnson on 10 June 2004, he gave the following evidence in chief:
	


“Q: And do you recall that the first of those involved Mr Johnson referring to the need for you to get the Sydney papers?

A: That’s right, yes.

Q: Now can you tell us how Mr Johnson came to call you in relation to that particular matter?

A: Mark Norman had been to the property just about at the end of I think it was April for the auction, and he told me that the police were investigating him for Mr Williams, questioning him over it, and he said my name had been mentioned. So then when I went to Ray’s wedding in the middle of May I told Ray about it.

Q: When you said ‘my name had been mentioned’, do you mean Mr Norman’s name or your name?

A: My name.”


	
	That is to say, in answer to an open-ended question which Mr Olivieri must have anticipated would be asked on the 13th day of a trial where the intercepted conversations were of immense importance, rather than explaining that the references were to unrelated criminal activity, he gave an explanation that turned upon earlier conversations he had had with Mr Norman and Mr Johnson (the first when he had come to Queensland, the second at Mr Johnson’s wedding the previous month).
	
	
	In his submissions on appeal, Mr Olivieri states:
	


“Olivieri did get confused by this (at the time) but thought it safer (at trial after not being called on [the voir dire]) not to admit to the unrelated activity as it could well have been seen by the trier of fact as ‘being involved with others (Johnson in this case) in unrelated matter’. Clearly this would have been highly prejudicial (and not outweighed by its negligible probative value).”


	
	As the Crown points out, Mr Olivieri sought and obtained a certificate under s 128 of the Evidence Act in relation to the drug dealings he claimed to have participated in in Leichhardt on 5 and 6 April 2004. The jury was given appropriate directions concerning that evidence, and no complaint is made in relation to them. There was no reason for Mr Olivieri not to have explained the context of the intercepted conversations.
	
	
	Further, it is plain from the course of the trial that counsel appearing for Mr Olivieri was conscious of the need to obtain instructions about any evidence to be given on the voir dire, during the objection to the tender of the transcripts of the intercepted telephone calls. Counsel was offered and accepted an opportunity to confer with his client (transcript 8 August 2006, p 427). Following that adjournment, counsel said:
	


“AUSTIN: I don’t seek to call any evidence on the voir dire after those instructions, and your Honour has my submissions in relation to the overall issues in terms of s 90, 137 and 138 in relation to this material.”


	
	I return below to address Mr Olivieri’s complaints against his representation at trial. For present purposes, the plain inference from the above is that the decision was made on instructions.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri’s written submissions criticise each of paragraphs 4-19 of the judgment delivered on 4 September 2006. None of those critiques amounts to the demonstration of any appellable error. I mean no disrespect, but much of the submission is difficult to understand, and reiterates material already addressed. By way of example, the dispositive paragraphs of his Honour’s reasons for the ruling are [9]-[10] and [16]-[17]. Mr Olivieri’s written submissions directed to those paragraphs were as follows:
	


“Points (9 & 10): Hall differentiates; a cold case where the procured admissions were the only evidence on which the conviction could stand. In the appellants matter there was a mosaic of circumstantial evidence available, but police set out to circumvent rules and procedures designed to protect citizens from such conduct by police (However it is noted that Olivieri should have been called on voir dire regarding such ‘admissions’: R v Singh-Bal (1997) 92 A Crim R 397: to assess if it was ‘reasonably open’ (s88)). Note also that the failure to adduce such calls would not be to deprive the crown of a prima facie case (R v Arvidson [2008] NSWCCA 135). Police set out to create a fiction in order to precipitate utterances which could be said ‘to go against interest’ in the proceeding.

…

Point (16 & 17): As above Evidence Act (NSW) s90 argument would turn upon evidence of Olivieri on voir dire. He was advised not to take part in voir dire. [Section] 138 was not considered in terms of the intended purpose of such conduct by police i.e. it was a deliberate attempt at circumventing rules (supra) which an argument of ‘good faith’ or ‘reasonable excuse’ could not save.”

There is nothing in these paragraphs, or the other submissions made by Mr Olivieri criticising the reasons of the primary judge, which gives rise to appellable error.


	
	Ground 4 supplemented the submissions advanced in support of ground 1(a). Mr Olivieri makes six points. They are:
	



	
	the conduct authorised by the authority was not authorised for release outside New South Wales;
	
	
	there was no authority given for any of the authorised participants to operate under an assumed name, making the authority incomplete;
	
	
	a constable used the name “Wendy” contrary to the authority;
	
	
	“[l]aw enforcement participants of controlled operation fabricating evidence”;
	
	
	the image in the Daily Telegraph was an “illegal image” because it was a true likeness, not a false image; and
	
	
	the conduct of the operation endangered lives.
	


I deal with each point in turn.


	
	Mr Olivieri points to the fact that the Daily Telegraph (a New South Wales based paper) could be bought in Queensland, and that articles were published in the Queensland Times in July. However, there is nothing to suggest that any media outlet received any information other than in New South Wales. The authority referred in terms to “Sydney based” media outlets, which plainly extended to the Daily Telegraph. There is nothing to suggest that there was any connection between the police and the article published in the Queensland Times.
	
	
	Section 8(2)(d) of the Act provides that an authority “must state whether or not any [authorised person] may operate under an assumed name”. Those words are struck out in the authority dated 9 June 2004. It is not entirely clear what significance is to be given to the striking through of the words. My own view is that there has been an administrative error in the document, because although the words “the following authorised law enforcement participants may operate under an assumed name” have been struck through, the names of the various officers appearing immediately below have not (as noted above, the position is different in relation to “authorised civilian participants”, for all of that section has been struck through). The legal meaning of the document is perhaps debatable, but the preferable view is to construe the authority narrowly, so that none of the law enforcement participants is permitted to operate under an assumed name. I will proceed, favourably to Mr Olivieri, on that basis.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri appears to submit that the striking out of those words means that the authority is invalid for not complying with s 8(2)(d). That submission cannot be accepted. The striking out of those words merely indicates, consistently with the obligation to do so in s 8(2)(d), that no authorised person may operate under an assumed name.
	
	
	One of the authorised persons, a constable, used the name “Wendy” on 13 June 2004. The uncontested evidence on appeal was that this was for voice identification and/or verification purposes after Mr Olivieri had purchased a new mobile phone: affidavit of Mr Bryan Downie, sworn 2 March 2016 at paragraph 17. So far as I can see (there are six volumes of materials, and the index is less than ideal) the transcript of that conversation is not included in the appeal papers. It was not before the jury. A statement prepared by that officer (who was not called as a witness) records that on 8.12pm on 13 June 2004 the officer made a call to Mr Olivieri’s new number (ending in 6340). She states:
	


“Utilising the caller name ‘Wendy’ I engaged in conversation regarding a meeting with ‘Gary’ at the Caxton Hotel, Brisbane. I made this call in conjunction with the monitoring of a listening post located at xxxxx Booval and a lawfully intercepted telephone warrant.”


	
	The unchallenged evidence of Detective Downie was that this call was not made pursuant to a controlled operation. On an issue such as this, his opinion cannot be determinative, but in any event I am of the same view. The controlled activities were linked, by the definition in the approval, to conversations concerning the false statements made to the New South Wales based media outlets. The call made by “Wendy” concerned a meeting with “Gary”.
	
	
	The fact that I have concluded that there is no breach of any condition on the controlled operation means that it is unnecessary to examine the consequences of any such breach. In order that there be no doubt about it, I should say that it would by no means follow that a breach on 13 June 2004, if there were one in relation to a conversation not placed in evidence, would have any impact upon the admissibility of any of the conversations which were placed in evidence, especially those on 10 June 2004, which are the critical ones for the purposes of this appeal.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri’s submission about fabricating evidence is as follows:
	


“False statements of law enforcement participants … allegedly observing me at Roma Street Railway Station on the 11th June 2004 at 9:53am heading to the Gold Coast”.


	
	Mr Olivieri here disputes that he was depicted in photographs taken by police at Roma St Railway Station. In this, he appears to be correct, having regard not merely to the images themselves but also to the telephone records. But there is nothing in this point. Assuming as Mr Olivieri maintains that the photographs were distributed to the defence, they were not tendered at trial, they were not mentioned to the jury, they were not in any way relied on by the Crown, and the Crown’s case on flight did not turn on these materials. They were not mentioned in the summing up.
	
	
	If as Mr Olivieri asserts the photographs were handed to the defence by the Crown Prosecutor, there was a mistake on which absolutely nothing turns. It is not shown that the photographs were fabricated; it is far more likely that there was an innocent misidentification in the course of a factually intensive trial. But in any event, the photographs were not tendered at the trial, and cannot give rise to the possibility of a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	The “illegal image” of which Mr Olivieri complains was a photograph of Mr Olivieri, altered to make it appear to be a computer-generated FACE image. As the Crown submissions (paragraph 487) observe, the image distributed was false in a number of respects. First, it was not a computer-generated FACE image. Secondly, it had not been produced by an eyewitness. Thirdly, there was no witness who had seen the man at the phone box. That is sufficient to dispel Mr Olivieri’s submissions concerning an obligation to distribute a false image.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri’s complaint about endangering lives has been addressed above, save that Mr Olivieri’s submissions under this heading make one further point (p 22), namely, that police knew of his drug dealing at the time, and so believed that he would more likely be evasive in his phone conversations. As the Crown observes, there is no evidence that the police knew this, the submission was not put to the police witnesses called at trial or at the committal, and it is difficult to see how the evasiveness in the intercepted telephone calls could have been attributed to drug dealings.
	
	
	I would dismiss these grounds. The primary judge was correct to permit the conversations obtained following publication of the false story and picture of Mr Olivieri to be adduced into evidence.
	


Ground 1(ii) – pretext calls


	
	This ground is described as follows:
	


“A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the erroneous reception of a number of ‘pretext calls’ said to contain utterances capable of being construed as ‘admissions’ and ‘[consciousness] of guilty evidence’. These utterances were determined by an agent of the state, and would not have been elicited if it were not for the actions of the agent.”


	
	No separate submissions were advanced in support of this sub-ground. For reasons already given, I do not accept that Mr Johnson was an agent of the State. This ground falls away.
	


Ground 2(a) – fresh evidence, Prof Barry Boettcher DNA report


	
	Mr Olivieri’s written submission in support of this ground is as follows:
	


“There is no DNA, no fingerprints; the shoe impressions taken from the crime scene do not match Olivieri’s shoes, the description, age or height given by Ms Williams does not match Olivieri, and the person she described was wearing NO gloves. No physical evidence puts Olivieri at the crime scene.”


	
	Mr Olivieri was given leave to rely upon recent reports obtained by him from Professor Barry Boettcher AM, whose expertise includes DNA profiles, including one prepared recently, dated 10 March 2016. The gravamen of that evidence was that there was nothing to conclude that the DNA found at the crime scene was linked to Mr Olivieri. So much may readily be accepted.
	
	
	The position in relation to DNA test samples obtained from a part of the gun at the crime scene was that there had been a dispute as to whether the DNA corresponded to that of Mr Olivieri. Expert DNA evidence ultimately was not adduced. In her closing address, the Crown Prosecutor made no mention of DNA evidence. Defence counsel submitted to the jury that Mr Olivieri’s DNA had not been found anywhere. The judge made no mention of DNA evidence when summing up. The dispute as to whether the DNA corresponded to that of Mr Olivieri was resolved after the conclusion of the trial favourably to Mr Olivieri.
	
	
	In oral submissions, Mr Olivieri said that there was evidence of a scuffle and that Mrs Williams had claimed that the gunman she saw had no gloves. He then said:
	


“[T]he DNA that was found on the piece of the gun belongs to somebody, and the point is that it’s not me. I mean, if the person using the gun has a scuffle has to leave fingerprints or some sort of forensic evidence there.”


	
	Although Mr Olivieri submitted that the absence of DNA evidence exonerated him, that is, of course, not the case. At all times, the onus lay upon the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Olivieri was the gunman. That could be done with, or without, DNA evidence. But the fact that the DNA material recovered from the gun is not shown to have been that of Mr Olivieri in no way exonerates him. As it was put by the Crown orally:
	


“It might be that they are not guilty but the absence of DNA does not establish or demonstrate that they are not guilty, because of course there can be a number of reasons why they might not have left their DNA there apart from the fact that they were not the gunman in this case.”


	
	There is nothing in this ground.
	


Ground 2(b) the evidence of Ms Kirkpatrick


	
	Ms Kirkpatrick was a Queensland government officer with whom Mr Olivieri had an appointment on 7 April 2004. She said that he had rung on 6 April 2004 to say that he would not be able to attend. She said that her office number would divert to a number ending in 1814 if she was not able to pick up the call, and indeed Mr Olivieri’s handset made a call at 5:22pm on 6 April 2004 to that number in Queensland (the call was transmitted from a receiver at the Cabramatta Bowling Club base station, consistently with his being at or near the Sunnybrook Motel). She said that in May she was told by Mr Olivieri that he had a new mobile phone number. She said that he had supplied Grant Norman as his next of kin.
	
	
	Ms Kirkpatrick was cross-examined very shortly. The entirety of her evidence at trial occupied two pages of transcript and took 5 minutes. She was not challenged as to her evidence of next of kin at all.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri submitted in respect of ground 2(b):
	


“Ms Kirkpatrick’s created a false document of the Offenders Profile dated 22nd October 2003 stating that Grant Norman as next of kin given to her by the appellant was false, as the appellant had been in custody from the 17th September 2003 to 10th December 2003. The offenders Profile has been amended by the Queensland Corrective Services (QCS) because it was proven to be misleading and inaccurate. The Offenders Profile was amended to the appellant’s mother who the QCS has a record of only her being next of kin, it was also stated by QCS that there is no record in the parole case file that the appellant or anyone has put G[r]ant Norman as next of kin” [emphasis in original].


	
	In support of this ground, Mr Olivieri relies on a letter dated 18 January 2010, which accedes to a request made by him in 2009, after his conviction, to amend the records of Queensland Corrective Services, to replace Mr Norman as his next of kin by his mother.
	
	
	There is nothing in this ground. The alteration in the Queensland government records was made after conviction, and on Mr Olivieri’s application. There is nothing to suggest that the evidence given by Ms Kirkpatrick was wrong at the time it was given.
	
	
	Moreover, the same evidence had been led at the committal in November 2005. Let it be assumed, favourably to Mr Olivieri and consistently with what occurred in 2010, that the Queensland government records were incorrect. There is no explanation why steps were not taken in the following months to correct this.
	


Ground 2(c) – Mr Damon Miller


	
	Mr Olivieri asserts that the deceased was, together with Mr Damon Miller, involved in a fraud, in connection with which Mr Miller was charged. The gravamen of the submission is that there was another person with a motive to kill the deceased which had not been disclosed by the Crown to the defence.
	
	
	So far as I can see, Mr Olivieri gives no evidence of these matters. He says, in his submission, that he was informed of the fact by an (unnamed) solicitor.
	
	
	Even so, the Crown read an affidavit by a police officer, who had been involved in investigations of Mr Miller, including his arrest in January 2005, and ultimately his conviction for fraud in September 2007. He gave evidence that he recalled speaking to detectives investigating the deceased’s death as to whether there was a link with Mr Miller, and being told that Mr Miller’s name had not come up. He said that in 2008, in connection with an appeal by Mr Miller, the deceased’s name had, again, come up in connection with the fraud, but that “the allegation was dismissed out of hand”.
	
	
	The evidence of the police officer was unchallenged, and contradicted Mr Olivieri’s submissions. There is nothing in this ground of appeal.
	


Ground 2(d) – the person seen near Petersham TAFE


	
	Mr Olivieri submitted that the person seen by the two Crown witnesses exiting Petersham Public School between 9.15pm and 9.30pm on 6 April 2004 may have been a student, rather than the gunman. The basis of this submission was that there were said to be “language classes being held at the TAFE which ran until 9.00pm”. Mr Olivieri maintained that “I have a document from the West Petersham TAFE with the information about what classes and the time it finished”, on which he seeks to rely as fresh evidence in support of this ground.
	
	
	This is not fresh evidence, as the substance of the evidence was available at the time of the trial. In any event, the Crown witnesses did not purport to identify the person they had seen as the killer, still less did they identify Mr Olivieri. Accordingly, the evidence of the witnesses was not a substantial part of the Crown’s case at trial. As the Crown submitted on appeal:
	


“[T]he Crown submission made to the jury was that the man seen by Ms Edwards and Mr Middleton was the gunman[.] …

However, to arrive at such conclusions the jury was required to draw the necessary inferences from the available evidence that it had been the gunman who was involved in the near collision with Ms Edwards and Mr Middleton. The evidence relevant to that issue that was available at the time of the trial was not particularly strong and was entirely circumstantial.

The tenuous nature of the evidence available to support the inference that the man had been the gunman may readily be assessed by reference to the competing submissions made upon the evidence in the final addresses by the Crown, Defence Counsel and to the remarks made by the learned trial Judge in the summing up.”


	
	When considered in context, as the Crown submitted, there was no miscarriage of justice occasioned by the absence of evidence at trial of the classes running at the Petersham TAFE on the evening of 6 April 2004, as the absence of that evidence has not deprived Mr Olivieri of any chance of an acquittal that might legitimately have been available had that evidence been led at trial. The evidence of the witnesses in question was not a material part of the Crown’s case, and the rejection of the inference sought to be drawn by the Crown would not have necessitated an acquittal.
	


Ground 3


	
	Mr Olivieri submitted that “[t]he following evidence needed to be presented at trial to show reasonable doubt to the Crown’s case. Crown did not present a whole case”. Mr Olivieri thereafter identified 14 matters which, so it was said, should have been presented to the jury. The matters are addressed in 6 single-spaced pages of submissions.
	
	
	The first item is that there was evidence that the deceased had come back from a trip to the Gold Coast early. Mr Olivieri submitted that the timing made it most unlikely that he had been asked by Mr Norman to murder the deceased. He submitted that the appointment between Mr Norman and the deceased was made at 4:40pm on 5 April 2004. He then said:
	


“I had contacted Mr Norman on the 5th April 2004 at 16:35 pm. There was no contact between Olivieri and Mr Norman from 16:35 pm until Olivieri contacted Mr Norman at 18:42 pm from Norton Street Leichhardt, now you would believe that Mr Norman would have contacted Olivieri to inform him that Mr Williams had returned from his trip after the appointment was made at 16:40 pm for 7:00 pm, if Olivieri was to murder Mr Williams. It shows reasonable doubt in the Crown’s alleged series of events for the 5th April 2004; this doubt would also go the jury.”


	
	There is nothing in this. Mr Olivieri’s submission ignores the calls made between Mr Norman and Mr Olivieri at 9:08pm and 9:11pm on 5 April 2004. There was ultimately no contest about the facts that a meeting was scheduled on the evening of 5 April 2004, that Mr Olivieri made four calls while in the Petersham area to Mr Norman, and that immediately following the fourth, Mr Norman cancelled the meeting saying that he had a flat tyre.
	
	
	Item 3(b) concerns a statement given by Mr Sharp, who gave evidence at the committal that he had seen the deceased on the day of the murder. Mr Sharp was not called at the trial. His witness statement to police was to the effect that Mr Norman had a “huge gambling problem”, and had been “fleecing clients”, and that the deceased was nervous and preoccupied in the afternoon before he was killed. Mr Sharp gave evidence about another fraud trial, of which he said “I don’t think there is any connection between Tom’s death and this fraud”. He also said that he knew Mr Olivieri through a common friend, with whom Mr Olivieri had leased a house from Mr Norman which was full of a hydroponic marijuana crop, and that he was told by a friend that “‘Toni’ was selling many hand guns to the Asians and Lebanese, he fancied himself as a gangster” and that he had been told that “‘Toni’ stood over people and shot at people”.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri’s submission under this item seems to be that Mr Sharp’s evidence should have been put to the jury, as he had a motive to commit the murder. However, Mr Sharp’s evidence would have been obviously and devastatingly damaging to Mr Olivieri’s case. There is nothing in this item.
	
	
	Item 3(c) concerns the police photographs said to have been of Mr Olivieri taken on 11 June 2004 at Roma Street Railway Station, which has been addressed above. The photographs were not in evidence and cannot give rise to a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Item 3(d) is a submission that the telephone records of a neighbour of the deceased who did not give evidence at trial, but who said that he texted friends in Japan and London on the evening of 6 April 2004 immediately prior to hearing screaming from the Williams’ residence, might shed light on the precise time of death. Mr Olivieri says that:
	


“This piece of evidence would bring us closer to the time Mr Williams was murdered, I believe this would show that I was on the phone talking to Mr Whitehouse at the time Mr Williams was [being] shot”.


	
	There is nothing in this ground. Mr Olivieri has caused orders for production to be made, but nothing has been produced. It is far from clear that even if there were records, they would produce any useful information. The critical weakness of this aspect of Mr Olivieri’s scenario is that his very short call with Mr Whitehouse of 30 seconds was some 6 minutes before the triple 0 call at 9.14pm.
	
	
	Item 3(e) is as follows:
	


“There were three phone calls between the appellant and Raymond Richard Johnson on the 10 June 2004 the third call was not used in evidence, this call was crucial to defence case.”


	
	Mr Olivieri does not elaborate in his submissions on how the call was crucial, but addresses it in his affidavit sworn 21 April 2015 (which is lengthy and in large measure duplicates the principal written submissions). The handwritten notes by officers monitoring the electronic surveillance of Mr Olivieri’s mobile phone record him receiving another call from Mr Johnson in the early evening of 10 June 2004, when he said he was not “too fussed” about it all but was “nervous naturally” and would “play it as it happens”.
	
	
	I cannot see how that call could be crucial to Mr Olivieri’s case. Even if it supported an inference that Mr Olivieri was less concerned than he had been when Mr Johnson first called him to advise of the publication, what matters is what Mr Olivieri said to Mr Norman a few minutes later.
	
	
	Item 3(f) is to the effect that the transcripts of the intercepted calls “shows that I was not fleeing”. Mr Olivieri refers to the remarks made by the primary judge in the course of dealing with the objection to the records. However, the transcripts do include Mr Olivieri saying on 10 June 2004:
	


“[Mr Olivieri]: Listen, I’m going to have to go away for a while mate.

[Mr Norman]: I think so.

[Mr Olivieri]: You know what I mean?

[Mr Norman]: Yeah, yeah, actually I just – yeah, I mean I was looking at it, yeah, you can see the similarities but I don’t think it’s currently, but then again the…

[Mr Olivieri]: No, ah, yeah just don’t want to um, you know what I mean? … I don’t know how to say this, but I’m going to need a little bit of money mate, you know what I mean?

…

[Mr Norman]: Yeah, I’ll have to – see at the moment I’m sort of fairly skint, but I’ll – yeah, we’ll get some and sort of have to fix something up.

[Mr Olivieri]: Yeah, well see I – me mate’s going to give me a ring, in about half an hour or so, he’s going to give me a phone number, then I’ve got to go see this bloke and he’s going to um, take me somewhere, you know what I mean?

…

[Mr Norman]: Will they be able to pay you or give you just board and keep?

[Mr Olivieri]: Oh, no, no, nothing mate, you know what I mean? It’s all up to me, you know what I’m saying?

[Mr Norman]: Yeah, I understand.

[Mr Olivieri]: You know they’re just going to put me there, sort of thing. I’m not…

[Mr Norman]: Yeah. Just be out there for a while?

[Mr Olivieri]: Yeah.”


	
	In a conversation between Mr Norman and Grant Norman on 15 June 2004, the following exchange took place:
	


“[Mark Norman]: … So where’s, where’s [Mr Olivieri] now?

[Grant Norman]: Hiding.

[Mark Norman]: Mm hm. Yeah.”


	
	Mr Olivieri also refers to having left town two intercepted conversations with Mr Norman on 16 June 2004, and again says “I’m not – I’m around sort of kind of thing” in an intercepted conversation with Mr Norman on 17 June. Later in the evening on 17 June, Mr Norman asks Mr Olivieri: “All right mate, so you could – you haven’t got anywhere you can sort of go to for a while?” Mr Olivieri responds: “Ah, I have, I have…”
	
	
	The transcripts thus do show that Mr Olivieri left his ordinary place of residence following the publication of his photograph in the media on 10 June 2004. Mr Olivieri does not identify anything in the transcripts which shows that he left his ordinary place of residence in Queensland first for remote Mount Isa and then for remote Western Australia for any purpose other than avoiding the police. In any event, when he gave evidence at trial, he conceded that he had been trying to avoid police whom he believed were trying to set him up. There is nothing in this item.
	
	
	Item 3(g) is a reference to evidence that the DNA profile from cigarette butts at the scene “is unsuitable for entry on the database but is suitable for comparison with a nominated subject”. The submission was not developed any further, either in writing or orally. There is nothing to suggest that this evidence could exonerate Mr Olivieri.
	
	
	Item 3(h) concerns the constructed FACE image identified by a computer search as the closest match to Mr Olivieri. Mr Olivieri submitted that because his own face was on the database, it was essential that the failure on the part of Mrs Williams and the computer search to identify him be brought to the jury’s attention. However, the jury heard evidence from Mrs Williams that the image constructed by her bore a poor resemblance to the gunman.
	
	
	Item 3(i) is a more elaborate submission dealing with the expert evidence concerning which base stations would transmit signals to mobile phones. Mr Olivieri queries the expertise of the technical experts, whether a mistake had been made in identifying his handset, refers to a criticism made by the primary judge concerning a different expert in a different criminal appeal (Morgan v R [2011] NSWCCA 257; 215 A Crim R 33 at [115]). It is, with respect, difficult to identify what point or points are being made. Mr Olivieri appears to challenge the expertise of one of the telecommunications experts, what can be drawn from the evidence as to which base stations transmitted a signal, and says there is a discrepancy in the IMEI information. Doing the best I can, I can see nothing in any of this. I accept that there are real limitations on what may be inferred from which station transmits a signal (principally, because that is dependent upon the level of activity throughout the network at the time). But those limitations had no application in this trial, because Mr Olivieri accepted that he participated in each of the calls on 5 and 6 April 2004, and was in the vicinity of Petersham when each of those calls were made and received by him.
	
	
	The last six sentences of this ground (pp18-19 of the written submissions) return to a different topic: DNA found on the metal gun components at the scene. This has been addressed under ground 2(a) above.
	
	
	Item 3(j) concerns the evidence of Mr Whitehouse that he had seen Mr Olivieri with a gun, and had heard him describe it as “a piece of shit” and that it had “fallen apart”. Mr Olivieri’s submissions were to the effect that the conversation could not have happened, because he “had changed his phone and number as from the 8 April ‘04 so as from this date there was no contact between the appellant and Mr Whitehouse”. He also submitted that Mr Whitehouse was a drug user with a criminal record including obtaining money by deception, which, according to Mr Olivieri, “shows he is known to lie”. Finally, he submitted that although Mr Whitehouse said that Mr Olivieri was angry and upset, Ms Kapor (who had provided her bank account details to Mr Olivieri) saw nothing unusual; he submitted that “Ms Kapor was not recalled to give evidence about that day”.
	
	
	There is nothing in this item. The critical evidence from Mr Whitehouse was his call to Mr Olivieri’s mobile phone at 9:08pm on 6 April 2004, which places Mr Olivieri at Petersham on that evening. The fact that Mr Whitehouse and Ms Kapor had different recollections of Mr Olivieri’s mood is neither here nor there, and certainly provides no basis for her to have been recalled. Mr Whitehouse was cross-examined vigorously, and apparently effectively, on his recollection as to what Mr Olivieri had said about the gun. The judge in summing up gave a strongly worded caution about any use by the jury of such evidence. His Honour said (transcript 24 August 2006, pp 66-67) that the jury would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt first that Mr Whitehouse did see the butt of a gun, secondly that the conversation between him and Mr Olivieri did happen, and thirdly that it happened after 6 April 2004. His Honour then said:
	


“Now I remind you that the evidence was strongly challenged. Mr Olivieri said in evidence that what Mr Whitehouse saw was a mobile phone, not the butt of a gun, and that no such conversation took place. And Mr Austin strongly challenged that evidence in his address to you.”

That was the very last direction given before the jury retired.


	
	There is nothing in this item.
	
	
	Item 3(k) asserts that the police never contacted Mr Olivieri but “tried to make it look like he was fleeing”. This item is misconceived. Mr Olivieri gave evidence himself that he was seeking to avoid arrest. There was no obligation on the police to arrest him, even if the police knew his location. This item falls away.
	
	
	Item 3(l) asserts that the police had in their possession an Ericsson phone box which, he says, was mistaken for the butt of a gun by Mr Whitehouse. This aspect is related to, and takes the matter no further than, item 3(j).
	
	
	Item 3(m) queried why police took “more notice of Ms Edward[s] and Mr Middleton” than a statement by witness who said that he observed a suspicious car on the evening of the murder. However, the witness could not identify the vehicle by its registration number or any other identifying features. Mr Olivieri gave no explanation of what useful evidence could have been given by this witness. There is nothing to suggest that the absence of this witness gave rise to any miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Item 3(n) was a complaint that a solicitor was not called to give evidence that he had advised Mr Olivieri that he was under no obligation to present himself to police. It is plain that any such communication would have been privileged. It was open to Mr Olivieri to waive privilege and call the solicitor in his case if he chose, but it cannot be a failure on the part of the Crown to fail to do so. He also submitted: “How could I be fleeing when there is no arrest warrant for me?” But flight, and the inferences capable of being drawn by suddenly relocating to remote Queensland, and then to remote Western Australia, are available irrespective of whether a warrant exists.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri concluded by stating:
	


“Individually the above points mean nothing; collectively they show the Crown’s case in a new light. It shows the Crown never presented a whole case; there was too much evidence left out by both Crown and defence, which would have shown reasonable doubt to the jury.”


	
	I am conscious that I have dealt with each of the items individually. I have done so for clarity of exposition, in light of their number. It is clear from a close examination of all of the complaints that Mr Olivieri’s basic submission that there were substantial matters which the Crown was obliged to expose to the jury but did not is unfounded.
	
	
	I would dismiss this ground of appeal.
	


Grounds 1(iii) and 5 – Incompetence of counsel


	
	Ground 1(iii) is articulated as follows:
	


“The failure of counsel to call Olivieri on voir dire to expunge inadmissible evidence (the calls in point (2) supra), and then to call him to give evidence (on those calls) in the trial itself, amounted to ‘flagrant incompetence’.”

However, most of the submissions in support of the alleged incompetence of Mr Olivieri’s representation at trial are contained within ground 5.


	
	Mr Mark Austin, an experienced Public Defender, appeared for Mr Olivieri at trial. He swore an affidavit which was read without objection in the appeal dealing with whether Mr Olivieri was called on the voir dire. He stated that there was no evidence that the intercepts had been unlawfully or improperly obtained, leaving an argument only that Mr Olivieri’s statements in the intercepts were ambivalent and did not amount to an admission against interest which should have been admitted. Mr Austin said in those circumstances that “there was nothing that any evidence given by the applicant could contribute” and “[i]t was not up to the trial judge to determine what the applicant actually meant by the words”.
	
	
	Both those statements are, with respect, correct. That is by itself a complete answer to complaint insofar as it was based on a failure to call Mr Olivieri on the voir dire.
	
	
	There is a further matter. If Mr Olivieri was called on the voir dire in relation to the intercepted conversations, he would have been subject to cross-examination early in the course of the Crown case. It is easy to see that that was apt to involve a very significant forensic disadvantage to him. And I find it impossible to see how there could have been any different outcome to the decision to admit the transcripts of the intercepted conversations had he been called.
	
	
	Turning to the decision to call Mr Olivieri before the jury, Mr Olivieri’s explanation of his presence in the vicinity of Petersham on 5 April 2004, and on 6 April 2004 minutes before the deceased was killed, namely, that he was dealing in drugs, was entirely unfounded in any other evidence in the case. Mr Olivieri thus needed to give testimonial evidence to support this explanation. I cannot conclude that there was any negligence, let alone the requisite flagrant incompetence, in giving whatever advice was given in relation to presenting that explanation to the jury.
	
	
	In the formulation of this ground, Mr Olivieri recognises, correctly, that it is necessary for him to demonstrate something amounting to “flagrant incompetence” (or “egregious error”, “extreme conduct” or “significant fault”: see TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 at [29]). Further, ordinarily it is not appropriate for an appellate court to review the decisions made by counsel at trial: Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614 at [8]. The ultimate question is whether the failure to call Mr Olivieri on the voir dire occasioned a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	It is not necessary to say anything as to the extent to which evidence from Mr Olivieri’s former counsel can be received and considered (as to which issue no submissions were made): see the authorities reviewed in Alkhair v R [2016] NSWCCA 4 at [27]-[31]. In my view, Mr Olivieri has not come close to establishing that there has been a miscarriage of justice in this regard.
	
	
	In large measure the 24 single spaced pages of submissions in support of this ground reproduce extracts from the transcript, or interlocutory judgment, in support of submissions that both counsel and solicitor acting for Mr Olivieri were so incompetent that there has been a miscarriage of justice. Although I have read all of this (as well as paragraphs 506-842 of the Crown’s written submissions in response), it is unnecessary to respond in detail.
	
	
	A recurring theme is the fact that the primary judge overruled the objection to the intercepted conversations with Mr Olivieri within the controlled operation. As explained above, there was no error in the primary judge taking that course, and his Honour’s decision to do so does not for a moment entail any lack of competence by counsel. Mr Olivieri focusses upon the failure to press that there was any impropriety in the controlled operation. Although I accept that Mr Olivieri is of the contrary view, no basis has been shown for any such submission. Indeed, far from demonstrating incompetence, it would have been improper for such a submission to have been made.
	
	
	Again, Mr Olivieri complained, in relation to the photographs at Roma St Railway Station, that “this crucial matter was never challenged on admissibility or relevance”. Indeed, when he complained to his counsel, he was told “Leave it to me. I’ll fix it”. The photographs did not form part of the case against Mr Olivieri.
	
	
	Again, Mr Olivieri complained about the officer who used the name “Wendy” (who did not give evidence): “It was essential for [that detective] to be summoned at my trial to be questioned about using the … false name of ‘Wendy’”. I disagree. This could have had, for the reasons already given, no material impact on any aspect of the trial.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri submitted that his case was conducted contrary to his instructions. He gave three examples at pp 33 and 34 of his written submissions: the failure to cross-examine one detective concerning the Roma St Railway Station photographs, the failure to cross-examine the officer who used the name “Wendy”, and the failure to have a DNA expert give evidence. Those three examples well illustrate the weakness of Mr Olivieri’s complaint. The Roma St Railway Station photographs were not part of the Crown case, the officer who used the name “Wendy” was not called, and the DNA evidence was not part of the Crown case.
	
	
	Finally, because of its centrality to the Crown case, and because it illustrates the nature of Mr Olivieri’s submissions, I reproduce verbatim what is stated in Mr Olivieri’s submissions concerning the mobile phone records of the 9:08pm call he received from Mr Whitehouse:
	


“The prosecution produced a document indicated that the call came from cell location of 606 Parramatta Road, Petersham (Millers Tower), please refer to provided and enclosed document outlining towers in the immediate, surrounding suburbs.

The issue of Millers Tower ought to have been fiercely challenged by Mr Austin because the ‘cell location’ possibly came from any number of different tower locations. This vital point was never adequately explored or developed by Mr Austin. If you view the time of the shooting of Mr Williams and compare the time I was on the phone speaking with David Whitehouse you will note it is the same time. It is impossible to be shooting someone with a phone in one hand and a gun the other.

For the prosecution’s purposes they had their own witness mention the Millers Tower simply because this location is the closest to the crime scene. From the very outset, I stated that I was in Norton Street, Leichhardt, at the time I received this phone call, at 9.08 pm (35 seconds duration) from Mr David Whitehouse.

Why the precise phone cell location becomes vital to my defence is this.

Retrieving weather forecasts for that night (and more importantly, that time period) was rain and cloud cover. I understand that this can affect the receiving signal and with so many cell location towers clustered so closely together it is more probable than not that the call hadn’t come from the Millers Tower and further away towards Norton Street, Leichhardt, where I in fact was.   

Mr Austin allowed the cell location to go unchallenged. This, obviously, suited the prosecution case being as close as they could physically get to the crime scene. This crucial point is equivalent to an independent alibi defence and conclusive evidence for it was established at my trial by phone records and Mr Whitehouse that it was in fact me on the phone at 9.08 pm on the 6th April, 2004. That has not been in dispute.

You can now understand if Mr Austin, on this point standing alone, was diligent and handled my defence with care he would have summoned our own expert to establish those aspects I have discovered after my conviction.

Irrespective of the Millers Tower location, according to the untested version of the prosecution’s witness, how can I be shooting Mr Williams at the same time I am speaking to David Whitehouse on the phone?

If Mr  Austin would have done his job and defended with my best interests at heart by calling our own telecommunication expert and it was, as I expect, the cell location was nearer the vicinity of Norton Street, Leichhardt, on this evidence alone would make it ‘impossible’ for me to have shot Mr Thomas Williams. Reasonable doubt wouldn’t enter the equation. His Honour, therefore, would have had no other alternative than to ‘direct a verdict’” [emphasis in original].


	
	This is, with respect to Mr Olivieri, completely wrong. Mr Olivieri acknowledged in this submission, as he did in his evidence at trial, that it was he who was speaking into his handset at 9:08pm on 6 April 2004. The telecommunications records established beyond all doubt that that call was transmitted by the Petersham Millers base station. The records do not establish where the handset was when Mr Whitehouse’s call was transmitted to it, but they suggest it was in the vicinity of Petersham. Nothing turns on that, because the competing cases were either that Mr Olivieri was approaching the deceased’s house to kill him, or else he was in Leichhardt in the course of a drug transaction. Either way, nothing arises that could have been affected by cross-examination.
	
	
	Secondly, I believe that Mr Olivieri misunderstands the expert evidence, and the references to “cells”. The references to “cells” in the expert evidence are references not to the location of the handset but to the base station sector transmitting the signal to the handset at that time. For example, part of the report from Optus stated:
	


“During the course of the call, it is possible for the call to move between different cells. An example is when a customer is travelling or driving then the call will also travel. The call may start at a particular base station and switch through several base stations during the course of the call. The Optus call records will only show the details of the cell that the call was setup on.

...

The ‘Dominant Cell Coverage’ plot indicates the predicted areas in which each base station sector (cell) is most likely to serve. Since mobile networks are designed to provide overlapping coverage, this area is slightly smaller than the total coverage. In instances of congestion, the ‘Directed Retry’ feature could result in a cell serving further away.”


	
	Thirdly, Mr Olivieri submitted that the call exonerates him, because it coincided with the shooting of the deceased. That is not so. The call is some 6 minutes before the triple 0 call to the ambulance. It only lasted 30 seconds. There was ample time for Mr Olivieri to take the call, terminate it swiftly, and proceed to murder the deceased. Once again, this could not be affected by cross-examination.
	
	
	There is nothing in this submission to establish any deficiency in the cross-examination or conduct of the defence, let alone something amounting to gross incompetence.
	
	
	Unlike every other aspect of Mr Olivieri’s appeal, I do not propose to address each complaint made against his former lawyers. To do so would only increase the length of these reasons, and to no useful end. What has been reproduced and addressed above is representative, and well indicates that this ground is meritless.
	


Ground 6 – the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory


	
	Mr Olivieri’s sixth and final ground of appeal invokes an “unsafe and unsatisfactory verdict”. As formulated in Mr Olivieri’s grounds of appeal, and on pp 48 and 49 of his submissions filed on 30 September 2014, the ground is principally based upon his conviction being unsafe and unsatisfactory in light of the material which was not before the jury. Mr Olivieri repeated the absence of DNA evidence linking him to the crime scene, the error in Ms Kirkpatrick stating that Mr Olivieri nominated Grant Norman as next of kin, the motive of Mr Miller, the fact that Mr Johnson was a police informer, the testimony that the deceased returned early from the Gold Coast, the evidence of Mr Sharp, the photographs said to be of him on Roma Street Railway Station, and the third call between him and Mr Johnson. All these matters have been addressed above.
	
	
	I think it is possible that Mr Olivieri also intended by this ground to suggest that the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, in accordance with what was said in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [58] (which Mr Olivieri cites). If so, I nevertheless would reject the submission. In doing so, I have undertaken an independent assessment of the whole of the evidence, in accordance with what was said in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 and SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [11], whilst having regard to the fact that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and which has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses: M v The Queen at 493; SKA v The Queen at [13]. I return to this below.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri made one new submission, which was that manslaughter should have been put to the jury. He said:
	


“From the defensive wounds another scenario should be considered, that there was a scuffle, maybe from an argument, for whatever reason, and during the scuffle a gun was produced that led to Mr Williams being shot. It may be that there was no intention to murder Mr Williams, and only because of the fight that Williams was shot.”


	
	This is fanciful. Four shots were fired hitting the deceased, who was unarmed. One was fired into the back of his head, at close range.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri’s principal written submissions concluded (at pp 50-51) as follows:
	


“I am very disappointed that as an innocent person has been wrongly convicted and a miscarriage of justice has in fact occurred in this instance. The reason for this is quite apparent and I will go to great extremes to achieve the appropriate decision through the due process.

You will see that the Crown case leveled against the appellant is not as strong as the prosecution would have a Court believe. In fact, the Crown case exonerates, it does not convict appellant.

Note following:

1. There is no DNA evidence linking me to the crime. (Prof. Boettcher’s report)

2. There is no fingerprint evidence linking me to the crime.

3. There is no description by any witness as to me being the perpetrator of the crime. In fact, in truth the descriptions further exonerate me (eg the height, and description).

4. The shoe impressions at the crime scene are no match to me.

5. There is available clear evidence that the investigating police and others have committed perjury i.e. allegedly observing me at Roma Street Railway Station on 10/6/04 which the CCTV photos clearly show was false.

6. There is further clear evidence that the investigating police and others have committed a perversion of the course of justice.

7. There is available an abundant amount of evidence and other material to establish that defence counsel’s handling of my trial was both grossly incompetent and unprofessional.

8. That the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997 (NSW) (and the authority of this Act), was used to falsify evidence, put forward misrepresentations, break the laws under the Crimes Act, Justices Act and contrary to what the Legislature intended, also blatantly abuse of Police Regulations. Johnson’s pretext phone calls, being a police informer, and as unnamed participant of controlled operation shows the great lengths the police went to have me convicted.

9. The prosecution’s departure from both her presented Indictment and her opening address to the jury is a clear breach of well established legal principles in law, and in itself, is a very strong appeal point (refer to R -v- HENRY & Others [2007] (unreported) CCA. NSW).

10. A good point in the trial proceeding is the phone call I received from David Whitehouse on 6th April 2004 at 9.08pm. This point by itself does not only exonerate me, but makes it IMPOSSIBLE for me to have committed the crime.

11. The parole officer Heather Kirkpatrick’s inaccurate and misleading evidence of me nominating Grant Norman as being my next of kin. This led the prosecution to say that the motive for me committing the murder was for loyalty to Mark Norman.

What I have stated above must show that the prosecution’s evidence against me was very weak at best, a complete case was not presented, and that the prosecution would clutch at anything to get a conviction” [emphasis in original, minor typographical corrections made].


	
	Having considered the entirety of the evidence, I cannot agree. The first, second, third and fourth points are correct, but do not establish any reasonable doubt about Mr Olivieri’s guilt. The remaining points are incorrect. It has not been shown that there was any perjury, or perversion of the course of justice, or indeed any deliberate misconduct in relation to the photographs at Roma St Railway Station, which in any event were not tendered and played no part in the jury’s deliberations. There is nothing to suggest that there was any gross incompetence on the part of counsel who appeared for Mr Olivieri, or any breach by the prosecutor. It has not been shown that the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act was contravened, and it has not been shown that Mr Johnson was a police informer; the unchallenged evidence is that he was not known by police to be associated with Mr Olivieri at the time that he called him. Ms Kirkpatrick’s evidence was not inaccurate or misleading. The 30 second telephone call Mr Olivieri received some minutes before the murder does not make it impossible for him to have killed the deceased, and therefore does not exonerate him.
	
	
	I regard the Crown case as overwhelming. Mr Olivieri came to Sydney from Queensland under a false name provided by Mr Norman. He left under a false name provided by Mr Norman. Mr Olivieri undoubtedly spoke numerous times to Mr Norman in the 24 hours before the victim was killed. Mr Olivieri was in the vicinity of the deceased’s home on the evening of 5 April 2004, when the latter had arranged a meeting with Mr Norman. While close by, Mr Olivieri spoke with Mr Norman four times, immediately following which Mr Norman cancelled the meeting. Mr Olivieri’s account that he was calling Mr Norman to talk about work related matters, four times that evening, while Mr Norman was attending a course at Richmond, immediately following which the scheduled appointment he had made to see the deceased was cancelled, is implausible in the extreme.
	
	
	Mr Olivieri was undoubtedly in the vicinity of the victim’s home minutes before he was killed. Mr Olivieri’s conversations after the publication of his picture on 10 June 2004 confirm his concern that, despite the false name he had used and the witnesses he said could vouch for his being in Queensland, he could be identified in Sydney at the time of the murder. The three conversations on 10 June 2004, the day of the Daily Telegraph publication, in particular the opening words of the conversation between Mr Olivieri and Mr Norman, show both men to be aware of the story, and are inconsistent with Mr Olivieri’s account that he was buying drugs in Leichhardt that evening.
	
	
	The subsequent conversations between Mr Olivieri and Mr Norman, the transfer of money, and Mr Olivieri’s subsequent departure for remote Queensland and then remote Western Australia have been outlined above.
	
	
	After reviewing the evidence as a whole, I am satisfied that this is a case where the jury was, in my view, amply entitled to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Olivieri had killed the deceased. The appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	I propose the following formal orders:
	



	
	Extend the time within which to commence this appeal to 30 September 2014.
	
	
	To the extent necessary, grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	JOHNSON J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Leeming JA. I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by his Honour. Upon the unreasonable verdict ground, I record my own satisfaction that the jury was well entitled to convict the Appellant of the murder of Mr Williams.
	
	
	HARRISON J: I have had the benefit of reading the draft reasons of Leeming JA. I have reviewed the whole of the evidence. I agree for the reasons given by his Honour that it was open on the whole of that evidence for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of murder.

2701135,Ridgeway v R [2016] NSWCCA 184,"Judgment


	
	PAYNE JA: On 1 May 2015 the applicant, Ms Ridgeway, was sentenced in the District Court for two offences committed in 2013 and one offence committed in 2012. The applicant pleaded guilty to all of the offences.
	
	
	The 2013 offences were first, an offence of aggravated break and enter with intent to commit larceny contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and, second, an offence of larceny contrary to s 117 of the Crimes Act. Both offences took place on 5 November 2013. The applicant was sentenced to periods of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months respectively, each to date from 5 November 2013. At the time of hearing this appeal, those sentences had both been completed.
	
	
	The 2012 offence was an aggravated break and enter with intent to commit larceny contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act, that occurred in October 2012. The applicant was sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 4 years to commence on 5 November 2014. A non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months was fixed to commence on 5 November 2014 and expire on 4 August 2017, with a balance of term of 1 year and 3 months to expire on 4 November 2018.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal under s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) only in respect of the 2012 offence.
	


Brief facts


	
	On either 26 or 27 October 2012, the applicant entered a home at Waterloo, while the occupants were asleep at the premises, and stole personal items being a laptop, two mobile phones, a wallet, a ring worth $400, a bankcard, a backpack and $375 in cash.
	
	
	At the time, the applicant was on parole and subject to a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). Although the applicant’s parole had been revoked shortly before the date of this offence, she had not yet been apprehended.
	
	
	Fingerprints were taken from the premises at Waterloo by the investigating police and matched to the applicant within a matter of days; that is in late October 2012.
	
	
	Despite the applicant being in custody from 2 November 2012 until 2 July 2013 serving the balance of her parole, she was not charged with this offence until 2 December 2013.
	


Sentencing remarks


	
	The sentencing judge commenced her remarks by observing that the maximum sentence for this offence is 20 years imprisonment. The offence carries a standard non-parole period of 5 years.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	With regards to the objective seriousness of the offence, the sentencing judge commented that:
	


The circumstances of the offending, the objective circumstances of the offending, as I have mentioned, are not particularly contentious nor are they particularly unusual for this sort of offence.

Subjective circumstances


	
	The sentencing judge took into account the subjective circumstances of the applicant, observing that:
	


Firstly, she is now 47 years of age. I have noted her criminal antecedents. They are very significant criminal antecedents as an adult and include the commission of a number of motor vehicle offences, a number of offences relating to violence or assaults and wounding, and a very significant number of dishonesty offences: break and enter; break, enter and steal; larceny offences and the like.

Ms Ridgeway was first imprisoned as an adult with respect to dishonesty offences in 1996 and since then has been sentenced to terms of imprisonment, on my count, on at least seven occasions, but on some of those occasions [sic] have been concurrent sentences. In 2005 I note that she was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with respect to her first aggravated break, enter and steal offence, and the recommendations to the Parole authority at that time included a recommendation that she receive counselling with respect to the issues that were then presenting, which included substance abuse and trauma from sexual assaults.

…

Some of my reasons for dealing with it in that way and for dealing with the sentence in the way I propose are contained in the evidence in the psychological report. The psychological report which was tendered by consent contains what appears to be a history of Ms Ridgeway’s background. She was born and raised in Taree. The report describes in general terms what I will summarise as being a very dysfunctional family background in which alcohol abuse, lack of adequate adult role models and lack of adult emotional availability were features of her life as a young child. The offender had difficulty with her own gender identification and a troubled understanding of her own sexuality or gender from a relatively young age. The community in which she was living was generally described in the report as being largely a dysfunctional community in which there was significant alcohol abuse and significant violence. The offender was subject to repeated sexual abuse as a young person and she left her family home at age 16.


	
	The sentencing judge also noted that the applicant:
	



	
	attended school to about year 8;
	
	
	attended TAFE courses, college courses and spent a short time at university in Queensland, however her studies were not completed as she was incarcerated around that time;
	
	
	informed the psychologist that she worked in an administrative job while studying, however, it is unclear to what extent she has had gainful employment;
	
	
	had little community support, as the people she associated with also abused substances;
	
	
	was receiving hormone therapy while in prison, and was otherwise in good health.
	


Delay


	
	Regarding the delay in charging and prosecuting the applicant for this offence, the sentencing judge said:
	


It could have been and should have been the case, as there was a fingerprint match and the authorities knew where the offender was, that the charge for this matter could have been and should have been laid well before that time. I am not going to speculate what may have happened had the charge been laid earlier. It may have been that the offender would have pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity, as she did when this charge was laid. It may have been, most likely, that an imprisonment term would have been imposed at that time. It may have been there would have been other consequent actions.

As it turned out, and there is not proper explanation from the Crown as the Crown rightly concedes, there is no proper explanation for the delay. Similarly there is no evidence before me as to the consequences of the delay, whether they be good or bad, on the offender. As it was she was released from custody on 2 July 2013 and was not charged with this particular offence until she was arrested on subsequent offences.

Now I have been referred to several cases concerning this matter, one of which is the case of Sabra, with which I am particularly familiar. In that case I do note that the District Court found that there was a detrimental consequence of the delay for Mr Sabra, and that was referred to in the initial decision and in Bellew J’s decision. I do not have such evidence in this case.

…I can certainly see and understand that generally a sentence for a stale crime should take into account the fact that it is a stale crime, but on this occasion the offender was released from custody…

I will take into account, as much as I can, any consequences of the delay. It is a matter that I will take into account to some extent in mitigation, but the delay and the mitigation that presents to the Court is taken over by all of the other matters that I would take into account with respect to sentencing Ms Ridgeway, to which I will refer later.

The notice of appeal


	
	Three grounds were advanced by the applicant as follows:
	


Ground one: Her Honour failed to make an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence contrary to s 112(2) Crimes Act 1900.

Ground two: Her Honour erred in finding that the mitigating factor of delay otherwise operating in the applicant’s favour was subsumed by other matters that would be taken into account when sentencing her.

Ground three: The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive.

Leave to appeal


	
	For the reasons that follow, the applicant’s grounds have substance and, accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal.
	


Ground one of the notice of appeal


	
	The applicant submitted that while the sentencing judge had set out the facts of the offending, the Remarks on Sentence do not reveal how her Honour applied those facts in determining the objective seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	In this regard, counsel for the applicant referred extensively to R v Van Ryn [2016] NSWCCA 1, where this Court emphasised a sentencing judge’s duty to assess the objective seriousness of an offence. Counsel also relied upon R v Campbell [2014] NSWCCA 102 at [27] where Simpson J (as her Honour then was) discussed the need to assess the objective seriousness of an offence, and said:
	


In my opinion, the assessment of objective seriousness is, and has always been, a critical component of the sentencing process…There is nothing in [Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 240 CLR 120] that cuts across the principle stated.


	
	The importance of an assessment of the seriousness of an offence emphasised in Van Ryn should be acknowledged. So too, however, should be the caution expressed in that judgment about prescribing too closely the use of a particular verbal formula in making an assessment of the objective seriousness of offending conduct.
	
	
	In Van Ryn the Court specifically referred to the earlier remarks of Hoeben CJ at CL in Delaney v R; R v Delaney [2013] NSWCCA 150; 230 A Crim R 581 where his Honour addressed this subject. His Honour said at [56]:
	


While it is true that his Honour did not in terms assess the objective gravity of the offending, he did specifically refer to the factors which bore upon its objective seriousness. His Honour took account of the amount involved, the role of the appellant, the nature of the conduct and the period over which it took place. While it may have been preferable for his Honour to have made a specific assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending, he did implicitly do so. I am satisfied that the factors to which his Honour referred were relevant and important and were given proper weight in the sentencing process. While his Honour may not have expressly determined the objective criminality of the offences, he clearly took that into account. (italics added)


	
	Those remarks are apposite in the present case. While the sentencing judge did not explicitly outline her process of reasoning in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, she clearly gave careful consideration to the nature of the offending conduct and the circumstances in which it occurred.
	
	
	In particular, in relation to objective seriousness, her Honour found that the offending:
	



	
	was opportunistic and not apparently premeditated;
	
	
	was aggravated by virtue of the occupants of the property being home, and mitigated by the fact that they were not disturbed or aware of the offending until the following morning;
	
	
	involved opening a closed door, but did not involve any property damage. It was unlikely that the offender was in the house for a lengthy period; and
	
	
	resulted in some property of value being taken and not recovered.
	



	
	Finally, after considering the facts as described above, her Honour said that other than the fact of the applicant’s status as a parolee and being subject to a s 9 bond, there were no other particularly aggravating factors in this case.
	
	
	Only very limited submissions were made by counsel for the applicant and the Crown about the objective seriousness of the offending. It was in this context that the sentencing judge remarked that the objective circumstances of the applicant’s offending were not “particularly contentious” or “unusual”.
	
	
	In my view, having made the findings about objective seriousness described at paragraphs [21] and [22] above, it cannot be said that her Honour fell into the error described in ground one of this appeal.
	
	
	I am satisfied that in this case the objective factors relating to the seriousness of the offence to which her Honour referred were relevant and important and given proper weight in the sentencing process.
	
	
	While her Honour did not expressly determine the objective criminality of the offences, she did so implicitly and clearly took the objective seriousness of the offending into account.
	
	
	No error has been shown and ground one of the notice of appeal should be dismissed.
	


Ground two of the notice of appeal


	
	The applicant submitted that her Honour erred in finding that the mitigating factor of delay otherwise operating in the applicant’s favour was subsumed by other matters that would be taken into account when sentencing her.
	
	
	The applicant emphasised that the chronology of the matter was important to her case and the way the sentencing judge dealt with it disclosed error.
	
	
	It will be recalled that the relevant offence was committed on 26 or 27 October 2012. Fingerprints located by the police at the scene were matched with the applicant on 29 October 2012.
	
	
	The applicant was in custody serving the reminder of her parole from 2 November 2012 until she was released on 2 July 2013. It may be concluded that the applicant’s location could have been confirmed almost instantly if any attempt had been made to find the applicant from early November 2012. The applicant, however, was not charged with this offence until 2 December 2013.
	
	
	Her Honour’s ultimate findings about delay were that she would:
	


…take into account, as much as I can, any consequences of the delay. It is a matter that I will take into account to some extent in mitigation, but the delay and the mitigation that presents to the Court is taken over by all of the other matters that I would take into account with respect to sentencing Ms Ridgeway…(italics added)


	
	In Blanco v R [1999] NSWCCA 121; 106 A Crim R 303, Wood CJ at CL said at [17]:
	


The reason why delay is to be taken into account when sentencing an offender relates first to the fact of the uncertain suspense in which a person may be left; secondly to any demonstrated progress of the offender towards rehabilitation during the intervening period; and thirdly, to the fact that a sentence for a stale crime does call for a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach

…

The present was not a case where the applicant had been arrested and had spent a long time awaiting sentence, or in a state of suspense as to whether he might be charged; nor is it a case where he had shown any commitment towards rehabilitation after having realised the error of the ways. However, it remains the fact that it is highly desirable that the prosecuting authorities act promptly where they have evidence of serious criminality. If they fail to do so, then they must expect that circumstance to be taken into account on sentencing. It is in the public interest that those who are suspected of serious criminality be brought to justice and be brought to justice quickly…

(italics added; citations omitted)


	
	In Sabra v R [2015] NSWCCA 38, Bellew J, at [33], cited with approval the Victorian Court of Appeal decision in R v Schwabegger [1998] 4 VR 649 at 569:
	


Delay which is not attributable to the offender, of course, constitutes “a powerful mitigatory factor”: R. v Liang and Li (1995) 124 F.L.R. 350 at 356; 82 A. Crim. R. 39 at 45. It can have relevance at a number of levels. In Duncan v R. (1983) 47 A.L.R. 746; 9 A. Crim. R. 354 the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia stated at A.L.R. 749; A. Crim. R. 356-7:

… where, prior to sentence, there has been a lengthy process of rehabilitation and the evidence does not indicate a need to protect society from the applicant, the punitive and deterrent aspects of the sentencing process should not be allowed to prevail so as to possibly destroy the results of that rehabilitation.

… The very fact of the long delay in bringing the matter to court which led the applicant to have this matter hanging over his head for nearly four years is rightly prayed in aid on his behalf.

Further, there is, in my opinion, a serious incongruity between the assertion that an offence is serious and that the courts must, through the sentences they impose, endeavour to limit its incidence, on the one hand, and such a leisurely progression of the criminal justice proceedings which follow its commission that literally years pass before the matter comes before the court, on the other. For a number of reasons, the investigation and prosecution of criminal conduct should be conducted as quickly as is reasonably practicable if the objectives of the system are to be attained. Additionally, a legitimate sense of unfairness can develop when the criminal justice process proceeds in what can be perceived as too leisurely a fashion.


	
	In R v Gay [2002] NSWCCA 6; 49 ATR 78, Mason P (RS Hulme and Hidden JJ agreeing) said at [18]:
	


The public interest as well as the legitimate private interests of the offender require a matter such as this to be brought to justice quickly. A failure by the authorities to do so will mitigate an otherwise appropriate sentence.


	
	The Crown in its submissions concentrated on the first two parts of the relevant effect of delay identified by Wood CJ at CL in Blanco, namely increased hardship to the applicant in being kept in suspense about whether he or she would be charged with the offence and the undesirable effects of delay upon an offender’s efforts at rehabilitation. The absence of these factors in the present case may be accepted.
	
	
	It is the third category explained by Wood CJ at CL in Blanco which was of principal relevance here. That is, the measure of understanding and flexibility of approach in imposing a sentence for an offence where there has been delay.
	
	
	In my view, insufficient weight in the sentencing process was given to this question of delay. The applicant was, throughout much of that period, between 2 November 2012 and 2 July 2013, in custody and could readily be located. This was a case where the relevant delay mitigated what would otherwise have been an appropriate sentence.
	
	
	It is tolerably clear that if the applicant had been charged with the 2012 offence soon after her fingerprints were identified at the end of October 2012, it is likely that she would have entered an early plea and been dealt with reasonably promptly, most likely early in 2013. She certainly lost an opportunity for that to occur by reason of the delay. This was an archetypal case for the application of a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach to sentencing.
	
	
	If the matter had proceeded in early 2013, the sentencing judge would have ordered the sentence to commence from the date of imposition of the sentence: s 47 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It is likely in those circumstances that there would have been some concurrency with the balance of the applicant’s parole period.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that delay was relevant but submitted that the sentencing judge was correct to find that the fact that the offence was committed while the applicant was on a bond and on parole, together with the sentencing judge’s conclusion about the applicant’s poor prospects of rehabilitation and her lack of intention to address her substance abuse issues, “swamped” the question of delay.
	
	
	In my view that was not a useful comparison. All of the things which the Crown pointed to would have been equally true if the applicant had been sentenced a year earlier for this offence. No doubt they were important matters to be taken into account, but the effect of delay in this case was an independent issue.
	
	
	The sentencing judge, while acknowledging the delay in this case, did not adequately take into account the applicant’s considerable lost opportunity by reason of the delay in prosecuting the 2012 offence. That delay was not a matter “swamped” by the other considerations to which her Honour referred.
	
	
	By treating delay in this way the sentencing judge failed to afford the applicant the measure of understanding and flexibility of approach to sentencing that the delay in this case required. As a result, ground two of the notice of appeal should be upheld.
	


Ground three of the notice of appeal


	
	Having upheld ground two it is unnecessary to determine ground three as it is necessary for this Court to re-exercise the sentencing discretion: Kentwell v The Queen [2015] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at 617‑618 [42].
	


Resentencing by this Court


	
	The maximum penalty for this offence is 20 years imprisonment. The standard non-parole period for this offence of 5 years is also a relevant factor.
	
	
	This offence, whilst serious, was at the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness for offences of this type. While the applicant committed the offence while on parole and in circumstances where the occupants were inside the home:
	



	
	the occupants were not aware of the offence until the following morning;
	
	
	there was no element of planning or premeditation on the part of the applicant;
	
	
	the applicant did not cause any property damage to the home;
	
	
	there was no suggestion of any kind of violent conduct on the part of the applicant.
	



	
	The applicant’s subjective case was compelling, and comprised the following factors:
	



	
	the applicant was brought up in a dysfunctional family and in a community where violence and alcohol was rife;
	
	
	she was subjected to continuous sexual abuse as a child by an uncle;
	
	
	she started using drugs at age 13, having grown up in a community where drugs and alcohol were prevalent and without any stable adult role models;
	
	
	she suffered from gender dysphoria and began dressing as a woman in her late teens;
	
	
	she was required to reside in a male gaol, with associated social isolation and restricted opportunities for education and employment within the gaol system;
	
	
	the risk of the applicant becoming institutionalised was real, given the amount of time she had spent in custody in her adult life.
	



	
	On this appeal, an affidavit of Ms Ridgeway, affirmed on 5 August 2016, was read. In that affidavit, she stated that she has made some progress towards rehabilitation since being sentenced and had completed courses and obtained employment within the gaol system. Ms Ridgeway also stated that she acknowledges the effect of substance abuse on her life and is committed to stopping using drugs. An affidavit of the applicant’s instructing solicitor, Mr Elliott affirmed 5 August 2016, was also read. This largely confirmed the matters relating to the applicant’s employment and behaviour in prison.
	
	
	Acknowledging that these are tentative first steps in a very long road to rehabilitation, they are nonetheless matters properly to be taken into account in the applicant’s favour.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, having regard the relatively low objective seriousness of the offence, the applicant’s powerful subjective case and the applicant’s lost opportunity to by reason of delay which I have described above, and after applying a utilitarian discount of 25 per cent for her plea of guilty, a sentence of 3 years imprisonment is appropriate.
	
	
	In this case there should be the same twelve month period of accumulation as was fixed by the primary judge in relation to the 2013 offences for which the applicant was originally sentenced. The sentence of imprisonment should thus commence on 5 November 2014 and expire on 4 November 2017.
	
	
	It will be recalled that the applicant was sentenced by the sentencing judge to two fixed periods of imprisonment for the two 2013 offences, of 6 months and 2 years respectively, each to commence on 5 November 2013. To reflect the fact of this earlier period of continuous custody, the sentencing judge made an adjustment to the non-parole period fixed for the 2012 offence in isolation, so as to give effect to the statutory ratio and apply it to the total effective sentence for the 2013 and 2012 offences.
	
	
	There is in my view a need to make a finding of special circumstances in this case so as to reflect the statutory ratio as applying to the total effective sentence for the 2013 and 2012 offences.
	
	
	Accordingly I would impose a non-parole period of 2 years for this offence commencing on 5 November 2014 and expiring on 4 November 2016 with a balance of term of one year. This has the effect that the applicant, at the expiry of the non-parole period on 4 November 2016, will have served a period of 3 years full time custody for the 2012 and 2013 offences and will have a balance of term of 1 year.
	


Orders


	
	For the forgoing reasons, the orders I propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	Quash the sentence for the offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act committed on 26 or 27 October 2012 imposed on 1 May 2015 in the District Court.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, for the offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act committed on 26 or 27 October 2012, the applicant be sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 3 years commencing on 5 November 2014 and expiring on 4 November 2017, comprising a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 5 November 2014 and expiring on 4 November 2016, and a balance of term of 12 months expiring on 4 November 2017.
	
	
	The applicant is to be released on parole at the end of the non-parole period. Parole is to be subject to the standard conditions prescribed under the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 including as to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service.
	



	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Payne JA.
	
	
	ADAMSON J: I agree with Payne JA.

2701141,R v Raymond Roff [2016] NSWSC 1151,"Judgment


	
	The trial of Raymond Roff for murder commenced before me on 14 April 2016. On 13 May 2016 the jury returned their verdict finding him guilty as charged: that on 29 July 2013 at Dubbo he did murder Alois Rez.
	
	
	The sentence hearing for the offender was completed on 12 August 2016. It did not proceed immediately after the trial because I considered that it would be necessary to defer passing sentence until I had considered evidence and submissions in relation to the sentencing of Sarah Tarrant. She was complicit in the homicide of Alois Rez and was found guilty of manslaughter on 14 April 2016. Due to limitations upon the availability of Sarah Tarrant’s counsel and of two psychiatric expert witnesses, her sentence hearing could not take place until 1 July 2016.
	


Particulars of the offence


	
	From June 2012 until his death in the early hours of 29 July 2013 Alois Rez lived at 46 Alfred Street Dubbo with his partner Sarah Tarrant and their 4 children. Alois Rez was 33 years old at the date of his death and Sarah Tarrant was 24. Raymond Roff was 51. From December 2012 the offender and Sarah Tarrant had been strongly attracted to each other and from March 2013 they were in a passionate affair. On 25 July 2013 they agreed to kill Alois Rez so that they could be together publicly.
	


Maximum penalty


	
	The maximum penalty of life imprisonment for murder may be reduced to a specific term of years pursuant to s 61(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). Such a reduction may not be made if “the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through” a sentence of life imprisonment. I am not satisfied that this case attracts the statutory bar in s 61(1). I consider that I must fix a finite term of imprisonment. In doing so I will have regard to the standard non‑parole period of 20 years which applies to the offence of murder under Pt 4 Div 1A, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	


Personal circumstances of Raymond Roff


	
	This terrible crime was an extraordinary exception to everything about the offender’s character and conduct up to that date. Raymond Roff gave evidence of his background at trial. More information emerged from a long letter he wrote to Sarah Tarrant in March 2013, from a psychologist’s report and testimonials tendered on sentence.
	
	
	Roff was born in Dubbo on 8 January 1962. His father was a violent alcoholic. His mother “had mental health issues and was very passive aggressive” towards her children. By the time he was 14 he had four younger sisters and five younger brothers. Then his father died at the age of 38. Up to that point his childhood had been harsh, now it ended. He assumed responsibility for his younger brothers and sisters and took jobs before and after school hours to provide for the family.
	
	
	The offender’s education ended at year 10 and he began full-time seasonal work, harvesting fruit and crops in the Dubbo area. At about this time his mother took up with another man and moved to live with him. She took the three youngest children. Raymond Roff was left to be the breadwinner and head of household for himself and six of his siblings. The eldest of his sisters says that he worked hard to ensure that they would not have to be taken into care. Prior to his mother’s departure he had an ambition to become a soldier; that had to be abandoned. His sister credits him that he never complained or blamed anyone for his disappointments and misfortunes.
	
	
	When he was 18 the offender commenced a relationship with the girl who would become his wife, Cathy. She was 16. The offender became a father at 18. Six more children followed over the next 10 years. Raymond and Cathy Roff planned to travel together once their children had grown up. With that in mind the offender worked in a variety of occupations, to acquire skills which would make him readily employable wherever he and Cathy might travel far off in the future.
	
	
	The third child of Raymond and Cathy Roff, a son, was lost to cot death at 12 weeks. After this tragedy Cathy began to develop symptoms of mental illness. Some years later she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The causes appear to have included childhood experiences as well as the loss of her baby boy. She suffered these illnesses until her death in 2012, with frequent self-harm and attempts to take her own life. There were times when the offender feared to go to work and leave her alone. Raymond Roff’s eldest sister describes him as highly protective of his wife. He never faltered in his love for her, stood by her and their children. He shared with all of them the many difficulties life threw at them.
	
	
	In April 2003 whilst working for the Rural Lands Protection Board the offender was seriously injured. A quad bike tipped over while a workmate was trying to drive it up a ramp onto the tray of a truck. The offender “drove [his] shoulder into the bike and caught it and put it back on the truck so that it didn’t land on top of [the fellow worker]”. In describing this event in his evidence the offender was matter of fact about his selfless exposure to personal danger. The incident tore the nerves in the offender’s left arm and damaged discs in his cervical and lumbar spine. The latter in turn caused sciatic nerve damage which interfered with the functionality of his legs. Raymond Roff returned to light duties after surgery but has been significantly physically disabled and in discomfort ever since.
	
	
	From about 2003 up to July 2013 the offender worked part-time on call as a maintenance man for a motel in Dubbo. In that period he also carried out some building and renovating work as a self-employed contractor in the Dubbo district. The psychologist’s report tendered on his behalf includes the results of formal scientific testing of his functional intelligence, placing him “in the average range”. This assessment does not do him credit for his demonstrated practical capability and powers of thought and expression. In the course of his life he has attained many working skills. He was articulate, well spoken and quick thinking in giving his evidence. His long love letter to Sarah Tarrant, written in March 2013, is lucid. It shows depth in reflections upon his life and in forthright expression of his feelings.
	
	
	By May 2010 Cathy Roff must have been responding to treatment. With the youngest child having reached adulthood the couple began to make plans in accordance with their early idea of travel in retirement. It never happened. Cathy was diagnosed with cancer. The offender nursed her over the next 2 years. She died in May 2012.
	
	
	By his own account, which I accept, the offender had been a faithful husband for over 30 years and a loving and interested parent. In various aspects of his evidence he exhibited a strong family sense and a nurturing disposition. His eldest sister attests to this. He told the psychologist that for a period after Cathy’s death he “just didn’t care”. He withdrew socially.
	


The offender’s connection with the deceased and the co-offender


	
	The offender had known the deceased’s mother, Zonia Rez, from school days in the 1970s. Alois Rez was of a similar age to the offender’s eldest son and the two boys had played weekend team sport together when they were young. In his early teens Alois Rez moved with his mother from Dubbo to the Newcastle area. Raymond Roff had no further contact with them until mid-2010. At that time he meet socially with Alois Rez and Sarah Tarrant over several weeks whilst the late Cathy Roff was receiving treatment at the John Hunter Hospital, near to where Mr Rez and Sarah Tarrant then lived.
	
	
	When Alois Rez and Sarah Tarrant moved with their children and Zonia Rez back to Dubbo in June 2012 they initially stayed for a short time at the offender’s home. Upon moving to 46 Alfred Street Dubbo they commenced renovating their home. The offender assisted in this work, both physically and as an advisor. He began to visit the home daily, often just for company.
	
	
	During the second half of 2012 and through early 2013 the offender showed interest in and affection for the children of Sarah Tarrant and Alois Rez. The children were then aged between 6 months and 6 years. Raymond Roff assisted Sarah Tarrant with their care on his visits to the home. He became close to her and showed her kindness and consideration. She confided in him that she was unhappy with Alois Rez, that he demeaned and criticised her, that he was lazy and demanding. She told the offender that Zonia Rez also criticised and belittled her. She said she would gladly end the relationship with Alois Rez.
	
	
	The passion which the offender came to feel for Sarah Tarrant from late 2012 unhinged his judgment. He had been of sound sense and morality throughout all his adult years to this point. By every account given in evidence before me he was a solid, honest, hard-working family man. It is material to the determination of an appropriate sentence that I should trace, briefly, the development of Raymond Roff’s relationship with his co-offender. His descent to murder is directly attributable to his infatuation with this young woman.
	
	
	I make the following findings of fact with due regard for the requirement that matters tending to mitigate the seriousness of Raymond Roff’s offending and facts subjectively in his favour need only be proved on the balance of probabilities. Facts tending to add to the seriousness of the crime or militating against lenience on a subjective basis require proof beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	In about December 2012 Sarah Tarrant began to make very explicit sexual overtures to the offender. On one occasion she deliberately exposed herself to the offender then asked him if he liked what he had seen. Soon after she entered her phone number in Raymond Roff’s phone and suggested that it be filed under “yes please”. During January 2013 Sarah Tarrant commenced to send Roff sexually explicit photographs of herself. I accept his evidence that this continued through to July 2013.
	
	
	This strong encouragement commenced to be accepted by the offender in early 2013, with increasingly intimate physical contact leading to sexual intercourse for the first time on 3 March 2013. At Easter 2013, which was at the end of March, Sarah Tarrant wrote a long love letter addressed to the offender. She left this for him in his motorhome, then located at Burrendong Dam 70 km Southeast of Dubbo. The offender replied in a letter of similar length, to which I have earlier referred. The offender declared he wanted to marry Sarah Tarrant and promised to be a good husband and a good father to her children. From March onwards they met many times at locations around Dubbo for sexual intercourse They met on most weekdays when Sarah Tarrant’s children were at school and sometimes twice on such days.
	
	
	In the offender’s own words to the reporting psychologist, “I was lonely. I could talk to her and what she was telling me was what I wanted to hear”. His psychologist interprets his life history as suggesting “a pattern of general emotional withdrawal from others but a tendency to identify one individual who he attaches to and he seeks to meet all his emotional needs through this relationship”. With the loss of his wife the “one individual” became Sarah Tarrant.
	
	
	According to his self-assessment, expressed in the course of giving evidence, Raymond Roff had a strong sex drive. Sarah Tarrant showed willing. The feelings may have been mutual or she may have done what was necessary to satisfy the offender, to keep his interest and have him take responsibility for her – I cannot tell which.
	
	
	Sarah Tarrant had been unhappy in her relationship with Alois Rez from soon after it began in 2004. They had commenced living together as man and wife when she was 15 years old. Alois Rez was 9½ years older. She gave birth to the first of their four children at the age of 16. Sarah Tarrant had had an unfulfilling relationship with her father. She has been diagnosed as having a personality disorder with dependent traits. It is clear to me that she looked to an older man to take responsibility for her. She looked first to Alois Rez and, when she felt she had become a slave to him and that she was not valued or respected by him, she looked to Raymond Roff.
	
	
	For Sarah Tarrant the impediment to fulfilment of her wish to be with the offender was that she feared Alois Rez would deprive her of her children, should she leave him. She told the offender that she also feared Alois Rez might be violent towards her following a separation. She said in evidence that she held such a fear. The offender’s evidence at his trial was that Sarah Tarrant never reported to him any violence by Alois Rez towards her during the 13 months they had lived together in Dubbo, except one minor incident on 23 July 2013, six days before Mr Rez was killed.
	


Lead up to the murder


	
	In May 2013 Sarah Tarrant told the offender she wanted Alois Rez “gone”. She meant by this that she wanted him dead. The offender so understood it. In the offender’s trial Sarah Tarrant gave evidence to this effect regarding the conversation of May 2013, which I accept. The offender denied that there was such a conversation but I find these matters proved beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Sarah Tarrant gave no evidence of any further specific discussion with the offender between May 2013 and 25 July 2013 on the subject of having Alois Rez “gone”. I do not accept that there was no further mention of the subject in this interval. But there is no evidence upon which I could make an affirmative finding about any particular additional discussion. That is because (a) the offender has at all times denied having ever spoken to Sarah Tarrant about killing or harming Alois Rez and (b) Sarah Tarrant, whilst admitting an agreement with the offender to kill the deceased and admitting her participation in the carrying out of that plan, has given evidence only of the conversations in May and July 2013. There was no other witness to any additional conversations which may have taken place between these dates.
	
	
	In June 2013 Sarah Tarrant informed the offender she was pregnant. She told him he was the father and he believed her. On about 15 July 2013 he gave her an ultimatum. Within 3 weeks she would have to have to leave Alois Rez and become Roff’s partner in a relationship that would be open and public. Otherwise, the offender said, he would break off his relationship with Sarah Tarrant altogether. She cried when this was put to her and terminated the conversation without answering.
	
	
	On 23 July 2013 the offender visited 46 Alfred Street for some hours during the evening. He left at about 10:30 pm. After his departure Alois Rez accused Sarah Tarrant of conducting an affair with the offender. There was a moderate physical altercation between them. She was pushed and dragged along the hallway. Sarah Tarrant sent a text message to the offender describing the incident and saying Alois Rez had tried to eject her from the home. She asked the offender to call the police. One of her text messages at this time also informed the offender that Alois Rez had said late in the evening that the offender was not to come to the house any more.
	
	
	The offender called the police on the emergency services number. When they attended 46 Alfred Street Sarah Tarrant told them there was no problem. This caused the officers to enquire of the offender what had prompted his emergency call. The episode angered the offender against Sarah Tarrant. In the next day or so he told her that this had been their chance to have the police remove Alois Rez and that they would not have another such opportunity. Instead of capitalising on the chance she had made a fool of him. He repeated his ultimatum of the previous week.
	
	
	At this Sarah Tarrant cried again and told the offender, for the first time, that Alois Rez had been violent towards her in the past. The implication was that she was physically afraid to leave Alois Rez.
	
	
	Sarah Tarrant gave evidence that she met with the offender on 25 July 2013 and they formed a concrete plan for the elimination of the deceased. The offender supplied her with sleeping tablets and told her these should be crushed and mixed into Alois Rez’s evening meal on a night when his mother, Zonia Rez, who shared the house at 46 Alfred Street, was away. He instructed that when Alois Rez went into a deep sleep she was to let the offender know and he would come to the house. She understood that the offender would then kill the deceased. He did not explain what he would do with the body. He told Sarah Tarrant it would be safer for her not to know these details.
	
	
	The offender and Sarah Tarrant agreed that they would not immediately report Alois Rez missing. They intended that when his absence was noted they would promote a story that he was likely to have been kidnapped and eliminated by members of the Rebels Outlaw Motorcycle Gang with whom the deceased had had a disagreement in early 2012. I accept beyond reasonable doubt Sarah Tarrant’s evidence to the effect summarised in this and the preceding paragraph.
	
	
	According to the offender’s own evidence, on Sunday 28 July 2013 Alois Rez rang and invited him to visit 46 Alfred Street. Upon the offender attending, around the middle of the day, Alois Rez asked him “Are we right?”. The offender understood this to be a request for assurance that there were no hard feelings between the two men following Alois Rez having accused the offender of misconduct with Sarah Tarrant and having said that he was no longer welcome at their home. The offender replied “We’re always right”. All the same, he murdered Alois Rez about 14 hours later in accordance with the plan he had made with Sarah Tarrant three days before.
	
	
	During the afternoon of Sunday 28 July 2013 Sarah Tarrant drove Alois Rez’s mother to the Dubbo railway station to board a train bound for Sydney. It was expected she would be away for at least a week. That night Sarah Tarrant mixed the crushed sleeping tablets into a serving of mashed potato which was part of a meal she made for Alois Rez. As he became drowsy and eventually fell into a deep sleep, Sarah Tarrant kept the offender informed by text messages about the victim’s state of consciousness. Pursuant to the offender’s request she left the front door of 46 Alfred Street unlocked, switched off a sensor light at the front of the house and disconnected a closed-circuit camera which normally displayed movements around the front of the property on a monitor in the deceased’s bedroom.
	
	
	At about 1:50 am when Alois Rez was sleeping soundly enough not to be disturbed by a train passing nearby, Sarah Tarrant conveyed this information to the offender by text. He came to the house at about 2:00 am. He entered the bedroom and killed the deceased. The manner in which Alois Rez died is not known because his body has never been recovered. The offender dragged the body, wrapped in bedding, from the bedroom to the front driveway. He had backed his vehicle close to the house. Sarah Tarrant helped him lift the body into the back of the vehicle. The offender drove out into the countryside and disposed of the body at an unknown location. He instructed Sarah Tarrant in an SMS to hose off the driveway, which she did.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that mortal injuries were inflicted on the deceased in his bedroom. His body was motionless when the offender and Sarah Tarrant lifted it into the back of the offender’s vehicle. Alois Rez was by that time either dead or close to death from wounds inflicted while he lay asleep.
	
	
	The victim’s aunt and his mother were aware of his absence within a few days of 29 July 2013. On 2 August they reported him as a missing person to Dubbo police.
	
	
	Sarah Tarrant lied to police, in denial of their homicide of Alois Rez, during a lengthy interview on 2 August 2013. The same day Raymond Roff made a statement to police about the matter in which he lied about not knowing the circumstances of Alois Rez’s disappearance. During the following week police examined the offender’s vehicle and found dried blood in its rear compartment. This was later linked by DNA profiling to the deceased. A search warrant was executed at the offender’s home on Friday 9 August 2013. During its execution the offender at first denied to police any relationship between himself and Sarah Tarrant. The love letters which had been exchanged between the offender and Sarah Tarrant in March of that year were then found. The offender made valiant but unconvincing efforts to explain his initial denial of the affair.
	
	
	On the night of 9 August 2014, under effective questioning by Detective Sgt Baker of the Dubbo detectives, Sarah Tarrant confessed most of the facts about the plan she had made with the offender for the killing of Alois Rez. During the early hours of 10 August 2013 a record of interview was conducted with the offender in which he said there had never been such a plan. He claimed to have no idea what had happened to Alois Rez.
	
	
	Raymond Roff maintained this stance in his evidence at trial. He admitted to the jury he had attended the residence in the early hours of Monday 29 July but said his purpose was not to kill Alois Rez, only to light a fire on his driveway to frighten him into believing that the Rebels had left a “calling card” or warning. He said this was the plan he and Sarah Tarrant had made. The implementation of this plan was what was referred to in the text messages between them on the night. The jury evidently rejected this.
	


Objective seriousness of the murder


	
	Objectively this was a very serious murder. It was premeditated, planned in detail several days beforehand and implemented coldly and thoroughly. Raymond Roff was a family friend of the victim. He had known the victim from when he was a childhood playmate of one of his own sons. He did not kill Alois Rez in a fit of rage, on the spur of the moment or in uncontrolled desperation. The crime was calculated for the advancement of the offender’s interests, to enable him to take up with the younger man’s de facto wife.
	
	
	The murder was the more serious for having been carried out in concert with another (s 21A(2)(e) and (n) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act), albeit there could be no suggestion that the offender co-opted or corrupted his younger co-conspirator. It was her idea. Psychiatric evidence was given concerning Sarah Tarrant in the joint sentence hearing following the two trials. I accept the psychiatrists’ opinions that Sarah Tarrant held an exaggerated perception of Alois Rez’s power in relation to her and that she did not appreciate her own potential – for example, to leave him and take the children, to win custody of them and to obtain police protection against him. In effect the psychiatrists describe Sarah Tarrant as a case of arrested development, a person who entered a de facto marriage at 15 and never matured emotionally or socially thereafter.
	
	
	Why Raymond Roff was not able to open Sarah Tarrant’s eyes to a lawful solution for her situation remains unexplained. The offender has given no evidence on the topic and only he would be able to say. He certainly tried to bring about police intervention on the night of 23 July 2013 and he remonstrated with Sarah Tarrant for not having then taken the opportunity to have Alois Rez removed from the house lawfully.
	
	
	Accompanying his physical attraction to her, Roff’s strength of feeling for Sarah Tarrant appears to have been sincere and decent. She became everything to him. With her he felt he could be a young man again, starting over with a second family, of her children and their own. Without her the future was cold, widowed and alone in a country town. The starkness of the alternatives overwhelmed him. To achieve his clear preference, he adopted criminal means proposed by the woman he did not want to lose. This describes and to some extent explains what occurred. It is no justification.
	


Statutory and other considerations


	
	I do not treat as an aggravating circumstance of this crime either of the matters referred to in pars (b) and (g) of s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). That is, the use of violence and the infliction of substantial harm. Those features were inherent in the offence of murder and to treat them as aggravating would be to double count.
	
	
	The murder in this case involved the use of a stupefying drug (par (cb) of s 21A(2)). I have already mentioned that it was committed in company (par (e)) and was part of a planned criminal activity (par (n)). The fact that the victim was killed in his own home is also aggravating (par (eb)). These factors are aspects of the objective seriousness of the offence to which I attach significance.
	
	
	With respect to the statutory mitigating factors in s 21A(3) the offender is entitled to credit for the absence of any relevant prior convictions (par (e)) and for his prior good character (par (f)). It is highly unlikely he would reoffend. There would never be repetition of the circumstances which led to this extreme aberration from his good character, even if he were at liberty. Given the length of the sentence which I must impose taking into account all other considerations, the possibility of reoffending is all the more unlikely. His prospects of rehabilitation (par (h)) are good, notwithstanding his obstinacy in denying his crime.
	
	
	The offender has shown no remorse. He continues to disclaim responsibility for the death of Alois Rez. This has led him also to deny knowledge of the location of the body. The consequence is ongoing pain for relatives of the deceased.
	
	
	Victim impact statements of Zonia Rez, the deceased’s mother, Arthur Smart, his brother, and Anne Smart, his sister, were read at the sentence hearing pursuant to s 28 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The statements attest to positive aspects of the deceased’s character and his close family bonds. The loss inflicted upon these family members by the killing of Alois Rez is starkly brought out by their impact statements. A further victim impact statement was read by the deceased’s aunt, describing the effect on the four young children of the victim, deprived of their father. They will be deprived of their mother as well because she will be imprisoned for manslaughter. Raymond Roff has wreaked a catastrophe on these four young innocents.
	
	
	This is Raymond Roff’s first time in prison. Discomfort from his work injury earlier referred to will likely worsen with advancing years and will be harder to cope with in prison than it would be under the care he could receive outside the corrective system. I have regard to these factors towards lenience for such weight as I can give them.
	


Reasons for exceeding standard non-parole period


	
	The sentence I am about to impose will include a non-parole period which exceeds the statutory standard of 20 years referred to at [4]. My reasons for fixing a longer non-parole period are, principally,
	



	
	the aspects of objective seriousness referred to at [41];
	
	
	the aggravating features referred to at [46] and
	
	
	the absence of remorse or of acknowledgement of his crime, as referred to at [48].
	



	
	In determining to set a non-parole period longer than the standard, I have evaluated the considerations listed in the preceding paragraph, for the purposes of s 54B(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and in the context of the entirety of the features of the case referred to in these remarks.
	


Relationship between non-parole period and balance of term


	
	I do not find any special circumstances under s 44(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which would require that the balance of term of the offender’s sentence should exceed one third of the non-parole period which I intend to fix. The uniqueness of the circumstances which led to commission of this crime, the absence of any relevant prior criminal record and the improbability of re-offending make it unnecessary to provide for an extended period of parole during which he could be supervised by Community Corrections.
	


Consistency with sentences in comparable cases


	
	The Crown cited two sentence decisions in cases where murders were carried out with the assistance of a co-offender in a premeditated and carefully planned fashion for financial gain or to eliminate a marital partner. Also cited were four instances of sentencing for the premeditated murder of a wife, de facto partner or girlfriend without the involvement of a co-offender. I have considered the objective and subjective factors taken into account in each of these decisions and in remarks on sentence in other cases of which I am aware. I have not identified any cases containing a significant combination points of comparability with the sentencing considerations identified in these remarks. There is thus no reference point for making a comparison in pursuit of consistency.
	


Firearms offence taken into account


	
	When Raymond Roff was arrested police found in his possession 3 air rifles and 10 other rifles including one repeating weapon. Most of these firearms were found on top of a wardrobe in an outhouse or shed on the residential property where he lived in Dubbo. The repeating rifle was in a cupboard in the main residence. None of the weapons were secured or safely stored. On 10 August 2013 he was charged with an offence of failing to keep firearms safely contrary to s 39(1)(a) Firearms Act 1996 (NSW). In relation to weapons of the type concerned here, this offence carries a maximum penalty of 12 months imprisonment or 20 penalty units ($2,200) or both. The offender has agreed to have the offence taken into account in his sentence for murder on a Form 1 pursuant to s 32 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	He has one prior firearms offence. Namely that in 1981 he discharged rifle near a public place. His account of this is that in a situation of escalating violence he fired into the air to bring a group of people to their senses. He then reported himself immediately to police and handed in the weapon. In the Local Court at Dubbo a bond was imposed. I do not regard the prior offence nor anything else on his record as disentitling him from lenience in respect of the offence now charged relating to the manner in which he kept guns at his home in 2013.
	
	
	I will take the offence into account, as asked. I consider that this makes no significant difference to the sentence that I would have imposed in any event. The Crown did not submit that it should have a large impact. In the absence of any aggravating circumstances the offence would likely have been dealt with adequately by way of a bond if it had been disposed of in the Local Court. The guns were not in a situation where children might gain access to them and harm themselves, for example, or where people with criminal or violent intentions might become aware of them and use them to harm others.
	


Second firearms offence, separately dealt with


	
	Arising out of the finding of the weapons referred to at [55] Roff was also charged with possession of unauthorised firearms contrary to s 7A(1) Firearms Act. The charge has been transferred to this Court pursuant to s 166 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). The maximum penalty is 5 years imprisonment. Possession of these weapons was unauthorised in that he held no licence or permit for them. The police statement of facts does not suggest any aggravating circumstance such as an intention to deal with the guns or involvement in any criminal activity in which they might potentially have been used. On the other hand, nor has the offender given any explanation for holding such a number of firearms or failing to take out a licence in relation to any of them.
	
	
	Ordinarily this charge would have been disposed of in the Local Court, where the maximum penalty would have been 2 years imprisonment or 50 penalty units ($5,500) or both. I consider that a fine of $2000 is the appropriate penalty.
	


Sentence


	
	The offender has been in custody for a total of 3 years and 10 days, being from his arrest up to today’s date. To allow the time served to count the sentence I impose will commence on 9 August 2013, the date of arrest.
	
	
	The offender is sentenced as follows:
	



	
	For the murder of Alois Rez at Dubbo on 29 July 2013 Raymond Isaac Roff is sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 24 years to commence on 9 August 2013 and to expire on 8 August 2037 and a balance of term of 8 years to commence on 9 August 2037 and to expire on 8 August 2045.
	
	
	Raymond Isaac Roff will be eligible for release on parole at the expiry of the non-parole period.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 25C(1) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) the offender is notified that the provisions of the Act apply to him and to the offending the subject of these proceedings.
	
	
	For the offence of possessing unauthorised firearms at Dubbo between 9 and 10 August 2013 contrary to s 7A(1) Firearms Act 1996 (NSW) Raymond Roff is fined the sum of $2000.

		21 April 2017",2016-08-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701155,Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Cui [2016] NSWSC 1118,"Judgment


	
	These proceedings have been brought by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (“AFP”) under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth). On 1 December 2015 the Court made a restraining order pursuant to s 19 of that Act upon the application of the Commissioner in respect of $199,990 in cash which had been seized by AFP agents on 11 March 2015. The interlocutory issue now before the Court concerns the sequence in which two substantive applications should be heard, one being an application for exclusion of the cash from the restraining order (s 31) by persons interested in that property and the other being a claim by the AFP for an order forfeiting the cash to the Commonwealth (s 49).
	
	
	On 11 March 2013 at approximately 1:00pm Weilei Cui, a female, was observed by Federal Agent Burtenshaw to enter the World Square branch of the National Australia Bank (“NAB”) in Sydney. She was carrying a black bag which she took into an office adjacent to the public area of the banking chamber. In the office Ms Cui unpacked from the black bag bundles of Australian currency notes totalling $199,990. Shortly afterwards she was joined in the office by Bei Jiang, a female.
	
	
	Federal Agent Burtenshaw intervened in the dealings between Weilei Cui and Bei Jiang and NAB personnel. He introduced himself and shortly after he was joined by Federal Agent Blunden. From 1:55pm Federal Agent Burtenshaw conducted a record of interview with Weilei Cui in which he obtained explanations of how she came to be in possession of the cash. He regarded the explanations as unsatisfactory and implausible.
	
	
	At approximately 2:39pm Sushan Li, the husband of Weilei Cui, attended the bank. Federal Agent Blunden interviewed him and obtained his explanations of the origins of the cash. These were inconsistent with the explanations offered by Ms Cui and they involved internal contradictions. Shushan Li terminated the interview with Federal Agent Blunden in a state of agitation. He was escorted from the bank by police. The cash was seized by the Federal agents.
	
	
	The AFP subsequently examined international passenger movement records for Weilei Cui, Sushan Li and others, reviewed records of the Australian Transactions Reports and Analysis Centre (“AUSTRAC”), undertook real property and company searches and made enquiries with four banks. They considered correspondence from a solicitor acting on behalf of Cui and Li. At the end of these enquiries Federal Agent Burtenshaw held a suspicion that the seized cash was either the proceeds of, or an instrument of, one or more serious offences.
	
	
	The offences in the officer’s contemplation were breach of s 400.9 Criminal Code (the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth)) (dealing with money reasonably suspected to be proceeds of crime) and breach of s 53 Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) (“the Money Laundering Act”) (moving currency not less than $10,000 into or out of Australia without report). Those are indictable and serious offences within the meaning of subpars (i) and (ii) of s 19(1)(d) Proceeds of Crime Act. It was on the basis of Federal Agent Burtenshaw’s suspicions that the restraining order over the cash was made by the Court on 1 December 2015.
	
	
	The Commissioner’s summons filed 2 October 2015 seeks at par 10 an order for forfeiture of the $199,990 cash, pursuant to s 49 Proceeds of Crime Act. That aspect of the summons should be listed for hearing as soon as all interlocutory processes relating to the summons have been completed. The pre-requisites for the making of a forfeiture order are, first, that it is applied for by “the responsible authority for a restraining order under section 19 that covers the property” (s 19(1)(a)). This requirement is satisfied because the Commissioner is such a responsible authority. Secondly, it is required that a restraining order should have been in place for six months (s 49(1)(b)), which again has been satisfied. Thirdly and fourthly, by operation of pars (c) and (e) of s 49 (1):
	


“(c)  the court is satisfied that one or more of the following applies:

(i) the property is *proceeds of one or more *indictable offences;

(ii) the property is proceeds of one or more *foreign indictable

offences;

(iii) the property is proceeds of one or more *indictable offences of

Commonwealth concern;

(iv) the property is an instrument of one or more *serious offences; and

(e)  the court is satisfied that the authority has taken reasonable steps to

identify and notify persons with an *interest in the property.”


	
	With respect to the third prerequisite set out in par (e) quoted above, it is provided by subs (2) that this does not require that the Court should find a particular person committed any offence or that any particular offence was committed. It would be sufficient for the Court to be satisfied that “some offence or other of a kind referred to in paragraph 1(c) was committed”.
	
	
	Subsection (3) of s 49 is in these terms:
	


“(3)  Paragraph (1)(c) does not apply if the court is satisfied that:

(a)  no application has been made under Division 3 of Part 2-1 for the property to be excluded from the *restraining order; or

(b)  any such application that has been made has been withdrawn.”


	
	Division 3 of Pt 2-1 comprises ss 29-32. In this case Weilei Cui and Sushan Li (“the Applicants”) filed on 7 December 2015 a notice of motion seeking orders pursuant to ss 29 and 31 of the Act that the seized cash be excluded from the restraining order. As the cash is the only property restrained, if this exclusion order should be made there would be nothing left under restraint which could be forfeited under s 49. The Applicants’ notice of motion also claimed revocation of the restraining order, however that paragraph of the notice of motion was dismissed by consent on 25 May 2016.
	
	
	The Applicants now seek directions for the exchange of evidence in relation to the Commissioner’s claim for a forfeiture order under his summons and they ask that the date be appointed for hearing that application. They seek to have the forfeiture application heard before their own notice of motion for exclusion. That sequence of procedure would be illogical, inappropriate and contrary to the Applicants’ own interests. Should the Commissioner succeed in his forfeiture application the cash would vest “absolutely in the Commonwealth at the time the [forfeiture] order is made” (s 66). The restraining order would thereafter no longer be operative and the Applicant’s application for an order to exclude the cash from its reach would be futile.
	
	
	In Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Zhang (Ruling No 1) [2015] VSC 390 T Forrest J of the Supreme Court of Victoria had before him for hearing both an application by the AFP for forfeiture orders and applications by two parties, Zhang and Shen, for exclusion orders in respect of certain property. His Honour decided at [33] that he should hear the forfeiture application first: “Should it be successful I will then hear the exclusion applications. Should it be unsuccessful it will not be necessary to hear those applications.” His Honour considered this course preferable as a matter of procedural fairness because it would require the Commissioner to go first in evidence, in support of his case on forfeiture. If the Commissioner should fail to make out this case, particularly in relation to par 1(c) of s 49, then the parties seeking exclusion orders would not need to press their application and need not go into evidence. In arriving at this decision his Honour placed considerable reliance upon reasoning in Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Zhao [2015] HCA 5; (2015) 255 CLR 46 at [29] and [37], a case in which the High Court considered the procedural disadvantages to an accused person if a forfeiture application in respect of property claimed by the accused should be heard in advance of that person’s trial on criminal charges. In the event his Honour dismissed the forfeiture application after hearing it first and therefore did not need to consider the exclusion application.
	
	
	The decision of T Forrest J was handed down in August 2015. It was referred to in correspondence between the solicitors for the Commissioner and for the Applicants, respectively, in late May and early June 2016. On 2 June 2016 the Court ordered that the Applicants serve by 29 June 2016 submissions concerning the sequence in which the completing applications should be heard. The summons and the Applicants’ motion were listed before the duty judge on 2 August 2016 for this question to be resolved. Submissions dated 29 June 2016 were served on about that date but not filed. They relied heavily on T Forrest J’s judgment.
	
	
	On 22 July 2016 the full bench of the Victorian Court of Appeal granted leave to the Commissioner of the AFP to appeal T Forrest J’s decision and allowed the appeal: Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Zhang [2016] VSCA 171. In a joint judgment the Court held that his Honour had erred in relying upon Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Zhao, thereby introducing concepts of procedural fairness which could not prevail over the clear structure and operation of the Proceeds of Crime Act. The following extracted paragraphs of the Court of Appeal’s judgment explain the Court’s reasoning sufficiently for consideration of its application to the present case (footnotes and references have been removed):
	


“[71] In our opinion, the orders dismissing the forfeiture applications are not interlocutory. They are final orders. The effect of the orders is that none of the Canterbury property, the Mercedes, or the Ashwood property is subject to any restraining order under the Act. The restrained property is released. There are no further steps to be taken towards a final disposition of the proceeding at first instance.

[72] We consider that Ruling No 1, and the consequential orders, were made in error. The sequence adopted by the judge was erroneous and the source of the error lay in the judge’s misconstruction of the Act. Upon its proper construction, the Act required the judge to determine the s 31 exclusion applications before determining the forfeiture applications. The error arose because the judge was persuaded that a beneficial reading of the Act which favoured Zhang and Shen should be preferred to a plain reading of the text of the Act.

[73] In our view, Zhang and Shen, in submitting that there was nothing impermissible about the sequence adopted by the judge because, if necessary, the exclusion applications (or, more particularly, the s 31 exclusion applications) could be heard after the making of any forfeiture orders and the result ‘would have been the same’, have elided the difference between exclusion applications made pursuant to s 31 of the Act and exclusion applications made pursuant to s 74 of the Act. It is necessary in construing the Act to be mindful that exclusion applications made pursuant to s 31 of the Act are applications to exclude property (or an interest in property) from the operation of restraining orders; whereas exclusion applications made pursuant to s 74 of the Act are applications made to exclude property (or an interest in property) from the operation of forfeiture orders. The distinction between the effect of restraining orders and forfeiture orders is critical.

[74] While restraining orders have the effect of restricting the exercise of rights of ownership over property in the interim, forfeiture orders exhibit a degree of finality. As noted, s 66 of the Act provides that property specified in a forfeiture order vests absolutely in the Commonwealth at the time the forfeiture order is made. In other words, forfeiture orders effect a transfer of ownership in property. While s 73 exclusion orders from forfeiture may be determined after a forfeiture order is made, this is because the Act makes express accommodation for directions, after the property has vested in the Commonwealth, for the Commonwealth to transfer the interest to the applicant, pursuant to s 73(2)(c), or, if the property has been disposed of, for the Commonwealth to pay the applicant an amount equal to the value of the interest concerned, pursuant to s 73(2)(d). There is no such accommodation made under the Act, post forfeiture, in respect of exclusion applications from restraining orders under s 29. This is so for the very reason that the Act envisages that exclusion applications from restraining orders will have been dealt with before forfeiture applications are heard and determined. In other words, if a forfeiture application is successful — and that possibility must always be open at the time a court embarks upon the hearing of the application — there will be no utility in persisting with an exclusion application from an earlier restraining order because the property will have vested in the Commonwealth and the Act makes no provision for reverse transfers in ownership or monetary compensation with respect to an order made under s 29 excluding property from restraining orders.

[75] Similarly, as was observed by the NSW Court of Appeal in Studman v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth), once a forfeiture order has been made and the relevant property vests in the Commonwealth, any appeal against the rejection of an application to exclude property (or an interest in that property) from the operation of the restraining order is futile.

[76] Once the judge in the present case heard and determined the forfeiture applications, there could never have been any occasion upon which he might subsequently hear and determine the s 31 exclusion applications. If the forfeiture applications were refused then that would have been the end (as it turned out to be) of the operation of the restraining orders. On the other hand, if the forfeiture applications were granted then that too would have been the end of the restraining orders. All that would have been left for the Court to do was to hear and determine the s 74 exclusion applications (being the applications to exclude the relevant property from the operation of the forfeiture orders). In effect, the judge, by adopting the sequence he did, never allowed for the possibility that he would deal with, and dispose of, the s 31 exclusion applications. It became inevitable that the s 31 exclusion applications would never be dealt with by the Court. In our view, this was contrary to the intended operation of the Act.

[77] The making, and maintaining, of exclusion applications under s 31 of the Act has important consequences as set out in s 49(3) of the Act. It would serve no purpose to require a party to make a s 31 exclusion application (and have that application remain on foot during the hearing of a forfeiture application) merely so as to require the Commissioner to establish one of the matters set out in s 49(1)(c) of the Act. If the submissions of Zhang and Shen were to be accepted then, in order to ensure that s 49(1)(c) applies (and one of the four matters therein is required to be proved by the Commissioner), all a respondent to a forfeiture application would need to do would be to issue and maintain an exclusion application, made under s 31 of the Act, that would never ultimately have to be heard or determined. Put another way, if general considerations of ‘fairness’ require the Commissioner to ‘go first’, as the judge concluded, once a forfeiture application has been made, then a ‘protective’ exclusion application could be made under s 31 of the Act. Such an application would never be heard or determined: its only purpose would be to disengage s 49(3) of the Act. An applicant for exclusion under s 31 would thereby obtain a substantial benefit from the application without ever having to discharge the onus associated with it.

[78] Nothing in the Act suggests that it was the intention of the Parliament that parties be permitted to make applications to a court that will never be heard or ruled upon. One would be very slow to embrace a construction of any Act of Parliament that required or permitted parties to make applications to courts, and thereby to consume valuable public resources in pursuing such applications, in circumstances where general notions of fairness or case management principles would ultimately require orders to be made that would have the effect of those applications never being heard and determined on their merits.

…

[81] Under the Act, Zhang and Shen were either required to pursue the s 31 exclusion applications before the forfeiture applications were determined, or to withdraw the s 31 exclusion applications. The Act does not allow for s 31 exclusion applications to be kept on foot, with the consequence that s 49(3) is deprived of any operation, without determination.

[84] Finally, on the question of sequence, it is necessary to consider the logic underlying the Act. As forfeiture orders are made under s 49 over restrained property, the first step for the court must be to identify the scope of the restraining order. Where a s 31 exclusion application has been made this requires the court to identify what property remains within the scope of the restraining order after the s 31 exclusion application has been heard and determined. It is that remaining scope which identifies the property to be forfeited. It follows that an exclusion application must be determined before the court considers whether the property should be forfeited pursuant to s 49(1)(c).” [Footnotes omitted]


	
	The Proceeds of Crime Act being Commonwealth legislation I am bound to follow the Court of Appeal’s interpretation and application of it unless convinced that their decision is plainly wrong: Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd (1993) 177 CLR 485 at 492; Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; (2007) 230 CLR 89 at [135]. Far from being convinced that the decision is plainly wrong, I respectfully agree with it. Following the court’s interpretation of the Proceeds of Crime Act I hold that it does not permit the Applicant’s s 31 exclusion application to be kept on foot for hearing and determination after the Commissioner’s forfeiture application: [81].
	
	
	The Applicants’ evidence in support of their exclusion application is closed. Apart from dismissing their application regarding the sequence of proceedings and providing for the costs thereof, the only other orders required are directions for filing and service of any evidence from the Commissioner with respect to the s 31 exclusion application and for evidence from the Applicants in reply. The proceedings must then be referred to the registrar to fix a date for hearing of the Applicants’ exclusion application.
	
	
	The Applicants’ solicitors were informed by letter of 28 July 2016 from the Commissioner’s solicitors of the Victorian Court of Appeal’s decision. It has been determinative of their application regarding the sequence of hearings. This letter was sent by email at 12:20pm that day, 2½ clear business days prior to the hearing which was listed before me on 2 August 2016. The Applicants should then have promptly abandoned their application regarding the sequence of hearings. By their own enquiries they could have ascertained earlier than 28 July that the decision of T Forrest J upon which they relied had been overturned.
	
	
	Even after I pointed out to the Applicants’ counsel in argument that I would be bound to follow the Victorian Court of Appeal and offered him an adjournment for part of the day to consider that court’s reasons (which he apparently had not yet done) the application with respect to the sequence of hearings was pressed. After I gave the Applicant’s counsel leave to deliver written submissions to my chambers as he was not prepared to argue the matter when it was called on 2 August 2016, the only submissions sent were those dated 29 June 2016 which had been entirely superseded by the overturning of T Forrest J’s decision. The submissions were sent unamended with no attempt to argue why the Victorian Court of Appeal’s reasoning should not be followed. In those circumstances the costs of the hearing of the application on 2 August should be paid on an indemnity basis.
	
	
	The orders of the Court are:
	



	
	The application by Weilei Cui and Sushan Li for deferral of the hearing of their notice of motion for an exclusion order until after the hearing and determination of the plaintiff’s claim under paragraph 10 of his summons for forfeiture is dismissed.
	
	
	Weilei Cui and Sushan Li are to pay the plaintiff’s costs of their application referred to in order 1, such costs to be on an indemnity basis for the hearing of 2 August 2016.
	
	
	The plaintiff is to file and serve any evidence in defence of the s 31 exclusion application of Weilei Cui and Sushan Li, by 5:00pm on 30 August 2016.
	
	
	Weilei Cui and Sushan Li are to file and serve any evidence in reply by 5:00 pm on 13 September 2016.
	
	
	The proceedings are stood over to the list of the Common Law Registrar on 14 September 2016 for the appointment of a date for the hearing of the exclusion application.

	On 16 May 2014 Whitford DCJ sentenced the applicant to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 9 years and 4 months, commencing 19 December 2013, with a non-parole period of 7 years expiring 18 December 2020 with the balance of term expiring on 18 April 2023.
	
	
	The applicant has appealed against his conviction on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1 – The verdicts of guilty cannot reasonably be supported on the evidence (i.e. are the verdicts are unsafe and unsatisfactory).

Ground 3 – His Honour erred in respect of his directions on Count 8 in that he directed the jury that recklessness satisfied the necessary intent.

Initially the applicant relied upon other grounds to appeal against his conviction, but these were abandoned before hearing.


	
	The applicant also seeks leave to appeal against his sentence on the following ground:
	


Ground 7 – His Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances.

As with the appeal against conviction, the applicant initially relied upon other grounds but these were abandoned either before hearing or at the hearing of the application.

Evidence at trial


	
	The complainant was 31 years of age at the time of trial. She is 160cms tall and she weighed approximately 60kgs at that time. She first met the applicant at the Oatley Hotel in Bexley on a Friday night between her 26th birthday (June 2008) and his 30th birthday (July 2008). The applicant and the complainant became friends on Facebook. Approximately a week after their first meeting, they went out together and had pizza at the Oatley Hotel. The complainant recalled having a glass of wine at the hotel. The next thing she recalled was waking up in the applicant’s bed at the workshop where he lived. She was naked and lying on her back. There was some light in the room coming from the television. The applicant was kneeling on the bed. He was next to her head and shoulders on her left hand side. He leaned over her and tried to put his penis into her mouth. His penis was 10-15cms away from her mouth. It touched her lip and then she passed out. In cross-examination she said that she did not remember if she said anything to him. She denied willingly removing her clothes at the factory. She did not participate in consensual fellatio. This was the evidence relating to Count 1.
	
	
	The complainant did not recall anything else about that night. The next thing that she recalled was going to work at Coles at Earlwood the following day. She recalled being in the car-park at Coles where she spoke to Brent Henry, a work colleague. She told him what had happened the night before, but she did not recall exactly what she said. On a couple of subsequent occasions, the complainant went to the applicant’s factory to watch movies. She did not stay there overnight, she stayed until 2 or 3am. She did not have anything to drink.
	
	
	The applicant and the complainant commenced sharing a house as housemates, occupying separate bedrooms, from about December 2009. In mid 2010 they moved to a property at Rossmore. From about December 2010 their relationship developed to a point that they were living as a couple in an intimate relationship. Towards the end of 2011 they moved from Rossmore to a property at Taren Point.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence of an incident that occurred in March or April 2011. She said that Carlos Benny, an employee of the applicant, was staying at their home and he and the applicant were building a boat together. The complainant recalled a night when they were sitting outside. Mr Benny and the applicant had been drinking alcohol since after lunch and they were both intoxicated. The applicant had a Rhodesian Ridgeback dog which was big and boisterous. The dog jumped on Mr Benny and he punched the dog in the crotch. The dog went away. The applicant was angry at him. A couple of hours later they were in the lounge-room when Mr Benny dropped a glass onto his foot. The glass broke and he cut his foot. The complainant bandaged his foot and Mr Benny then went to sleep in the spare room.
	
	
	The complainant was in the kitchen. The applicant was angry with her and accused her of flirting with Benny. He punched her with his right fist on the left side of her head and her eye. Five to ten minutes later, he punched a hole in the wall. The complainant could not recall what happened in between the two punches. The spare bedroom was 4 to 5 metres from the kitchen. The complainant did not scream when she was punched. She did not yell Benny’s name. When she looked at her face the next morning, she had a puffy eyelid and bruises on the left side of her face. She also sustained swelling and bruising to the left side of her head and bruising on her arms. Over the next few days, she experienced very bad headaches. Benny was still in the house and the complainant saw him, but did not speak to him. Benny did not ask the complainant what happened to her face. The complainant did not tell anyone about this incident.
	
	
	The complainant had given evidence about this incident in a previous trial which took place in May of 2013. She was cross-examined as to inconsistencies between the evidence she gave on that occasion and the evidence she gave in this trial. Specifically, in the earlier trial the complainant said that in the course of the assault by the applicant he dragged her into the garage and then slapped her in the face with his right hand so hard that she fell against shelving. She said that he dragged her back again and slapped her in the face on another two occasions. There were some other discrepancies of a relatively minor kind as to whether certain things happened outside the house or inside. The complainant explained the difference in her evidence because she was confused when she gave evidence on the previous occasion but she was not confused when she gave evidence in this trial. That was the evidence relating to Count 2.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence that on Friday 3 June 2011 it was her sister’s birthday. On that night she was at home with the applicant and his friend, Marty Greg. The applicant and Mr Greg had been working on a boat engine together. They were drinking during the day. The complainant said that she had drunk Wild Turkey and Coca-Cola, but was not intoxicated. She described the applicant as “more than tipsy” and that he was swaying a bit when he was walking. She denied that the applicant and Mr Greg were wrestling inside the house and refused to stop when she asked them. She denied that she threatened to call the police and that the wrestling was the reason why she did in fact call them.
	
	
	The complainant said that Mr Greg went to sleep in the spare room at around 3am. The spare room was four to five metres from the kitchen. She was in the kitchen cleaning up. A few minutes later, the applicant came into the kitchen and accused her of flirting with Greg. He began to throw glasses and bottles, smashing them on the kitchen floor. He grabbed the complainant by the shoulders and pushed her into a wall next to the fridge. He then dragged her by the hair into the garage and she later realised that some of her hair had been pulled out. The applicant slapped her on the left side of the face and she was projected into shelving in the garage. The applicant slapped her three more times and she passed out.
	
	
	The complainant said that when she regained consciousness she saw what she described as “blood everywhere”. The applicant had apparently cut himself on the broken glass on the kitchen floor. He dragged the complainant to the shower, pushed her into the shower clothed and turned the cold water on fully. She was under the cold shower for about three minutes. The complainant made a triple 0 call and said “I live at 106 Graham Road Rossmore. Please come, he’s trying to kill me”. She then took the cordless phone, went into the backyard and called triple 0 again, about a minute after the first call. She asked for the police and gave her name and address and hung up. She then took her car keys and got into the car. She drove about 40 metres and then realised that the petrol light was flashing, meaning that the car was almost out of petrol. She drove back to the house. The applicant came towards her and asked “why are the police calling your phone?”
	
	
	The complainant and the applicant went back inside the house and the police arrived approximately 5 – 10 minutes later. The applicant told the complainant to put on a jumper, which she did, as her clothes were wet. The applicant instructed the complainant to tell the police that nothing was wrong and they went out to speak to the police. The complainant said “I had a nightmare and I was sleep walking”. She did not tell the police the truth because she was terrified. She was afraid that “it would have been worse for me”. When they returned inside the house, the applicant asked the complainant why she had called the police, but she did not answer him.
	
	
	The attending police officers gave evidence at the trial. They had not made any notes of their attendance and their evidence was based on their recollection. They were of the opinion that the three persons they spoke to were affected by alcohol. They both said that the light was poor. They did not observe that the complainant’s clothes were wet. When they asked the complainant whether she needed help, she declined.
	
	
	[By way of interpolation, the complainant is a small woman. In contrast, the applicant is a large man with a height of between 185 – 190cms, weighing 100 – 105kgs. The tone of the complainant’s voice when making the second of the triple 0 calls is consistent with her being genuinely afraid.] This was the evidence concerning Count 3.
	
	
	The next morning the complainant went to the kitchen to clean up the mess before returning to the bedroom and lying next to the applicant on their bed. The applicant was kneeling on the bed and punched the complainant to the face and body with his left and right hands about ten times. While he punched her, the applicant said “Why did you call the police? What were you trying to do to me?” Later that day, the complainant noticed that she had bruising to her face around her eyes and also to her arms. Sometime later, when she returned to the bedroom, the applicant commenced hitting her again with both of his hands. He slapped and punched her face for about three minutes. He then stopped and began to cry. He said “I love you so much but you make me so angry. I can’t do this anymore”. The complainant did not leave the bed and she did not try to get away from the applicant.
	
	
	A few hours later, the complainant’s phone rang. She could see from the caller ID that it was her family ringing. She did not answer the phone. The complainant’s family came to the house and called out her name from outside. She saw them and she heard them shouting. She did not respond. The applicant said “don’t say anything”. After about ten minutes her family left the premises.
	
	
	The complainant was shown six photographs that were taken at the applicant’s birthday on 2 and 3 July 2011. She agreed that no injuries were visible in the photographs. She did not know if she had commenced working at the childcare centre when the photographs were taken. This was the evidence relating to Count 4.
	
	
	On Saturday night 16 July 2011 Dale and Mandy (surnames unknown) and Carlos Benny were visiting the house at Rossmore. They were all drinking alcohol and were intoxicated. The applicant, Dale and Benny were quite intoxicated and Mandy was “tipsy”. The complainant was less intoxicated than the applicant and was aware of what was going on. At about 6am the next day, Dale told the complainant that he and Mandy were going to leave. The complainant attempted to wake up the applicant but was unable to do so. Eventually when the applicant woke up he appeared angry. Once Dale and Mandy had left the house, the applicant pushed the complainant into the lounge and she ended up lying on it. She could not get up because the applicant was standing over her. He did not say anything to her but punched her in the left eye with his right fist. The complainant heard a popping sound and felt excruciating pain. She did not recall if she screamed. She felt her face swell around her left eye. The applicant grabbed the complainant by her shoulders and shook her. He then dragged her by her arms into the bathroom. She did not call out for Mr Benny, even when the applicant dragged her past his bedroom door to the bathroom. He held her by the ears and her hair and banged her head into the tiles in the bathroom three times. He punched her nose with his right fist and her nose began bleeding. He was standing just centimetres away from her and said “Stop your nose from bleeding, you’re making me angry”. The complainant then ran some cold water over her nose and her face. As she stood up, the applicant punched her in the left side of her mouth with his right fist. She sustained a cut to her lip, a swollen mouth and painful teeth. He then dragged her into the lounge-room. She tried to open the door to Mr Benny’s room but was pulled away. The applicant said “he can’t help you”.
	
	
	The applicant sent the complainant outside to look for cigarettes in the car. She wanted to drive away but the car would not start. She did not walk out onto the road, she did not call anyone from her mobile phone as she had no phone credit. She agreed that she could have called triple 0 from her mobile phone without credit but was too scared to do so. She could not call anyone from the home phone as it was disconnected.
	
	
	When the complainant returned to the house, the applicant said “You know not to leave me if anyone else is in the house. You know not to leave my sight … You can’t leave. You can’t leave your room while you look like this”. The complainant lay on the bed next to him, even though he had just assaulted her.
	
	
	When the complainant got up and looked at her face in the bathroom mirror, her eyes were swollen shut and her face was swollen. Her eye was full of blood and she was in a lot of pain. At about 5 or 6pm the applicant apologised to the complainant. The following day he came into her room. He was crying and said “I’m so sorry I can’t believe I did this to you. I’m going to get some help. I’m going to get some money and we’re going to go on a holiday”. He kept repeating “I’m so sorry I did this to you, I’m so sorry”. The complainant stayed in the room for about one and a half weeks until Benny left the house. During that time the applicant brought her food to eat. She did not tell anyone what had happened to her.
	
	
	At the time of this incident, the complainant worked as a carer at a childcare centre. She was unable to return to work for one and a half to two weeks. She attended a medical centre at Prestons on 26 July 2011 in order to obtain a medical certificate for being absent from work. Before she attended the doctor, the complainant Googled “bloody eye”. She also applied makeup to her face to cover her bruises. The applicant drove the complainant to the centre as she was “not allowed” to go there by herself. The complainant saw Dr Saakar at the medical centre. She told her that she blew her nose too hard and had a subconjunctival haemorrhage. Dr Saakar asked the complainant if she had been struck and she said “no”. She was afraid to tell the doctor the truth so she lied about her injuries. The applicant was waiting for her outside the medical centre and she was concerned that if she told anyone what happened he would kill her.
	
	
	The complainant worked at the childcare centre for about two and a half to three months. She was not sure of the dates when she started and finished her job there. She agreed that she had trouble with her sinuses while she was working at the centre. Some months later the complainant underwent x-rays and a CT scan. They showed that she had a fracture to the lower floor of her eye socket and that her sinus cavity was full of blood or liquid. She denied suffering any injuries as a child, teenager or young woman that involved an impact to her face. She did not suffer any fractures to her eyes or nose, other than those caused by the applicant. This was the evidence in relation to Count 5.
	
	
	In August 2011 the complainant went camping at Port Hacking with the applicant and his cousin, Yiannie Orfanos. She knew him because he lived a few houses away from them in Rossmore. He sometimes “dropped in” to see them after work and he often stayed for dinner. On this occasion they stayed in a tent at Port Hacking. The applicant drank alcohol during the day. During the evening he drank vodka and fruit juice. He became quite intoxicated. The complainant agreed in cross-examination that she had drunk a glass and a half of a vodka fruit juice mix which the others were drinking. The complainant was not sure how much Orfanos had to drink, but it was not a lot.
	
	
	When the applicant and the complainant were alone in their tent, he became angry and accused her of flirting with Orfanos. The applicant and the complainant were both standing up. The applicant pushed her backwards and she fell. She landed with her back on an Esky. The complainant was concerned that Orfanos would hear the noise so she said “It’s okay, I just tripped” but the applicant said “no, I pushed you”. She did not go outside to ask Orfanos for help. She did not leave the tent until the next morning. She did not discuss the incident with the applicant or Orfanos the next morning. She did not tell anyone about it when she got back home. She suffered “massive bruising” on her back, going from the top of the left shoulder blade down to her right hip. The bruises were there for a week. She said that she could not recall for how long the visible signs of this injury remained on her body.
	
	
	Orfanos was called by the Crown at the request of the defence. He said that he had spent much of his time down at the river fishing. He did not hear the applicant and the complainant having an argument, he did not observe that the complainant had suffered any injury. This was the evidence relating to Count 6.
	
	
	At some time in August 2011 while they were at Rossmore, the applicant became angry with the complainant after she ate a piece of pizza which was left over from their meal the previous night. It was night and the applicant was very intoxicated. He slapped the complainant on the face about 20 times with his left and right open hands. As he was hitting her, the applicant was saying repeatedly “Did you eat my pizza, did you eat my pizza?” The complainant responded each time that she had eaten the pizza. The applicant then hit the complainant’s head against the oven door a couple of times, after which he opened the oven door and slammed it with such force that the glass in the front of the oven shattered all over the kitchen floor. He then pushed the complainant onto the tiles and she landed on some of the broken glass from the oven door and banged her head on the floor. She had some glass lodged in her elbow and the applicant cut his foot. The complainant ran to the car with her keys, but the applicant took the keys from her and threw them into the grass. The injuries suffered by the complainant included bruising to the face, a lump on the back of her head and glass in her elbow. This was the evidence relating to Count 7.
	
	
	In October 2011 the complainant and the applicant were at home. The applicant had not been drinking. It was about 4am and he was working on the computer, setting up a Facebook page for his business. The complainant was sitting to his left and was falling asleep. She was playing music in the background. The applicant was not happy about that and said “What’s wrong with you, you’re ruining my life, I should chuck you away you bloody moll”. He said that all of her music was bad and started to snap her CD’s into pieces. He then grabbed her by the arm and threw her across the room into the breakfast bench. She ended up leaning on the bench with her buttocks and thighs against the bench. Her thigh was sore and was swollen. He put his hands around her throat and his thumbs behind her windpipe. He lifted her slightly off the ground and started to choke her. She subsequently had bruises around her neck. Her toes were still touching the floor when the applicant lifted her off the ground. She did not scream out in pain during the incident. She could not breathe. The applicant said “This time I’m going to make sure you can’t tell anybody”. She did not tell anyone about it. This was the evidence in relation to Count 8.
	
	
	The applicant let go of the complainant’s throat. He grabbed her hair and dragged her from the kitchen into the lounge-room. She was standing on the left side of the fish tank when he slapped both sides of her face with his right hand. She was projected to the other side of the room and fell to the ground. The applicant said “Get up”. He pulled her by her hair, then grabbed her by the hair and ears before banging her head into the wall three times. He then banged her head three times into the adjacent wall, leaving holes in the wall. The complainant was scared that the applicant was going to kill her and she wet her pants. This was the evidence concerning Count 9.
	
	
	The complainant told the applicant that she needed to go to the toilet. She ran to the toilet and one minute later, the applicant followed her there. He asked “What do you have on you? What are you hiding? Do you have your phone on you?” He felt her body. The applicant dragged the complainant by her hair into the room where she stored her clothes. He said ”This isn’t a room of a girl, look at this shit everywhere. You’re a piece of shit”. The applicant rammed the complainant’s head into the bedroom wall three times. He pushed her across the room into the wall. The complainant passed out in the bedroom.
	
	
	The complainant next recalled waking up on the lounge. She was naked, lying on her side in a foetal crouching position. She felt “excruciating pain” and realised that the applicant’s penis was in her anus. The pain continued for two or three minutes. She screamed in pain. The applicant was not restraining her, but she did not try to move away. She was in shock. She yelled “Stop, stop, please just stop” but he kept going. After a couple of minutes, he ejaculated and withdrew his penis. He rolled over and went to sleep on the lounge. This was the evidence relating to count 10.
	
	
	The following morning, the complainant saw the injuries to her head, face and neck. She did not examine her anus for injuries but was unable to defecate for three days. The applicant told her “You’ll be all right, just put some makeup on” and he sent her to the shops to buy him cigarettes. The complainant left the house to get cigarettes. She did not drive to the police station while she was out because she was scared. She did not tell anyone about what had happened. The complainant did not recall showering before she left the house.
	
	
	As a result of this incident, the complainant sustained bruises to her neck and the side of her head. She also had hand-marks around her neck. A few days later, she went to the childcare centre where she had previously worked. One of her colleagues, Sharlene, said “What happened to you? Who did this to you?”. The complainant replied “He hit me”. The complainant then drove back to Rossmore. She did not go to her parents’ house, nor to the police to seek help. She did not tell Sharlene about the sexual assault. She did not remember if she ever told Sharlene that she was clumsy and bumped into things. That was not the truth. She may have said it to explain how she came to be bruised.
	
	
	On or about 15 November 2011 the complainant and the applicant moved to Production Avenue, Taren Point. Before they moved to the new address, the complainant patched up the holes in the wall of the Rossmore address, where her head had gone through the wall and where the applicant had punched the walls. They painted the patched walls so they matched. The oven also had to be replaced because it could not be fixed.
	
	
	On Sunday 26 November 2011 there was a party at the Taren Point home for one of the applicant’s friends who was setting up a new business. The applicant’s parents were there, as well as a friend of the applicant called Chris. The applicant was “quite drunk”. The complainant only had one drink. At about 2.30am Chris went to move his car. He was intoxicated and scratched the side of the applicant’s boat with his car. The side panel of his car was damaged. The applicant told Chris not to worry about it and the guests left the party.
	
	
	At around 2.30 – 3am, about 20 minutes after all the guests had left their house, the applicant and the complainant went upstairs. The applicant lay down on the air mattress and the complainant sat on the floor. The applicant said “Get away from me, you f…. bitch” and he pushed her away. He then pulled her close and punched her left temple with his right fist. The punch did not leave a bruise but it hurt her. The applicant said “I’m sorry, I’m sorry” so the complainant remained next to him and did not leave the room. He hugged and kissed her and said “Take off your top”. The complainant removed her top and her bra. He then said “I didn’t tell you to do that, put your bra back on”, so the complainant put it back on. The applicant said “That’s a disgusting bra” and ripped it off her. He then ripped off her pants. The applicant grabbed the complainant’s head and pushed it towards his flaccid penis. His penis was near her mouth. In cross-examination she said that her lips touched his penis for a couple of seconds. He then pushed her head away and vomited on the floor. The complainant brought him a bottle of water and he drank some water. He vomited again and then went to sleep. This was the evidence relating to Count 11.
	
	
	The following morning the complainant went downstairs. She cleaned up, walked the dog and made breakfast. The applicant came down the stairs and appeared to be in a good mood. He asked her “What’s wrong with you?” and she replied “I wanted to stay away from you after what happened last night”. The applicant became angry. He asked “Why are you bringing up shit from last night?” The complainant went upstairs and the applicant followed her. She told him that she wanted to leave the relationship. He said “If you want to leave, then leave”. The complainant said “I’ll just go grab my bag”. The applicant grabbed her shoulders and slammed her against the wall. She sustained hand marks on the top of her arms. They looked like “brown spots”. He then grabbed her ears and her hair and rammed her head into the wall. The applicant asked “Why do you have to make me angry. You know I like it quiet in the morning”.
	
	
	There was a knock at the front door. The applicant grabbed the complainant’s cheeks. He told her not to cry and to “act normal”. The applicant’s friend Chris was downstairs at the front door. He had brought coffee for the applicant. The complainant remained upstairs and the applicant went down to open the door. About 10 minutes later, the complainant went downstairs. Her face was red from crying but it was not bruised. She did not recall for how long Chris remained in the house. Later that day the applicant apologised and again said “You know I like it quiet in the morning”. This was the evidence relating to Count 12.
	
	
	Despina and Marika were siblings of the complainant. She recalled attending a christening for Despina’s son in 2011. She also recalled attending a birthday celebration for “Yaya”, the applicant’s grandmother, at their home in Taren Point. She was not sure whether that birthday party was held on 27 November. She attended a birthday party for Marika in October or November 2011. She did not recall if she had any visible injuries at Marika’s birthday, at the christening or at Yaya’s party.
	
	
	Some text messages sent by the complainant on 5 December 2011 and 8 December 2011 to the applicant were placed before the court. These were expressed in affectionate terms, e.g. on 8 December at 11pm the complainant sent a message saying “Babe I just got home. Good night sweet dreams. I hope you have a good sleep. Muah, muah” (“muah” is meant to be the sound of a kiss).
	
	
	On 8 December 2011 the complainant, the applicant, Mr Benny and Chris were at Taren Point. The men were celebrating so the complainant was “allowed” to stay over at her parents’ house. She slept at her parents’ house and at 6am the following day she received a text message from the applicant. He said “Morning see you soon”. She called the applicant and he asked why she was awake. The complainant told him that her mother was getting ready for work. He sent her a message that said “The front door is unlocked, lock it on your way in, see you soon”.
	
	
	The complainant dressed in her clothes from the previous day (as she had no other clothes at her parents’ house) and drove to Taren Point. She entered and went upstairs. Mr Benny was sleeping on the lounge. The applicant was awake and lying on the bed upstairs. The complainant gave the applicant his car keys. He asked “Aren’t they the clothes that you had on yesterday?” and she said “Yes”. The applicant said “You dirty bitch”. The complainant said she would go and have a shower. She started down the stairs to have a shower. The applicant followed her, grabbed her right shoulder and turned her around. He put two fingers from his left hand inside her underpants and into her vagina. He lifted her slightly. His fingers were inside her vagina for about five seconds. He did not say anything to her and she did not say anything to him. When he took his hand out she said “it hurts”. The applicant smelt his fingers and said “Go and have a shower you dirty bitch” and shoved her down the stairs. This is the evidence relating to Count 13.
	
	
	On 11 December 2011 the complainant and the applicant went to the St George Motor Boat Club for dinner. Afterwards they returned to their home at Taren Point. The complainant had arranged for her father to pick her up from her house at 9pm. She was to stay at her parents’ house. At 9pm her father and sister arrived. Within 5 minutes of them leaving, the applicant started to call the complainant and send her text messages. She did not respond. The applicant then rang the complainant’s father and sister. The complainant spoke to the applicant on her sister’s phone. He said he was going to come over.
	
	
	Within a few minutes of the complainant arriving at her parents’ house, the applicant arrived. The complainant and her family were outside. The applicant said “This is going to turn to shit real fast isn’t it?” The complainant replied “No … it’s not”. The applicant said to the complainant’s father “I’m going to take [the complainant] for a coffee and her father said “No you’re not, she’s not going anywhere, she’s staying here”. When asked the complainant said “No, I don’t want to, I don’t want to go with you, I don’t want to be with you anymore after everything that you’ve done to me. I can’t be with you”. The applicant suggested that the complainant just needed to have a rest but she said “no”. He asked “Is this really what you want?” and the complainant said “yes”. The applicant said that he was confused and hugged and kissed the complainant goodbye. He asked “Is anybody going to come knocking at my door?” to which the complainant responded “No, no”. The applicant left the premises.
	
	
	After the applicant left, the complainant spoke to members of her family. She told her parents, her sisters Rosanna and Karina, and Karina’s boyfriend Steven that the applicant had hit her. She did not tell them that he had sexually abused her because she was too embarrassed. A day or two later, she told her sister Tina about the sexual assaults. The complainant attended Hurstville Police Station on 12 December 2011 where she made a signed police statement. She did not tell the police about the sexual assaults at this time as she was too embarrassed. She provided additional statements to the police on 20 December 2011 and 10 January 2012 providing details of the sexual assaults.
	
	
	After the complainant made her second statement, the police suggested that she call the applicant on the telephone and attempt to have discussions with him. The police obtained a warrant to permit them to listen to the conversations. On 8 February 2012 the complainant called the applicant twice and the calls were recorded as part of the police investigation. No admissions were made by the applicant who had already consulted his solicitors. He terminated both the conversations.
	
	
	The Crown called evidence from work colleagues of the complainant.
	
	
	Brent Henry worked with the complainant at Coles Earlwood in 2008. One day during a coffee break in 2008 the complainant told him that she had woken up to find the applicant pulling his penis out of her mouth and that this incident had occurred at the applicant’s factory in Peakhurst. He only saw the complainant socially three or four times after she started a relationship with the applicant.
	
	
	Sharlene Mourshed was the director of the childcare centre in 2011. She said that the complainant had worked at the centre from 4 July 2011 until the end of September 2011 as a trainee childcare assistant. Ms Mourshed noticed bruises on the complainant’s arms while she was working at the centre. The complainant told her that she was bruised from bumping into things because she was clumsy. The complainant was absent from work from 18 July 2011 and returned on 26 July. She told Ms Mourshed that she was absent because she had a sinus infection. When the complainant returned to work she had a bloodshot eye that was “all red” and “a bit puffy”.
	
	
	On or about 27 September 2011 the complainant resigned. She told Ms Mourshed that she was forced to resign – “I’m quitting because he wants me to”. About two weeks later the complainant returned to the childcare centre to complete some forms and Ms Mourshed noticed that her ear was bruised and that she had three lines on her ear that were bleeding. The complainant also had bruising to the side of her face. Ms Mourshed asked the complainant what happened and the complainant said “He hit me”. Ms Mourshed asked “With what?” but the complainant said she did not know because she had passed out. Ms Mourshed said that generally the complainant’s demeanour while she worked at the centre was “nervous and scared”.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Ms Mourshed said that initially the complainant did not provide the centre with a medical certificate for the week when she was away. She just told Ms Mourshed that she had a sinus infection. Later she produced a doctor’s certificate. The certificate stated that the complainant was able to return to work but did not explain why she had been absent.
	
	
	Rachel Fouques worked at the childcare centre with the complainant. She said that there were occasions when she noticed that the complainant had bruises on her arms and also occasions when the complainant showed her bruises on her arms. Ms Fouques recalled an occasion in mid 2011 when the complainant asked her to look at her arms. Ms Fouques saw a bruise and when she asked the complainant about it, she said “I bumped myself. I’m a bit clumsy”. On another occasion, about a month after the complainant commenced work at the childcare centre, Ms Fouques saw redness in one of her eyes and a bruise on her cheek. The complainant told her that she had been sick and had popped a blood vessel.
	
	
	The Crown adduced evidence from two medical witnesses.
	
	
	Dr Nahida Saakar was a general practitioner. She examined the complainant on 26 July 2011 at the Prestons Medical Centre. She concluded that the complainant had a subconjunctival haemorrhage. The complainant did not mention an injury or visual disturbance to the doctor. She did not say that she had been assaulted. The complainant gave a history consistent with having the flu. She asked for a clearance certificate as she was feeling better after taking antibiotics. Dr Saakar observed redness to the eye. Dr Saakar said that a subconjunctival haemorrhage could result from the flu and could happen spontaneously. If trauma to the eye caused the haemorrhage, she would have expected to see other symptoms with it.
	
	
	Dr Peijin Tew was a radiologist. On 13 December 2011 she reported on x-rays taken of the complainant’s facial and nasal bones. These x-rays included a CT scan. Dr Tew concluded that the complainant suffered the following injuries:
	


Fractures to the eye sockets with some nerve damage.

Blood inflammation or some other abnormality present in the eye sockets.

Additional fractures to the right sinus.

The opening of the sinuses was blocked.

Fractures to the nose. The broken nose was consistent with a single punch, or with multiple punches.

Abnormal thickening of the sinus mucosa suggestive of some inflammatory process.

There were no abnormalities to the brain, jawbone or ears.


	
	Dr Tew was asked about the age of the various injuries. She said that the left eye and nose and eye sockets were injured more than two weeks before the scans as she did not see soft tissue swelling. The injuries could have been inflicted in July. The nose injury was consistent with one or more blows. The eye socket injuries were consistent with blunt force trauma, like a punch or punches. The injuries were more than two weeks old but the doctor was not able to put an outer limit on how old they might have been. Dr Tew said that a punch to the eye could result in a subconjunctival haemorrhage.
	
	
	In cross-examination Dr Tew agreed that the blocking of the sinus could have been from an infection or sinusitis. If someone were prone to suffering sinusitis, that could explain the blocking. Dr Tew agreed that a person could fracture a nose through a fall. Dr Tew agreed that if somebody were punched on the left side of their nose, it could cause an injury to the eye socket and both sides of the nose. Dr Tew said that a significant form of trauma was required to break a bone.
	
	
	The Crown called evidence from members of the complainant’s family.
	
	
	Antonia Comitogianni is the complainant’s sister. She did not see the complainant often once the complainant and the applicant were in a relationship. She said that on the few occasions that she saw the complainant, she did not seem to be herself and looked really run down. She looked thin and white in the face. She said that the complainant, instead of being her normal bubbly self, was very quiet.
	
	
	In March 2011 there was a twenty first birthday celebration for the complainant’s cousin, Laura. The complainant attended but the applicant did not. When Ms Comitogianni asked why he was not there, the complainant said that when he drank he became angry so he was not coming. Just before midnight the complainant asked Ms Comitogianni for a lift to her father’s house where she had left her car. The complainant appeared panicky. She explained that the applicant said that she had to be home before midnight or he would get really angry.
	
	
	Ms Comitogianni said that on a Friday or Saturday in June 2011 the family met at their parents’ house to celebrate the complainant’s birthday. The plan was to celebrate with dinner but the complainant and the applicant did not arrive until after dinner. They stayed for cake and then left. Ms Comitogianni noticed that the complainant was wearing very heavy makeup and that it was darker around her eyes. The makeup was much darker than the complainant’s natural skin colour and she did not normally wear makeup. It looked like fake tan. Ms Comitogianni thought that the complainant had bruising on her face, above and below her right eye. When Ms Comitogianni asked the complainant about why she was wearing the makeup, the complainant explained that the light in the bathroom was broken when she applied her makeup. Three photographs of the complainant taken that night became Exhibit F.
	
	
	On or about 5 December 2011 the complainant came to Ms Comitogianni’s home in Blakehurst. She told her about an incident that had occurred at Taren Point approximately two weeks earlier. This was the incident when the applicant’s friend Chris had driven his car into a boat when the applicant’s parents were present. The complainant told Ms Comitogianni that this had made the applicant very angry. He was also angry because he thought that the complainant was in the car with Chris. The complainant told Ms Comitogianni that the applicant had hosed her down with a hose at about 3am after Chris had left. The complainant told her that when they went upstairs, the applicant had ripped her pants off and said “Come over you dirty slut” and when she went over to him he hit her in the face in the left eye. The complainant told her that the applicant had attempted to make her give him oral sex but he was too drunk and became sick. The complainant said the next morning the applicant had acted like nothing had happened.
	
	
	The complainant told Ms Comitogianni about an incident which had occurred two days before she moved back with her parents. The complainant told Ms Comitogianni that the applicant had put his hands down her underwear and inserted his fingers into her vagina, then pulled them out and smelled his hands and said “You’re a liar” or “a dirty liar” or something like that. Then he said “You’re a dirty bitch. Go and have a shower”. When she had had a shower, he came upstairs and said to her “You don’t look like a girl” or “the clothes that you are wearing, you don’t look like a girl, go and fix yourself up”.
	
	
	The complainant also told Ms Comitogianni of an incident which had occurred at Rossmore at about 4am. The complainant told her that she was watching movies on a laptop in the kitchen and that she was very tired but she had to stay awake until the applicant went to bed. The complainant told her that the applicant had said that she was boring and had choked her and pulled her by her hair into the lounge-room. The complainant told her that he had slapped her face three times and that she had fallen down. He had pulled her back up again and bashed her head into the wall three times and then went to another wall and had bashed her head into the wall again where she had fallen down again and that she had urinated and defecated. The applicant had then dragged her into her bedroom and said that this is not a girl’s room, this is a pigsty. He then pulled her by her hair into the lounge-room and that at that stage she passed out and was unconscious. Ms Comitogianni said “What happened when you became conscious again?” and the complainant said that she was lying down, face down, with her body on the side and that she was in extreme pain and that he was having sex with her “down there”. Ms Comitogianni said “Where? … in your vagina?” and she said “No, the other place”. Ms Comitogianni said “In your anus?” and she said “Yes”. Ms Comitogianni said “Oh my God, what did you do?” and then the complainant said she was screaming and thinking he would not stop and Ms Comitogianni said “Did he stop?” and the complainant said “No, he just kept going ‘til he was finished”.
	
	
	Ms Comitogianni said that there was an occasion when she offered to make pizza for the complainant, but the complainant said that she would never eat pizza again. She told Ms Comitogianni that two months previously, she had eaten some leftover pizza from the fridge and the applicant had asked her if she ate the pizza and she had said that she did. He then slapped her face and asked the question again. He had continued slapping her on both sides of her face and asking if she had eaten the pizza. He did it about 20 times. The complainant did not know when he stopped because she passed out. Ms Comitogianni assumed that the incident had occurred at Rossmore. The complainant told Ms Comitogianni that once at Rossmore the applicant had hit her in the eye and she was in extreme pain and that the eye had blood in it and that she had attended a medical centre. The complainant said that the doctor at the centre asked if somebody had hit her but she had told the doctor that she fell over. The complainant said that the applicant was sitting right outside the door.
	
	
	Silvestro is the complainant’s father. In 2010 he became aware that the complainant and the applicant were in a relationship and that at some point they moved in together. Before the relationship began, he used to see the complainant nearly every day. That decreased significantly after she entered into the relationship with the applicant. Thereafter he used to see her approximately once a month or less.
	
	
	On Friday 3 June 2011 there was a dinner for the birthday for another of his daughters, Tina. The complainant telephoned and said that she could not attend. In the early hours of the following morning, the police attended the family home. The police asked Silvestro if the complainant lived at the house as a call had been made from a mobile phone registered to that address. He telephoned his daughter and then spoke to the applicant. He said “You’re supposed to be looking after my daughter” to which the applicant responded that he had had an accident and cut himself and that the complainant “went off”. Silvestro asked “Is that how you look after your girlfriend?” and the applicant replied “That’s all I f’ing seem to do”. The applicant was angry. The police left the house while he was talking to the applicant on the phone.
	
	
	The following afternoon Silvestro, his wife and his youngest daughter went to the complainant’s house at Rossmore. He drove up the driveway and parked near the house. Outside the house he saw a Toyota Corolla that the complainant had been using. The windows were down and it was wet inside. The applicant’s utility vehicle was parked outside the house and it was locked. He called the complainant on her mobile phone but no-one answered. They walked around the house and tried to look into the windows. Everything was shut. They assumed no-one was at home. They stayed there for about 45 minutes.
	
	
	On Sunday 5 June 2011 the complainant called him. She apologised and said that she went out with friends. The applicant told him that they were out on a boat with friends and that was why they could not be contacted the previous day.
	
	
	Silvestro visited the complainant at Rossmore in October 2011. He told the applicant that he wanted her to move back home with him. The applicant said that he needed the complainant to help him move to Taren Point. This would be in about a month and after that the complainant could move back to her parents’ house. In November 2011 the applicant and the complainant went to Silvestro’s house and they discussed the complainant moving home again. At that time he thought the complainant looked pale, unwell and sickly.
	
	
	On 11 December 2011 Silvestro telephoned the complainant and said “today is the day”. At about 6pm the complainant called him and asked him to pick her up which he did. He then picked up his daughter Rosanna from the airport. While they were in the car, the complainant told him that the applicant had been bashing her. They drove to their home at Bexley. The applicant arrived about 15 minutes later. The applicant was outside the brick fence of the house, standing on the footpath. He said that he wanted to speak to the complainant. Silvestro and his family members were inside the fence. The complainant was standing three or four metres away from him and the applicant was speaking mainly to her. The applicant asked her “Is the shit going to hit the fan and is someone going to knock on my door?” He did not know if the complainant responded or if there was any further conversation. Silvestro said that the complainant had not previously sustained fractures to her face, eyes or nose.
	
	
	Detective Senior Constable Jones was the officer in charge of the investigation. He contacted Mr Benny and explained that he was investigating serious assaults against the complainant. Mr Benny said that he was not aware of anything like that and he said that he was not in contact with either the complainant or the applicant. He was asleep in bed on the night when police arrived at the Rossmore house. He refused to make a statement. Mr Greg was located and he refused to make a statement.
	
	
	Detective Jones was unable to locate Dale and Mandy whose surnames were unknown.
	
	
	The first call made by the complainant to triple 0 was answered by a Telstra operator. This call was not recorded. The second call to triple 0 went directly to the police. The police then returned the call. The two phone calls in which the police were involved were recorded. The recording of the calls was played to the jury and became Exhibit G.
	
	
	Detective Jones arrested the applicant on 8 February 2012 and cautioned him. The applicant exercised his right to silence.
	
	
	Gabriele Kennedy was a real estate agent. She inspected the Rossmore property after the complainant and the applicant had moved out. She noted that the oven was damaged and that there was no glass frontage.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence. His case was that he had never physically or sexually abused the complainant. The following is a summary of his evidence.
	
	
	After having met the complainant on an earlier occasion, a few days later he and she went on a date to the Oatley pub. They had pizza and a few glasses of wine. Afterwards they went back to the applicant’s warehouse. They were “fooling around” and performed consensual oral sex on each other. The complainant did not fall asleep when they were having oral sex. He denied that the complainant had woken up to find his penis near her mouth. He stated that he and the complainant were both consenting.
	
	
	He moved his factory from Peakhurst to Sylvania and at some point the complainant moved in with him. They used to eat dinner together and often went out together. Friends and family visited them at Sylvania. In 2010 he and the complainant moved to Rossmore. They lived on a five acre block. He used the sheds for his work as a marine mechanic and boat builder. From the house it was about a 15 minute round trip to the closest shop. The complainant liked to help him work on his boats and he bought her a mask to wear. He had a Rhodesian Ridgeback which was a large dog.
	
	
	In March/April 2011 Carlos Benny worked as a subcontractor for him. He had been living with the applicant and the complainant at their house in Rossmore from about February 2011. He stayed in the spare bedroom. The applicant recalled an incident when Mr Benny was playing with the dog and the dog jumped on him. Mr Benny dropped his glass and it cut his foot. Mr Benny then punched the dog. The applicant said, “Don’t punch the dog”. They had all been drinking. He was tipsy. He denied that Mr Benny cut his foot a couple of hours after the incident with the dog. He denied accusing the complainant of flirting with Mr Benny. He denied punching the complainant or punching the wall. He did not see any bruising or swelling on the complainant’s body that evening or the next day.
	
	
	He did not recall what happened the next day. He thought that he and Mr Benny continued working on a boat. He denied that he was angry when Mr Benny punched the dog and denied that he was angry with the complainant. He went to sleep on the lounge after Mr Benny went to bed. He thought that the complainant went to sleep in her room. He used to sleep in the lounge often as that was where his CPAP machine was set up.
	
	
	He recalled an occasion on 3 – 4 June 2011 when Marty Greg was at the house. They were working on a new engine for his speedboat. He drank beers and bourbon and was intoxicated. Mr Greg stayed over that night as he was too intoxicated to drive home. The complainant had a “fair few drinks” and was “fairly intoxicated”. He denied that he accused the complainant of flirting with Mr Greg. He did not break glasses and bottles in the kitchen. He was not violent towards the complainant. He did not put her in the shower, or say “now I’m going to get him” [i.e. Mr Greg].
	
	
	He said that he and Mr Greg were wrestling in the lounge and the complainant was concerned and said “Stop, or I’m going to call the police”. They stopped but then started again. The wrestling lasted 10 – 15 minutes. They ended up in the spare room. Mr Greg had the applicant in a head lock and he bit Mr Greg on the back.
	
	
	The police telephoned and spoke to him but he did not know that it was the police calling. He hung up the phone because he could not hear properly. There was music in the house all night. He listened to the recording in court. He agreed that he could not hear any music during the call. He said he was standing 10 – 15 metres away from the stereo when he spoke to the police on the phone.
	
	
	He recalled that at one point Mr Greg came inside and said that the police were looking for the complainant. He did not tell the complainant to put on a jumper and he did not instruct her to tell the police nothing was wrong. All three of them went out the front. They told the police that they were drinking because it was Saturday night. The police officers left the premises. He went back inside the house and asked the complainant why she called the police. She said “You were wrestling and it looked serious and I was asking you to stop, and you didn’t stop”. He was not angry with the complainant for calling the police.
	
	
	The next morning he helped Mr Greg to hook up his boat. He did not tell the complainant to stay inside. He did not see any injuries to the complainant’s face. He did not hear Mr Greg ask the complainant what happened to her face. He did not tell the complainant that he loved her but that she made him “so angry”. He did not recall her family coming to the premises the next day. He did not instruct the complainant not to say anything.
	
	
	He did not recall if the complainant tidied up the kitchen that morning. He denied that the complainant wore makeup to a party at her parents’ house in June in order to cover up the injuries to her face. He denied that there were bruises under her eyes. He said that she had black bags under her eyes and wore makeup to cover the bags. He never caused any bruising to her.
	
	
	In cross-examination he agreed said that there were holes in the lounge-room walls but these were from when he and Mr Greg were wrestling. He patched up the holes before they moved out of the Rossmore premises.
	
	
	There was an occasion when he, the complainant, Dale, Mandy and Mr Benny were at their house. They were drinking and dancing until about 4.30 or 5am. He, the complainant, Dale and Mandy went into the spa. They were all naked in the spa and drinking. The next morning he woke up at lunchtime. He denied that he was angry when he was woken and he denied sending the complainant inside when he was outside speaking to Dale and Mandy. He denied assaulting the complainant once Dale and Mandy were gone. He denied pushing the complainant into the lounge, punching her left eye or punching her nose. He denied that she was relegated to her bed and denied taking food into her room.
	
	
	He thought that Mr Benny initially went to sleep on the lounge and then later moved into a room. He denied assaulting the complainant and causing her nose to bleed. He did not drag her past the room where Mr Benny was asleep and say “He won’t help you”. He did not send the complainant to the car to get his cigarettes. Mr Benny stayed with them for a total of three weeks. He was still there for a couple of weeks after this night. He denied apologising to the complainant and saying that they would go on a holiday together.
	
	
	He first noticed that the complainant had a red eye on a Sunday or Monday. There was no puffiness or bruising around the eye. In late July 2011 he drove the complainant to a medical centre. She had a red eye and needed a certificate in order to return to work. He parked the car in the car-park and waited there while the complainant saw the doctor. He did not know why he drove her to the medical centre. The complainant told him that she did not want to scare the little children at school with her red eye.
	
	
	He recalled a camping trip to Port Hacking when his cousin, Yiannie Orfanos, was there. They were all a bit tipsy. He drank beers and vodka and the complainant drank vodka. Yiannie drank bourbon but he did not have much to drink. He denied accusing the complainant of flirting with his cousin. He denied pushing her backwards into the esky.
	
	
	He denied that there was an incident in August 2011 when the complainant ate some of his pizza. He did not break any glasses and he did not hit the complainant’s face. He did not see any bruising on her face. The oven door shattered when he accidentally let go of it and the door sprung back up. The handle of the oven door was piping hot so he let go of it. The following day he made inquiries with the oven company in relation to replacing the door. He was told that he needed to get a new oven. He denied that he pushed the complainant onto the toilet floor. He did not cut his foot and the complainant did not get glass in her elbow. He denied dragging the complainant outside next to the garbage bins and throwing her keys into the grass.
	
	
	He recalled an occasion in October 2011 when he was sitting at the computer and updating his Facebook page at night. The complainant was watching a movie at the time. He denied that he insisted on the complainant staying up with him until he went to bed. He denied that he was angry with her that night because she was falling asleep. He denied breaking her CDs and pushing her into the kitchen bench. He denied trying to choke her. He did not ram her into a wall, slap her or insult her. He denied having anal sex with her. The following morning he did not tell her to put on some makeup and go and buy him cigarettes.
	
	
	They moved into premises at Taren Point on 5 or 6 November 2011. There was a factory downstairs and he resided on the mezzanine level. On 26 November 2011 there were a number of people there for a demonstration during the day. That evening some of them remained for a barbeque, including his parents and his friends, John and Chris. He had a few drinks. Chris accidentally reversed a car into his boat. He was not angry with Chris and there was no damage to the boat. At the end of the barbeque Chris left and the applicant’s parents were the last to leave. He did not recall at what time they left.
	
	
	He and the complainant tidied up and went upstairs to sleep. He denied that that he was angry with the complainant that night. He denied punching the complainant and asking her to take off her top. He did not rip her clothes. He did not push her head towards his penis in an attempt to have oral sex. He did not vomit. He denied arguing with the complainant the following morning and he denied pushing her against a wall. When Chris arrived with coffees, he denied telling the complainant “don’t cry, act normal”.
	
	
	On 8 December 2011 the complainant slept at her parents’ house. Chris and Mr Benny were at the Taren Point house with him. On 9 December he exchanged text messages with the complainant. He recalled that she arrived at their home while he was asleep. Mr Benny was also there sleeping on the lounge. He was not angry with her. He denied having a conversation with the complainant when she came home. He did not call her a “dirty bitch” or tell her to have a shower. He did not put his fingers inside her vagina. He got up at about 10am and the complainant was downstairs at the time.
	
	
	He gave evidence of a conversation which took place between him and the complainant outside the complainant’s parents’ house on 11 December. He reported the conversation as follows:
	


He said “What’s going on?” The complainant said “My parents think it’s best that we have a break”. He said “Oh are you okay, want to go for a coffee or something?” and then her father said “No, she doesn’t want to go for a coffee”. He said “All right, fair enough”. Then he grabbed his washing and put it in the car. They went and moved outside and that is when he said “Are you okay? Anything you want to talk about?” She said “No, I just need a break, you know, after moving I’m tired”. He said “Okay”, gave her a kiss and a cuddle and left.


	
	He denied asking the complainant if everything was going “to turn to shit” and if he should expect a knock on the door. After he drove away from the house, he sent a text message to the complainant asking what was going on and saying that he was confused. She did not reply to that message.
	
	
	He identified a number of photographs taken at his birthday celebration on 2 July 2011, a photograph taken on 15 August 2011 and a photograph taken in September 2011. It was common ground that those photographs did not show any injuries suffered by the complainant. He agreed that he had not produced any photographs of the complainant taken in March or April 2011 but denied that this was because photographs taken at that time would have shown her with bruising.
	
	
	He said that he used to organise a Performance Outboard Club for his fellow performance boat enthusiasts. In March and April 2011 the complainant accompanied him on an outing at Port Hacking. On 22 May they attended an outing on the Georges River and on a third occasion they went to Akuna Bay. In 2009 when they lived at Sylvania he and the complainant were involved in a boating accident. The complainant hit her face on the dashboard. She told the applicant that it hurt. Pictures of the damaged boat were tendered as Exhibit 4. After the crash her face was red under her eyes and her cheek. She did not attend the doctor. She said that she did not need to see the doctor. In cross-examination he denied that he “came up” with the story about the boat crash in between the first and the second trials.
	


CONVICTION APPEAL

Ground 1 – The verdicts of guilty cannot reasonably be supported on the evidence (i.e. are the verdicts are unsafe and unsatisfactory).


	
	In written submissions (prepared by counsel other than counsel who appeared on the appeal), little assistance was provided to the Court as to the basis for this ground of appeal. Assertions were made in general terms without specific reference to the evidence.
	
	
	The following matters were asserted:
	


The Crown case was a word on word case with there being little independent corroborating evidence for the complainant. The applicant had denied all allegations. There was late complaint. The complainant had lied to Dr Saakar. Logically there was no reason why the verdicts would be different for all or any of the counts.


	
	The written submissions asserted that significant inroads had been made into the complainant’s credibility which were identified as follows:
	


There was no explanation for why the complainant did not scream, call out or otherwise seek assistance from persons who were close by such as Carlos Benny and Marty Greg.

The evidence of the complainant concerning the triple 0 calls was inherently unlikely and was in conflict with the observations made by the police officers, who observed that she was clothed and did not observe any wetness.

That the complainant remained in her bedroom for a week after one of the assaults was inherently unlikely and no corroborating evidence was called.

It was inherently unlikely that the applicant would have sent the complainant to the shops the morning following the forced anal intercourse.

The only explanation the complainant gave for not leaving the applicant or seeking assistance was fear or that he would cry and apologise.

It was inherently unlikely that the applicant would drive the complainant to the medical centre if he had caused the injury.

To the extent that there was evidence of complaint, it was long after the events complained of.

The complainant did not initially say anything to the police about the sexual assaults.


	
	On the appeal different counsel appeared, and whilst adopting the written submissions, focused on what was said to be an inconsistency in the verdicts of the jury. The submission was that the not guilty verdicts in respect of Counts 1, 2, 6 and 11, when taken with the guilty verdicts in respect of the other nine counts, amounted to “an affront to logic and common sense which is unacceptable and strongly suggests a compromise of the performance of the jury’s duty”. Counsel submitted that the difference in verdicts gave rise to a factual and logical inconsistency given that the complainant was clearly rejected as a witness of truth in relation to the counts on which the applicant was acquitted. There was no rational basis for that outcome and there was no way to reconcile the verdicts. As a result counsel submitted that the verdicts were an affront to logic and common sense and should be set aside in their entirety.
	
	
	Counsel sought to rely upon the observations of Simpson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Latham J agreed) in TK v R [2009] NSWCCA 151; 74 NSWLR 299 where her Honour said:
	


“97   Central to the decision in Jones was the circumstance that the accused person, facing multiple charges, was convicted of only two of them, and acquitted of one; and that no rational explanation could be found, on examination of the evidence, for that diversity. Inherent in the judgments is the proposition that the jury must be found to have experienced a doubt about the credibility of the complainant in respect of that count on which they acquitted. It was not a case in which, with respect to any count, the evidence, standing alone, was insufficient to warrant satisfaction, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused was guilty of the offence. What was important was the mere fact that, in respect of the first and third counts, the jury expressed themselves to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt; but, on the second, they expressed themselves to be not so satisfied. The High Court could find no rational explanation in the evidence for that diversity, and, accordingly, took the view that, since the jury must be taken to have experienced a doubt in respect of one count, that doubt must, rationally, also have attended the others. They applied that doubt to those counts on which the accused was convicted.” (The reference to Jones is a reference to Jones v The Queen [1997] HCA 12; 191 CLR 439.)

Consideration


	
	It should be noted that in his summing up, the trial judge comprehensively set out the submissions of both counsel and in particular, identified the matters in the complainant’s evidence which required consideration by the jury. The resolution of these issues was quintessentially a matter for the jury who had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses which this Court did not. In relation to the issues relied upon in the applicant’s written submissions, these were issues of fact in relation to which the primacy of the position of the jury in resolving disputes questions of fact has been acknowledged in many cases (see particularly Mackenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; 190 CLR 348).
	
	
	The following extracts from his Honour’s summing up make it clear that the very issues identified by the applicant were put fairly and squarely to the jury for their decision.
	


“In any case like this one where the Crown relies substantially on one person to prove a case against another, it is important that the jury are told that they exercise caution before they convict the accused. Unless you are satisfied that the complainant is an honest, reliable and accurate witness in the account she has given, you cannot find the accused guilty. Therefore you need to examine the evidence of the complainant very carefully in order to satisfy yourselves that you could safely act upon the evidence to the high standard required in a criminal trial.

In considering her evidence you should of course look to see if other evidence supports it. This caution that I am asking you to take is not based upon any personal view I have of the complainant. In any criminal trial where the Crown relies wholly or substantially upon the evidence of a single witness, a jury must always approach that evidence with particular care because of the onus and standard of proof placed upon the Crown. I am not suggesting to you that you are not entitled to convict the accused upon the evidence of the complainant - and in fact you are entitled to convict the accused upon the evidence of the complainant - but the direction I am giving you is that you can only do so after you have carefully examined the evidence and satisfied yourselves that it is accurate and reliable beyond reasonable doubt.

It flows from all of this that if you have doubts about one or more aspects of the complainant’s evidence on one count, those doubts ought to be considered when assessing her overall credibility and whether the Crown case has been proved on each of the other counts. It is entirely a matter for your judgment but you might think that there was nothing to distinguish the evidence of the complainant on one count from her evidence on another count. For example, if you have a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s credibility in relation to one count it might make it difficult to see how the evidence of the complainant could be accepted in relation to other counts. But as I have said, it is entirely a matter for your judgment and for you to decide whether that is so or not. I have already directed you that you are not to compromise. It would be wrong if say half of you accepted her evidence beyond reasonable doubt and half did not, to average it out and convict the accused on some counts and find him not guilty in relation to others. (SU 24.2 – 25.4)

…

In considering the complainant’s evidence and whether it does satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt, you will need to carefully consider any matter which affects its reliability. One matter which may positively affect the reliability of the account given by her is the question of whether or not and when she complained about the accused’s conduct towards her. There are two ways in which evidence about complaint and timing of complaint might bear upon your consideration of the complainant’s evidence. Firstly, as going to her credibility or, secondly, as evidence supporting the fact that the violence and sexual acts which she alleges did occur. Evidence that a person complained very soon after something happened to them may show that the complainant has acted in a way in which you might expect someone who has been assaulted to act. In that way, it might make the evidence of the complainant more believable.

In the present case, the Crown contends that the complainant complained to Mr Henry in the sense of relating some of the details of the first count to him the very day after that first incident. In respect of the other incidents, the complainant did not complain or report any of the specific incidents which occurred in the period from March through to December 2011 until she first related them to her family, in particular her sister in December, and then when she made her statements to the police in December 2011 and January 2012, and there is also the more general evidence the Crown relies upon of complaint about being hit which she made to one of the childcare workers, and you have heard evidence about that.

The Crown case, and you have heard the complainant’s evidence about this, is that the failure to complain immediately was brought about by fear on her part. The complainant says she was frightened that if she revealed what she says had been going on, her safety would be threatened. By contrast, the defence says that the fact that no complaints were made or calls for help, et cetera, made at around the time of the incidents tends to undermine the complainant’s account. It is a matter for you entirely to assess and weigh those various matters.

The Crown also relies on the evidence of the complainant that when she first complained to the police she made a statement about the various violent acts, but made no complaint then and not until January about the various sexual acts, and that the reason for that was embarrassment in relation to those additional matters on her part. If you think that the complainant has done what you would expect someone in her position to do, that may support the Crown case because you may find that there is consistency between her conduct and the allegations she makes against the accused. Of course, the fact that a person says something on more than one occasion does not mean that what is said is necessarily true or accurate. A false or inaccurate account or statement does not become more reliable just because it is repeated on one or more occasions.

On the other hand, if the complainant has not acted in the way you would have expected someone to act after being assaulted in the way she has described, then that may indicate that an allegation is false. But bear in mind when considering this issue that there may be good reasons why a complainant did not raise the allegation immediately following the alleged assault and that a failure to do so does not mean that the allegation must be false.

The absence of a complaint or a delay in making a complaint is a matter that you may take into account in assessing the credibility of the complainant’s evidence as to what she says the accused did to her. However, the delay in making a complaint about an alleged assault does not necessarily indicate that the allegation is false. As I have said, there may be good reasons why a victim of an assault, whether it be a sexual assault or some other violent act, may hesitate in making or refrain from making a complaint or telling anyone about it at the time.

In considering whether and to what extent any delay by the complainant in coming forward affects her credibility, you should take into account the whole of the circumstances, including what she said about it. Remember, ladies and gentlemen, the question is not what you would have done in the circumstances. You should consider the complainant’s explanation in the light of her particular circumstances as you find them to have been on the evidence. It is a matter for you to consider whether the failure to complain at the time of a particular incident or the delay in complaining does or does not affect the reliability and the credibility of the account. What I have just outlined relates to one way in which the evidence of complaint, or absence or delay in complaint might be used. That is in relation to credibility and whether the making [of] a complaint or the delay in making one makes the evidence more or less believable.

The second way in which evidence of complaint might be used is that you can use the evidence of what was said in the complaint as some evidence that such an assault did occur. That is, you can use it as some evidence independent of the evidence given to you of that incident by the complainant in the courtroom. The law says that because of the circumstances in which the complaint was made, a jury is entitled to use what was said in that complaint as evidence of the truth of what the complainant alleged against the accused. A jury is entitled to find that the complaint was made at a time and in a manner that would indicate that the allegation was reliable, that is, that the allegation is less likely to have been fabricated and more likely to be accurate.

It is entirely a matter for you whether you draw that conclusion in this particular case and so treat the complaints made, in particular to the complainant’s sister, and to the police in December 2011 and January 2012 as evidence of the various alleged assaults by the accused, in addition to the evidence that has been given about them by the complainant in this courtroom. If you do use the evidence of complaint as some evidence of the assaults the subject of the various charges, then what weight you give to it is a matter for you. Of course, once again the fact that a person says something on more than one occasion does not mean that what is said is necessarily true or accurate. A false or inaccurate statement does not become reliable just because it is repeated more than once.

Also in considering the complainant’s evidence and whether it does satisfy you of the accused’s guilt you should of course look to see if it is supported by other evidence. It is the Crown case that the complainant’s evidence is supported by other evidence that has been put before you, and you were taken through the evidence in the Crown address. I will not repeat it but, broadly speaking, to support the complainant’s account the Crown relies upon the evidence of her father, of her sister, of Mr Henry, of the other childcare workers, and the evidence of the doctors. And of course there is the triple-0 call and the photographs, and the Crown submits there are numerous details of the complainant’s account which are accepted by the accused.” (SU 31.1 – 34.9)


	
	Contrary to the written submissions of the applicant, there was a substantial quantity of corroborative evidence for the complainant. The most significant is that of her fellow workers (who were quite independent) and the doctors, in particular Dr Tew. So far as the applicant’s position is concerned, the evidence of the facial fractures was damning. The jury on that issue were perfectly entitled to disregard the applicant’s evidence (unsupported as it was) of the complainant having been involved in a boating accident some years before.
	
	
	In summary, while there were some discrepancies in the complainant’s evidence, these were matters for the jury to take into account and there was ample evidence, if the jury accepted it, to establish the Crown case beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	This leaves the question of whether the verdicts were in fact inconsistent.
	
	
	When considering the use which can be given to what the High Court said in Jones v The Queen, it is useful to look at how that case has been subsequently interpreted and applied. In TK v R McClellan CJ at CL said:
	


“4    To my mind the decision of the majority in Jones is of confined application. The majority were of the view that having regard to the facts of that case and informed by the fact that the jury did not accept that the complainant’s evidence on count 2 was sufficient to convict the appellant of that count, it was not open to the jury, relying on the complainant’s evidence, to convict on count 1. However, as Spigelman CJ emphasised in Markuleski the decision in Jones is largely dependent upon the factual analysis of the majority. This was also the approach to Jones adopted by Winneke P in R v KT (Supreme Court of Victoria, Court of Appeal, 8 October 1998, unreported). Spigelman CJ emphasised that difficult questions arise when all that appears to differentiate between verdicts of guilty and not guilty on individual counts is whether the jury was satisfied that the complainant’s evidence would support a finding beyond reasonable doubt (see [98] of Markuleski).

5    In Markuleski Wood CJ at CL indicated that with the benefit of the analysis by Spigelman CJ the view that his Honour expressed in R v Kaboni [2000] NSWCCA 387 had changed. His Honour, correctly in my view, accepted that Jones was not authority for a presumption that where the only direct evidence of the offences was that of the complainant and where the jury had convicted on only some of multiple counts, the guilty verdict should be regarded as unreasonable.

6   It seems to me that there are problems in an appellate court concluding that because a jury does not convict on one or more counts any conclusion as to the general creditworthiness of a complainant can be drawn. As the judgments in Markuleski point out there may be many reasons why a jury does not convict on a particular count. The High Court has been careful to emphasise that an appellate court must allow for the advantage of the jury when considering questions arising under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. The most significant advantage is assumed to be that of observing the witness as they give their evidence. It is a very significant step to conclude that the reason for the jury’s decision to acquit on any count is that they were so unable to accept the complainant’s evidence on that count that her evidence was not capable of founding a conviction on another count. The consequence of such a decision by an appellate court is that the jury has not been faithful to the fundamental directions from the trial judge, namely that the Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt on each count. As the law presumes that the jury has been faithful to a trial judge’s directions (HML v R [2008] HCA 16; (2008) 245 ALR 204 per Kirby J at [52]; Gilbert v R (2000) 201 CLR 414 at 420 per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J), the starting point for any analysis must assume that this is so. The burden of satisfying the appellate court that there has been a miscarriage of justice rests upon the appellant.”


	
	The quote from Simpson J in TK relied upon by the applicant was no more than her Honour summarising the effect of Jones v The Queen. Her Honour was not seeking to adopt what was there said but it was part of her review of the decided cases. In the same case, as part of that review, her Honour said of Markuleski v R:
	


“105    Spigelman CJ began by extracting the passages from M to which I have already referred – including that paragraph in which the majority said:

“ … the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.”

106    His Honour then referred to and quoted from Mackenzie, citing the test as:

“ … one of logic and reasonableness.”

He said that, in Jones, there was nothing illogical about the divergent verdicts, and that Jones:

“ … represents a particular application of this test of ‘reasonableness’.”

107    He then said:

“[10]   It is against this background, that the test for an unreasonable verdict – whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty – must be applied to the whole of the facts and circumstances of a particular case.” (The references to Markuleski and M are references to Markuleski v R [2001] NSWCCA 290; 52 NSWLR 82 and M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487).


	
	Later in TK v R, as part of her analysis of the law, Simpson J said:
	


“127   What is implicit in that paragraph of MFA is that, where unreasonableness of a verdict of guilty is asserted by reason of a mix of verdicts, the inquiry is wider than that stated in M. In M no question of inconsistency arose, and, in cases of that sort, the inquiry is as to the adequacy of “the whole of the evidence” to support the verdict. In cases of the Jones variety, a further dimension is added – the “circumstances” of the particular case. That goes beyond “the whole of the evidence” and includes an examination of the significance of the acquittals, and what can be read into those verdicts.

128   That is not, on my reading, an adoption (for inconsistent verdict cases) of the most commonly quoted M test. The foundation for the test stated in MFA is not confined to “the whole of the evidence” but incorporates “all of the facts and circumstances of the particular case”. That is wide enough to include matters outside the evidence, such as the impact on the reasonableness of the verdict of guilty of what may be discerned to be the explanations for the acquittals. In determining whether convictions are unreasonable, in these circumstances, the focus of the inquiry is upon any explanation, not for the convictions, but for the acquittals. If such an explanation can be found, without resort to doubts about the complainant’s credibility, the verdicts of guilty may not be unreasonable, at least not on that basis. The inquiry may also permit examination of circumstances that give “insight” (Mackenzie), to the extent that is permissible, into the jury’s thinking. …” (The reference to MFA is a reference to MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606.)


	
	When focusing upon the evidence relating to those counts on which the applicant was acquitted, there was a logical and reasonable basis for the jury entering such verdicts. This did not involve the jury necessarily rejecting the complainant as a witness of truth. In any event, as a matter of law and as juries are always told, it was open to them to accept some evidence of a witness and to reject other evidence.
	
	
	There are clear points of distinction between the evidence relating to Count 1 and that relating to other counts. Count 1 was the oldest count. The offence was said to have occurred in 2008. The complainant’s evidence, unlike that in relation to most of the other counts, particularly those on which the applicant was convicted, was relatively brief. There were considerable gaps in her recollection which left a number of matters unexplained. There were also discrepancies between her evidence at trial and that which she told Mr Henry, e.g. Mr Henry’s evidence was that her first recollection was of the applicant removing his penis from her mouth, whereas her evidence at trial was that at most the penis came in contact with her lip.
	
	
	It should also be noted that the trial judge gave detailed directions as to the ingredients required for each offence to be made out. In relation to Counts 1 and 11, the allegation was of an attempt at sexual intercourse without consent. The evidence in relation to each of those counts did not amount to evidence of actual attempted penetration. In Count 1 the evidence was that the penis touched the complainant’s bottom lip.
	
	
	The actual evidence was:
	


“Q. Now when you say that and when you say he was trying to put his penis into your mouth, can you tell us exactly what it was that was happening in terms of any movement with his penis relative to you?

A. John was about - his penis was about 10-15 centimetres away from my face and it was coming closer. His penis had touched my lip and then I had passed out again.” (30.1.2014 – T.2.44)

“Q. So his body’s moving towards your mouth and his penis is moving towards your mouth, yes?

A. Yes.

Q. Where are his hands, well hand or hands?

A. I don’t remember.

Q. You didn’t notice his hands?

A. No.

Q. You said in your evidence that his penis touched your lip, which lip did it touch?

A. My bottom lip.

Q. And about where on your lip did it touch?

A. This side at the bottom.

Q. Was he saying anything at that time?

A. I don’t remember.

Q. What did you say?

A. I don’t remember.

Q. You didn’t say what, what are you doing, stop?

A. I don’t remember.

Q. What did you do?

A. I passed out.” (31.1.2014 – T.106.7)


	
	For sexual intercourse to take place, there needs to be penetration of the lips (R v Preval (1984) 3 NSWLR 647). Here there was no actual evidence of sexual intercourse and the question of whether there was “an attempt” was a matter very much for the jury. Given the extremely vague nature of the complainant’s evidence, it was well open to the jury not to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that an attempt at sexual intercourse had taken place. The jury could have had that doubt based on the vagueness of the evidence rather than any disbelief or non-acceptance of what the complainant had said.
	
	
	In Count 11 the evidence was that the penis was flaccid and there was no contact with the complainant’s mouth. In Count 11, the applicant’s conduct could be appropriately characterised as no more than drunken groping with no specific intent before he became sick and fell asleep. It is also important in relation to Counts 1 and 11 that there was no evidence of the applicant trying to engage in sexual intercourse at a time when the complainant had clearly indicated her unwillingness.
	
	
	The jury were reminded on a number of occasions, both in the summing up and in counsel’s address, that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt with respect to each ingredient of the offences. A reasonable and logical explanation for the acquittal in the case of Counts 1 and 11 is that the jury were not satisfied that the ingredients of each offence had been made out.
	
	
	There is also a logical and reasonable explanation for the acquittal in relation to Count 2. When giving evidence in relation to Count 2 in the earlier trial, the complainant appears to have become confused as to the facts surrounding that incident and the incident which formed the basis for Count 3. In the earlier trial the complainant had given evidence about being dragged into the garage and thrown against a wall.
	
	
	Her evidence as to Count 2 in this trial made no mention of the garage or being thrown against a wall. They were factual matters associated with Count 3. The complainant explained the discrepancy under cross-examination when she said that she was confused at the time of the first trial but was not confused in her evidence in this trial. It was a reasonable and logical approach on the part of the jury in this trial to have some doubts about the accuracy (as distinct from the honesty) of that evidence and not to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to what occurred in relation to Count 2.
	
	
	Count 6 is probably the most minor of the assaults alleged against the applicant. In the course of an argument with the complainant, he was accused of pushing her so that she fell onto an esky which was in a tent. As a result of that fall, she experienced bruising on her back. It was open to the jury not to be satisfied that the applicant intended to do more than simply push the complainant, as distinct from deliberately intending to push her in such a way as to cause her to fall against the esky and onto the ground. Moreover, in directing the jury about the meaning of actual bodily harm. His Honour said that it “includes any hurt or injury which interferes with the health or comfort of the victim”. It may well be that by comparison with the more serious harm caused in other assaults the jury had a doubt that the bruising had that effect.
	
	
	By comparison with the violence of the other assaults perpetrated against the complainant, and the significant injuries which were thereby caused, it was open to the jury in relation to this count not to be satisfied as to the fact of an assault and that it caused actual bodily harm. This would not necessarily involve a non-acceptance by the jury of the complainant’s evidence. There is a real difference between the facts of this event and the other assaults charged which all involved punching and acts of extreme violence in relation to which there could be no doubt either as to intent nor as to the resulting harm.
	
	
	In relation to these four counts in which verdicts of acquittal were entered, the observation of the plurality (Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ) in Mackenzie v The Queen at 367 is apposite:
	


“4   Nevertheless, the respect for the function which the law assigns to juries (and the general satisfaction with their performance) have led courts to express repeatedly, in the context both of criminal and civil trials, reluctance to accept a submission that verdicts are inconsistent in the relevant sense. Thus, if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted. If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury. In a criminal appeal, the view may be taken that the jury simply followed the judge's instruction to consider separately the case presented by the prosecution in respect of each count and to apply to each count the requirement that all of the ingredients must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Alternatively, the appellate court may conclude that the jury took a ""merciful"" view of the facts upon one count: a function which has always been open to, and often exercised by, juries. The early history of New South Wales was affected by English juries which, in the face of clear evidence, declined to find the value of goods stolen sufficient to attract the punishment of death, thereby affording to the offender the alternative punishment of transportation. Australian decisions have acknowledged that the role of the jury continues to be ameliorative in this respect. In R v Kirkman, in the Supreme Court of South Australia, King CJ (with the concurrence of Olsson and O'Loughlin JJ) observed:

""[J]uries cannot always be expected to act in accordance with strictly logical considerations and in accordance with the strict principles of the law which are explained to them, and courts, I think, must be very cautious about setting aside verdicts which are adequately supported by the evidence simply because a judge might find it difficult to reconcile them with the verdicts which had been reached by the jury with respect to other charges. Sometimes juries apply in favour of an accused what might be described as their innate sense of fairness and justice in place of the strict principles of law. Sometimes it appears to a jury that although a number of counts have been alleged against an accused person, and have been technically proved, justice is sufficiently met by convicting him of less than the full number. This may not be logically justifiable in the eyes of a judge, but I think it would be idle to close our eyes to the fact that it is part and parcel of the system of administration of justice by juries. Appellate courts therefore should not be too ready to jump to the conclusion that because a verdict of guilty cannot be reconciled as a matter of strict logic with a verdict of not guilty with respect to another count, the jury acted unreasonably in arriving at the verdict of guilty.""

We agree with these practical and sensible remarks.”


	
	I would grant leave for the applicant to rely upon this ground of appeal but would dismiss it.
	


Ground 3 – His Honour erred in respect of his directions on Count 8 in that he directed the jury that recklessness satisfied the necessary intent.


	
	The basis for this ground of appeal emerges from the following part of the trial judge’s summing up:
	


“The final of the offences that is charged on the indictment is an offence of attempt to choke with the intention to intimidate. That is count 8. There are two elements of that offence, which the Crown must satisfy you about beyond reasonable doubt. The first is that the accused intended to intimidate the complainant and the second is that he attempted to choke her. As you have before you on that sheet that I have given you, as a matter of law, intimidation looks at the conduct of the accused and its likely effect on the complainant rather than examining the actual effect on the complainant. It includes conduct that might cause a person to fear for his or her safety or that might cause a person to have a reasonable apprehension of injury to themselves. Again, intention looks at the state of mind of the accused when he commits the intimidating conduct. A person intends to cause fear of harm if he knows that the conduct is likely to cause fear in the other person.

In terms of that knowledge there are two ways in which the Crown might establish knowledge. They can do so by either satisfying you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused actually knew that his conduct was likely to cause the complainant to be afraid. Or alternatively, it can establish knowledge by proving that the accused was reckless about the impact of his conduct on the complainant in the sense that he realised that it was reasonably possible that his conduct may cause the complainant to be afraid but he carried on regardless, not caring one way or the other.

In this case the conduct upon which the prosecution relies is the combination of the actions of the accused in putting his hands around the complainant’s throat as she was lying across the kitchen bench and the words, which the complainant says the accused uttered at that time, which were to the effect that, “This time I’m going to make sure you won’t be able to tell anyone.” The Crown submits that the words used by the accused demonstrate the requisite intention on his part. And if you accept beyond reasonable doubt that those words, either by themselves or accompanied by his actions, demonstrate that the accused intended to intimidate the complainant, the Crown’s case is that the first element will be satisfied. As to the second element, the Crown relies on the accused’s actions. If you accept the complainant’s account beyond reasonable doubt you will not have any difficulty concluding that the accused attempted to choke the complainant. Again, the accused has said to you - and the defence case is - that this incident never happened.” (SU 21.5 – 22.8)


	
	The applicant submitted that s 37 of the Crimes Act 1900 was in the following form when the offence occurred:
	


“37   Attempts to choke etc (garrotting)

Whosoever:

By any means attempts to choke, suffocate or strangle any person or by any means calculated to choke, suffocate or strangle attempts to render any person insensible, unconscious or incapable of resistance with intent in any such case to enable himself or herself or another person to commit or with intent in any such case to assist any person in committing an indictable offence shall be liable to imprisonment for 25 years.”


	
	At the time of trial s 37 had been amended to include liability if the offender “is reckless as to rendering the other person unconscious, insensible or incapable of resistance”.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that s 37 as it stood at the time of the offence did not make any allowance for recklessness and that his Honour erroneously introduced recklessness as an element of the offence thereby misleading the jury and giving rise to an error of law. The applicant submitted that the conviction on Count 8 should be quashed.
	


Consideration


	
	It is correct that recklessness formed no part of s 37 as it was at the time when the events said to give rise to Count 8 occurred. It is equally correct, that on the facts which were before the jury no issue of “recklessness” could possibly arise. If, as they clearly did, the jury accepted the factual background, i.e. that the applicant said the words attributed to him and that he was choking the complainant to such an extent as to cause bruising to her throat at the time that he said those words, no question of recklessness arises. An offence of specific intent has been made out. There is no room for any other interpretation. This was not a case of a person being convicted of an offence unknown to the law at the time the actions giving rise to the offence occurred. The evidence given by the complainant falls fairly and squarely within the terms of s 37, as it then was and the jury so found.
	
	
	In raising the issue of recklessness and explaining it to the jury, his Honour was in error for the reason submitted by the applicant. However, the error did not produce a miscarriage of justice. This was because the factual basis for Count 8 could not give rise to a finding of recklessness. His Honour’s reference to recklessness was simply irrelevant. It is also important to have regard to the way in which the trial was run. The applicant’s defence was that these acts did not happen.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out. Accordingly, although I would grant leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appeal.
	


SENTENCE APPEAL


	
	Before the hearing of the appeal, Ground 6 was abandoned and during the hearing, Ground 5 was also abandoned. This left a single ground seeking leave to appeal against sentence.
	


Ground 7 – His Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances.


	
	The aggregate sentence imposed by his Honour was a head sentence of 9 years and 4 months, commencing 19 December 2013 with a non-parole period of 7 years expiring 18 December 2020. The indicative sentences for each of the offences were as follows:
	


Count 3 (common assault) – 12 months.

Count 4 (assault occasioning actual bodily harm) – 12 months.

Count 5 (recklessly causing grievous bodily harm) – 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months.

Count 7 (assault occasioning actual bodily harm) – 6 months.

Count 8 (attempt to choke with intent to intimidate) – 8 years.

Count 9 (assault occasioning actual bodily harm) – 12 months.

Count 10 (sexual intercourse without consent) – 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.

Count 12 (common assault) – 3 months.

Count 13 (sexual intercourse without consent) – 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months.


	
	His Honour dealt with special circumstances as follows:
	


“It was submitted that I would find special circumstances in this case. As I understood it, four matters were advanced in that regard. First, that this is the offender’s first experience of full time custody; second, that there should be allowed a period of supervision in order to deal with issues relating to the abuse of alcohol; third, the offender has been placed against his wishes in protective custody; finally, that the offender has a condition known as sleep apnoea, for which he had been receiving some treatment in the community. In my view none of those matters, either alone or in combination, justifies a finding of special circumstances. I do not understand that the first time in custody has ever, in and of itself, been an adequate ground for a finding of special circumstances. There is no evidence which justifies any conclusion on my part that the offender has a problem with alcohol that needs to be addressed. Certainly the consumption of alcohol was a feature of some of the offences but not all of them. There is no evidence either that some treatment in respect of alcohol is indicated in the case of the offender, or that the offender wishes to undergo any such treatment. Even if there had been evidence of that nature there does not seem to me to be any basis in this case for a conclusion that the issue could not be adequately or appropriately addressed without the finding of special circumstances. In the context of a sentence that must necessarily be imposed in the case of this offending, there will be adequate time for appropriate supervision in the context of the statutory ratio.

While the offender has been placed for the time being in protective custody, there is no evidence that supports the proposition that by reason of that status the conditions of custody will be any more harsh such as to justify a finding of special circumstances. Finally, there is no evidence that indicates that any ongoing treatment is required for sleep apnoea, nor any to suggest that, to the extent any future treatment is required, the condition is not as capable of adequate treatment whilst in custody as it is in the community.” (Sentence judgment T14.2 – 15.3)


	
	The written submissions in relation to this ground went no further than to assert:
	


“It is submitted that the first time in custody plus the extent of alcohol’s contribution to the offences and that the accused suffered from an alcohol problem plus the protection issues there should have been such a finding.”


	
	In oral submissions it was submitted that this was a case where the excessive consumption of alcohol was associated with most of the offences and certainly the most serious offences, so that his Honour should have found that treatment was required by the applicant.
	


Consideration


	
	In R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 a five judge bench (Spigelman CJ, Mason P, Grove and Sully JJ and Newman AJ) considered “special circumstances” as set out in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999 (NSW) and the extent to which it operated as a fetter or constraint on the exercise of the sentencing discretion. It was there accepted that “special circumstances” could not be confined to cases in which a longer period of supervision was required although many cases in which “special circumstances” were found, would be of that kind. The Court restated the proposition that, although it might be open to a sentencing judge in the exercise of his or her discretion to have regard to certain facts in combination as “special circumstances”, a sentencing judge was not bound to do so. The existence of factors which may amount to special circumstances did not alter the discretionary nature of the judgment for which the statute provided. The Court also restated that the ultimate constraint was that the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence (at [63]).
	
	
	Here the sentencing judge set out in detail his reasons for not finding “special circumstances”. In line with what was said in R v Simpson, it was open to his Honour had he so determined, to find special circumstances based on some or all of the four propositions put to him. He was not, however, obliged to do so. No error in his Honour’s approach has been identified. I would refuse leave to rely upon this ground of appeal.
	


Conclusion


	
	The orders which I propose are as follows:
	



	
	In relation to the conviction appeal, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	In relation to the application for leave to appeal against sentence, leave should be refused.
	



	
	ROTHMAN J: The test for an unreasonable verdict is as described by Hoeben CJ at CL, whose reasons in draft I have had the advantage of reading. I have read the evidence and formed the same view as his Honour. I also do not accept that the verdicts of acquittal are inconsistent with the guilty verdicts. Nor do the acquittals raise any reasonable doubt in my mind about the convictions. Any further comment would be repetitious.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL and with his Honour’s reasons.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I have read in draft the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL.  My own assessment of the evidence leads me to agree with the reasons of his Honour for the rejection of Ground 1 of the appeal against conviction.  I also agree with his Honour’s reasons with regard to the other grounds.  I agree with the orders proposed.

2701179,R v Wells [2016] NSWDC 169,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	In May this year I presided over a jury trial in which the accused, Ian Jeffrey Wells was charged with 2 offences. The first was an offence of dangerous driving occasioning the death of Mrs Katina Mihailidis and the second was an offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm to Mr Peter Mihailidis. The accused was acquitted on both counts.
	
	
	With the consent of Mr Wells, and pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act, I am now dealing with 2 back-up charges, an offence of negligent driving occasioning the death of Mrs Mihailidis and an offence of making a U turn without giving way to a vehicle.
	
	
	There is no back up charge relating to the grievous bodily harm suffered by Mr Mihailidis. That circumstance apparently arises from inappropriate advice given to those who laid the charges.
	
	
	The evidence which I will consider in determining the guilt or otherwise of Mr Wells on these 2 back up charges consists of the evidence given in the trial, both oral and documentary, supplemented by the tender in these proceedings of some further documents to which reference had been made in the earlier trial. There was also a statement of agreed facts tendered which has substantially reduced the issues for me to resolve.
	


Facts


	
	What follows is a non-controversial outline of the events which have led to the present proceedings.
	
	
	The accused was a volunteer rural fire-fighter with the Kariong Brigade of the Rural Fire Service (“the RFS”). One evening while at his home he was paged and, together with other RFS members, attended an incident at the Mount White weighbridge station on what was then called the F3 Freeway. Concentrated orange juice had been spilt. The accused travelled to the scene of the spillage in a RFS vehicle designated Kariong 1. That vehicle was a category 1 fire tanker which carried a substantial quantity of water. It was thus heavy, about 13 tonnes, and slow to accelerate.
	
	
	Before completion of the task concerning the orange juice spill the accused and another of the RFS personnel at the weighbridge, Paul Barwick were asked to attend a motor vehicle accident closer to Sydney, but also on the F3 Freeway. The accused and Mr Barwick arrived at that incident and performed various duties.
	
	
	At around 10.21pm the accused and Mr Barwick were asked to drive Kariong 1 back to the weighbridge station where the incident regarding the spillage of the concentrated orange juice was ongoing. The evidence does not disclose precisely what their duties on their return to the weighbridge would be. To get back to the weighbridge station the accused, who was driving Kariong 1, needed to turn the tanker around so that it could head north, back to the weighbridge station at Mount White. He thus drove along the F3 southbound until he reached U-turn bay 10. He decided that he would perform a U-turn through that gap in the median divide. There was a sign at the U-Turn bay which said “no U-turn” but a supplementary sign positioned underneath said “Police, RTA, NRMA and emergency vehicles excepted”. 
	
	
	There was no other traffic heading south, so the accused was able to begin his U-turn by moving to the left of the south bound carriageway before turning the steering wheel to the right. He activated the red and blue flashing lights on the top of the tanker and applied full right lock to the steering wheel. He was in second gear.
	
	
	There was some north bound traffic which had gone past the U-turn bay, but a Toyota Corolla driven by Mr Peter Mihailidis, with his wife Katina Mihailidis in the passenger seat, had not. It was approaching the U-turn bay from the south (and thus heading north). It was visible to the accused and would have taken about 11 seconds to pass him. It was initially in lane 3 and it was Mr Wells’ intention to also turn into lane 3, the lane nearest the centre of the roadway.
	
	
	When the Corolla driven by Mr Mihailidis was about 350 metres south of the U-Turn bay he flashed the car’s high beam headlights. At about the same time the Corolla moved from lane 3 to lane 2, the centre of the northbound lanes. Both Mr Barwick and the accused noticed this and interpreted this as an indication from the driver of the approaching vehicle that he or she was aware of the presence of the RFS vehicle and, in effect, indicating to the driver of that vehicle that he could complete his U-turn – and that he, the driver of the approaching vehicle, would give way.
	
	
	As I mentioned before the RFS tanker was heavy and slow to accelerate. It had remained in second gear as it went through the U-Turn bay at walking pace. As the accused told police in his interview with them conducted early the following morning, it was easier for him to keep the momentum going rather than stop and go back into first gear. As the tanker moved into lane 3 of the northbound carriageway the Corolla also moved back into lane 3. The accused saw this manoeuvre in his rear view mirrors and so steered the tanker left, intending to get out of the way of the Corolla. He had partly entered lane 2 at the time the Corolla collided with the rear left hand side of the fire tanker. The tanker was moving slowly at the time of the collision, its speed being in the order of 10-15kph.
	
	
	After the collision the accused drove the tanker into the break down lane. The Corolla was left stationary in lane 3. Its electrical system was damaged to the extent that none of its lights operated. It was completely unlit. Mrs Mihailidis, whilst perhaps injured in the collision, was alive. She opened the passenger door and released her seat belt. She was in the process of getting out of the car when she was struck by a third vehicle, this a Mazda driven by Ms Nicole Burton who was also travelling northbound. She was driving the Mazda in lane 3 and had been for some time. Her lights were on low-beam and as she approached the scene she looked towards the flashing lights of the RFS tanker to her left. She did not see the stationary Corolla until it was too late to avoid colliding with it. It was the collision between the Corolla and the Mazda which caused Mrs Mihailidis’ death.
	


The trial


	
	There were 3 issues in dispute at the jury trial insofar as the count concerning the death of Mrs Mihailidis was concerned. The Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the impact between the RFS fire tanker and the Toyota Corolla driven by Mr Mihailidis caused the death of Mrs Mihailidis. The jury was directed that the Crown would have proved that if it proved beyond reasonable doubt that the impact between the RFS tanker and the Corolla caused the impact between the Mazda and the Corolla.
	
	
	The next issue for the jury to resolve at the trial was whether at the time of the impact between the RFS tanker and the Corolla the accused was driving the RFS tanker in a manner dangerous to another person or persons.
	
	
	And the third issue, which only arose if the 2 earlier issues were resolved in a manner adverse to the accused, was whether the accused proved on the balance of probabilities that Mrs Mihailidis’ death was not in any way attributable to the manner in which he drove the RFS tanker. Of course how the jury resolved these issues is unknown. On what basis the not guilty verdicts were returned is unknown.
	
	
	It is now my task to determine whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused on the 2 back-up charges I have referred to at the start of this judgment.
	


Was the accused driving an “emergency vehicle”


	
	I will firstly deal with an issue which Mr Higgins says arose in the case of both charges before me – the question of whether the accused was driving an “emergency vehicle”
	
	
	The issue arises directly as regards the charge relating to the U-turn and, Mr Higgins says, indirectly in relation to the charge of negligent driving causing death. It concerns Rule 306 of the Australian Road Rules. That rule provides
	
	
	A provision of these Rules does not apply to the driver of an emergency vehicle if:
	



	
	In the circumstances:
	



	
	the driver is taking reasonable care, and 
	
	
	it is reasonable that the rule should not apply, and 
	



	
	if the vehicle is a motor vehicle that is moving – the vehicle is displaying a blue or red flashing light or sounding an alarm.
	



	
	An “emergency vehicle” is defined in the dictionary as meaning any vehicle driven by a person who is;
	



	
	An emergency worker, and 
	
	
	driving the vehicle in the course of his or her duties as an emergency worker.
	



	
	The definition of emergency worker is such that, as a member of a rural fire brigade the accused would be an emergency worker if he was “providing transport in the course of an emergency” (emphasis added).
	
	
	The word “emergency” is not defined in the Road Rules but Mr Higgins suggested that that word should be interpreted in the way that word is used in the Rural Fires Act. The Crown accepted that that was an appropriate way of interpreting the word “emergency”. The relevant part of Mr Higgins submissions, in which he quotes the definition he impresses upon me, is this:
	


The Rural Fires act 1997 (NSW) (Rural Fires Act) provides the best guide to the legislature’s intended meaning of the word “emergency” in the Australian Road Rules. It relevantly applies to a member of a rural fire brigade, which establishes and sets out the functions of rural fire brigades. Relevantly, section 4 of the Rural Fires Act as at 18 October 2012, is a Note, which picks up the definitions in the State Emergency and Rescue Management Act 1989 (NSW):

Emergency means an emergency due to an actual or imminent occurrence (such a fire, flood, storm, earthquake, explosion, terrorist act, accident, epidemic or warlike action) which:


	
	endangers, or threatens to endanger, the safety or health of persons or animals in the State, or
	
	
	destroys or damages, or threatens to destroy or damage, property in the State,
	


being an emergency which requires a significant and co-ordinated response. (emphasis added)


	
	Mr Higgins also relied on the natural and ordinary meaning of the word emergency and noted that the Macquarie Dictionary defined emergency as “an unforeseen occurrence; a sudden and urgent occasion for action”.
	
	
	The evidence as to what was actually happening at the Mount White checking station at the time the accused performed the U-turn was not terribly clear. There was evidence that about 2,000 litres of concentrated orange juice had spilt. It was classified as a chemical spill. Crew attending had to wear breathing apparatus. I was asked to infer that the evidence was such that there was a threat of damage to property. Whilst I may have been prepared to infer that fact at the time of Kariong 1’s first attendance at the weighbridge station, there is a dearth of evidence as to whether such threat continued to the time when the accused performed the U-turn.
	
	
	The communication logs admitted at trial speak only of a need for the accused to return to the Mount White checking station. The accused in his interview with police conducted in the early hours of the following morning spoke of having to return to the Mount White checking station to finish tidying up and pick up the crew that were left there. The accused told police that he had consumed pizza at the weighbridge before he left, bought for them by the owner of the truck which had spilt the concentrated orange juice. The accused would have known what the situation was at the time he left the weighbridge and so there is no reason at all to doubt his description of the reason that he was heading back to the Mount White checking station some time later.
	
	
	A number of points flow from the evidence to which I have just referred. Firstly it tends to suggest that whatever threat there had been to property had abated and, more importantly, that there was no urgency in the accused and Mr Barwick getting back to the weighbridge to assist with tidying up and picking up the crew.
	
	
	In my view the need for “urgency” or as the Macquarie Dictionary suggests “urgent occasion for action” was missing from the evidence as to what the accused was responding to at the time he did his U-turn.
	
	
	As it turns out I have reached verdicts on the 2 counts before me without needing to decide whether the accused was the driver of an emergency vehicle. If it had been necessary I would have concluded beyond reasonable doubt that he was not.
	
	
	The definition of “emergency” relied on by Mr Higgins defines the sort of emergencies which amount to an “emergency”. Even if there has been an accident which threatens to damage property, which Mr Higgins says there had been, the opening words of the definition: “Emergency means an emergency due to…” make it clear that the overarching requirement to be understood is that there is an “emergency”. On proper analysis the definition limits the types of emergencies which are covered. I find that a threat to property which does not require an urgent response is not an “emergency”.
	
	
	No evidence before me pointed to any urgent need for the accused to return to the weighbridge. The accused knew the situation at the weighbridge when he left and he told the police in his interview that he had to return there to tidy up and pick up the crew. I repeat, if necessary I would have found beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was not driving an emergency vehicle when he performed the U-turn.
	
	
	Implicit in that conclusion is my rejection of an argument raised by Mr Higgins at paragraphs 50 - 55 of his written submissions where he asked me to form a conclusion, from the particular charge chosen by the prosecution, that the Crown was effectively conceding that the accused was driving an emergency vehicle. I will simply say that there is no legal principle which would require, or even allow, such a conclusion. Mr Higgins suggested that it would be an abuse of process for me to allow the Crown to argue that the accused was not driving an emergency vehicle. I completelyaccept that the categories of abuse of process are not closed but it has never been said to apply to the situation raised by Mr Higgins, nor, in my view, should it.
	


Negligent driving occasioning death

Legal test for Negligence


	
	I will now turn to the allegation of negligent driving occasioning death. It is important to emphasise that a significant degree of negligence needs to be proved beyond reasonable doubt by the Crown. The authorities require that the Crown prove negligence of such a high standard that criminal punishment is appropriate. Negligent conduct penalised by the criminal law must evidence such a marked departure from the standard of care that the reasonable person would have exercised, that it merits criminal punishment.
	
	
	Many relevant issues are examined in determining whether an accused’s manner of driving reaches that standard. There needs to be proved a likelihood of risk to others which must be at least real, obvious and serious.
	
	
	It is also relevant to consider whether the conduct said by the Crown to be negligent has been shown to be a breach of a duty of care recognised by the general law, or created by statute. That of course is not the same thing as saying that the Crown needs to demonstrate that a road rule has been breached before driving can be negligent (although as will be seen, I do in fact find that the accused did breach at least road rule 38).
	
	
	The test for criminal negligence in this context is well expressed in by Johnson J in DPP v Yeo & Anor [2008] NSWCSC 953 as follows
	


27 Negligent driving is established where it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused person drove a motor vehicle in a manner involving a departure from the standard of care for other users of the road to be expected of the ordinary prudent driver in the circumstances. The distinction which may be drawn between driving negligently, driving in a manner dangerous to the public and driving of a kind which justifies a conviction for manslaughter is essentially a distinction in the degree of negligence appropriate to the offence, being a distinction in the degree of departure from the standard of care for other users of the road to be expected of the ordinary prudent driver in the circumstances: R v Buttsworth at 672. 

…

29 The question is essentially whether the driver was exercising that degree of care which the ordinary prudent driver would exercise in all the circumstances, including the circumstances as set out in s.42(3): Simpson v Peat [1952] 2 QB 24.

The Respective Cases


	
	The Crown case is that the accused failed to allow Mr Mihailidis’ vehicle to pass, that he did not wait until the roadway was clear before entering the northbound carriageway, and in so doing he did not take the reasonable care expected from the ordinary prudent driver.
	
	
	The case for the accused is that the road rules entitled him to drive the way he did, that he only entered lane 3 when it was clear of traffic, and that the cause of the collision was Mr Mihailidis’ decision to move back into lane 3, a decision perhaps contributed to by Mr Mihailidis’ obstructive sleep apnoea and vision problems..
	


Findings


	
	Mr Higgins makes a series of submissions in support of his general submission that the accused breached no relevant road rule by doing what he did. Subject to the question of whether the accused has breached the road rule the subject of the second charge, for the purposes of this judgment I accept Mr Higgins’ submission in this regard.
	
	
	I do not take into account Mr Mihailidis’ obstructive sleep apnoea though. That it contributed to this collision is mere speculation and inconsistent with what appears to have been a deliberate response (flashing his lights and changing lanes) by Mr Mihailidis to the circumstances as he perceived them to be.
	
	
	The problems that Mr Mihailidis had with his vision may have contributed to the collision, in particular his decision to move the Corolla from lane 2 north to lane 3 north once the RFS tanker began entering the northbound carriageway. His ability to correctly perceive the path that the RFS tanker was taking may have been effected by the cataract he had in one eye and the intra ocular lens he had in the other. However I find that he was legally entitled to drive in that he had been recently tested and met the vision standards required to hold a drivers’ licence. As I explain later, even a driver with perfect vision could easily be unaware that the accused was intending to perform a U-turn. And in any case, drivers must drive in a way which takes account of the abilities of all other drivers who are on the road. We all have different levels of vision, we all have different reaction times. Some drivers startle more easily than others. Mr Wells was entitled to assume that Mr Mihailidis’ vision allowed him to legally drive. He was not entitled to assume more than that.
	
	
	I accept, because it is consistent with statement of agreed facts, that Mr Mihailidis moved his vehicle from lane 3 to lane 2 and then back to lane 3, the first of those manoeuvres coinciding with him flashing his lights. I am prepared to proceed on the basis that the accused was entitled to assume that Mr Mihailidis would see the RFS tanker as an emergency vehicle and give way to it as the road rules required.
	
	
	But I am satisfied, even given all those findings made in the accused’s favour, that he drove negligently. The Crown case is that the accused was negligent by failing to stop or slow his vehicle so that it did not enter the northbound carriageway until after Mr Mihailidis’ vehicle had gone past. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was negligent for the accused to have entered the northbound carriageway while Mr Mihailidis’ vehicle was approaching.
	
	
	Many of Mr Higgins’ submissions referred to the actions of Mr Mihailidis. In deciding whether the accused is guilty of negligent driving occasioning death the focus should be on the accused’s manner of driving, albeit one of the matters taken into account when assessing that will of course be the accused’s responses to the actions of another road user, in this case the driver of the car which collided with the RFS tanker, Mr Mihailidis.
	


The accused was negligent


	
	I find that the accused’s driving was criminally negligent for the following reasons, acknowledging of course that there is some considerable overlap in the matters to which I will now refer:
	



	
	The accused should have foreseen that northbound vehicles approaching him would be travelling at or about that speed limit of 110kph. A reasonable and prudent driver would foresee that.
	
	
	The accused must have also understood, as would a reasonable and prudent driver, that when he turned his vehicle and entered lane 3 northbound there was going to be an enormous speed differential between Mr Mihailidis’ approaching Corolla and the RFS tanker, even if that tanker accelerated as fast as it was able. When the collision occurred the tanker was only doing about 10-15kph and was only 8 metres past the U-turn bay.
	
	
	The accused should have also foreseen that drivers do not always act as anticipated and that even drivers with perfect vision can be startled by unexpected events. In this regard, the accused well knew that it was night time with no lighting in the area. These matters would also be foreseen by a reasonable and prudent driver.
	
	
	The accused believed, as did Mr Barwick that when Mr Mihailidis flashed his lights and moved into lane 2 he was in effect saying “I acknowledge your presence on the roadway and it is safe for you to enter the northbound carriageway”. If he were a reasonable and prudent driver, the accused would have foreseen that it was entirely possible that Mr Mihailidis flashed his lights as a warning and moved into lane 2 at the same time to avoid the danger which he could see approaching from his right.
	
	
	The accused should have foreseen that one entirely logical response to a vehicle entering from a driver’s right, apparently taking a path from right to left in front of him or her, is to steer to the right and pass behind the apparent path of the other vehicle. At the very least the accused should have foreseen that Mr Mihailidis might have been unaware that he intended to turn into Lane 3 and so he should have foreseen, as a reasonable and prudent driver would, that there was a risk that the oncoming driver would, wrongly, perceive that the RFS tanker was going to cross his path and so would steer his vehicle to the right in an attempt to pass behind the apparent path of the other vehicle.
	
	
	Further, even accepting that the accused was driving an emergency vehicle in that he was responding to an event which threatened to damage property back at the Mount White vehicle checking station the accused should have foreseen that the driver of an approaching vehicle would not have known what Mr Wells’ intention was. The driver of an approaching vehicle would just see an emergency vehicle on his right but the driver would not know whether the emergency vehicle was responding to an incident located at the position where the RFS tanker was at the time (perhaps somewhere in the 8 metres gap between the 2 carriageways), or responding to an emergency on the left hand side of the northbound carriageway, or performing a U-turn so that the vehicle can travel north along that carriageway.
	
	
	Mr Wells knew what he intended to do, namely enter lane 3 and travel north, but a reasonable and prudent driver would foresee that this intention was not at all obvious to the driver of a vehicle approaching at or about 110 kph. Mr Wells knew what he was planning to do, but he should have foreseen that an approaching driver would not share that knowledge.
	
	
	Even assuming that the driver of an approaching vehicle could work out that the emergency vehicle was in the process of performing a U-turn, Mr Wells should have foreseen, because a reasonable and prudent driver would, that given that Mr Mihailidis’ car was the only vehicle approaching, it would not be unreasonable for the driver of a car approaching an emergency vehicle to expect the driver of the emergency vehicle to stop and wait the 11 seconds it would take to allow the approaching car to pass, before entering the northbound carriageway, and that the driver of the approaching car may be startled when that did not occur.
	
	
	Mr Higgins relies on some evidence in the trial as to the unlikelihood of a driver steering towards an emerging hazard. There was evidence in the trial about a study in which a researcher had reviewed driver’s responses in actual collisions. It was found that steering towards an emerging hazard is very rare. However circumstances behind real world collisions must vary enormously. The collision that I am concerned with arose in particular circumstances and, while relevant to the foreseeability that Mr Mihailidis would have swerved to his right immediately before the collision, the study to which reference was made in evidence at the trial establishes little about the circumstances of this particular collision. Like many statistics, they say much about a population, but say much less about an individual event.
	
	
	In the particular circumstances of this evening, especially where Mr Mihailidis was the only vehicle approaching, and could have been forgiven for thinking that the emergency vehicle he could see ahead would not enter the carriageway until after he had gone past it, the sudden and unexpected emergence of a threat which appeared to him to be entering on his right and moving towards his left could have led to him making the decision to respond to this emerging threat by veering behind the apparent path of the emergency vehicle. This is especially the case if, as I have found it foreseeable that it was, the flashing of the lights coinciding with the move from lane 3 to lane 2 was a warning to alert the driver of the RFS tanker that a car was approaching at high speed, rather than an invitation to proceed as the accused interpreted it.
	



	
	It was foreseeable to the accused that the driver of the sole vehicle approaching might have responded to the RFS tanker entering the northbound carriageway in unexpected ways, including by doing exactly what Mr Mihailidis did.
	



	
	It was foreseeable by a reasonable and prudent driver that a collision could occur as a result of the accused’s manner of driving, in particular by the driver of the approaching vehicle changing from lane 2 to lane 3 to avoid what was perceived as a risk that the RFS tanker would move from the driver’s right, across his path of travel in lane 2.
	



	
	The accused was negligent in that he failed to take what is the obvious decision when the driver of a heavy vehicle intends to enter the carriageway of a high speed expressway while a vehicle is approaching – wait the 11 seconds or so necessary to allow that vehicle to go past before entering the carriageway.
	
	
	By failing to do that, by entering the carriageway while the Corolla was approaching, the accused’s manner of driving was such a serious departure from the standard of care that a reasonable driver would have exercised that it merits criminal punishment. A reasonable and prudent driver would not have entered lane 3 of the northbound carriageway of the F3, where the speed limit is 110 kph, at night, in a slow moving vehicle, while he or she could see a car approaching in lane 2. By doing what he did he created a risk which was real, obvious and serious. The accused did not exercise that degree of care which the ordinary prudent driver would exercise in the circumstances I have outlined above.
	
	
	Mr Wells didn’t want to lose momentum and have to change down to first gear. Mr Wells didn’t want to stop. It was negligent of the accused to fail to do so.
	
	
	Thus I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was driving negligently.
	


Causation


	
	That raises another issue in this case which arises because, as I have explained above, Mrs Mihailidis did not die in the collision between the Corolla driven by her husband and the vehicle driven by the accused. It was the later collision between the Mazda driven by Ms Burton and the stationary Corolla which killed her.
	
	
	Although the collision between Ms Burton’s Mazda and the stationary Corolla was the immediate cause of death that does not mean that, as the law understands it, there was not another cause, namely the accused’s negligent driving.
	
	
	The concept of causation in the criminal law does not require the application of esoteric legal principle. What is required is that the question as to whether one circumstance caused another is to be looked at in a common sense way. It is not enough to say that but for the accused’s negligent driving Ms Mihailidis would not have died. As Mr Higgins’ correctly submitted,
	


“the causal connection between the manner in which the U-turn was conducted and impact #2 must be sufficiently substantial to attribute criminal responsibility to Mr Wells for the death of Mrs Mihailidis from impact #2”


	
	Mr Higgins focused on the driving of Ms Burton in an attempt to demonstrate that his client’s negligent driving did not cause the death of Mrs Mihailidis. Mr Higgins referred to a number of features of the manner in which Ms Burton drove that evening which I have outlined at the beginning of this judgment. In particular I note that, amongst other matters, she was travelling at slightly more than the speed limit, she did not have her head lights on high beam, and she was distracted by the flashing lights on the RFS tanker so that she took her eyes off the roadway for some time.
	
	
	Before going any further I should mention that I have not paid too much regard to a submission by Mr Higgins that Ms Burton had breached a road rule by travelling in lane 3 while she was not overtaking any other vehicle. True it is that if she was travelling in lane 2 she would not have collided with the Corolla, but that is merely a matter of coincidence because of where the Corolla ended up. I find that there is no relevant connection between what appears to be Ms Burton’s breach of a road rule by travelling in lane 3 and the issue as to whether, as a matter of law, the accused’s manner of driving caused the collision between the Mazda and the Corolla which was the direct cause of the death of Mrs Mihailidis.
	
	
	It is as well to remember the position after the accused moved the RFS tanker to the breakdown lane. The Corolla, dark in colour, was unlit and stationary on the roadway in the overtaking lane. Drivers approaching the scene would naturally look towards the tanker with its flashing red and blue beacons. In such a situation it was almost inevitable that an approaching vehicle would collide with the Corolla.
	
	
	Mr Higgins points out that Ms Burton’s Mazda was not the first vehicle to approach the stationary Corolla and that other drivers had been able to avoid colliding with it. That much is true, but it is important to understand the situation which approaching drivers were presented with.
	
	
	Perhaps the best evidence of the situation which presented itself to oncoming drivers is to be found in the dash cam video of Mr Schiemer. That video was tendered in the trial and Mr Schiemer himself gave oral evidence. The video graphically demonstrates the very limited time that an approaching driver had to see the stationary, dark, unlit Corolla and then avoid colliding with it. I fully accept of course that a poor quality video recording does not replicate what the human eye can see but fortunately the video recording contains a sound track. Mr Schiemer can be heard loudly expressing an expletive. He gave evidence that that was the moment that he saw the Corolla. It was but a matter of moments between when Mr Schiemer saw the stationary Corolla and when he went past it. From that evidence it is apparent that, as I have already said, a collision between an approaching vehicle and the stationary Corolla was almost inevitable.
	
	
	In a common sense way, a group of men who throw off a cliff an unconscious man, who later dies of exposure have caused his death (Thabo-Meli v R [1954] 1 WLR 228). Again in a common sense way, a man who causes some live electric cables to fall to the ground causes the death of the boy who is later electrocuted after coming into contact with the live cables (Cameron v R unrep NSWCCA 27 Sep 1994). And of course when causation is considered in a common sense way the death a woman who jumps to her death to escape an attack from her partner was caused by the partner (Royall v The Queen (1990) 172 CLR 378)
	
	
	Looking at the facts of this case in a common sense way, the Crown has satisfied me beyond reasonable doubt that the cause of Mrs Mihailidis’ death was the manner in which the accused drove the RFS tanker that night.
	
	
	I thus find the accused guilty of negligent driving occasioning death.
	


Failure to give way to another vehicle when making a U-Turn


	
	That brings me to the question as to whether the accused has breached Road Rule 38. Has the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused, as a driver making a U-turn, did not give way to Mr Mihailidis’ approaching vehicle?
	
	
	It is here that Mr Higgins relied on the exemption in Rule 306 to which I have earlier made reference. As noted above, if necessary I would have found that the accused was not driving an emergency vehicle and so the exemption would not apply to him. But in any case it is to be noted that the exemption only applies if, among other circumstances, “the driver is taking reasonable care”.
	
	
	As I have concluded above, the accused’s manner of driving was negligent. It follows that he was not taking reasonable care. In the course of submissions Mr Higgins conceded that he could not contemplate a situation where a driver found to be driving negligently could be found to have been taking reasonable care.
	
	
	For that reason I find that the exemption in Rule 306 does not apply and that Mr Wells did not give way to Mr Mihailidis’ approaching vehicle when he, Mr Wells, was making a U-turn.
	
	
	I thus find him guilty of breaching Road Rule 38.
	


Conclusion


	
	The accused is guilty of the 2 back up charges on the section 166 certificate

		24 November 2016",2016-08-16 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2701184,Furio Rossi v Regina [2016] NSWDC 168,"Judgment


	
	Furio Rossi (the appellant) appeals against the severity of the sentence imposed on him by his Honour Magistrate Bailey on 1 April 2016 at the Downing Centre Local Court. The appellant also sought leave to appeal against the conviction based on his plea of guilty in the Local Court, pursuant to section 12 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, if it was necessary to do so.
	
	
	At about 10.10pm on 18 August 2015 the appellant was the driver of a vehicle on River Road at Northwood. At that time Senior Constable Wolven was operating a hand held Lidar radar device serial number LA 396 (the device) to measure the speed of vehicles that drove past. The prosecution alleged that the appellant was detected driving at 101km/hour in a 50km/hour zone, by reference to the reading from the device obtained by Senior Constable Wolven.
	
	
	The appellant was charged with one count of exceeding the speed limit by more than 45km/hour, contrary to rule 20 of the Australian Road Rules 2014 (the Road Rules). The maximum penalty for the offence was a fine of $2,530. A conviction for the offence also carried with it a mandatory and minimum licence suspension for 6 months. The magistrate convicted and fined the appellant the sum of $2,500.
	
	
	The appellant accepted that he was speeding at the time he was observed by the police, but disputed that he was doing so by more than 45km/hour over the limit. The magistrate convicted the appellant of the offence after he pleaded guilty in the course of the hearing.
	
	
	On the appeal, the appellant contended that the certificate tendered pursuant to section 137 Road Transport Act 2013 (the section 137 certificate) was inadmissible and if I accepted that argument that I should set aside the conviction and find the appellant guilty of the statutory alternate of exceed speed by between more than 30km/hour but less than 45km/hour provided for by rule 10-2(7) Road Rules.
	


Admissibility of the section 137 certificate

The relevant law


	
	Section 135 Road Transport Act 2013 relevantly defines an “appropriate inspection officer” in relation to an approved traffic enforcement device that measures the speed at which a vehicle is travelling but is not used in conjunction with, or as part of a digital camera device to be a police officer or a person authorised by the Commissioner of Police to test a device of that kind.
	
	
	Section 136 Road Transport Act 2013 provides that evidence may be given in proceedings for a speeding offence of a measurement of speed obtained and recorded by an approved traffic enforcement device that is approved for speed measurement.
	
	
	Section 137 Road Transport Act 2013 provides:
	


In proceedings for a speeding offence in which evidence is given of a measurement of speed obtained from an approved traffic enforcement device that is approved for speed measurement, a certificate purporting to be signed by an appropriate inspection officer for the device certifying the following matters is admissible and is prima facie evidence of those matters:

(a)   that the device is an approved traffic enforcement device that is approved for speed measurement,

(b)   that on a day specified in the certificate (being within the period prescribed by the statutory rules before the alleged time of the offence) the device was tested in accordance with the statutory rules and sealed by an appropriate inspection officer for the device,

(c)   that on that day the device was accurate and operating properly.


	
	The law is that a section 137 certificate does not possess a character independently of its contents; it is defined by reference to its contents. Unless its contents meet the statutory description, the statute is not invoked to allow its tender or its use to facilitate proof. A section 137 certificate does not provide prima facie evidence of any of the particulars contained in it, unless it certifies to each of them: Henning v Lynch [1974] 2 NSWLR 254 at 260-1, RTA v Nicholls [2005] NSWSC 946.
	
	
	A section 137 certificate requires the following elements, that it:
	



	
	is signed by an authorised officer for the device;
	
	
	states that the device is an approved traffic enforcement device that is approved for speed measurement;
	
	
	states that on a day within the relevant period that the device was tested in accordance with the statutory rules and sealed by an approved officer for the device; and
	
	
	states that on the day of testing it was accurate and operating properly.
	


The section 137 certificate


	
	The section 137 certificate tendered in the Local Court provided as follows:
	


I S.Taki being a Police Officer/ an Appropriate Inspection Officer from the Radar Engineering Unit, certify that

(i)   The device bearing Serial No LA396 is an appropriate traffic enforcement device that is approved for speed measurement, within the meaning of the Road Transport Act 2013.

(ii)   On the 30th day of April 2014 the device was tested in accordance with the regulations made under that Act and sealed by a Police Officer/ an Appropriate Inspection Officer from the Radar Engineering Unit; and

(iii)   On that day the device was accurate and operating properly.

The appellant’s argument


	
	The appellant contended that the section 137 certificate was defective because where the words “Appropriate Inspection Officer” appeared in it (highlighted in italics), it did not state that the Appropriate Inspection Officer was so designated for a speed measuring device. In the appellant’s argument, the words “for a speed measuring device” are missing after each of the references in the section 137 certificate to “Appropriate Inspection Officer”.
	


Consideration


	
	The appellant’s argument can be shortly disposed of.
	
	
	There is a presumption that defined words in a statute have their defined meanings; the presumption should not be displaced without good reason: Qantas Airways Ltd v Chief Commissioner of State Revenue [2008] NSWSC 1049 at [38] per Handley AJ. Interpretation clauses must be interpreted reasonably to promote and not defeat the purposes of the Act that they are designed to elucidate: In re The Fourth South Melbourne Building Society (1883) 9 VLR (E) 54 at 58 per Holroyd J.
	
	
	It was accepted on behalf of the appellant that he could not go behind the matters certified, including that the author of the certificate was an appropriate inspection officer. In this case, by crossing out all of the references to being a police officer it is clear that the author of the certificate was certifying that he or she was a person authorised by the Commissioner of Police to test an approved traffic enforcement device that measured the speed at which a vehicle was travelling, pursuant to the provisions of sub-paragraph (a)(ii) of the definition.
	
	
	The author of the certificate was entitled to rely on the statutory definition to prove that he or she was an appropriate inspection officer for the speed measuring device and that the relevant testing was carried out by him or her or another appropriate inspection officer.
	
	
	The words “for the device” in section 137 still had work to do in the context of section 137 because they were a necessary reference to the particular device. The reference to “a device of that kind” is contained in the definition of appropriate inspection officer, whereas the reference to the specific device is contained in section 137 that provides for the issue of a certificate for use as evidence of the accuracy of the particular device used by the police to measure the speed of the vehicle of interest.
	
	
	For these reasons I am satisfied that the section 137 certificate provided particulars of all of the matters required by the section and that it was admissible and able to be relied on as prima facie evidence of the speed measurement of the appellant’s vehicle at the time of the offence.
	
	
	The order that I make is that the appeal against conviction for the offence of exceed speed by more than 45km/hour is dismissed.
	
	
	I will hear the appellant on the severity appeal.

	HIS HONOUR: Not that long ago, Parliament made clear that self-induced intoxication is not a mitigating factor when an intoxicated person commits a crime. That had been the law for some time. In the present case, not only is Mr Mussen’s voluntary decision to intoxicate himself by means of an illegal drug not a mitigating factor, it is, indeed, an aggravating factor, as I will soon explain.
	
	
	The offender has pleaded guilty to three offences. They are reckless wounding, possessing a shortened firearm and firing a firearm in a manner likely to endanger the safety of others. When I sentence him for the second of those matters, the shortened firearm matter, he asks that I take into account two matters on the Form 1, possessing ammunition and not keeping a firearm safely.
	
	
	The maximum penalties are set out on the Crown sentence summary as follows: For reckless wounding, the maximum penalty is seven years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of three years. For possessing the shortened firearm, the maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment, a sentence which indicates how significantly Parliament says judges should regard such offences. And for firing a firearm in a manner likely to endanger the safety of others, the maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment. I have taken into account the maximum penalties and, where appropriate, the standard non-parole period, in deciding the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period for the reckless wounding matter appear in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	In the very early hours of 12 July, a man by the name of Brook Sloane was asleep at his home. There was a loud knocking at his door. When he woke up and went to the door he saw the offender and another man.
	
	
	Mr Sloane let them in so they would not disturb the neighbours. Mr Sloane made the other two a cup of coffee and there was a conversation about jewellery and gold. Then the offender asked Mr Sloane if he wanted to buy a gun. Sensibly, Mr Sloane declined the offer. It was at this stage that the offender produced the firearm which he had brought with him. It was a shortened ·.22 calibre rifle.
	
	
	The offender pointed the gun at the floor and said, “If I shot this into the ground will it wake up the neighbour?” Mr Sloane replied that the neighbour had died a previous week. He then heard a click and the offender say, “Lucky it wasn’t loaded.” There was a loud bang. What had happened is that the offender had shot Mr Sloane in the knee. The offender and the man that he had come to the unit with then ran away.
	
	
	Mr Sloane called triple-0. The offender and the other man went to a park where the offender went and concealed the firearm he had just shot Mr Sloane with. Police went to Mr Sloane’s home and took him to hospital.
	
	
	Eventually police caught up with the offender. They could not interview him because he was under the influence of a drug but they did go to his home and spoke with his mother, who gave permission to search the home. In the offender’s bedroom police located the following: A rifle cleaning kit on the bed; a bag containing a sawn off shotgun and two shotgun cartridges, also on the bed. There was a fired shotgun cartridge casing behind the television. There was a black baton in the bottom drawer of the desk, a pair of silver handcuffs there too, as well as seven assorted knives and six plastic cable ties.
	
	
	Police then went back to the offender and spoke with him. He said that he knew nothing about the shooting and that he was “frying” when that happened. That meant that he was getting high.
	
	
	In response to receiving some more information, police went to where the offender had hidden the ·22, they recovered it and a number of ·22 rounds. When they rendered the firearm safe a ·22 calibre cartridge ejected from it. Thus it had been loaded when it was hidden.
	
	
	Police conducted an interview with the offender and he made no admissions but told police he had been smoking ice for some days prior. The ·22 was in working order when it was examined by a ballistics expert. Of course it was in working order when it was used to shoot Mr Sloane as well. The shortened shotgun was also in working order.
	
	
	To say that these offences are serious is an understatement. The offender, whilst intoxicated, was playing around with a loaded firearm. He managed to shoot an innocent person in the knee, causing significant consequences for him. When police went to his home they found yet another shortened firearm. And on top of that the offender possessed ammunition suitable for those firearms.
	
	
	As the Crown accurately pointed out, there is but one reason that a firearm is shortened, that is so that it can be used in the commission of a crime. The fact that the offender also possessed handcuffs, a number of knives, cable ties and a baton, say a great deal about the character of the offender at the time he committed the offences for which I must sentence him.
	
	
	The offender was barely 18 at the time he shot Mr Sloane, 18 years and two months in fact. There is, of course, no bright line by which a person reaches adult maturity as soon as they reach their 18th birthday. I take into account, in the offender’s favour, his youth at the time he committed these offences.
	
	
	The offender did not have a good role model in his father. His parents split up when he was reasonably young, with, as I understand it, custody at one stage being given to his father. During the time that the offender lived with his father, he was exposed to behaviour which poorly modelled to him the way he should act. His father owned illegal firearms, he did not keep them locked up or in a gun safe. His father’s new partner was physically abusive towards him and was herself the victim of domestic violence at the hands of his father. The offender was the subject of abuse, including abuse which led to signs of physical injury.
	
	
	When this became known, the offender’s mother regained custody of him, which led to his father simply, as I understand it, abandoning his relationship with the offender.
	
	
	In contrast to the role model which his father provided, his mother is a good role model. He has a half-brother too, who provided a reference for the court, explaining the circumstances of the offender’s early upbringing and suggesting that there is hope for the future once the offender is released from what is conceded to be a significant period of custody.
	
	
	I should mention another poor role model. At one stage the offender had a partner who introduced him to the drugs that he was using at the time of this offending.
	
	
	Mr Krisenthal relies in particular on one aspect of the psychological report tendered on his behalf. The psychologist said,
	


“To surmise his substance use, Mr Mussen indicated that cannabis was normalised by his father and peers in his area as a means of regulating his daily emotional functioning. The addition of methamphetamine, also normalised an older intimate partner and his peers, reportedly allowed Mr Mussen to feel ‘untouchable’ as if he was ‘flying’.”


	
	Quite clearly, these offences have occurred in the context of the offender mixing with the wrong crowd. It was the sort of crowd that would allow him to possess dangerous weapons, weapons that, as I have said, are really only to be used in the course of committing further offences.
	
	
	I should now speak about the consequences for the offence on Mr Sloane. Mr Krisenthal submitted that these injuries were not life threatening but they were certainly life changing. The consequences for Mr Sloane have been set out in the victim impact statement. He says that walking over 500 metres is a challenge. He can no longer run and catch a bus or a train, with stairs being nearly impossible. He refers to psychological effects as well. He has suffered financially because of what the offender did to him.
	
	
	He does say that he forgives the offender. That forgiveness by Mr Sloane, while highly commendable from a human point of view, must be ignored by a sentencing judge. Just as when victims of crime seek harsh penalties such expressions of opinion must be ignored, so must expressions of forgiveness be ignored.
	
	
	Mr Krisenthal accurately submitted that there is significant overlap between two of the offences. The offence of reckless wounding was committed when the offender fired the firearm and so there is a significant overlap between the offences of reckless wounding and firing a firearm in a manner likely to endanger the safety of others.
	
	
	There are prospects for the offender’s rehabilitation, although the very serious nature of his behaviour does call into question whether the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. There is a job available for him in his brother’s pest control company. The fact that the offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity is also a factor to be taken into account in assessing the likelihood that the offender will re-offend in the future. He certainly does have good role models available to him, which bodes well for the future.
	
	
	Having mentioned the pleas of guilty, I should emphasise that he is to be rewarded with a discount of 25 per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of those pleas of guilty.
	
	
	I need, however, before passing sentence, to emphasise just how serious this behaviour was. He went with a loaded 22 to Mr Sloane’s home and offered to sell it to him. Whilst highly intoxicated, he shot Mr Sloane, not intending to, but given the combination of an intoxicated person and a loaded firearm, that a person ended up getting shot is not terribly surprising. And then, on top of that, to possess a shortened shotgun, simply lying in a bag on his bed, with two shotgun cartridges nearby, demonstrates a level of criminality which is highly significant, even in a person only 18 years and two months old at the time.
	
	
	It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that a sentence needs to reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct. That explains why a significant sentence of imprisonment is required.
	
	
	There are special circumstances in this case. They relate to the offender’s immaturity, his behaviour whilst in custody is poor as well and so if he is to stay out of gaol, if he is to take the opportunities which are available to him upon release from custody, he will benefit from an extended of supervision by the Probation and Parole Service.
	
	
	I will impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment. Had I not imposed an aggregate sentence, I would have imposed the following sentences:
	
	
	For the reckless wounding offence, three and a half years imprisonment with a two year non-parole period. For possess shortened firearm, three years imprisonment. For the fire firearm in a manner likely to endanger safety, two and a half years imprisonment.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence I impose consists of a non-parole period of three years and a head sentence of six years to date from 12 July 2015.
	
	
	The non-parole period will expire on 11 July 2018, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

2701202,Hoskins v R [2016] NSWCCA 157,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: On 26 March 2013, following a trial before a jury, Darren Michael Hoskins, the applicant, was convicted of murder contrary to s 18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Two of his co-offenders, Sean Sutcliffe and Darrin Moulds, were also convicted of murder. Michael Brown was convicted of manslaughter and the final co-offender, LC, was dealt with in earlier proceedings, ultimately giving evidence against his co-offenders.
	
	
	On 7 June 2013, the applicant was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment to date from 4 July 2011 and expiring on 3 July 2023. A non-parole period of 9 years was fixed, and is due to expire on 3 July 2020.
	
	
	On 21 June 2013, the applicant filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal (“NIA”) against both conviction and sentence, but the matter ultimately proceeded to hearing on 27 August 2014 as an appeal against conviction only: Hoskins v R [2014] NSWCCA 207. The appeal against sentence was, effectively, abandoned.
	
	
	The applicant now seeks leave to appeal, out of time, against sentence.
	


Relevant facts


	
	On 18 January 2011, the deceased, Jamie LaFoe, with two others, apparently spoke with Mr Sutcliffe’s partner at the Sutcliffe home and said he believed that the applicant had set his car, plus two others, alight.
	
	
	A number of phone calls were made after this, and as a result Mr Moulds drove to Mr Sutcliffe’s house with three passengers, including Mr Brown. Mr Brown carried a machete with him. The applicant also drove to Mr Sutcliffe’s house with three passengers.
	
	
	After Mr Sutcliffe arrived home, his partner contacted the deceased and told him to come down to the house by himself and “sort it out”. When the deceased and his two companions arrived at Mr Sutcliffe’s house, Mr Sutcliffe’s partner observed that the deceased was carrying a gun.
	
	
	Upon becoming aware of the deceased’s arrival, Mr Moulds and the applicant, in separate cars, moved quickly towards Mr Sutcliffe’s house. The deceased began shooting his gun towards the oncoming cars. Mr Moulds was grazed by a bullet.
	
	
	The passengers of both cars alighted, and Mr Brown struck the deceased with the machete. The deceased and the two other men tried to flee by running to a vehicle, but Jason Moulds (the brother of the co-offender) rammed the car with another vehicle.
	
	
	The deceased then attempted to run away on foot. He was chased by five men, including the applicant. The deceased had run out of ammunition by this stage. He ultimately tripped, or was tackled, and set upon by the five pursuers. In the course of the attack by those men, the deceased suffered a fatal stab wound in the lower back. The applicant did not inflict the fatal wound, but had participated in the attack upon the deceased, being himself armed with a baseball bat. The Crown’s case was that the applicant had participated in a joint criminal enterprise to cause grievous bodily harm to, or kill, the deceased.
	


The Sentence Imposed by the Trial Judge


	
	The trial judge described, at [32] – [34], the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending as follows:
	


“Hoskins was, I find, a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to inflict grievous bodily harm by some means on the victim and he is liable for the murder which was committed accordingly.

On his own version to police, Hoskins entered the fray with a baseball bat which, although he dropped it at one point, was retrieved and used, although he claimed that he may or may not have made contact. Certainly no major injury to the victim could be associated with a heavy blow by the bat but I reject the contention that Hoskins' purpose was to disarm Jamie LaFoe. As I have said his intention was to cause grievous bodily harm and punish him.

It is not insignificant that Hoskins came to the scene after collecting passengers in circumstances where it was obvious that there was potential for trouble of some sort and the numbers of men would give an advantage in a physical sense to any confrontation. The departure after first arrival, the waiting nearby and the return are all indicative of Hoskins’ preparedness to become engaged in whatever trouble might erupt. Added to his knowledge of the additional four men in the Moulds vehicle, the Crown description that they were preparing for ambush was quite accurate.”


	
	The applicant’s sentence incorporated the following:
	



	
	A 33 per cent reduction in sentence due to provocation by the deceased;
	
	
	Backdating the commencement date of the sentence to take into account the time that the applicant had been in custody on remand; and
	
	
	An allowance of 60 days to reflect strict bail conditions that the applicant had been subject to whilst awaiting trial (60 days being approximately 25 per cent of the time the applicant had spent on bail).
	



	
	The sentencing judge also took into account the following subjective factors:
	



	
	The applicant had a back injury. Treatment in gaol had been inadequate leading to him being granted bail whilst awaiting trial, and there was no reason to think that the medical treatment would be markedly different in the future; and
	
	
	The applicant was in protective custody and his sentence would be served in custodial conditions more onerous than those of other prisoners who were in the general gaol population.
	


Previous Appeal


	
	As noted, the applicant filed a NIA on all grounds in June 2013. Applications to extend the NIA were twice granted by the Registrar of this Court, over a nine month period.
	
	
	On 12 May 2014, the applicant’s then solicitor filed a second NIA limited to conviction only. This Court dismissed the conviction appeal.
	
	
	The present application for leave to appeal against sentence was filed by the applicant on 22 December 2015. The applicant filed an accompanying affidavit dated 2 December 2015, in which he asserted that his former solicitor had allowed the June 2013 NIA, as relevant to a proposed sentence appeal, to expire.
	
	
	On 1 July 2016, the applicant appeared before this Court representing himself.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	The applicant advanced 13 grounds of appeal, some of which overlap to a considerable extent. They deal largely with the applicant’s experience in custody, and some rely on events that post-date the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	Both the applicant and the Crown filed and relied upon written submissions. No oral submissions were made at the hearing of the application.
	


Ground One: “His Honour erred when he took into account my psychologist report”


	
	Before the sentencing Court the applicant relied upon a report from a psychologist, Ms Barbara Panagiotopoulos. By ground one, the applicant contends that the report was not taken into account by the sentencing judge, even though it was favourable to him, and despite the fact that psychological reports tendered during sentence proceedings by his co-offenders were given consideration.
	
	
	It is clear from his Honour’s reasons that he both read and carefully considered the report of Ms Panagiotopoulos. He concluded, however, that the contents of the report were of limited assistance, particularly in assessing the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour specifically noted the absence of information as to the administration of relevant psychological tests, with the report consisting principally of information provided to the author by the applicant. The sentencing judge concluded that the opinions expressed in the report lay outside the author’s area of expertise. His Honour said, at [37] of the judgment:
	


“[…] Much of the opinion therein lies outside what I would consider the expertise of a psychologist. The report does not record application of specific psychological tests and their results. A number of documents were listed as having been examined. I do not doubt the sincerity of the reporter but I can only conclude that her favourable predictions may or may not come to pass and I make no finding as to probability.”


	
	It was entirely open to his Honour to draw those conclusions. In many cases statements made by an offender to an expert and recounted in an expert report, in the absence of evidence from the offender as to the truth of those statements, are of very little weight, if any: R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353, at [58] and [79].
	
	
	The report of Ms Panagiotopoulos was of limited utility. It did not contain any objective material which suggested, let alone compelled, a conclusion different to that reached by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	The fact that reports tendered on behalf of co-offenders were or may have been given weight by the sentencing judge can say nothing about the question of error in the treatment of the report relied upon by the applicant. His Honour was both entitled and obliged to assess the weight to be given to the report of Ms Panagiotopoulos by reference to its contents, and the absence of foundational evidence from the applicant.
	
	
	No error has been shown. We would not grant leave to advance this ground.
	


Ground Two: “His Honour erred when he took into account my medical problems”

Ground Three: “His Honour erred when he took into account my lack of medical treatment in gaol”


	
	Grounds two and three will be addressed together as they both relate to the applicant’s health problems and the delays he has experienced in receiving appropriate treatment in the prison system.
	
	
	The applicant contends that his poor health and the deterioration in his mobility due to a spinal problem have not been adequately treated in custody. Although he does not specify the precise nature of the error made by the sentencing judge in addressing this issue, it appears that the applicant’s contention is that the sentence imposed upon him by the sentencing judge did not properly reflect this feature of the subjective case.
	
	
	Setting aside for the moment the applicant’s experience in prison following the imposition of sentence, it is difficult to see how the applicant could make good these grounds in light of the attention given to the question of the applicant’s health by the sentencing judge. His Honour was cognisant of, and referred to, the applicant’s poor health, and the lack of adequate medical treatment that had been available to him when on remand.
	
	
	At [34] and [35] of the sentence judgment his Honour noted that the applicant was in poor health and suffered from a deteriorating spinal condition. He referred to the inadequate medical treatment provided to him in goal, as detailed in an earlier judgment relating to bail, and noted that those inadequacies were likely to continue into the future. The sentencing judge specifically said that some allowance would be made in assessing sentence to reflect that feature of the subjective case (at [35]). More could not be required.
	
	
	Whilst an offender’s health difficulties and the additional hardships that such difficulties may lead to for an offender in custody are matters legitimately taken into account by a court in assessing sentence, it is simply one of the features to which the court must have regard. It cannot be concluded in the applicant’s circumstances that the degree of amelioration of penalty his Honour allowed entailed error.
	
	
	The applicant’s current circumstances are not relevant to the determination of this application. Not only is there no evidence before this Court of the applicant’s state of health post-sentence, or of the treatment regime presently available to him, but any such evidence may not meet the test of fresh evidence, and would thus be inadmissible: Abou-Chabake v R [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417 at [63]; Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118; 209 A Crim R 509 at [104] – [121].
	
	
	The applicant has failed to demonstrate any error in the sentencing judge’s consideration of his health problems and medical treatment in custody and we would not grant leave to advance these grounds.
	


Ground Four: “His Honour erred when he took into account my strict bail conditions”


	
	Although not specifically stated by the applicant, his argument appears to be that the discount of 60 days from the sentence imposed upon him was not an adequate reflection of the 229 days during which he experienced, what he contends, were onerous conditions of bail.
	
	
	As has been noted, after a period spent in custody on remand awaiting trial, the applicant was granted conditional bail, principally because of his health difficulties and the lack of appropriate treatment available to him as a remand prisoner.
	
	
	The bail conditions imposed upon the applicant included a residential condition, a daily reporting condition, a prohibition on contact with both Crown witnesses and any of the co-accused, a condition requiring the applicant to pursue employment, a curfew condition requiring him to be at his residence between 7pm and 7am each night, and a condition requiring him to present himself at his front door at the request of a police officer, for the purpose of checking his compliance with the curfew.
	
	
	The fact that an offender was subject to strict conditions of bail during the period awaiting trial or sentence is a matter that may be taken into account by a sentencing judge, but there is no obligation to do so. Much will depend upon the facts of the particular case. Certainly, there is no principle that dictates a reduction in sentence as a direct equivalent of a period of time spent subject to strict conditions of bail.
	
	
	It is a matter for the sentencing judge to assess the facts of the particular case and determine whether bail conditions to which an offender was subject amount to quasi-custody: R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243, at 258; R v Webb [2004] NSWCCA 330 at [18].
	
	
	The bail conditions imposed upon the applicant were strict, but there is a real factual issue as to whether an overnight curfew and, perhaps additionally, a daily reporting condition, are so restrictive as to amount to quasi-custody.
	
	
	Here, although it was by no means mandatory for him to do so, the sentencing judge specifically took into account the curfew and reporting conditions to which the applicant was subject, in the exercise of his discretion, to reduce the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed by 60 days (at [39] of the judgment). There was no basis for an equivalent allowance of 229 days reduction in sentence to reflect 229 days of restricted liberty on bail. Time spent by an offender residing in his or her own home in the community prior to trial or sentence cannot be directly equated to time spent in the much harsher environment of a prison.
	
	
	We do not regard the 60 day reduction of sentence allowed to the applicant as capable of demonstrating error.
	
	
	We would not grant leave to advance ground four.
	


Ground Five: “His Honour erred when he took into account provocation by the victim”


	
	Whilst acknowledging the 33 per cent discount on sentence allowed (pursuant to s 21A(3)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)), to reflect the provocation by the deceased, the applicant contends that his Honour was in error in allowing anything less than a 50 per cent discount.
	
	
	The issue of provocation was dealt with by the sentencing judge at [40] – [42], incorporating the remarks on this aspect of the matter at [31]. His Honour concluded that the deceased had come armed to the confrontation with a lethal weapon which he used in a threatening fashion, and that he had used the weapon to shoot in the area where persons were present. He found that the level of provocation was “high” (at [31]) and “of no minor scale” (at [41]). He said (at [42]):
	


“As I have said, the statute expressly provides that provocation by a victim is a matter to be given allowance and on the facts of this case I would assess that allowance as one third of the penalty otherwise assessed.”


	
	The sentencing judge was not obliged to quantify the discount on sentence that was reflective of provocation. Having done so, we do not regard a discount of 33 per cent as inadequate, or otherwise erroneous.
	
	
	In our view, the sentencing judge’s reduction in sentence was generous, particularly as the fatal attack occurred after the deceased had stopped shooting and was attempting to run away.
	
	
	He was astute to the confrontational and reckless behaviour of the deceased in the events leading to his death but this does not alter the applicant’s aggressive involvement in the fatal attack, after the deceased attempted to flee the area.
	
	
	We would not grant leave to advance ground five.
	


Ground Six: “His Honour erred when he took into account protective custody and associating problems”


	
	The applicant submitted that, whilst the sentencing judge said that some allowance was made for the hardships the applicant would suffer in protective custody, no such allowance can be discerned having regard to the sentence imposed.
	
	
	As the applicant’s submissions acknowledge, his Honour’s remarks on sentence demonstrate that he made some allowance for the fact that the applicant would serve his sentence largely in protective custody (at [35]). He was not required to identify a specific allowance for hardship in custody: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357, at 373-374 [37], citing Wong v The Queen; Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 611-612 [74]-[76]. There is no basis upon which to conclude that the allowance his Honour said that he would make was not made. It cannot be concluded that the sentence imposed is so harsh as to point to a failure to give appropriate weight to this aspect of the applicant’s subjective case. Indeed, a sentence of 12 years with a 9 year non-parole period for the offence of murder may well be regarded as relatively lenient.
	
	
	We do not accept that this proposed ground can be made out, and would not grant leave to rely upon it.
	


Ground Seven: “His Honour erred when he took into account I played lesser part, then Moulds is given a lesser sentence”


	
	The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge erred by imposing a shorter sentence on the applicant’s co-offender, Darrin Moulds, than the sentence he received, despite the fact that the applicant’s culpability was assessed as being less than that of his co-offender, Mr Moulds.
	
	
	His Honour was well aware of the parity principle. He made a careful assessment of the culpability of each of the offenders, and of the subjective circumstances of each.
	
	
	Whilst the culpability of Darrin Moulds was assessed as being higher than that of the applicant, his Honour regarded his subjective case as more favourable. He said (at [52] – [53]):
	


“A disturbing aspect of Moulds’ situation is the callousness revealed in the text messages to which I have made earlier reference. Overall, an objective assessment of Moulds’ capability including striking the victim, non fatally, with an iron bar, would tend to make his culpability higher in scale than that of Hoskins but of course less than Sutcliffe who performed the stabbing. However, taken altogether I consider Moulds’ favourable subjective factors exceed those available to Hoskins with a result that I would consider a similar head sentence.”


	
	This assessment resulted in a head sentence (of 12 years) that was the same for both the applicant and his co-offender.
	
	
	A sentence of 10 years imprisonment was ultimately imposed on Darrin Moulds. The sentence was calculated after a reduction of 33 per cent from a proposed sentence of 18 years imprisonment, with a further reduction of 2 years to reflect past and future assistance (at [56]). That sentence took into account what his Honour regarded as the more favourable subjective circumstances of the co-offender. Mr Moulds was 28 years old at the time of the commission of the offence. He had a minor criminal record which was of no relevance to the sentencing task. He had been diagnosed as having a developmental disability, and psychological testing assessed him as functioning at a level consistent with a mild or borderline intellectual disability. Like the applicant, he was held in protection, and was likely to remain in protective custody for the duration of his sentence. His Honour concluded that the co-offender’s prospects of rehabilitation were favourable.
	
	
	The applicant was aged 36 at the time of the murder, and had a criminal history which included offences of violence. His health problems and the onerous nature of custody were features taken into account in his favour. Unlike the situation of Darrin Moulds, his Honour was not able to conclude that the applicant had favourable prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The different features of Mr Moulds’ circumstances distinguished his case from that of the applicant and, together with the reduction of sentence specifically reflecting assistance to the authorities, justifies the disparity.
	
	
	As was observed in Wong at 608 ([65]):
	


“To focus on the result of the sentencing task, to the exclusion of the reasons which support the result, is to depart from fundamental principles of equal justice. Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect.” (per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ, emphasis in original)


	
	The cases of the two men differed in relevant respects, leading to differing outcomes.
	
	
	Whilst the applicant referred in his submissions to his current willingness to provide information concerning “a known paedophile”, that was not evidence before the sentencing judge, and not something that could have ameliorated the sentence to be imposed.
	
	
	We would not grant leave to advance ground seven.
	


Ground Eight: “His Honour erred when he failed to consider my family situation”


	
	The applicant submitted that he should have received a specific allowance in the sentence imposed to reflect the hardship his incarceration was causing to his family. In support of this, the applicant brought to the attention of this Court a number of unfortunate matters relating to his children which we have carefully considered but do not detail here. Most of those issues have arisen since his incarceration, and were not matters the subject of evidence before the sentencing judge.
	
	
	A term of imprisonment will, unfortunately, always cause hardship to an offender’s family but, except in circumstances where that hardship is extreme, it is not ordinarily a relevant consideration on sentence. In R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510, at 515, Gleeson CJ said:
	


“There is nothing unusual about a situation in which the sentencing of an offender to a term of imprisonment would impose hardship upon some other person. Indeed, as senior counsel for the respondent acknowledged in argument, it may be taken that sending a person to prison will more often than not cause hardship, sometimes serious hardship, and sometimes extreme hardship, to another person. It requires no imagination to understand why this is so. Sentencing judges and magistrates are routinely obliged, in the course of their duties, to sentence offenders who may be breadwinners of families, carers, paid or unpaid, of the disabled, parents of children, protectors of persons who are weak or vulnerable, employers upon whom workers depend for their livelihood, and many others, in a variety of circumstances bound to result in hardship to third parties if such an offender is sentenced to a term of full-time imprisonment.”


	
	There was no evidence before the sentencing judge to suggest the applicant’s family would suffer any unusual or extreme hardship. Events that have taken place since sentence was imposed in 2013 cannot assist the applicant in demonstrating error by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	We would not grant leave to advance ground eight.
	


Ground Nine: “His Honour erred when he failed to consider my community volunteer work”


	
	The applicant referred in his written submissions to voluntary work that he had performed for a number of government and non-governmental agencies. He complains that the sentencing judge gave no consideration to this work, and thus fell into error. There was in fact no evidence before the sentencing judge in relation to voluntary work undertaken by the applicant. His Honour can hardly be in error for not taking into account a matter of which there was no evidence, and about which no submissions were made.
	
	
	This proposed ground of appeal cannot be made good.
	


Ground Ten: “His Honour erred when he failed to consider victim’s family working for Corrective Services”


	
	In his written submissions the applicant contends that, because members of the deceased’s family are employed by the Department of Corrective Services, he has been “targeted” in custody, making “things extremely difficult.”
	
	
	As with ground nine, the applicant did not tender any evidence to the sentencing judge to establish, either, that members of the deceased’s family were employed by the Department of Corrective Services, or, that that fact had an adverse effect on the conditions of his custody. His Honour cannot be in error for not taking into account a matter about which there was no evidence, and which he was not asked to consider.
	
	
	Even assuming that there was such evidence, the sentencing judge was not obliged to adjust the sentence imposed by reason of that matter alone. It is noted that his Honour adjusted the sentence favourably to the applicant to reflect the fact that the conditions of custody in which he was held were more onerous than those of the general prison population.
	
	
	We would not grant leave to argue this ground.
	


Ground Eleven: “His Honour erred when he failed to consider my assault while in gaol”


	
	The applicant submitted that he was assaulted in prison by “up to five inmates”, requiring hospitalisation, and leaving permanent scarring and ongoing headaches. He contends that the sentencing judge was in error in not considering this aspect of his case.
	
	
	There was limited, and no satisfactory evidence before the sentencing judge to establish that the applicant had been assaulted in custody with lasting consequences. In her report, Ms Panagiotopoulos recorded the applicant’s account to her of having been assaulted in custody two years previously by “an inmate” requiring hospitalisation. She noted that “he stated he was not told what the medical injuries amounted to”. The applicant pointed to what he said was a scar on his forehead, but Ms Panagiotopoulos was “unable to detect it”.
	
	
	Since the applicant told Ms Panagiotopoulos that he had sustained head injuries in other contexts, such as in an explosion and in two car accidents, it would be difficult, in any event, to attribute headaches and the like to an asserted assault.
	
	
	There was no confirmatory documentation or medical evidence before the sentencing judge about any assault on the applicant and, having regard to the unsatisfactory nature of the hearsay account recorded in the psychological report, the sentencing judge was entitled to give that aspect of the matter no weight.
	
	
	His Honour did take into account the applicant’s ill health, and the fact that he would serve his sentence in protective custody, making a specific allowance for that in the sentence he imposed. He could have done no more even had there been evidence of an assault in custody unconnected with this offence.
	
	
	We are not persuaded that there was any flaw in the sentencing judge’s reasoning in this respect, and would not grant leave to advance this ground.
	


Ground Twelve: “His Honour erred when he failed to consider my mental health problems”


	
	In his written submissions, the applicant asserted that he was suffering from bipolar disorder and depression and had not received appropriate treatment for his conditions in custody.
	
	
	There is nothing beyond the applicant’s assertion to establish that he in fact suffers from these disorders. The only evidence before the sentencing judge was contained within the psychological report, which noted:
	


“Mr Hoskins reports he has been diagnosed with a number of psychiatric disorders but was unable to recall when the diagnoses were made. He reported he was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorder “years ago”. In the last two weeks, he stated that he was also been [sic] diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder by a Psychiatrist in gaol, but again was unable to elaborate on this any further.”


	
	Ms Panagiotopoulos went on to refer to various medications that the applicant said he had been prescribed over the previous 10 to 12 years, and to a reported prescription for an anti-depressant in the fortnight before her consultation with him. The applicant had been unable to name the anti-depressant.
	
	
	The applicant did not give evidence on sentence and, for the reasons set out when considering ground one, the sentencing judge was not prepared to give weight to the applicant’s self-report to Ms Panagiotopoulos, unsupported by evidence.
	
	
	There could be no error in such an approach, since it is consistent with authority.
	
	
	Leave should not be granted to advance this ground.
	


Ground Thirteen: “His Honour erred when he failed to consider special circumstances”


	
	The applicant’s only submission addressing this ground was as follows:
	


“I feel I should have been given a shorter sentence with a longer court ordered parole period due to my circumstances.”


	
	A submission was made to the sentencing court that a finding of special circumstances should be made, but rejected by his Honour. At [39], his Honour said:
	


“Application is made to vary the formula for division of head sentence from that specified in the applicable statute by reason of special circumstances. I accept that health can operate as such but I am unpersuaded to make a special circumstances finding in this instance.”


	
	A finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is a discretionary matter for the sentencing judge. It is a finding in respect of which this Court will be slow to interfere: Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277, at [83].
	
	
	The fact that there are features of an offender’s circumstances which could establish a finding of special circumstances does not impose an obligation on the sentencing court to make such a finding: R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264, at [36]. An error in the exercise of that discretion must be shown. No such error was pointed to by the applicant here.
	
	
	For a finding of special circumstances to be made, there must be some particular utility in a period of parole longer than that which would flow from the ordinary operation of statute. It is difficult to see any utility in this instance other than a simple reduction in the non-parole period. Mere reduction in the period of the sentence to be served in custody is not a proper basis for a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	Whilst in addressing earlier grounds of his appeal, the applicant has pointed to the challenges he faces in custody, including in relation to his health and his concerns for his safety, he has not demonstrated that the sentencing judge erred in exercising his discretion to decline to make a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	Leave to advance this ground should not be granted.
	


Application for Leave to Appeal


	
	There are cases where a lengthy delay will not preclude an applicant from successfully bringing an application for leave to appeal on sentence. This is not one of those cases.
	
	
	The applicant’s then legal representatives had significant time in which to consider the merits of both his proposed conviction and sentence appeals. It is tolerably clear that those representatives made a deliberate forensic decision to abandon the applicant’s sentence appeal when they filed the second NIA.
	
	
	Given our conclusions about each of the grounds advanced here, that was a forensic decision well open to them. In these circumstances, the present application for leave to appeal should be refused.
	


Further Evidence Filed by the Crown


	
	At the hearing before this Court, the Crown read an affidavit of Miriam Rottenberg, a solicitor of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, dated 20 June 2015, on the basis that it was relevant if the Court proceeded to re-sentence the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant objected to the admission of that affidavit. Given that the admissibility of the affidavit only arises if the Court proceeded to resentence the applicant, the admissibility of the affidavit need not be determined. The affidavit is not admitted.
	


Orders


	
	The order of the Court is:
	



	
	Leave to appeal against sentence is refused.

2701203,Ngatamariki v R [2016] NSWCCA 155,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Bellew J.
	
	
	HALL J: I agree with the orders proposed by Bellew J.
	
	
	BELLEW J: On 21 May 2015 an indictment was presented against George Michael Ngatamariki (“the applicant”) in the District Court of NSW containing the following two counts:
	


“1. On or about 2 April 2014 at Ashford in the State of New South Wales caused grievous bodily harm to Deborah Lavender with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Deborah Lavender.

2. On or about 2 April 2014 at Ashford in the State of New South Wales did cause grievous bodily harm to Deborah Lavender and was reckless as to causing actual bodily harm to Deborah Lavender”.


	
	The applicant entered a plea of not guilty to the first count. His plea of guilty to the second (alternative) count was not accepted by the Crown in discharge of the indictment. Accordingly, the matter proceeded to trial before his Honour Judge Hanley SC and a jury. The jury subsequently returned a verdict of guilty in respect of count 1.
	
	
	The offence in count 1 was contrary to s. 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). It carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 7 years is prescribed.
	
	
	On 28 August 2015 the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment commencing on 2 April 2014 and expiring on 1 April 2017, with an additional term of imprisonment of 2 years commencing on 2 April 2017 and expiring 1 April 2019.
	
	
	The applicant now seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds:
	



	
	The sentencing judge erred by having regard to the applicant’s prior conviction in determining the objective seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	The sentence passed on the applicant is manifestly excessive.
	


THE FACTS


	
	In sentencing the applicant the sentencing judge found the facts to be as follows (ROS 3-8).
	
	
	The applicant, who was born in the Cook Islands and came to Australia as a child, was in a relationship with the victim at the time of the offending and resided with her and their two children. On 1 April 2014 the victim accompanied her children to a day care centre, following which she went to work. The applicant travelled with the victim and waited for her until they collected the children, and picked up some hay for their horse. The hay was not capable of fitting into their car and accordingly they asked a friend, John Palmer, for assistance. The victim took the applicant to Mr Palmer’s house and went home with the children. After a period of time, not having heard from the applicant, the victim became concerned and drove back to Mr Palmer’s house where she discovered the applicant drinking. The applicant said to her:
	


“I’m just having a few drinks”.


	
	The victim warned the applicant not to drink too much, and not to be too long in coming home.
	
	
	Later that night the victim heard the applicant yelling from outside of their house. She then saw him mumbling and staggering. He could not walk in a straight line and he appeared to her to be drunk. The victim locked the applicant out of the premises and telephoned her sister. She told the applicant that she was going to call the police and he immediately left.
	
	
	At about 9:30pm the victim’s cousin, Belinda Lavender, went to her mother’s home and saw the applicant there. She thought that he looked drunk and was unable to walk in a straight line. At that time the applicant shouted to Ms Lavender:
	


“She has called the police on me.”


	
	In an attempt to placate the applicant, Ms Lavender said:
	


“George, let’s go over there and see what’s going on.”


	
	Ms Lavender then drove the applicant to his home. Several times on the way, the applicant said:
	


“I’m going to kill her”.


	
	Ms Lavender did not regard these threats as serious.
	
	
	When they arrived at the applicant’s home (which, as previously noted, he shared with the victim) the victim told Ms Lavender that she did not want the applicant to be there. There followed a discussion about possible alternative places where the applicant could sleep. Eventually, Ms Lavender resolved to take the applicant to premises where a William Lavender, and his partner Sarah Krauss, lived. When they arrived at Mr Lavender’s premises the applicant fell over the front fence on the way up to the house. He appeared to be drunk but requested that Mr Lavender provide him with alcohol. That was refused.
	
	
	Mr Lavender sat with the applicant for some time in the course of which the applicant said:
	


“She locked me out, the fucking bitch. I’m going to kill her”.


	
	Mr Lavender formed the view that the applicant was well affected by alcohol. He apparently did not regard the applicant’s threats as serious. The applicant was left on a lounge and Mr Lavender went to bed. Sometime later Mr Lavender noticed that the front door of the premises was open and that the applicant had left.
	
	
	At around 12:30am the following morning the victim was woken by knocking on the door of her premises. She heard a voice say:
	


“It’s George”.


	
	The applicant was not yelling or screaming at that point and the victim decided to let him in. Having done so she told him to go to bed. Despite this, the applicant sat on the lounge and was mumbling:
	


“Why did you lock me out?”


	
	The victim noticed that the applicant did not appear to be as drunk as he had appeared to be on the previous evening.
	
	
	Having told the applicant to go to bed, the victim then noticed a light on at a computer in a room in the premises. She went into the room and found the applicant sitting at the computer. She again told him to go to bed. The applicant said that he wanted to go and see the children who were asleep at the time. The victim was not prepared to allow the applicant to do so as she was concerned that he would wake them.
	
	
	The victim’s refusal to allow the applicant to see the children was found by the sentencing judge to have been the catalyst for what followed. Although the victim’s memory of the incident was not clear, it was evident that she suffered a number of injuries which were consistent with admissions made by the applicant when later interviewed by police.
	
	
	Photographs tendered at the trial showed blood on the floor of the premises. The sentencing judge found that at some stage the applicant and the victim had ended up on the floor. The applicant was on top of the victim at one point. He had one hand around the victim’s throat. With his other hand, he punched her at least four times.
	
	
	Around this time two nearby campers, Lawrence and Julie Somerton, heard shouting and screaming coming from the victim’s house. They also heard a man yelling out:
	


“I’m going to kill you, you fucking cunt”.


	
	This was followed by what were described by the sentencing judge as “loud thudding noises”. Mr and Mrs Somerton called the police.
	
	
	The victim found herself unable to move. She thought that the applicant was going to kill her and she began to cry. She had little memory of what had occurred leading up to that point in time, a fact found by the sentencing judge to be unsurprising in light of the injuries that she sustained.
	
	
	The children then came out of the bedroom. This appeared to shock the applicant into some realisation of what had occurred. When he looked at the victim’s face the applicant said:
	


“Oh my God, you don’t look like you. Go and have a shower. You don’t look like you, I’m going to gaol.”


	
	The victim went to the bathroom and observed her injuries. Her face was significantly swollen. Photographs tendered at the trial showed swelling of such magnitude that it was virtually impossible to recognise the victim as the person who was depicted in them.
	
	
	As a result of (inter alia) the victim’s acknowledgement that she would not call the police, the applicant calmed down. The victim had in fact hidden her phone. She discreetly rang 000. The applicant, concerned about the gravity of what he had done and about the possibility that the police would intervene, was apparently reluctant to leave the victim alone. However he eventually agreed to allow her to call her sister. He apologised profusely saying:
	


“I love you. I don’t want to go to gaol. I’m so sorry.”


	
	Police and ambulance officers arrived, at which time the applicant was cautioned. When asked what had occurred, he responded:
	


“I was having a few drinks with mates, I came home and ended up having a fight with the missus”.


	
	The applicant was observed by police at that time to be unsteady on his feet and swaying. His eyes were bloodshot and glassy and he had blood on his left cheek.
	
	
	The victim was taken to hospital where she was examined. There was no issue at the trial as to the extent of her injuries. Firstly, she suffered a comminuted fracture of the front and side walls of the maxillary antrum, meaning that the wall of the sinus base behind her cheek bone was fragmented into several pieces on the front and side walls. Secondly, she suffered a fracture of the right frontozygomatic suture or in other words, a fracture at the junction of the cheekbone and the skull. Thirdly, she suffered an undisplaced fracture of the right zygomatic arch or in other words, a fracture through the cheek bone. Fourthly, she suffered an undisplaced fracture of the lateral wall of the right orbit, i.e. a fracture of the bony casing of the right eye on the outside or lateral side. Fifthly, she suffered a comminuted fracture of the floor of the right orbit, which meant that the bony casing at the bottom of the right eyeball was fractured or splintered in numerous places.
	
	
	The applicant participated in an interview with police. He asserted that he had consumed “four medium glasses of red wine” the night before. He said he had started drinking at 6:00pm and concluded at around 8:00pm. He agreed that he had beaten the victim with a clenched fist. When asked why he had done so, he told police that she had forced his anger and that he could not handle himself at the time, so he just punched her in the face.
	
	
	There were marks around the applicant’s eyes and mouth which were consistent with attempted self-defence on the part of the victim. According to the applicant, he had pushed the victim’s hands away and kept punching her. He acknowledged that he punched her about four times, and that each of the blows was to her face. He agreed that they had ended up on the floor, but claimed that the victim had been abusive towards him. He said that he knew when he punched her he would cause her injury. He acknowledged that the punches that he threw were hard, and were inflicted in anger.
	
	
	There was no issue at the trial that the injuries sustained to the victim constituted grievous bodily harm. There was also no issue that they had been sustained as a consequence of the applicant punching the victim. The sole issue was whether the applicant intended to cause the victim grievous bodily harm. That issue fell to be considered by the jury having regard to the degree of the applicant’s intoxication. It is evident from the verdict that the applicant’s case was rejected.
	


GROUND 1 – His Honour erred by having regard to the applicant’s prior conviction in determining the objective seriousness of the offence

The determination of the sentencing judge


	
	On 17 March 2011 the applicant appeared at the Inverell Local Court in respect of a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm which had occurred on 27 October 2010. That offending involved the same victim. He was convicted, fined $1000.00, and ordered to enter into a bond pursuant to s. 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Sentencing Act”) for a period of 2 years. There were a number of conditions attaching to that bond, including that the applicant not consume alcohol or illicit drugs, and that he not enter any licensed premises within NSW.
	
	
	The applicant’s criminal history detailing that offence was before the sentencing judge who (commencing at ROS 9) turned to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending. He said:
	


“In respect of this case, the matters that I consider are appropriate in determining the seriousness of the offence is firstly the relationship between the parties; they were in a domestic relationship. It is clear that there had been at least on one prior occasion a violent assault upon the victim by the accused. Whilst that had only resulted in actual bodily harm to her, it was sufficient for him to be charged and subjected to supervision by way of a bond. It is also significant in the context of the circumstances leading up to this offence that on that occasion alcohol had been involved.”


	
	Having made reference to a number of other factors, the sentencing judge concluded (at ROS 10) that the applicant’s offending fell “just below the mid-range of objective seriousness”. He then made a number of observations about the applicant’s moral culpability before returning to consider aggravating factors. At that point he said (at ROS 13):
	


“As I have already mentioned the offender has a prior conviction for domestic violence towards the same victim. That is a fact I will take into account as something that diminishes his entitlement to leniency and indicates a sentence should include a greater element of specific deterrence.

In relation to that prior conviction I note it was in 2010 and he was supervised on a two-year s 9 good behaviour bond. There was a case plan that focused on addressing his alcohol abuse and the violent aspect of the offence. He completed an anger management program and alcohol and other drug counselling.”

Submissions of the applicant


	
	Counsel for the applicant accepted that in light of the provisions of s. 21A(1)(d) of the Sentencing Act it was appropriate for the sentencing judge to have regard to the applicant’s prior conviction as an aggravating factor in the terms in which he stated in the passage set out at [39] above.
	
	
	However, it was submitted that when the sentencing remarks were read as a whole, and having regard to the terms of the passage set out at [38] above, it was clear that the sentencing judge had also taken into account the applicant’s previous conviction when assessing the objective seriousness of the offending. It was submitted that by approaching the matter in that way, the sentencing judge had acted contrary to the requirement that punishment must be proportional to the offence.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the reference by the sentencing judge to the earlier offence in the passage set out at [38] above should be construed as a reference to part of the context in which the present offence occurred, namely an offence committed within a relationship marred by domestic violence including violence that had earlier been prosecuted.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that on a fair reading of the sentencing remarks as a whole there could be no suggestion that the sentencing judge had used the fact of the applicant’s previous conviction to improperly aggravate the objective gravity of the offence.
	


Consideration


	
	The principle of proportionality requires that the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence be set by the objective circumstances of the offence: Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465; Baumer v R [1988] HCA 67; (1988) 166 CLR 51. Those objective circumstances do not encompass an offender’s prior convictions: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [24] per Spigelman CJ; at [81] per Barr and Bell JJ.
	
	
	True it is that his Honour’s reference to the applicant’s prior conviction in the passage set out in [38] above was made following a reference to determining the seriousness of the offending. However, when the remarks are read as a whole, it is apparent that his Honour was doing no more than taking into account the domestic relationship which existed between the applicant and the victim as a factor which was relevant to determining the objective seriousness of the offending. That was both unremarkable and entirely appropriate. It was in that specific context that his Honour made reference to the applicant’s previous conviction. Viewed in that way, it is apparent that his Honour did not err by using the applicant’s prior conviction as a factor which aggravated the seriousness of his offending.
	
	
	I am fortified in that view by the terms of what his Honour said in the passage set out at [39] above where it was made plain that the applicant’s prior conviction was a factor which would be taken into account as something that diminished the applicant’s entitlement to leniency, thus justifying greater weight being afforded to specific deterrence. Nothing said by his Honour in the passage set out at [39] suggests, even remotely, that the applicant’s prior conviction had already been taken into account in some way. Indeed, the express language used by his Honour was very much to the contrary.
	
	
	For these reasons, ground 1 is not made out.
	


GROUND 2 – The sentence passed on the applicant is manifestly excessive


	
	The written submissions filed on behalf of the applicant were prepared by counsel who did not ultimately appear before this Court on the hearing of the appeal. However, counsel who did appear expressly adopted them. Those submissions contended that this Court should “consider sentences for offences against s. 33(1)(a) for comparative purposes in the applicant’s case.” The submissions proceeded to make reference to the sentences imposed in a series of other cases. It was submitted that in view of those sentences, and having regard to a number of other factors, this Court would conclude that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The additional factors upon which reliance was placed were that:
	



	
	the offence was found by the sentencing judge to be below the mid-range of objective seriousness;
	
	
	the offence was not planned;
	
	
	although the applicant had punched the victim on multiple occasions, the assault was not a sustained or pre-meditated attack;
	
	
	although the injuries sustained by the victim were serious, the offending was not within the worst possible category and did not result in any permanent injury;
	
	
	the offending did not involve the use of a weapon;
	
	
	the applicant had expressed genuine remorse; and
	
	
	the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation.
	



	
	Counsel appearing before this Court expanded upon those various factors in oral argument. In doing so, she submitted that the applicant was a person of limited cognitive functioning and that his offending should be assessed in that light. In that regard, counsel relied, in particular, on the contents of a psychological report which was before the sentencing judge which, under the heading “Assessment”, stated (inter alia) the following:
	


“The results of the WRAT/4 indicated that Mr Ngatamariki’s reading abilities were in the Average Range. Mr Ngatamariki’s results varied between scales. His reading and spelling fell within the average range. However, comprehension and maths fell within the low average range. During test administration, it was observed that Mr Ngatamariki had significant difficulty with comprehension tasks. He demonstrated patience with each item and appeared to give his best effort, however he was unable to complete the tasks to the same level as reading and spelling. Given the variation in the scales, a WASI-II was administered.”


	
	The reference to the “WASI-II” was a reference to the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (Second Edition) which is a standardised and abbreviated measure of intellectual functioning. The results of that testing were reported as follows:
	


“Results indicated that Mr Ngatamariki’s general level of intellectual functioning was in the Borderline Range. These results indicate that approximately 93% of the general population is functioning at a higher level than Mr Ngatamariki.”


	
	The report concluded (inter alia):
	


“Although Mr Ngatamariki’s overall cognitive functioning falls in the Borderline Range, his verbal comprehension skills are significantly low. This may be particularly relevant to his interpersonal relationships where Mr Ngatamariki may demonstrate some difficulty verbalising and comprehending various issues.”


	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that this evidence placed the applicant’s offending in a particular category. It was submitted that in light of the conclusions expressed in the report, the applicant’s conduct was to be viewed as the product of “his frustration at his inability to negotiate conflict situations due to his inherent cognitive difficulties”. Counsel submitted that it was necessary to have particular regard to these matters, so as to ensure that individualised justice, appropriate to the circumstances of the appellant’s circumstances, was imposed: R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302; (2006) 164 A Crim R 179 at [88] per Johnson J (Hunt AJA and Latham J agreeing).
	
	
	Finally, it was submitted that although the applicant had a record for not dissimilar offending, he was not to be regarded as a “repeat offender” for the purposes of sentence.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the applicant’s reliance, in the written submissions, upon sentences imposed in other cases reflected an incorrect approach and, in any event, was of no utility. The Crown pointed out that offending of this nature necessarily covers a broad range of circumstances and that in determining an appropriate sentence, it had been necessary for the sentencing judge to take into account all of the circumstances including:
	



	
	the degree of violence;
	
	
	the ferocity of the attack;
	
	
	the apparent lack of any provocation; and
	
	
	the relationship between the offender and the victim.
	



	
	The Crown submitted that the cases upon which the applicant sought to rely for comparative purposes demonstrated the wide range of offending in matters of this nature. It was further submitted that reference to those cases demonstrated the presence of various distinguishing factors. It was submitted that in those circumstances, the sentences imposed in those cases did not support a conclusion that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The Crown also pointed to the considerable violence involved in the applicant’s assault. It was submitted that deterrence, both general and specific, were important factors, as was the protection of the community. In a more general sense, it was submitted that recognition of the harm done to the victim and the community as a result of offences of domestic violence was important.
	
	
	In terms of the applicant’s reliance upon the psychological report, the Crown emphasised that following the passages upon which counsel for the applicant had relied, the following appeared:
	


‘It should be noted that English is Mr Ngatamariki’s second language. Consequently, the results from this cognitive assessment must be interpreted with caution”.


	
	The Crown submitted that in these circumstances, the report did not support the submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant regarding his cognitive functioning.
	
	
	Ultimately, the Crown submitted that when consideration was given to the multiple objectives of sentencing, and the absence of a strong subjective case, the sentence was not manifestly excessive. This, it was submitted, was particularly so when the sentence was considered by reference to the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period which had been prescribed by the Parliament.
	


Consideration


	
	The written submissions filed on behalf of the applicant effectively invited this Court to engage in an exercise comparing sentences imposed on other cases with that imposed on the applicant. In support of that approach, the written submissions cited the observations of Fagan J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Adams J agreed) in Newman v R [2015] NSWCCA 270 where his Honour said (at [19]):
	


“The circumstances which give rise to the offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm vary widely and the range of culpability for the offence is vast. Whilst recognising that sentences passed in other more or less comparable cases cannot be treated as confining the sentencing discretion within boundaries different from those laid down by Parliament (Hili v The Queen (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [54]), some consideration of sentences imposed on other occasions is essential if consistency is to be achieved.”


	
	His Honour’s observation should not, in my view, be interpreted as an endorsement of the course that the written submissions urged this Court to follow. What his Honour said in the passage extracted above must be read in the context of what he said immediately thereafter (at [20]-[24]):
	


“[20] In order to take into account, at all, a sentence passed upon a different offender for an offence against the same section but arising out of unrelated circumstances, regard must be had to all of the factors which the sentencing court had before it on that other occasion. That is, the objective circumstances of the commission of the offence, whether sentence was passed following a plea of guilty or after a trial, the antecedents and personal attributes of the offender, whether a standard non-parole period was applicable and so on. In Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [59], Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ held:

“[59] Similarly, recording what sentences have been imposed in other cases is useful if, but only if, it is accompanied by an articulation of what are to be seen as the unifying principles which those disparate sentences may reveal. The production of bare statistics about sentences that have been passed tells the judge who is about to pass a sentence on an offender very little that is useful if the sentencing judge is not also told why those sentences were fixed as they were.” (Emphasis in original).

[21] That passage has equal application when this Court is considering whether a sentence passed at first instance was manifestly excessive. Wong v The Queen (supra) was concerned with sentencing for offences against Commonwealth laws but the passage quoted is concerned with sentencing principles generally and is not founded upon anything peculiar to Commonwealth criminal law.

[22] Also in Wong v The Queen (supra) Gleeson CJ said:

“[6] … All discretionary decision making carries with it the probability of some degree of inconsistency. But there are limits beyond which such inconsistency itself constitutes a form of injustice. The outcome of discretionary decision-making can never be uniform, but it ought to depend as little as possible upon the identity of the judge who happens to hear the case. Like cases should be treated in like manner. The administration of criminal justice works as a system; not merely as a multiplicity of unconnected single instances. It should be systematically fair, and that involves, amongst other things, reasonable consistency.”

[23] The requirement of reasonable consistency, to be sought by consideration of all features of comparable cases, was reiterated in Hili v The Queen (supra), in the judgment of the plurality. After quoting the above passage from the judgment of Gleeson CJ their Honours said:

“[53] Next, in seeking consistency, sentencing judges must have regard to what has been done in other cases. … Care must be taken, however, in using what has been done in other cases.

[54] In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 at [303]-[305], Simpson J accurately identified the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. As her Honour said: ‘Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts’. But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix ‘the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence’. Past sentences ‘are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence’. When considering past sentences, ‘it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that 'unifying principles' may be discerned’.”

[24] These principles were reiterated in Green v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 462, a case concerning sentencing under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). At [28] and [29] French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ referred to both Wong v The Queen (supra) and Hili v The Queen (supra) in support of the requirements of “systematic fairness” and “reasonable consistency” in sentencing, applying “to persons charged with similar offences arising out of unrelated events” as well as to the punishment of co-offenders under the parity principle.


	
	In Barbaro v R; Zirilli v R [2014] HCA 2; (2014) 253 CLR 58 the plurality (French CJ, Hayne, Kiefel and Bell JJ) stated (at [40]-[41]):
	


[40] The setting of bounds to the available range of sentences in a particular case must, however, be distinguished from the proper and ordinary use of sentencing statistics and other material indicating what sentences have been imposed in other (more or less) comparable cases. Consistency of sentencing is important. But the consistency that is sought is consistency in the application of relevant legal principles, not numerical equivalence.

[41] As the plurality pointed out in Hili, in seeking consistency sentencing judges must have regard to what has been done in other cases. Those other cases may well establish a range of sentences which have been imposed. But that history does not establish that the sentences which have been imposed mark the outer bounds of the permissible discretion. The history stands as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence. What is important is the unifying principles which those sentences both reveal and reflect. And as each of Buchanan JA and Kellam JA rightly observed in MacNeil-Brown, the synthesis of the “raw material” which must be considered on sentencing, including material like sentencing statistics and information about the sentences imposed in comparable cases, is the task of the sentencing judge, not counsel.


	
	These principles have been consistently applied in this Court: MLP v R [2014] NSWCCA 183 at [41]-[44]; Briouzguine v R [2014] NSWCCA 264 at [76].
	
	
	Even accepting the proposition that consideration of sentences imposed on other occasions is essential if consistency is to be achieved, the written submissions of the applicant did not approach the matter on that basis. Rather, they sought to establish, essentially by reliance upon the sentences imposed in the cases cited, that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive. In other words, the reliance on those cases was really based upon a suggested need to achieve numerical equivalence of the kind to which their Honours referred in Barbaro (supra). That reflects an incorrect approach. Moreover, and unsurprisingly, those cases expose, to varying degrees, fundamental differences in the circumstances of the offending, and/or the circumstances of the offender, when compared to the present case.
	
	
	Bearing in mind that what is sought is consistency in the application of relevant legal principles, as opposed to numerical equivalence, the applicant’s reliance on those cases does not demonstrate that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. Nothing in terms of the outcome of any of those cases suggests, in any way, that the sentencing judge in the present case applied relevant sentencing principles in a way which was not consistent with some established sentencing pattern.
	
	
	The sentencing judge considered the various subjective factors relied upon by the applicant. Having done so, he found that:
	



	
	the offending was not planned;
	
	
	the applicant was remorseful;
	
	
	his admissions at the trial were of utilitarian benefit to the community as a consequence of the fact that the trial was shortened and there was an alleviation of the necessity to call expert medical evidence; and
	
	
	he had good prospects for not reoffending and for succeeding in his rehabilitation.
	



	
	No complaint is made about any of those findings and it is not suggested that the sentencing judge overlooked, or gave insufficient weight to, any aspect of the applicant’s subjective case.
	
	
	I am unable to accept the submissions advanced by counsel based upon the psychological report which was before the sentencing judge. As the Crown pointed out, the conclusions expressed in that report were subject to an important qualification.
	
	
	I am also unable to accept counsel’s submission that the applicant’s offending should be viewed as a manifestation of his “inability to negotiate conflict situations”. Leaving aside the fact that such a submission was based upon the qualified conclusion expressed in the report, the sentencing judge found that the catalyst for the applicant’s attack was the victim’s indication that she did not wish the applicant to disturb the children. The sentencing judge did not find that any conflict whatsoever emanated from the victim. Whilst a “conflict situation” certainly arose thereafter, it was one created by the applicant himself. In other words, the applicant was the instigator of the conflict, not the respondent to it.
	
	
	The applicant’s offending was extremely serious. He was responsible for a brutal and violent attack perpetrated upon an innocent, and largely defenceless, victim. The ferocity of the applicant’s attack is best gauged by the fact that the victim suffered no less than five separate facial fractures. Any sentence required a strong measure of general deterrence. Personal deterrence was also a relevant consideration in light of the applicant’s previous conviction. Further, the applicant’s subjective circumstances, which were generally unremarkable, were clearly taken into account by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	The sentencing judge also properly took into account the fact that the offending took place in the context of a domestic relationship. In Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; (2013) 249 CLR 600 the majority (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell, Gageler and Keane JJ) observed (at [55]):
	


[55] … A just sentence must accord due recognition to the human dignity of the victim of domestic violence and the legitimate interest of the general community in the denunciation and punishment of a brutal, alcohol-fuelled destruction of a woman by her partner. A failure on the part of the state to mete out a just punishment of violent offending may be seen as a failure by the state to vindicate the human dignity of the victim; and to impose a lesser punishment by reason of the identity of the victim is to create a group of second-class citizens, a state of affairs entirely at odds with the fundamental idea of equality before the law.


	
	Even though the offending in that case was different to (and more serious than) that of the applicant, the Court’s reference to the denunciation of, and punishment for, “brutal” and “alcohol-fuelled” conduct is particularly apt in a case such as the present.
	
	
	Even accepting that the section under which the applicant was charged covers a range of offending, the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period provide important guide posts to the determination of an appropriate sentence. It is not without significance that the head sentence imposed upon the applicant is two years less than the standard non-parole period prescribed for the offence. That is not, in any way, determinative. However, it is a factor which tends against the proposition that the sentence is manifestly excessive. This is particularly so in circumstances where the applicant went to trial, and where his offending was aggravated by not dissimilar behaviour, towards the same victim, on a previous occasion.
	
	
	In order to make out a complaint of manifest excess, the applicant must demonstrate that the sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321; Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357. For the reasons I have given, none of the submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant establish that the sentence imposed falls into such a category. Indeed, for my part, having regard to all of the circumstances, the sentence is one that might be regarded as modest.
	
	
	For all of these reasons this ground is not made out.
	


ORDERS


	
	For the reasons expressed I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is dismissed.

2701209,Clark v Robards [2016] NSWCA 187,"judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: It is now more than 14 years since 2002 when the applicant, Peter Frederick Clark, commenced the first proceedings seeking damages from the State with respect to his arrest and prosecution on three sets of charges. In 2005 separate proceedings were commenced against two individual respondents, and the State, alleging numerous instances of unlawful conduct.
	
	
	These proceedings have had a long and tortuous history, which is recounted by Emmett AJA, with whose reasons I agree. On 17 June 2014 Hidden J made an order dismissing the 2005 proceedings. [1]  With respect to the 2002 proceedings he extended the time granted by the Court of Appeal for repleading the claims from the original date of 22 May 2012, to 30 June 2014.
	
	
	Mr Clark sought leave to appeal from the orders of Hidden J. On 22 May 2015 this Court granted leave, limited to the causes of action (other than a conspiracy charge) found in the 2005 pleading, in the form considered by Harrison J in June 2010. [2]  The summons seeking leave was otherwise dismissed.
	
	
	The reason for the form of the order granting leave was that the pleading before Hidden J was a composite document. [3]  The first tranche (pars 1-26) dealt with claims in trespass and conspiracy against the first individual defendant. A second tranche (pars 27-33) involved a claim in trespass against the second individual defendant. In substance, those allegations were to be found in the 2005 pleading. The Court noted that a conspiracy charge (par 10) was properly struck out and excluded that matter from the grant of leave to appeal. The Court also excluded a third tranche (pars 37-54) which reflected claims made in the 2002 pleading.
	
	
	A fourth tranche (pars 55-71) alleged a conspiracy by identified police officers to have the applicant charged with a number of offences, of which he had been convicted, but in respect of which the convictions were set aside in part. These too had appeared in the 2005 proceeding, though specified as “trespass”. Finally, a fifth tranche (pars 72-118) identified a number of incidents of “trespass”, each involving a step from the arrest to the prosecution and conviction of the applicant on various further charges, the events having taken place between 30 June 2006 and 18 May 2009. Part only of these had been included in the pleading before Harrison J, with respect to which leave had been granted to replead.
	
	
	The new claims included a claim in respect of an attack on the applicant by a fellow inmate on 14 November 2007. The claim was brought in negligence alleging that the State had failed to protect the applicant from the attacker. Although the applicant was at large from June 2008 until April 2009, it appeared that the new claim fell within the scope of s 4 of the Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act 1981 (NSW), as having been commenced whilst the applicant was in custody, with the result that it was unsustainable in the absence of leave, which had not been obtained. That part of the pleading also fell outside the grant of leave to appeal.
	
	
	Leave to appeal was granted only with respect to so much of the pleading as had been the subject of the grant of leave to amend by Harrison J in 2010, for two reasons. Thus, to the extent that the events the subject of the 2000 proceedings were, with one apparent exception, later in time than those dealt with in the 2002 proceedings, there appeared to be an anomaly in striking out the 2005 proceedings, but allowing more time for repleading of the 2002 proceedings. With respect to delay, there was also a possible anomaly in allowing that the delay in resolving an appeal from a judgment of Johnson J from 2006 until May 2012 provided some justification for the lapse of time in respect of the earlier proceedings, but not the 2005 proceedings.
	
	
	A detailed consideration of the procedural history, as set out by Emmett AJA, provides a sufficient explanation of the apparent anomalies. It lies in the very long delay from 30 June 2006, when Johnson J ordered that the 2002 proceedings be summarily dismissed, until May 2012 when this Court upheld, in part, Mr Clark’s appeal. The disparity in treatment was explicable on the basis that the 2005 proceedings remained on foot throughout that period, although the criminal proceedings which gave rise to much of the delay were not accepted as a full answer to the failure to advance the 2005 proceedings.
	
	
	The second basis on which leave was granted was the fact that, although some of the causes of action either had no substance or were pleaded in a manner which did not allow an assessment of their merit, that was not so in respect of all. Accordingly, the Court was concerned that an analysis of particular claims might have warranted some remaining on foot, whilst others were struck out, as had occurred before Harrison J with respect to the defamation claim and the conspiracy claim.
	
	
	The submissions on appeal, however, took these matters no further than the material which had been before the Court on the leave application, much of which had also been before Hidden J. By way of example, several claims alleged trespass, namely the arrest of the applicant, when he was charged with a number of offences which were later dismissed without evidence having been proffered. He said in each case that “the cause of action is clearly defined and covers all the elements of the tort [of] malicious prosecution”. However, neither of those statements was correct. In any event, the most recent causes of action arose in 2007 and many were over a decade old. No evidence was proffered which, if accepted, would be sufficient to support a claim for damages in tort, let alone significant damages.
	
	
	Accordingly, although the Court should properly be wary of dismissing claims against the State, brought by a person who is held by the State in custody in circumstances which inevitably impede the ability to plead and prove a claim, the dismissal of the present claims does not raise concern that there might be a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	For these reasons, the matters which gave rise to the grant of leave to appeal have not been shown to support any finding of error in the result. Accordingly the appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	SIMPSON JA: I agree with Emmett AJA.
	
	
	EMMETT AJA: This appeal is concerned with the summary dismissal for want of due despatch of proceedings brought in the Common Law Division by Mr Peter Clark (the 2005 Proceedings). The Statement of Claim that commenced the 2005 Proceedings, which was filed on 14 June 2005, named five defendants, being Timothy Robards, Terrence Robards, the State of New South Wales (the State), Detective Senior Constable Jeffrey Bryan and Registrar Douglas Wright. On 13 January 2009, Mr Clark filed a Further Amended Statement of Claim that removed Detective Senior Constable Bryan and Registrar Wright but purported to add three new defendants. In the events that occurred, the three additional defendants did not become parties and the 2005 Proceedings, for present purposes, can be taken to have been continued on the basis that the only defendants are Timothy Robards, Terrence Robards and the State.
	
	
	The 2005 Proceedings involved claims against Terrence Robards and Timothy Robards of conspiracy and intimidation, and against the State of false arrest, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution, negligence in the administration of medication while in custody, negligence in failing to protect him from assault while in custody and negligence in failing to provide him with adequate access to computer facilities while in custody. The State was sued in several guises under the Crown Proceedings Act 1988 (NSW), relying upon the conduct of New South Wales police officers, Justice Health, the Department of Justice and the Department of Corrective Services, for which the State was said to be liable under the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983 (NSW).
	
	
	In another set of proceedings, commenced by the Statement of Claim filed on 21 May 2002 (the 2002 Proceedings), Mr Clark made other claims against the State of false arrest, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution in 1997 and 2000. On 30 June 2006, after a hearing in August 2005, Johnson J ordered that the 2002 Proceedings be dismissed summarily as an abuse of process. Mr Clark appealed to this Court from that order. The appeal from the orders of Johnson J was first listed for hearing in June 2011 but the fixture was vacated pending the disposition of criminal proceedings against Mr Clark and the appeal was heard in April 2012. Judgment was given on 22 May 2012, when the Court set aside the orders made by Johnson J and directed Mr Clark to file a Further Statement of Claim within 3 months. [4] 
	
	
	On 17 June 2014, Hidden J (the primary judge) ordered that the 2005 Proceedings be dismissed. [5]  At the same time as the primary judge heard the application for summary dismissal of the 2005 Proceedings, his Honour also heard an application for summary dismissal of the 2002 Proceedings for want of due despatch. His Honour declined to dismiss the 2002 Proceedings but, on 17 June 2014, ordered that the time for compliance with this Court’s direction of 22 May 2012 be extended to 30 June 2014. That matter has a bearing on the dismissal of the 2005 Proceedings, as will become apparent.
	
	
	In order to put the questions raised by the appeal in context, it is necessary to describe in some detail the progress of the 2005 Proceedings, as well as the 2002 Proceedings. That will include the manner in which Johnson J dealt with the earlier application by the State for summary dismissal of the 2002 Proceedings and the manner in which Harrison J dealt with an earlier application for summary dismissal of the 2005 Proceedings.
	
	
	It is relevant, as will appear below, that Mr Clark is presently in custody at Goulburn Correctional Centre, having been convicted of a number of offences after trial in the District Court. In separate proceedings in the Common Law Division, Mr Clark sought judicial review in respect of decisions made concerning the conditions of his custody (the Conditions of Custody Proceedings). The Conditions of Custody Proceedings were dismissed [6]  and an Application for Leave to Appeal from that dismissal was heard immediately following this appeal.
	


Progress of the 2002 Proceedings and the 2005 Proceedings


	
	The 2002 Proceedings were commenced by Statement of Claim filed on 21 May 2002. On 23 and 24 August 2005, Johnson J heard a Notice of Motion brought by the State in the 2002 Proceedings, whereby the State sought orders that the 2002 Proceedings be stayed or be dismissed. On 30 June 2006, for reasons published on that day, Johnson J ordered that the Further Amended Statement of Claim in the 2002 Proceedings be dismissed and that Mr Clark pay the State’s costs of the application. [7]  Mr Clark sought leave to appeal from those orders. For various reasons, the Application for Leave to Appeal was not heard until 27 April 2012.
	
	
	On 22 May 2012, for the reasons given on that day, this Court granted leave to appeal from the orders of Johnson J, and allowed the appeal in part. The Court set aside the orders made by Johnson J and, in lieu thereof, ordered that the State’s Notice of Motion be allowed to the extent that certain paragraphs of the Further Amended Statement of Claim in the 2002 Proceedings that had been filed on 22 April 2004 be struck out. The Court directed Mr Clark to file, within three months, a Second Amended Statement of Claim removing any reference to the persons or causes of action pleaded in the paragraphs that were struck out.
	
	
	The 2005 Proceedings were commenced by Statement of Claim filed on 14 June 2005. On 28 September 2005, Terrence Robards filed a Notice of Motion seeking, relevantly, an order that the Statement of Claim be struck out as an abuse of process or alternatively that the 2005 Proceedings be stayed and that Mr Clark be declared a vexatious litigant. On the same day, Mr Clark filed a Notice of Motion seeking that the 2005 Proceedings be temporarily stayed. By consent, the 2005 Proceedings were stood over to 14 December 2005.
	
	
	On 7 December 2005, Terrence Robards filed another Notice of Motion seeking an order that the Statement of Claim in the 2005 Proceedings be struck out as an abuse of process. It is not apparent what happened to the Notice of Motion filed on 28 September 2005. On 14 December 2005, the 2005 Proceedings were stood over by consent to 6 February 2006.
	
	
	On 6 February 2006, Mr Clark’s Notice of Motion of 28 September 2005 and Terrence Robard’s Notice of Motion of 7 December 2005 came before McClellan CJ at CL. Terrence Robard’s Notice of Motion was not dealt with. The 2005 Proceedings were adjourned, with all orders requiring action to be taken by reference to time limits being stayed until 31 May 2006, when the State consented to an adjournment to 30 June 2006. On that day, all defendants consented to an adjournment to 1 December 2006 because Mr Clark was facing criminal charges, which were to be heard in September and November 2006.
	
	
	On 24 October 2006, Mr Clark requested a further adjournment of the 2005 Proceedings because his criminal trial had been fixed for 27 November 2006. On 24 November 2006, the Crown Solicitors Office (the CSO) wrote to Mr Clark consenting to an adjournment and noting defects in his Statement of Claim. On 27 November 2006, Mr Clark requested that the 2005 Proceedings be adjourned to 2007.
	
	
	On 12 December 2006, Mr Clark entered into custody again. On 4 January 2007, he wrote to the CSO indicating that he had been convicted on various charges in the District Court and that he intended to seek leave to appeal. He requested a further adjournment of the 2005 Proceedings. On 29 January 2007, the CSO informed Mr Clark that the State would consent to a four week adjournment on 2 February 2007 but would indicate to the Court that, on the next Court date, Mr Clark should inform the Court of his intention in relation to the matter. The CSO said that, if the matter was to proceed, a timetable should be set down.
	
	
	On 2 February 2007, counsel for the State mentioned the matter on behalf of all parties and sought an adjournment for a further two months to allow Mr Clark to consider his position. Counsel for the State told the Court that Mr Clark would be informed that he ought to be in a position on the next occasion to indicate what was to happen to the 2005 proceedings. A status conference was fixed for 5 April 2007.
	
	
	On 8 February 2007, Mr Clark requested that the State consent to the 2005 Proceedings being adjourned until his Application for Leave to Appeal in his criminal matter had been heard. On 5 March 2007, Mr Clark was informed that the State would not consent to a further adjournment. On 29 March 2007, the CSO requested Mr Clark to indicate his position for the proposed status conference on 5 April 2007.
	
	
	Mr Clark did not appear at the status conference on 5 April 2007. Timothy Robards and Terrence Robards also did not appear. Counsel for the State indicated that there had been no response from Mr Clark as to his position and a timetable was sought for the defendants to file a Notice of Motion for dismissal for want of due despatch pursuant to r 12.7 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (UCPR). The 2005 Proceedings were listed for directions on 26 April 2007.
	
	
	On 14 April 2007, Mr Clark informed the CSO that he may not be able to appear on 26 April 2007 and would seek a temporary stay, pending his release from custody. However, on 26 April 2007 Mr Clark appeared in person. The State proposed that the 2005 Proceedings be adjourned to 27 July 2007 and that, by 16 July 2007, Mr Clark either confirm his intention to seek a stay or serve an Amended Statement of Claim remedying the pleading defects identified in the letter from the CSO of 24 November 2006. The 2005 Proceedings were stood over until 27 July 2007 and Mr Clark was directed to file any evidence in support of an Application for Stay by 16 July 2007 or file an Amended Statement of Claim by that date. The Court noted the intimation that the State would approach the Department of Corrective Services concerning Mr Clark’s access to his papers and a computer.
	
	
	On 21 May 2007, Mr Clark filed a Notice of Motion in the Court of Criminal Appeal, seeking orders for 24 hour computer access and the provision of a printer. He also asked that the sentence imposed on 9 February 2007 be stayed. The Notice of Motion was not served on the State but came to the attention of the State when the court file was inspected. On 19 June 2007, at a status conference, Mr Clark requested that his Notice of Motion be referred to the duty judge for hearing. The Court ordered him to file and serve any affidavit evidence in support of his Notice of Motion no later than 27 July 2007. The listing on 27 July 2007 was vacated and the 2005 Proceedings were listed for directions on 17 August 2007.
	
	
	On 30 July 2007, the CSO received a letter from Mr Clark saying that he no longer required directions regarding computer access and requested that the fixture for 17 August 2007 be vacated and the proceedings be adjourned for a minimum of two weeks after his appeal hearing. Mr Clark also said that, if his appeal process is unsuccessful he would withdraw his Statement of Claim in the 2005 Proceedings. The CSO responded on 6 August 2007, saying that the State would not consent to an adjournment and informing Mr Clark that the Court of Criminal Appeal had advised that the documents provided by him did not constitute a Notice of Appeal. The State asserted that it was prejudiced by the continual delay and proposed that orders be made for the filing and serving of an Amended Statement of Claim and further and better particulars on the next hearing date.
	
	
	On 17 August 2007, orders were made by consent that Mr Clark file an Amended Statement of Claim by 24 August 2007, the State request further and better particulars by 14 September 2007 and Mr Clark provide the particulars by 12 October 2007. The matter was stood over for a status conference on 19 October 2007.
	
	
	On 24 August 2007, Mr Clark provided a proposed Amended Statement of Claim to the CSO. On 28 August 2007, Mr Clark wrote again to the CSO acknowledging that errors had been made in the proposed Amended Statement of Claim. He also said that it was his belief that the appeal would succeed and that he would be acquitted. He said that those matters would be added later in a Further Amended Statement of Claim. The CSO wrote to Mr Clark on 6 September 2007 saying that the State did not consent to the filing of the proposed Amended Statement of Claim. The CSO said that a letter would be sent to Mr Clark setting out the defects in the pleading. On 13 September 2007, the CSO wrote to Mr Clark addressing at length the deficiencies said to be contained in the proposed Amended Statement of Claim. The letter requested Mr Clark to indicate within 14 days whether he would amend the pleading or whether he intended to file a Notice of Motion seeking leave to file the Amended Statement of Claim.
	
	
	At the status conference on 19 October 2007, Mr Clark filed a Notice of Motion seeking orders for the provision of computer facilities. Hidden J dismissed the motion and referred the matter back to the Registrar with a recommendation that the Department of Corrective Services provide computer facilities to Mr Clark. The status conference continued before the Registrar, when Mr Clark said that he was unable to amend the Statement of Claim because of lack of access to a computer as he was sharing a cell with a “granny killer”. The Registrar ordered Mr Clark to file and serve a motion seeking a stay supported by affidavit evidence by 16 November 2007 or, in the alternative, provide a reply to the CSO’s letter of 13 September 2007 by that date. Mr Clark’s motion was to be made returnable on 6 December 2007.
	
	
	On 26 October 2007, the CSO wrote to the Superintendent of Long Bay Correctional Centre recommending that Mr Clark be provided with access to a computer. However, on 14 November 2007, Mr Clark suffered serious injury when he was assaulted in prison with a fire hose. It appears that he continues to suffer continuing incapacity as a result of the injury he suffered in the assault.
	
	
	At the status conference on 6 December 2007, Mr Clark provided a Notice of Motion seeking a temporary stay pending recovery from the injuries he suffered in the assault on 14 November 2007. He also sought an order that the State secure a copy of the security video of the assault. The Court directed that Timothy Robards and Terrence Robards be served with the Notice of Motion and directions were given for the filing of evidence. The matter was fixed for hearing on 24 April 2008.
	
	
	On 25 March 2008, the CSO received a letter from Mr Clark dated 15 March 2008. Mr Clark sought a stay on the ground of his medical condition resulting from the assault. He also said that it was physically impossible to prepare legal documents because he did not have a desk or chair, had a bad back and suffered from major depression. On 27 March 2008, the CSO received a letter from Mr Clark dated 22 March 2008 serving a draft Amended Statement of Claim. He requested a copy of the security footage of the assault. On 18 April 2008, the CSO informed Mr Clark that the State did not consent to a stay.
	
	
	On 24 April 2008, Mr Clark’s Notice of Motion of 6 December 2007 was heard by Simpson J. Her Honour ordered that the motion be dismissed with costs.
	
	
	Mr Clark provided a draft Amended Statement of Claim to the Court on 24 April 2008. On 13 May 2008, the CSO wrote to Mr Clark in response to the draft Amended Statement of Claim advising him that the State did not consent to the filing of it in its current form, and setting out particulars of objections in detail. The objections included the fact that new allegations against other police officers, which were prohibited by s 4 of the Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act 1981 (NSW) had been included as well as new allegations of false imprisonment and malicious prosecution.
	
	
	On 13 June 2008, Mr Clark was released from custody on parole. He was taken back into custody in April 2009, was convicted of a number of charges and has remained in custody since that time.
	
	
	At a status conference before a Registrar on 11 July 2008, Mr Clark sought an adjournment. The State requested that he properly indicate in writing within one week as to why the adjournment was required. He was ordered to inform the State of his position by 1 August 2008 and the matter was listed before the duty judge on 18 August 2008.
	
	
	On 4 August 2008, the CSO received an affidavit filed by Mr Clark on that day. On 12 August 2008, the CSO wrote to Mr Clark in response to the affidavit, saying that Mr Clark had failed to articulate his pleadings properly or provide a proper answer to the request for particulars. Mr Clark was informed that the State did not consent to the matter being further adjourned and filed a Notice of Motion seeking orders for dismissal or striking out of Mr Clark’s claims. On 15 August 2008, Mr Clark filed a Notice of Motion seeking various orders, including that the 2005 Proceedings be stayed pending the conclusion of his criminal proceedings.
	
	
	On 18 August 2008, the State’s Notice of Motion for dismissal or strikeout came before Harrison J. Harrison J adjourned the hearing of the motion and granted liberty to the State to restore its motion on 7 days’ notice following the conclusion of Mr Clark’s criminal proceedings. The 2005 Proceedings were listed for mention on 8 December 2008.
	
	
	It appears that Mr Clark’s criminal proceedings were adjourned to 16 February 2009. The circumstances of the adjournment are unclear. On 3 December 2008, Mr Clark served a Notice of Motion seeking an order that the 2005 Proceedings be adjourned until after his criminal proceedings were complete. He submitted that anything that he put before the Court in the 2005 Proceedings may jeopardise his acquittal in the criminal proceedings. Mr Clark filed an Amended Notice of Motion seeking similar relief on 4 December 2008. He also filed an affidavit. On 5 December 2008, the CSO wrote to Mr Clark saying that the State objected to the orders sought in his Notice of Motion on the basis that he had had ample opportunity to amend his pleading, and that he was legally represented in the criminal proceedings and therefore ought to be in a position to prepare an amended pleading in the 2005 Proceedings.
	
	
	On 8 December 2008, the 2005 Proceedings came before Harrison J again. Mr Clark handed up an Amended Notice of Motion seeking an adjournment pending determination of his criminal proceedings on 16 February 2009. Harrison J ordered Mr Clark to file a Further Amended Statement of Claim no later than 23 January 2009, and adjourned the State’s motion of 12 August 2008 and Mr Clark’s motion of 8 December 2008 for further directions on 6 February 2009. His Honour noted that the primary reason for the matter being adjourned on the last occasion was because Mr Clark had to prepare for the criminal proceedings. His Honour said that, as the trial was originally to be heard in October 2008 and it was adjourned at the request of the Crown, the bulk of the preparation had presumably been done and Mr Clark should therefore be able to put his pleading in the 2005 Proceedings in a proper form.
	
	
	On 13 January 2009, Mr Clark filed a Further Amended Statement of Claim to which he added three new defendants, new causes of action and removed the original fourth and fifth defendants. On 14 January 2009, Mr Clark informed the CSO of those amendments. On 18 January 2009, Mr Clark wrote to the CSO saying that he proposed to seek to combine the District Court criminal proceedings against him with the 2005 Proceedings. The CSO responded on 3 February 2009, saying that there was no court rule to enable the two matters to be consolidated. On 3 February 2009, the CSO requested further and better particulars of the Further Amended Statement of Claim.
	
	
	On 6 February 2009, at a directions hearing before Harrison J, the State opposed the addition of the new defendants on the basis that it would further delay the 2005 Proceedings. The State submitted that Mr Clark had been ordered to amend the Statement of Claim that was on foot and did not have leave to add other defendants and other causes of action. Harrison J ordered Mr Clark to furnish a response to the State’s request for particulars no later than 20 February 2009. The matter was listed for directions on 23 February 2009. On 20 February 2009, Mr Clark wrote to the CSO providing a response to the request for further and better particulars.
	
	
	At a status conference on 23 February 2009, counsel for the State submitted that Mr Clark’s response to the request for further and better particulars was defective. Mr Clark, who appeared in person, argued that providing all particulars would jeopardise his criminal proceedings and insisted that the criminal matter should be dealt with before the 2005 Proceedings continued. The Registrar ordered Mr Clark to provide a proper response to the request for particulars by 16 March 2009 and to serve an evidentiary statement by the same date. The Registrar directed that, if Mr Clark believed he could not serve the material because of the criminal proceedings, he should file and serve a Notice of Motion and affidavit in support. The proceedings were stood over to 23 March 2009.
	
	
	On 16 March 2009, Mr Clark filed a Notice of Motion and affidavit seeking an order that the 2005 Proceedings be stayed pending the conclusion of the criminal proceedings against him. He also asked that his computer and back up discs be returned to him.
	
	
	Mr Clark did not appear at the status conference on 23 March 2009 but consented to orders proposed by the State that his Notice of Motion filed on 16 March 2009 be fixed for hearing before Harrison J, that the defendants serve any evidence upon which they intend to rely at the hearing of the motion by 20 April 2009 and that the motion and affidavit be served on Timothy Robards and Terrence Robards by 31 March 2009.
	
	
	On 1 April 2009, Mr Clark wrote to the CSO, saying that he had filed a Notice of Motion seeking to have the order made by the Registrar on 23 March 2009, concerning the filing of the evidentiary statement, set aside. He also pressed for materials sought under a Notice to Produce to enable him to prepare the evidentiary statement. The CSO replied on 6 April 2009 saying that the documents sought under the Notice to Produce lacked any legitimate forensic purpose.
	
	
	On 9 April 2009, Mr Clark entered custody again. It appears that that was a consequence of his breaching his bail conditions.
	
	
	On 4 June 2009, the CSO wrote to Mr Clark proposing that a status conference be held on 10 August 2009. Mr Clark responded on 17 July 2009, saying that he wished to seek leave on that day to amend his Further Amended Statement of Claim on the basis that he had been found not guilty in relation to five of the criminal charges against him.
	
	
	On 10 August 2009, at a directions hearing before Harrison J, Mr Clark handed up a Notice of Motion and an unsworn affidavit seeking access to computers and documents. He also foreshadowed that he would seek to add a cause of action to the proposed Second Amended Statement of Claim adding a cause of action regarding the five counts on which he was not convicted. Harrison J ordered Mr Clark to provide the defendants with a copy of his Notice of Motion and his proposed amended pleading by 11 September 2009. He directed that the matter be listed before him on 14 September 2009.
	
	
	On 23 August 2009, Mr Clark wrote to the CSO enclosing “interim part of second further amended statement of claim”. He also purported to add the Commissioner of Corrective Services (the Commissioner) and Justice Health as defendants. On 9 September 2009, the CSO wrote to Mr Clark saying that the causes of action in the “interim part of second further amended statement of claim” concerning the Department of Corrective Services and Justice Health were completely unrelated to the 2005 Proceedings.
	
	
	At a directions hearing on 14 September 2009, Mr Clark withdrew the “interim part of second further amended statement of claim”. He also filed a Notice of Motion on that day seeking access to a laptop computer and protection of his legal files. Harrison J adjourned the Notice of Motion to a date to be fixed.
	
	
	On 16 September 2009, Mr Clark wrote to the CSO enclosing an unfiled Summons naming the State, the Commissioner, and Justice Health as defendants and seeking an order that he be provided with his legal files, a laptop, a chair in his cell and an order that a new trial be ordered in relation to his recent convictions in May and June 2009.
	
	
	On 26 November 2009, Harrison J ordered that Mr Clark’s Notice of Motion of 14 September 2009 be dismissed and that Mr Clark file and serve a Further Amended Statement of Claim by 20 January 2010. His Honour also directed Mr Clark to answer the State’s request for further and better particulars of 3 February 2009 by the same date. Mr Clark was ordered to file and serve his evidentiary statement by 30 January 2010 and the State was ordered to file and serve, by 25 February 2010, any evidence in support of its motion for dismissal of the 2005 Proceedings filed on 12 August 2008. Mr Clark was ordered to file and serve any evidence in reply by 20 March 2010. The State’s Notice of Motion to strike out or dismiss was listed for hearing on 30 April 2010.
	
	
	On 30 March 2010, the CSO wrote to Mr Clark pointing out that he had failed to comply with the orders of 26 November 2009. The CSO confirmed that the State’s evidence had been served on Mr Clark.
	
	
	The 2005 Proceedings came before Harrison J on the application by the State to dismiss Mr Clark’s claims or to strike out the Statement of Claim, in the form in which it then stood. The pleading in question was a Second Further Amended Statement of Claim filed in Court on 30 April 2010. Harrison J described the pleading as containing very serious allegations of misconduct by certain police officers, including conspiracy, destruction and concealment of evidence, intimidation, soliciting bribes, malicious prosecution, wrongful arrest, false imprisonment, perjury, suborning witnesses, perverting the course of justice and defamation. The Statement of Claim also contained allegations of negligence on the part of Justice Health, the Department of the Attorney General, the Commissioner and the Department of Corrective Services.
	
	
	Harrison J observed that, while the State’s Notice of Motion to strike out Mr Clark’s Statement of Claim had been filed on 12 August 2008, that motion was not dealt with before the Statement of Claim had been succeeded by a series of amended versions. By the time the motion was ready for hearing, the current version of the Statement of Claim had become the Second Further Amended Statement of Claim, which was filed in Court on 30 April 2010. In anticipation of Mr Clark being permitted to rely on that pleading, the State prepared an Amended Notice of Motion, which was also filed in court on 30 April 2010. The State’s application was treated by the parties as an application for orders that the Second Further Amended Statement of Claim be dismissed generally pursuant to UCPR, r 12.7 for want of due despatch, dismissed pursuant to UCPR, r 13.4(1)(a), (b) or (c) or struck out pursuant to UCPR, r 14.28(1)(a), (b) or (c). UCPR, r 13.4 is concerned with the frivolous and vexatious proceedings. UCPR, r 14.28 is concerned with the circumstances in which a court may strike out pleadings as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, having a tendency to cause prejudice, delay or embarrassment or otherwise being an abuse of the process of the court.
	
	
	Harrison J ordered that the claim in defamation be dismissed and that claim is not presently relevant. His Honour also concluded that the other claims were not properly pleaded or particularised, but considered that Mr Clark should have a further opportunity to plead them properly. However, his Honour was not satisfied that it could be said that Mr Clark had failed to prosecute the 2005 Proceedings with due despatch within the meaning of UCPR, r 12.7. [8] 
	
	
	Harrison J observed that Timothy Robards and Terrence Robards appeared to have taken the view that they should no longer respond to Mr Clark’s allegations, or possibly could not afford to do so. His Honour said that they had never appeared at any time since the proceedings first came before his Honour for directions and case management.
	
	
	At the time of the hearing before Harrison J, the appeal from the decision of Johnson J had not been heard by the Court of Appeal. On 2 July 2010, having been informed of Mr Clark’s appeal, Harrison J stayed the 2005 Proceedings until further orders and directed that Mr Clark take no further steps in the 2005 Proceedings unless and until he served upon the State a further version of the Statement of Claim upon which he relied, which complies with the rules of the Court and which pleads no factual matter that was a fact or matter pleaded by him or relied on by him in the 2002 Proceedings before Johnson J. Harrison J granted liberty to the State to reply in relation to any Statement of Claim so served. The only document that has been served on the State is the consolidated Statement of Claim to which I have referred above. There has been no other compliance with the terms of the orders made by Harrison J.
	
	
	On 2 December 2009, Mr Clark filed an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal from his convictions in the District Court. The grounds of appeal included that his counsel was incompetent and that the verdicts of the jury were unsatisfactory or unreasonable. The appeal was heard on 24 October 2011 when the Court of Criminal Appeal reserved its decision. On 15 December 2011 the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the appeal from the convictions on all counts.
	
	
	On 6 February 2012, Mr Clark wrote to the Registrar, with a copy to the CSO, requesting that a Third Further Amended Statement of Claim be filed. He asked that the matter be listed in September or October 2012. On the following day, he wrote again to the Registrar asking that his letter of the previous day be disregarded.
	
	
	Mr Clark’s Application for Leave to Appeal from the orders made by Johnson J in respect of the 2002 Proceedings was heard by this Court on 27 April 2012. On 22 May 2012, this Court granted leave to appeal and allowed the appeal in part. The order made by Johnson J was set aside. The State’s Notice of Motion was allowed to the extent that certain paragraphs of the Further Amended Statement of Claim filed on 23 April 2004 were struck out. Mr Clark was directed to file, within three months, a Second Further Amended Statement of Claim removing any reference to the persons or causes of action previously pleaded in the paragraphs struck out. Each party was to pay his or its own costs of the appeal. [9] 
	
	
	At a directions hearing before a Registrar on 10 October 2012, Mr Clark provided a copy of a Notice of Motion that had not been filed. The proceedings were stood over to 24 October 2012. On that day, a Registrar ordered Mr Clark to file, by 6 November 2012, any Notice of Motion seeking to consolidate proceedings. The application was to attach the proposed consolidated Statement of Claim. All motions were to be made returnable on 16 November 2012. The Registrar directed that the 2002 Proceedings and the 2005 Proceedings were to travel together.
	
	
	On 31 October 2012, Mr Clark wrote to the CSO attaching a copy of a Notice of Motion and Statement in Support to be relied upon at the proposed hearing on 16 November 2012. The Notice of Motion was to be filed in both the 2002 Proceedings and the 2005 Proceedings on 6 November 2012. On 8 November 2012, Mr Clark filed an Amended Statement in Support of his Notice of Motion.
	
	
	The hearing on 16 November 2012 was terminated because of difficulties with the audio-visual link and both the 2002 Proceedings and the 2005 Proceedings were stood over for directions on 10 December 2012. On that day, a Registrar made orders granting leave to Mr Clark to file the foreshadowed Notice of Motion in court together with his Statement in Support and his proposed Statement of Claim. Mr Clark was also granted leave to file a Further Amended Notice of Motion in respect of his claim to have access to his laptop computer. The State was directed to file any application in respect of the pleadings or the proceedings generally no later than 18 January 2013. All applications or Notices of Motion and affidavits in support were to be served on Mr Clark no later than 25 January 2013. The 2005 Proceedings were stood over for directions before the duty judge on 30 January 2013.
	


The Hearing before the Primary Judge


	
	On 10 December 2012, Mr Clark filed a Notice of Motion seeking leave to amend his pleading in each of the 2002 Proceedings and the 2005 Proceedings by filing a single consolidated Statement of Claim. Mr Clark filed another motion on 21 May 2013 seeking, first, an order that he be granted leave “to add the two matters reinstated by the Court of Appeal” in the previous claim into one “Consolidated Statement of Claim” and that he be granted leave to simplify the claim by dividing it into two parts, namely, Part A and Part B. The proposed consolidated Statement of Claim named Timothy Robards, Terrence Robards and the State as defendants. Mr Clark also sought orders relating to the terms of his custody. He produced a Second Further Amended Statement of Claim, consisting of Part A and Part B, dated 5 April 2013. In addition, he filed a Statement in Support of his motion, which contained significant assertions of fact concerning the conditions of his custody.
	
	
	On 18 January 2013, the State filed a Notice of Motion in each of the 2002 Proceedings and the 2005 Proceedings seeking the following orders:
	



	
	Dismissal for want of due despatch under UCPR, r 12.7;
	
	
	Dismissal as vexatious and an abuse of the court’s processes under UCPR, r 13.4; or
	
	
	Striking out as an abuse of process of the Court and as tending to cause prejudice and embarrassment or delay in the proceedings under UCPR, r 14.28.
	


The State filed a Notice of Motion in the 2002 Proceedings seeking the same relief.


	
	In support of its motion in the 2005 Proceedings, the State filed the following:
	



	
	Affidavit of Stephanie Koch of 18 January 2013, which annexed a very detailed procedural chronology;
	
	
	Affidavit of Stephanie Koch of 27 February 2013, detailing the number and identity of potential police officer witnesses who have been medically retired or discharged from the NSW Police Force, which evidence was relevant to the question of prejudice; and
	
	
	Affidavit of Michael Hovey of 28 February 2013 with respect to Mr Clark’s application in relation to his conditions of custody, which was to be relied upon for questions as to the nature of the custody of Mr Clark and might bear upon any consideration of the reasons for delay on his part in the 2005 Proceedings.
	



	
	Both Mr Clark’s motion and the State’s motion were heard by the primary judge on 21 May 2013 and 22 May 2013. At the hearing before the primary judge on those days, the State relied on a detailed, if somewhat confused chronology, of the progress of the 2005 Proceedings. However, the State’s submissions in support of its motion were somewhat superficial and did not address the detailed chronology as to the progress of the 2005 Proceedings. The primary judge did not address that chronology at all. Rather, his Honour devoted considerable attention to the content of the allegations made in the 2002 Proceedings and the 2005 Proceedings. His Honour observed that Mr Clark’s application to amend the 2005 Proceedings was made some two and a half years after Harrison J granted him leave to re-plead. His Honour accepted that that delay may be partly explained by Mr Clark’s conduct of the appeal against the decision of Johnson J in the 2002 Proceedings. Nevertheless, his Honour considered that the delay must be viewed against the background of the substantial delay attending the proceedings from their outset, including the period when Harrison J was dealing with them.
	
	
	In the State’s outline of submissions in support of its motion, attention was drawn to the fact that the 2005 Proceedings were subject to a stay with liberty to re-plead. It was said that, in the light of the inaction of Mr Clark in exercising that liberty to re-plead, the 2005 Proceedings should be dismissed and the Statement of Claim should be struck out. The State submitted that the history of the 2005 Proceedings, even at June 2010, was already convoluted and lengthy and that it was clear that Mr Clark had previously been made aware of his obligations under the Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act 1981 (NSW) and that Mr Clark had in the past attempted to rely on issues relating to his conditions of custody to explain his defaults and inability to prepare his claims.
	
	
	The State’s submission asserted that it was clear from the decision of Harrison J that Mr Clark had been given numerous attempts to plead his claim properly. The submission referred to the observation made by Harrison J that there was a question as to whether the position of Mr Clark with respect to getting his pleadings in order was a question of willingness or ability to do so, as opposed to one whether he had time to do so.
	
	
	The State’s submission referred further to the observation made by Harrison J as to whether Mr Clark’s claim would ever be properly pleaded. The submission also referred to his Honour’s comment that he was not confident that Mr Clark would ever produce a properly pleaded Statement of Claim, although his Honour was not then prepared to say that it would never be produced. The submission pointed out that, while Harrison J had observed that the then current pleading could not withstand the State’s assault upon it, Mr Clark should be given another chance to correct the defects, although he must understand and appreciate that there was a prospect that the time may arrive when no further opportunity to do so would be extended to him. His Honour was not prepared to say that such a time had yet arrived and that it was obviously inappropriate for his Honour to express any view about whether it ever would.
	
	
	The State’s submission asserted that Mr Clark had not re-pleaded his claim in the 2002 Proceedings in the way contemplated by the orders of the Court of Appeal of 22 May 2012. Further, it was pointed out, Mr Clark had not appropriately re-pleaded his Statement of Claim following the orders made by Harrison J in the 2005 Proceedings of 2 July 2010. It was asserted that the circumstances of Mr Clark were not so harsh or remarkable that he had been unable to attend to his legal affairs properly. On the contrary, it was asserted he had been a highly productive litigator throughout the entire relevant period.
	
	
	The State’s submission asserted that the overall procedural history of both the 2002 Proceedings and the 2005 Proceedings would not give the Court any confidence that Mr Clark will ever properly attend to his pleadings. It was said that, in circumstances where substantial indulgences had already been granted to Mr Clark, notwithstanding his own gross misconduct, the time had been reached when the 2005 Proceedings should be ended.
	
	
	Counsel appearing for the State on the hearing of motions acknowledged to the primary judge that he could point to no specific prejudice arising from the delay in preparing the State’s case. However, he pointed out that the claims in the 2002 Proceedings were based on events said to have occurred no later than 2000. For the most part, the claims against the police in the 2005 Proceedings related to events in 1999 or between 2005 and 2007 and one claim based on events in 2008.
	
	
	The primary judge reserved his decision on 22 May 2013. However, in the course of the hearing, his Honour indicated that the claims for relief in relation to the terms of Mr Clark’s custody should more appropriately be the subject of separate proceedings. Mr Clark thereafter commenced separate proceedings (348662 of 2013) in the Common Law Division seeking such relief. Mr Clark filed a Second Further Amended Summons in those proceedings on 27 January 2014. Those proceedings were listed for hearing before the primary judge on 12 May 2014. Before embarking on the hearing of those fresh proceedings on 12 May 2014, his Honour published an interim judgment in the 2005 Proceedings. His Honour indicated that he had decided that the 2005 Proceedings should be dismissed but that he had a concern about the 2002 Proceedings on which he invited further submissions if the parties wished.
	
	
	On 30 May 2014, the primary judge heard further submissions in relation to the 2002 Proceedings. On that day, his Honour ordered, in the 2002 Proceedings, that the time for compliance with the direction made by the Court of Appeal on 22 May 2012 be extended to 30 June 2014. His Honour ordered that the 2005 Proceedings be dismissed for want of due despatch, pursuant to UCPR, r 12.7. He also ordered that Mr Clark’s motion of 10 December 2012 in the 2005 Proceedings be dismissed, and that Mr Clark’s fresh proceedings in respect of his conditions of custody be dismissed. However, those orders were apparently provisional. Nonetheless, on 17 June 2014, his Honour published his final reasons in relation to the motions of Mr Clark and the State in the 2002 Proceedings and the 2005 Proceedings and made formal orders.
	
	
	The primary judge concluded that the form of the proposed pleading as a consolidated Statement of Claim in two parts was inappropriate and that the proposed pleading could not be allowed to stand since it achieved none of the purposes set out in s 64(2) of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), namely, the determination of the real questions raised by the litigation, the correction of any defect or order in the proceedings and the avoidance of multiplicity of proceedings. The real question, his Honour said, was whether Mr Clark should be allowed a further opportunity to re-plead his claims.
	
	
	While the primary judge considered that the proposed pleading as a consolidated Statement of Claim, embracing the claims in both the 2002 Proceedings and the 2005 Proceedings, was inappropriate, his Honour treated Mr Clark’s application as an attempt to amend the pleadings in each of the 2002 Proceedings and the 2005 Proceedings. His Honour identified the allegations made in the proposed consolidated pleading that he treated as the proposed amendments to the pleading in the 2002 Proceedings. The remaining allegations in the consolidated pleading were treated as the amendment to the pleading in the 2005 Proceedings. His Honour then dealt separately with the 2005 Proceedings and the 2002 Proceedings.
	
	
	The primary judge observed that the 2005 Proceedings had undoubtedly been very protracted and had made little or no progress since their inception. His Honour observed that Mr Clark’s current application to amend the pleading in the 2005 Proceedings was made roughly two and a half years after Harrison J granted him leave to re-plead. His Honour said that the proposed amended pleading in large part reproduced the previous pleading in the 2005 Proceedings and failed to address the problems identified by Harrison J. His Honour considered that it remained an embarrassing document with the potential to cause prejudice and delay.
	
	
	The primary judge said that he appreciated the difficulty Mr Clark faced as an unrepresented litigant drafting pleadings and that he was also conscious of the problems he faced being in custody. His Honour referred specifically to evidence concerning the difficulties under which Mr Clark claimed to labour having regard to his conditions in custody.
	
	
	The primary judge found that Mr Clark had access to computer facilities, albeit in circumstances considerably more constrained than a person at liberty. He found that the same was true of Mr Clark’s access to the documents and other records in his possession in relation to the 2005 Proceedings, and that Mr Clark’s access to that material and to his facilities was affected by the daily routine of prison life as he experienced it, as well as his movements from time to time to different institutions within the system. His Honour also took into account an assault endured by Mr Clark in 2007 and his treatment for that assault, as well as the fact that he has been involved in the preparation of other proceedings, both criminal and civil. His Honour concluded, however, that despite those difficulties, the delay in the progress of the 2005 Proceedings was unacceptable.
	
	
	The primary judge then referred to the State’s contention that the 2005 Proceedings were vexatious or an abuse of process or that the pleading was an abuse as tending to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay. His Honour also referred to the fact that new claims not previously pleaded were not authorised by the terms of the relief granted by Harrison J. However, his Honour was content to terminate the 2005 Proceedings on the basis of want of due despatch, without addressing the deficiencies in the pleading asserted by the State. His Honour considered that the prediction by Harrison J that Mr Clark could never have produced a properly pleaded Statement of Claim had proven to be true. His Honour concluded that the time had arrived when no further opportunity to produce a properly pleaded Statement of Claim should be extended to Mr Clark and, balancing the legitimate interests of the parties, justice required that the 2005 Proceedings be dismissed. Having concluded that the 2005 Proceedings should be terminated for want of due despatch, it followed, his Honour said, that Mr Clark’s application to amend the 2005 Proceedings must also be dismissed.
	
	
	The primary judge then said that the dismissal would include dismissal of the claims against Timothy Robards and Terrence Robards. While they had previously moved for summary dismissal, there was apparently no current application for dismissal by them and no application for dismissal for want of due despatch. His Honour gave no additional reasons for his conclusion, but observed that neither of Timothy Robards and Terrence Robards had taken any part in the 2005 Proceedings since an early stage.
	
	
	However, the primary judge considered the fate of the 2002 Proceedings was not so easily resolved. While they are older than the 2005 Proceedings, and much of the delay in the progress of the 2002 Proceedings stemmed from the judgment of Johnson J and the appeal against it, the fact remained that the appeal was not finally determined until May 2012. The time set for the filing of an appropriately amended Statement of Claim was extended to 24 October 2012. Mr Clark’s motion to amend was filed less than two months after that date and his Honour considered that, in all of the circumstances, the extent to which it was out of time, was of itself, of little significance.
	
	
	The primary judge considered that the proposed amended pleading of the claims in the 2002 Proceedings could not be allowed to stand but that the original pleading of them, when Mr Clark was represented, appeared to be appropriate. His Honour considered that it may be that a reversion to that original pleading, amended in accordance with the Court’s directions, would be acceptable. His Honour observed that the paragraphs of the proposed amended pleading in the 2002 Proceedings were not in accordance with the limited leave granted by the Court of Appeal in 2012 and did not achieve the purpose of that leave. His Honour considered that that was a matter that might readily be remedied by focusing on the earlier pleading of the claims in the 2002 Proceedings and the terms of this Court’s leave. His Honour considered that that might be achieved expeditiously and without prejudice. That question was not squarely addressed and his Honour considered that it was appropriate for the parties to be heard further on the question.
	
	
	The primary judge then referred to the hearing on 30 May 2014, when the State contended that Mr Clark had exhausted his opportunity to re-plead. Mr Clark had assured his Honour that he could, and would, observe the limits placed by the Court of Appeal on its grant of leave on 22 May 2012. Not without some reluctance, his Honour was prepared to allow Mr Clark one last opportunity, which should be strictly limited. For that reason, his Honour adopted a self-executing order.
	
	
	Accordingly, in the 2002 Proceedings, his Honour ordered that the time for compliance with the direction made by the Court of Appeal on 22 May 2012 be extended up to 30 June 2014. His Honour directed that, if Mr Clark failed or declined to comply with that direction, the 2002 Proceedings were to be dismissed for want of due despatch under UCPR, r 12.7. No amended Statement of Claim has since been filed in the 2002 Proceedings and, accordingly, they must be treated as dismissed.
	
	
	The primary judge also dismissed Mr Clark’s motion to amend the pleadings in both the 2002 Proceedings and the 2005 Proceedings by filing the proposed consolidated Statement of Claim. His Honour also ordered that Mr Clark’s motion in respect of conditions of custody be dismissed. Finally, his Honour ordered that the 2005 Proceedings be dismissed and that Mr Clark pay the State’s costs of the 2005 Proceedings.
	


The Appeal


	
	By Summons filed on 8 August 2014, Mr Clark sought leave to appeal from the orders made by the primary judge in the 2005 Proceedings. No application was made in respect of the orders made in the 2002 Proceedings, although Mr Clark is asking that the time for complying with this Court’s direction of 22 May 2012 be further extended.
	
	
	After a hearing on 5 May 2015, this Court ordered, on 22 May 2015, that leave be granted to Mr Clark to appeal against so much of the judgment of the primary judge as dismissed paragraphs of the proposed Amended Statement of Claim that dealt with causes of action to be found in the pleadings in the 2005 Proceedings, as considered by Harrison J, other than the conspiracy charge contained in that pleading. The Court otherwise ordered that the Summons seeking leave to appeal be dismissed. On 8 July 2015, pursuant to the Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act 1981 (NSW), this Court, on the papers, granted leave to Mr Clark to commence proceedings for leave to appeal and, to the extent that leave has been granted, to commence an appeal in this Court, from the orders of the primary judge of 17 June 2014.
	
	
	Mr Michael Heath has been granted leave to make submissions on behalf of Mr Clark as amicus curiae. Mr Heath provided the Court with a form of Notice of Appeal as well as written submissions. The grounds in the Notice of Appeal are as follows:
	



	
	The primary judge erred in dismissing the 2005 Proceedings as against Timothy Robards and Terrence Robards without giving any or proper reasons for doing so in circumstances where those parties had neither filed a defence to the proceedings nor made any application to dismiss the proceedings and were not the moving party on the application.
	
	
	The primary judge erred in dismissing the 2005 Proceedings as against Timothy Robards and Terrence Robards by failing to take into consideration the fact that those parties had neither filed a defence to the proceedings as against them nor made any application to dismiss the proceedings.
	
	
	The primary judge erred in dismissing the 2005 Proceedings for want of due despatch by giving no, or insufficient, consideration to the delay associated with the 2002 Proceedings and the impact of that delay in the prosecution of the 2005 Proceedings.
	
	
	The primary judge erred in dismissing paragraphs of the proposed amended Statement of Claim that deal with causes of action to be found in the 2005 Proceedings, other than the conspiracy charge.
	



	
	While the draft Notices of Appeal filed by Mr Clark name the State as a Respondent, the Notices of Appeal prepared by Mr Heath name only Timothy Robards and Terrence Robards. The omission of the State appears to be an oversight, since it was made clear that Mr Clark seeks to have the dismissal as against Timothy Robards, Terrence Robards and the State set aside.
	
	
	By the Notice of Appeal, Mr Clark seeks orders that the orders made by the primary judge on 17 June 2014 be set aside, that the time for compliance with the directions made by the Court of Appeal on 22 May 2012 be extended to such date as the Court sees fit, and that the 2002 Proceedings and the 2005 Proceedings be remitted to the Common Law Division for orders and directions. Leave to appeal from the orders made by Hidden J in respect of the 2002 Proceedings was not granted by this Court in Clark v Robards [2015] NSWCA 140. In order to deal with the issues raised in the appeal, it is necessary to consider the progress of the 2005 Proceedings in some detail.
	
	
	As indicated above [10] , the primary judge acknowledged the problems faced by Mr Clark being in custody, but his Honour ultimately appears to have discounted the difficulties experienced by Mr Clark and concluded that, despite those difficulties, the delay in the progress of the 2005 Proceedings was unacceptable. His Honour was therefore content to terminate the 2005 Proceedings on the basis of want of due despatch, without addressing the questions of the adequacy of the Statement of Claim.
	
	
	There was no application for leave to appeal from the decision of Harrison J declining to dismiss the 2005 Proceedings for want of due despatch. On the other hand, as the primary judge observed, the proposed consolidated pleading reproduced, in large part, the pleading in the 2005 Proceedings that was before Harrison J and failed to address the problems identified by Harrison J. His Honour considered that it remained an “embarrassing document” with the “potential to cause prejudice and delay”, as Harrison J had concluded. To the extent that there was delay up to the time of Harrison J’s judgments, it is appropriate to have regard to the cumulative effect of that delay in conjunction with the delays from the judgments of Harrison J until the time when Mr Clark sought to take up the leave to re-plead that was reserved by Harrison J.
	
	
	Mr Clark contends, through Mr Heath as amicus curiae, that the primary judge failed to give adequate consideration to the delay associated with the 2002 Proceedings, and the impact of that delay on any delay in the prosecution of the 2005 Proceedings. He contends that, while both the 2002 Proceedings and the 2005 Proceedings were considered by his Honour, only the 2005 Proceedings were dismissed for want of despatch. He points to the fact that the 2002 Proceedings were older than the 2005 Proceedings and that the progress in the 2005 Proceedings was delayed by the appeal from the orders of Johnson J in the 2002 Proceedings, which was not finally determined until May 2012. He suggests that the result is anomalous.
	
	
	First, the events complained of in the 2005 Proceedings were more recent than those complained of in the 2002 Proceedings. Secondly, the primary judge accepted that the appeal from the decision of Johnson J partly explained the delay in the 2005 Proceedings. However, the 2002 Proceedings and the 2005 Proceedings are distinct and separate. No explanation has been advanced as to why the prosecution of the 2002 Proceedings should have an effect on the prosecution of the 2005 Proceedings and it is quite unclear how the delay in dealing with the appeal in the 2002 Proceedings impacted on the preparation of a pleading in the 2005 Proceedings.
	
	
	Mr Heath, as amicus curiae, contends that the global approach adopted by the primary judge in dealing with the application to dismiss the 2005 Proceedings was inappropriate in the circumstances of the case. He relies on the fact that the State did not point to any specific prejudice in preparing the State’s case that might arise from the delay. He contends that, having regard to Mr Clark’s difficulties by reason of his incarceration, and his lack of representation, dismissal of the 2005 Proceedings on the basis of delay, when the 2002 Proceedings remain on foot, is unjustified. He contends that much of the delay had been caused by the refusal of the State and the other defendants to plead defences that are clearly open to them that, in some cases, might lead to summary dismissal of particular claims. In particular, he contends that it is quite unclear as to why Mr Clark is responsible for the delay with respect to the claims against Timothy Robards and Terrence Robards, who have apparently neither filed defences nor sought to have the claims dismissed, at least until recently.
	
	
	Even if the delay in the prosecution of the 2005 Proceedings up to the decision of Harrison J in July 2010 is not consolidated with the delay thereafter, the delay from July 2010 up to the time when Mr Clark sought to file the consolidated Statement of Claim has not been satisfactorily explained. Certainly, Mr Clark has complained about the conditions of his custody and the difficulties that he claims that to have caused to the preparation of the 2005 Proceedings. Nevertheless, Mr Clark has apparently been able to produce detailed and lengthy documents in relation to the interlocutory applications that he made. He was able to produce the consolidated Statement of Claim and the detailed Statement in Support of his motion to file the consolidated Statement of Claim. That Statement runs to some 22 pages containing 191 paragraphs. In addition, there are some 18 annexures attached to the Statement in support of the motion.
	
	
	No explanation is proffered as to why the energy and effort devoted to that document could not have been directed to producing a pleading in the 2005 Proceedings that satisfied the terms of the leave granted by Harrison J. The evidence indicates that the State wrote to Mr Clark on several occasions pointing out the asserted deficiencies in his then pleading in the 2005 Proceedings. No explanation has been proffered on behalf of Mr Clark as to why the complaints made by the State were not addressed by an attempt to produce a pleading that satisfied the requirements of the UCPR. The fact is that Mr Clark has simply not made any effort to produce a Statement of Claim that complies with the UCPR and that does not plead a fact or matter as a fact or matter pleaded by him or relied upon in the 2002 Proceedings.
	


Dismissal as against the State


	
	In all of the circumstances, I consider that the State has demonstrated that the 2005 Proceedings should be dismissed as against the State for want of due despatch.
	


Dismissal as against Timothy Robards and Terrence Robards


	
	As I have said, Timothy Robards and Terrence Robards were the first and second defendants in the 2005 Proceedings. While they participated in the proceedings at an early stage, they have not participated for some time. It is not entirely clear that they were served with the Notices of Motion that were heard by the primary judge on 21 May 2013 and 22 May 2013. Nevertheless, as indicated above, the primary judge ordered that the 2005 Proceedings be dismissed as against not only the State but also as against Timothy Robards and Terrence Robards.
	
	
	More importantly, there was no satisfactory evidence that Timothy Robards and Terrence Robards were served with Mr Clark’s Application for Leave Appeal. They did not appear at the hearing of the Application. In those circumstances, at the completion of oral argument, the Court directed that the Registrar write to Timothy Robards and Terrence Robards, informing them of the proceedings and providing them with copies of the following:
	


●   Reasons for judgment of the primary judge of 17 June 2014;

●   Mr Clark’s Summons seeking leave to appeal;

●   Mr Clark’s Summary of Argument in support of the application for leave;

●   Draft Notice of Appeal;

●   Reasons of this Court of 5 May 2015 for granting leave to appeal;

●   Written submissions of the State filed on 12 February 2016; and

●   Written submissions of Mr Heath as amicus curiae.

In response to the Registrar’s letter, an appearance was filed by the solicitors acting on behalf of Timothy Robards and Terrence Robards and the Court has now received written submissions on their behalf.


	
	Timothy Robards and Terrence Robards opposed any and all applications brought by Mr Clark that involved them as parties. They support each of the decisions made by various orders that have the effect of finalising, staying, dismissing or striking out statements of claim and notices of appeal filed by Mr Clark. Their principal contention is that, given the dormancy of the 2005 Proceedings since 2 July 2010, in that Mr Clark has taken no action to file an amended pleading, this Court should not interfere with the orders made by Harrison J.
	
	
	Timothy and Terrence Robards point out that Mr Clark has not taken up the conditional liberty to file an amended pleading in the 2005 Proceedings, which therefore remain poorly pleaded and not particularised. They contend that the allegations made against them are difficult to understand, are unclear and are imprecise. They say that, having regard to the time that has passed since the observation was made that Mr Clark must understand and appreciate that there is a prospect that a time may arrive when no further opportunity to correct the defects in his pleadings will be extended to him, that time has now arrived.
	
	
	In addition, Timothy and Terrence Robards adopt the conclusions outlined in the submissions filed on behalf of the State. Having regard to the unlikelihood of any costs order being successfully enforced, they say that they have played a limited role in the proceedings and have not filed a defence. They say that Mr Clark has never made a demand for a defence to be filed and that the allegations against them were poorly articulated and convoluted such that the preparation of a sensible and appropriate defence could not be achieved. Their failure to file a defence, therefore, they say, should not be held against them.
	
	
	Timothy and Terrence Robards also assert in their submissions concerning alleged assault of Timothy Robards by Mr Clark, that “matters” between them and Mr Clark have been ongoing for 21 years. That prompted further detailed submissions on the part of Mr Clark, purporting to set out in some detail the history of litigation involving himself and Timothy Robards. None of the matters raised by the Robards or Mr Clark appear to have any relevance to the question presently before this Court.
	
	
	No application was made on behalf of Timothy and Terrence Robards for summary dismissal of the 2005 proceedings. Nevertheless, all of the considerations relevant to the claims against the State are equally applicable to the claims as against Timothy and Terrence Robards. In all of the circumstances, I consider that it was appropriate for the primary judge to order dismissal as against them.
	


Conclusion


	
	The appeal should be dismissed. Mr Clark should be ordered to pay the costs of the appeal of the State, as well as the costs of Timothy Robards and Terrence Robards.

2701241,R v Manevski [2016] NSWSC 1032,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	During the cross-examination of the accused, the Crown applied for leave to cross-examine her about an aspect of her character. After hearing submissions, I granted that leave on a very limited basis, and indicated that I would give reasons later, so as not to interrupt the smooth running of the trial. This judgment represents those reasons.
	


Background


	
	The background of the application was as follows.
	
	
	On 13 July 2016, the accused, Rachel Manevski, was arraigned on an indictment before a jury panel and me at Newcastle. The indictment contained two counts: first, a count averring that, on 13 February 2014 at Niagara Park, she murdered Kieran Priestland; and, in the alternative, a count averring that, the murder having been committed by Andrew Perkins, she was an accessory after the fact to it.
	
	
	The trial commenced immediately upon her pleas of not guilty. It quickly became clear that the major issue with regard to the count of murder was whether the accused had entered into a joint criminal enterprise with Mr Perkins to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased.
	
	
	During the cross-examination by defence counsel of Detective Senior Constable Green (the officer in charge of the investigation), the following exchange occurred (at TT 377.46 – 378.01):
	


Q. Now, detective, as the officer in charge, have you made enquiries regarding the antecedents of my client Rachel Manevski?

A. I have.

Q. And are you able to tell the Court that Ms Manevski has never been convicted of any criminal offence whatsoever, violent or otherwise?

A. Prior to this matter, yes.

Q. She’s not convicted.

A. My apologies. No, she hasn’t, that’s right. Sorry.


	
	No evidence was led to rebut that proposition in the Crown case. Nor was any application to do with the character of the accused in a specific respect or generally made by the Crown Prosecutor during the Crown case.
	
	
	The Crown case closed on 19 July 2016. During the evidence of prosecution witnesses, on at least a dozen occasions I had interrupted witnesses if they were giving discursive answers, and respectfully requested them to answer a direct question directly.
	


Central exchange


	
	The accused was the only witness in the defence case. She entered the witness box on the afternoon of 19 July 2016.
	
	
	Towards the end of her evidence-in-chief on 19 July 2016, the following exchange occurred between the accused and her counsel (at TT 431.34-37):
	


Q. Did you at any time agree with Mr Perkins, or anyone at all, to cause any injury at all to Mr Priestland?

A. No, never, ever. Anyone that knows me knows I would never do anything like that to anyone.


	
	The next morning, in accordance with my general request that my Associate be informed electronically of any potential upcoming legal disputes, the Crown Prosecutor informed my Chambers (and defence counsel, of course) that there would be an application founded on that part of the evidence-in-chief of the accused that I have extracted.
	
	
	The foreshadowed application was duly made, and opposed by defence counsel.
	
	
	In the meantime, on the morning of 20 July 2016, the jury requested a complete transcript of the evidence of the accused; with the agreement of both counsel, I indicated that their request would be fulfilled as soon as reasonably practicable.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	In a nutshell, the Crown Prosecutor explained that the reference in the cross-examination of the officer in charge to the absence of a criminal record on the part of the accused was by agreement between counsel. It was also agreed that adduction of that evidence from the detective in cross-examination did not constitute raising of character generally, but rather in a particular respect (I interpolate that I am not entirely convinced of that proposition, but because the position of the parties was a joint one, there is no need for me to discuss it further).
	
	
	The evidence adduced in examination-in-chief of the accused, however, was said by the Crown Prosecutor to fall into a different category. It was said that the accused had positively intended to adduce evidence to prove, at the least by implication, that she was not a violent person at all. It was said that the Crown should be granted leave to cross-examine the accused about an incident, founded upon a statement of a young woman of 14 February 2014, and provided to police very shortly after the alleged murder occurred.
	
	
	That statement was tendered, and became Voir Dire Exhibit A. The Crown Prosecutor placed particular reliance on para 8, which in its entirety is as follows:
	


8. About 11am on 12 August, 2013, I was walking into the Gosford TAFE. As I was walking up some stairs I saw [the accused] walking towards me. I hadn’t met her before but I recognised her through Facebook photos I had seen of her. She was about 5 meters away when I saw her. I also saw Andrew [Perkins] further away in the distance. She walked up to me and said, “Are you [the complainant]”.

I was a bit scared of her and didn’t want any confrontation so I said, “No”.

She said, “Yes you are. You better stay away from my boyfriend slut”. I saw that she had a stick in her hand and she was pointing it towards me. It was a small tree branch about 15 centimetres long. Rachel was pretty close to my face and was speaking aggressively towards me. She said, “Stop inboxing my boyfriend. You’re dead. I’ll kill you and your family. I’m a fucking psycho”. As she was saying these things she has pressed the stick against my forehead.


	
	The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the accused (as opposed to her counsel) had deliberately gone beyond the limited evidence of good character that had been adduced by agreement from the officer in charge in cross-examination. By way of her discursive response to the question of her counsel, he submitted, she had given the jury the impression that she was a person who would have no connection with any form of violence. And yet that impression, based upon Voir Dire Exhibit A, was said to be demonstrably false.
	
	
	In short, it was said that I should grant leave to permit the Crown to correct the false impression that would otherwise be made upon the minds of the jury.
	


Submissions of the accused


	
	In contrast, defence counsel submitted that the accused had indeed raised her character in a further way, but only in a further particular respect. In short, he submitted that her words should be interpreted as being an assertion that she would never agree with another person to involve herself in violence, rather than asserting that she would never commit an act of violence herself.
	
	
	In other words, defence counsel submitted that, if the Crown had evidence available to it that the accused had previously agreed with another person to commit violence, perhaps there could be a grant of leave in that regard. But the proposed cross-examination was said not to “mirror” the aspect of her character that had been raised by the accused in a particular respect.
	
	
	In the alternative, if I were against him on that reading of what the accused said, defence counsel relied upon the well-known “discretion” contained in s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (the Act), and submitted that the evidence, in all the circumstances, should be excluded pursuant to that discretion.
	


Determination


	
	Turning to my determination, each counsel agreed that the question called for consideration of the following sections of the Act: first, s 110 of the Act; secondly, s 112 of the Act; thirdly, s 192 of the Act; and finally, s 137 of the Act.
	
	
	Turning to the first matter for consideration, s 110 is as follows:
	


110 Evidence about character of accused persons

(1) The hearsay rule, the opinion rule, the tendency rule and the credibility rule do not apply to evidence adduced by a defendant to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is, either generally or in a particular respect, a person of good character.

(2) If evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that a defendant is generally a person of good character has been admitted, the hearsay rule, the opinion rule, the tendency rule and the credibility rule do not apply to evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is not generally a person of good character.

(3) If evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that a defendant is a person of good character in a particular respect has been admitted, the hearsay rule, the opinion rule, the tendency rule and the credibility rule do not apply to evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is not a person of good character in that respect.

[emphasis added]


	
	It is clear that what had to be demonstrated was a positive intention to raise character, either generally or in a particular respect: see Gabriel v The Queen (1997) 76 FCR 279 at 296-7; and PGM v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 310; (2006) 164 A Crim R 426 at [35].
	
	
	Contrary to the submission of defence counsel, I was satisfied that, in the witness box, the accused deliberately and intentionally attempted to give the jury the impression that she was not a violent person at all, thereby raising her character in a further particular respect beyond her lack of a criminal record. I came to that view for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, her answer was discursive; in truth, the question of her barrister could have been answered directly and emphatically by saying something along the lines of “No, of course not”.
	
	
	Secondly, I believed that the words spoken inherently had a flavour of deliberateness.
	
	
	Thirdly, as I remarked to defence counsel during discussion, her discursiveness needed to be seen in the context of the accused having observed me repeatedly require direct answers to direct questions of many witnesses. Indeed, before the exchange in question, I had made the very same request of her twice during her evidence-in-chief.
	
	
	Fourthly, I did not accept the alternative grammatical reading proposed by defence counsel of what the accused said. Without being overly punctilious about prepositions, it could be said that, if the accused had truly been denying a propensity to enter into agreements to commit violence, as opposed to violence itself, then the preposition “with” would have been used in the second line of her answer, as opposed to the preposition “to”. And speaking more generally, I did not accept that the accused was seeking to make such a limited and highly artificial assertion as to deny agreements to commit violence, but not violence itself.
	
	
	In short, I considered that the essential preconditions for the application of the Crown contained in s 110 of the Act had been made out: there had been a positive, intentional assertion that the accused was (at the least, by implication) a person not prone to acts of violence.
	
	
	Turning to s 112 of the Act, it is as follows:
	


112 Leave required to cross-examine about character of accused or co-accused

A defendant must not be cross-examined about matters arising out of evidence of a kind referred to in this Part unless the court gives leave.


	
	There is no doubt that, by that section, Parliament has imposed an additional important fetter upon cross-examination of an accused person about his or her character (interestingly, as opposed to the leading of evidence in rebuttal of good character, with regard to which there is no requirement for leave).
	
	
	That fetter leads one to consider the factors enumerated in s 192(2) of the Act. Without extracting them verbatim, I briefly record my analysis of each of those factors.
	
	
	First, as for the extent to which granting leave would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, I considered that the topic could be dealt with in cross-examination in no more than 10 minutes: s 192(2)(a) of the Act.
	
	
	Secondly, as for the extent to which granting leave would be unfair to a party or to a witness, I considered that the adduction of the evidence rebutting good character could lead to unfairness to the accused, if used wrongly by the jury. To be weighed against that possibility was the fact that it would be unfair to the Crown for the evidence of the accused to be left uncontradicted: s 192(2)(b) of the Act.
	
	
	Thirdly, as for the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave was sought, I considered that the question of the good character or otherwise of the accused was certainly important, as it is in any criminal trial in which it is raised, and especially in light of the fact that the Crown case for murder bordered on the bizarre with regard to motive: s 192(2)(c) of the Act.
	
	
	Fourthly, as for the nature of the proceeding, I considered that the fact that this was a murder trial (as opposed to some less serious criminal prosecution) meant that it was important that all issues before the jury be able to be properly ventilated by both parties. As well as that, at the time I made my ruling, it was clear that the jury would have a transcript of the entirety of the evidence of the accused. That meant that it was impossible for the answer that she gave in evidence-in-chief to be “skated over” by agreement in the final addresses, or in my summing-up: s 192(2)(d) of the Act.
	
	
	Fifthly and finally, as for any power reposed in me to adjourn the hearing or to make another order, or give a direction in relation to the evidence, I considered that, other than granting leave on terms as I thought fit, no other ancillary order was reasonably practical. Separately, I bore in mind the undoubted need for me to direct the jury with unmistakable clarity about the use to which they could put evidence led in rebuttal of good character, and the uses to which they must not put such evidence: s 192(2)(e) of the Act.
	
	
	Bearing in mind the important fetter of leave that Parliament has imposed, and having analysed that fetter in accordance with s 192 of the Act, I came to the opinion that leave should be granted, albeit on strictly limited terms.
	
	
	Finally, turning to s 137 of the Act, I came to the view that, if para 8 of Voir Dire Exhibit A in its entirety had been permitted to form the foundation of cross-examination of the accused, then the prejudicial effect of that cross-examination on this murder trial would indeed have outweighed the probative value of the evidence rebutting good character.
	
	
	In particular, it can be seen from Voir Dire Exhibit A generally that the subject matter of the asserted dispute between the accused and the other young woman was allegedly Mr Perkins. And my understanding of the Crown case for murder in this trial was that part of the motivation for the offence could have been ill-feeling felt by the accused about the relationship between Mr Perkins and another young woman, Ashleigh Cornish. I took the view that that part of the rebutting evidence should not be permitted, pursuant to the combined effect of s 192 and s 137 of the Act.
	
	
	In the same vein, it can be seen from para 8 of Voir Dire Exhibit A that the accused allegedly made a threat of death against the young woman and her family. Again, a central part of the Crown case for murder was that the accused had openly announced her intention to kill the deceased shortly before she played a role in doing so. In her evidence-in-chief, the accused had firmly denied saying such a thing. Again, I thought that that aspect of para 8 of Voir Dire Exhibit A, if led merely to rebut evidence of good character, could be too prejudicial, especially with regard to the jury reflecting on a possible tendency to speak in such a way on the part of the accused. And I maintained that view despite whatever ameliorative directions I may have been able to craft.
	
	
	In short, I came to the view that the proposed evidence could not be led in cross-examination in its entirety. Having said that, I also came to the view that, if shorn of its most prejudicial aspects, it should be placed before the jury. In particular, I considered that not to permit the Crown to explore the evidence in cross-examination could lead to the jury being left with a completely false impression about the character of the accused.
	
	
	To summarise: I came to the view that the preconditions for the receipt of evidence rebutting good character had been established; that leave should be granted with regard to the evidence, but on strict terms; and that, once the evidence was shorn of its most prejudicial aspects, I should not refuse to admit the evidence pursuant to s 137 of the Act.
	
	
	Finally, of course, at the time I made the decision to permit the cross-examination, I was determined to give the jury clear directions in my summing-up about the very limited way in which the evidence rebutting good character could be used, and the ways in which it must not be used.
	


Orders


	
	In the event, I informed the parties that leave was granted to the Crown Prosecutor, but only if cross-examination occurred in a restricted way, and in general concordance with my determination.
	
	
	My actual determination was as follows:
	


Separately, I grant leave to the Crown Prosecutor to cross-examine the accused as follows:

1. Some years ago;

2. As part of a dispute with another young woman;

3. You pressed a small tree branch against her forehead;

4. And made a threat against her and her family;

5. To the extent that you said yesterday in-chief what appears at page 361, that was not correct.

…

The following aspects pertain:

(a) Those questions should be asked immediately, not at the end of cross-examination.

(b) I shall give my reasons later.

(c) Questions of a case in-reply are another matter that we will come to as necessary.

		03 August 2016",2016-07-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701243,NSW Police v Waddington [2016] NSWLC 12,"Judgment


	
	John Joseph Waddington is before the court today for sentence. He has pleaded guilty to a charge of negligent driving occasioning grievous bodily harm contrary to s 117(1)(b) of the Road Transport Act 2013. The matter came before me in a busy list at the Downing Centre Local Court on 19 July 2016. At that time I heard submissions from Mr Robinson, Solicitor, on behalf of the defendant. I then adjourned the matter until today so the sentencing task could be completed.
	
	
	The charges arise out of serious motor vehicle collision that occurred at Narrandera on 20 September 2015. The matter initially came before the Local Court at Leeton on 19 February 2016. At that time a plea of not guilty was entered. The matter then proceeded in that court and in the Local Court at Griffith until it was transferred to the Downing Centre Local Court upon a plea of guilty being entered. That occurred on 18 May 2016, being the fifth appearance before the court. A plea of guilty was not entered at the first available opportunity and accordingly the discount on penalty for that plea must be modified from what would otherwise have been appropriate had it been entered at the earliest possible time. I am of the view that an appropriate discount for the plea of guilty is in an amount of 15%, and note that it is permissible for the application of that discount to result in a different type of sentence being imposed than might otherwise have been the case: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32].
	
	
	The defendant is aged 65 years and is a heavy vehicle driver. In the early afternoon of Sunday 20 September 2015 at Narrandera, he was driving a very large truck which had two vehicle transport trailers attached. Upon those trailers were 11 motor vehicles. The defendant was transporting those vehicles to South Australia. I was told by Mr Robinson that the total weight of the vehicle being driven by the defendant was in the order of 50 tonnes. At the same time and place the victim in this matter Amanda Mohr was riding her Kawasaki 250 motorcycle. Both vehicles were being driven along the Sturt Highway towards Hay. The defendant's vehicle was travelling behind Ms Mohr’s motorcycle and had been for some time. The Sturt Highway is generally a single lane in each direction in the area. At about 1.54pm, the two vehicles came into collision in circumstances which give rise to the charge before the court.
	
	
	The facts reveal that at the collision scene the Sturt Highway curves right and that at the end of that curve is a right hand turn into Innisvale Lane. That right hand turn is clearly signposted. The victim was travelling west along the Sturt Highway with the intention of negotiating the right hand turn at Innisvale Lane. At the point where Innisvale Lane runs off the Sturt Highway, a lane opens in a west bound direction to allow vehicles in the position of the defendant's to pass on the left vehicles that are turning right. As Ms Mohr’s motorcycle slowed down preparing to make the right hand turn into Innisvale Lane, the vehicle driven by the defendant failed to slow and or stop appropriately and in an attempt to avoid a rear-end collision which may well have had fatal consequences, made a hard right turn into the east bound traffic lane. During this manoeuvre the rear passenger side of the defendant's truck and trailer clipped the right side of Ms Mohr’s motorcycle breaking the handle bar and causing her serious injuries. The defendant's truck managed to correct itself and stopped in the west bound lane approximately 100 metres from the point of the collision. Local persons and emergency services attended and Ms Mohr was flown to Canberra hospital. She was placed into an induced coma and remained in hospital for 8 days. Sadly she has suffered a severe injury to her right hand and she will never regain the full use of it. Her hand was degloved and she underwent a number of surgeries to correct the damage. I will return to the issue of Ms Mohr’s injury and the effect upon her in due course.
	
	
	Mr Robinson who appeared for the defendant noted that the accident had occurred on a sweeping right hand bend and that Ms Mohr had moved into the middle of the road prior to making what would have been a sweeping right hand turn into Innisvale Lane. He told me that the defendant had noticed her slowing and was aware that there was a right hand turn on that part of the road. He was apparently familiar with the roadway.
	
	
	In his ERISP the defendant said:
	


Suddenly, very suddenly, I was right up close to the bike. I can only think that the bike rider must’ve slowed very fast and I was, and the bike seemed to be in the middle of the road. There didn’t seem to be any indication that the bike rider was turning. I now know that turn off is there. There didn’t seem to be any indication that she was turning or going anywhere.

I interpolate that the victim says in her Victim Impact Statement that she had put her blinker on to turn right prior to the collision. I was told by Mr Robinson, and this was not challenged by Sgt Alzaim, that later examination of the motorcycle by police revealed that the blinker switch on the bike was not turned on. The facts tendered are silent on the matter and I cannot completely discount that this positioning of the blinker switch may have been the result of the significant impact which had occurred. In any event, the resolution of this fact does not effect in any meaningful way my assessment of the factual basis upon which I proceed to sentence.


	
	Mr Robinson told me that if his client had braked, his truck would have jack-knifed and may well have slid towards Ms Mohr, thus causing her further serious injury or worse. He says further that Ms Mohr’s movement towards the centre of the roadway prior to making her right hand turn meant that his client was unaware if she was pulling over to the left side of the road, and that in those circumstances it was not appropriate for him to pass her in the lane specifically designated for that purpose. He also says that had he done so he would have run the risk of tipping his truck over. The defendant contends in essence, that he had no choice but to seek to pass the motorcycle on the right as he did. His version is that as he passed the motorcycle, Ms Mohr turned her bike into him and struck the side of the truck. Of course that version is not consistent with the facts that were tendered and upon which I must proceed to sentence. Those facts suggest and I accept, that during the manoeuvre by the defendant seeking to pass Ms Mohr on the right, his truck and trailer “clipped” the right side of Ms Mohr’s motorcycle. The facts clearly contend that the truck struck Ms Mohr, not that she struck the truck. The defendant through his solicitor has conceded that he should not have crossed to the side of the road as he did and that it was this action which constituted his negligence.
	
	
	In my view the defendant's negligence is not limited to the manner of driving that he concedes. Whilst the defendant's action in seeking to pass Ms Mohr on the right hand side as he did is plainly negligent, it is also a function of other acts of negligence including his failing to keep an appropriate and proper lookout in all the circumstances, his failing to travel an appropriate and safe distance behind the motorcycle and of his failing to travel at a speed that was, in all the prevailing circumstances appropriate. This is so even if he was, as he contends, travelling within the sign posted speed limit. The fact that a person is driving within a speed limit does not mean that he or she is travelling at an appropriate speed in all the circumstances. These features of the defendant's driving which are to be considered in combination, involve a serious departure by him from the standard of care for other road users that is expected of an ordinary and prudent driver.
	
	
	As in any matter it is necessary for me to make an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending. This is to be done in part by having regard to the maximum penalty that has been prescribed by the Parliament. In this case, the charge of negligent driving occasioning grievous bodily harm carries with it upon conviction a maximum penalty of 20 penalty units and/or imprisonment for 9 months. The assessment will also have regard to the degree of negligence involved in the driving and the extent of the injuries that result: Gorladenchearau v R (2011) 34 VR 149. Given all of the circumstances, I find that the objective seriousness of the offending is at or about the mid-range. The fact that Parliament has deemed it appropriate to legislate that a term of imprisonment might be imposed for this offence indicates the seriousness with which the offence is to be regarded: R v Oliver (1980) 7 A Crim R 174.
	
	
	The defendant is a man of prior good character. He has no prior criminal history. Of course, prior good character is to be given less weight in cases where general deterrence is important, the offence is serious and the offence is one often committed by persons of otherwise good character: R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 527. He has a traffic record that extends over 48 years and while the record provided to the court stretches over a period of only 42 years, I am told and accept that there are no major offences on his record. Over the period that he has been driving (as disclosed by his traffic record) there are 17 entries where traffic infringement notices have been issued. Over such a lengthy period of time and given the fact that he has been employed as a long haul truck driver for more than 20 years, his traffic record is in my view a reasonable one.
	
	
	Tendered on the defendant's behalf was a document dated 9 July 2016 from Able Psychology and Assessment Services of West Gosford. That document indicated that the defendant had been referred by his general practitioner to Ms Angela Barry a Clinical and Health Psychologist for treatment of anxiety and depression under a mental health care plan. I note that his first appointment took place on 7 July 2016 just twelve days before his matter was listed for sentence. The report indicates that this was the first occasion that he had been referred to a psychologist. I have carefully read the psychologist's report and accept that the defendant is genuinely remorseful and feels real empathy for Ms Mohr. I do however note that the defendant has apparently reported to the psychologist that he was “shocked and demoralised by the misinterpretation of events adopted by Police in their Fact Sheet”. This indicates to me some reluctance by the defendant to fully accept his responsibility for the collision and its consequences. The effect of the accident upon him and the police retention of his log books for a number of months, coupled with restrictions placed on him by his employer, have meant that he has not been able to resume his employment as a driver on regular long haul trips. This has further added to his anxiety and has caused financial loss. He has been diagnosed by the psychologist as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and I have no reason to doubt that diagnosis.
	
	
	I note that the defendant has attended a Traffic Offender Intervention Program and I accept that like most other people who attend that program, he will have taken a good deal from it.
	
	
	I have been provided with a Victim Impact Statement by Ms Mohr dated 16 June 2016. While the statutory scheme for such statements set out within the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 does not have application in this matter, I am nevertheless required to have regard to the effect of the crime on the victim. Section 3A(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that one of the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an defendant is “to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community”. Similarly, section 21A(2)(g) invites the court to a consideration of the injury, emotional harm and loss or damage caused by an offence.
	
	
	There can be no doubt in this case that the harm suffered by Ms Mohr as a consequence of the defendant's criminal conduct has been and continues to be substantial. Her statement indicates that she suffered injuries to her head, neck, a fractured sternum and severe injuries to her right arm and hand. She underwent surgery to her right hand to repair and graft the severe degloving injury that she had sustained. That surgery involved the insertion of transferred K-wires through her right index metacarpal finger, open reduction and fixation of internal plates. She has poor function of the ring and little fingers on her right hand and describes those fingers as “essentially useless”. It has been suggested to her that her right little finger be amputated and that she requires further surgery on her right middle finger. In addition, she has suffered from dizziness, headaches, slurred speech, sensitivity to light, blurred vision and a ringing in her ears since the accident. These issues have required ongoing assessment and treatment by the South West Pain Injury Rehabilitation Unit. She is also said to have symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, is extremely depressed and has been referred for psychological counselling. She has ongoing severe pain. Prior to the accident she was right handed. It is not hard to appreciate the level of pain, discomfort and distress to which she has been exposed as a consequence of her injury. No doubt even the simplest of daily tasks would be difficult, particularly when one bears in mind the fact that she is a young woman of 34 years with 3 children who she provides for in the absence of support from a partner. She has attempted to compensate for the loss of function in her right hand by utilising her left hand however this is not without problems.
	
	
	Mr Robinson in his careful submissions urged me to consider dealing with the matter without recording a conviction and by the imposition of a bond pursuant to section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I note that the scope for the application of section 10 lessens when the offence itself is objectively serious, and factors such as general deterrence and denunciation are significant matters to be borne in mind. In the course of his address, Mr Robinson provided me with Sentencing Statistics for the offence as maintained by the Judicial Commission. These statistics demonstrate that for all offenders sentenced in the period July 2013 to December 2015 (a sample of 446), 29% were disposed of without the recording of a conviction, with the vast majority, 27%, being dealt with by section 10 bonds. By logical inference, 71% of all matters were disposed of in such a way as to result in a conviction being recorded. The statistics also indicate that for offenders who more closely mirror this defendant, with one charge only, no priors, a plea of guilty and aged more than 50 years, a sample of 106 cases, 47% were dealt with without conviction, 5% through a section 10 dismissal and 42% by the imposition of a section 10 bond. I have had cautious regard to these sentencing statistics consistent with what the Court of Criminal Appeal has indicated is the proper approach to be taken: Skocic v R [2014] NSWCCA 225 per Bellew J, Macfarlan JA and Fullerton J agreeing.
	
	
	In considering Mr Robinson’s submission, and in dealing overall with the sentence to be imposed, I am required to and have had regard to section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which sets out the seven purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender. They are:
	



	
	To ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence;
	
	
	To prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences;
	
	
	To protect the community from the offender;
	
	
	To promote the rehabilitation of the offender;
	
	
	To make the offender accountable for his actions;
	
	
	To denounce the conduct of the offender;
	
	
	To recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and to the community.
	



	
	The purpose of ensuring adequate punishment guards against the imposition of both unduly lenient and unduly harsh sentences. Put in simple terms, the punishment ought to fit the crime. In considering this purpose I am required to have regard to the objective seriousness of the offending. As I have already remarked I have determined the objective seriousness to be at or about the mid-range. There is also, it seems to me, a need for the court to impose a penalty that acts as a deterrent both to the defendant and others. Whilst I have concluded, given the defendant's lack of antecedent history, that the issue of specific deterrence has little role to play in this sentencing task, there is nonetheless a role for general deterrence. I am of the view that the purposes of community protection, accountability and denunciation also have a role to play. The defendant's management of the massive motor vehicle that he was in charge of at the relevant time fell so far short of what ought be expected of a reasonable and prudent driver, that the court, in the place of the community must, by the sentence imposed, express its complete abhorrence. It does not seem to me controversial that those who are licensed to drive vehicles of the type that the defendant was licensed to drive are required to exercise the utmost skill and attention in doing so. Drivers in these circumstances must be hyper vigilant. When they fail to manage the vehicle under their control as they ought, the consequences to innocent members of the community can be severe, as evidenced by this case.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the defendant has good prospects of rehabilitation and that the orders I will shortly impose will promote that. I have already made some comment on the harm done to the victim. The injuries that she has sustained will undoubtedly have lengthy and ongoing consequences for her.
	
	
	When considering the purposes of section 3A it is in my view clear that this is not a case that would appropriately be dealt with in the absence of the recording of a conviction. To take such a course would be unduly lenient and would not properly reflect what the Parliament has said are the purposes in respect of which a sentence is to be imposed, and the overall objective seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	Balancing all of the relevant factors I have concluded that the matter can be finalised by the imposition of a fine and with the defendant entering into a bond to be of good behaviour pursuant to the provisions of section 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The conclusion I have reached in this regard means that I must also turn my mind to the question of the disqualification from driving of the defendant. The question I must ask myself is “Are there reasons that would entitle me to depart from the automatic period of disqualification?” I have reached the conclusion, having regard to the generally reasonable traffic record of the defendant, his attendance at a Traffic Offender Intervention Program and his good prospects of rehabilitation that I would be entitled in all the circumstances to so depart.
	
	
	The Orders of the Court are as follows:
	



	
	The defendant is convicted. He is fined the sum of $1,100.
	
	
	Further, he is ordered to enter into a bond pursuant to the provisions of section 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to be of good behaviour for a period of 18 months. The conditions of the bond are that he is to be of good behaviour and appear for sentence if called upon and that he is to notify the Registrar of this Court of any change of his residential address.
	
	
	In addition, the defendant is to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driver’s licence pursuant to the Road Transport legislation for a period of 15 months.

2701251,R v Hatzisavvas; R v Lopez-Rios [2016] NSWCCA 147,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and sentence

Mr Hatzisavvas

On 14 October 2014 Mr Hatzisavvas [Hatzisavvas] pleaded guilty in the Local Court to two counts of supplying a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty for each offence is imprisonment for life. There is a standard non-parole period of 15 years.


	
	On 7 August 2015 Flannery SC DCJ sentenced Hatzisavvas to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 8 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 5 years. That sentence was to commence on 28 August 2013 and expire on 27 November 2021. The non-parole period will expire on 27 August 2018.
	
	
	Hatzisavvas received a combined discount of 33 per cent for his pleas of guilty (25 per cent) and for his assistance to authorities (8 per cent).
	
	
	The indicative sentences were:
	


Count 1 – Imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months.

Count 2 – Imprisonment for 7 years 3 months with a non-parole period of 4 years 3 months.

Mr Lopez-Rios


	
	On 14 October 2014 Mr Lopez-Rios [Lopez-Rios] pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the same two charges as Hatzisavvas.
	
	
	On 28 August 2015 Flannery SC DCJ sentenced Lopez-Rios to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months. The sentence commenced 28 August 2013 and will expire on 27 August 2022. The non-parole period will expire on 27 February 2019. Lopez-Rios received a discount of 25 per cent for his pleas of guilty.
	
	
	The indicative sentences found by her Honour were:
	


Count 1 – Imprisonment for 6 years 9 months with a non-parole period of 4 years.

Count 2 – Imprisonment for 8 years 3 months with a non-parole period of 5 years.


	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed against both aggregate sentences, pursuant to s 5E(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In respect of Hatzisavvas the Notice of Appeal was served on 17 September 2015. In respect of Lopez-Rios the Notice of Appeal was served on 19 September 2015.
	
	
	In each matter the Crown relies upon a single ground of appeal particularised as follows:
	


Ground 1: The aggregate sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate.

(i)   The sentencing judge failed to properly assess the objective seriousness of the offences.

(ii)   The overall indicative sentences individually were manifestly inadequate having regard to the criminality involved and the need for general deterrence. Further the indicative sentences arrived at for each count did not adequately reflect the differing degrees of criminality involved; and

(iii)   The degrees of notional accumulation were inadequate and failed to reflect the totality of the criminality of the two offences in each instance.

Factual Background


	
	In both matters Agreed Facts were tendered. Apart from minor differences, the Agreed Facts are the same for both respondents.
	
	
	In June 2013 police began an investigation into the criminal activities of Li Wei Dong (Li). This included the use of undercover police officers, surveillance and telephone intercepts. During the investigation the police became aware of the behaviour of the two respondents and Mr Beyhoon Kucuk [Kucuk].
	
	
	On 8 August 2013 an undercover operative contacted Li by phone and negotiated the supply of 1 kilogram of methylamphetamine for $220,000. Later that day, Li met with two undercover police officers at a hotel in Mascot to discuss the sale. Li provided a small sample of the drug and told the officers that this drug was cheaper, costing $190,000, and that he had 10 kilograms available for supply. The undercover officers agreed to buy 1 kilogram.
	
	
	Li then contacted Kucuk to arrange the supply. Kucuk told Li that he needed to go to Chinatown first and that he would then contact him. Police later saw Kucuk meet the two respondents in a restaurant in Chinatown. Kucuk then drove to meet Li at the Mascot Hotel. A short time later, the two respondents arrived at the hotel. Hatzisavvas was carrying a paper bag containing a number of packages making up one kilogram of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	The two respondents were met in the hotel lobby by Kucuk and taken to the eleventh floor. Kucuk took Hatzisavvas into a room to meet Li. Lopez-Rios waited near the lifts with another man (Moustafa). Hatzisavvas, Li and Kucuk discussed the drug sale and the location of the money. Li tested a sample of the drug and Hatzisavvas asked for confirmation that $190,000 was available. Li assured him that it was.
	
	
	A short time later one of the undercover officers entered the room and asked Hatzisavvas whether all the packages of drugs were the same. He reassured the officer saying “Absolutely. If there’s a problem you can call me and I’ll fix the problem. One hundred per cent.”
	
	
	Hatzisavvas and Li went into another room on the floor. Inside that room Hatzisavvas handed the officer the bag containing the drugs in exchange for $190,000 in cash. Inside the paper bag were five packages wrapped in black electrical tape. Within each package was 200 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 79 per cent. The packaging also contained remnants of a black granular charcoal like substance.
	
	
	The two respondents left the hotel with $140,000. This was after Kucuk was given $30,000 and Li was given $20,000. The respondents caught a taxi to an apartment in Zetland.
	
	
	Police continued their investigation into the respondents’ activities. On 28 August 2013 police became aware that they intended to meet an unknown male. Throughout that day Hatzisavvas was in phone contact with Lopez-Rios and discussed who to meet and what to say. The respondents also discussed changing their mobile phones. Later that day, in a further conversation Lopez-Rios said: “Let’s go Malaka and get the things” to which Hatzisavvas said “Huh”. Lopez-Rios said “Let’s go and get the things” to which Hatzisavvas said “What thing … the Aboriginal?”.
	
	
	Subsequently the respondents were seen catching a taxi. Lopez-Rios had a large black suitcase with him. They travelled by taxi to an address in Glebe where they met Robert Johnston and entered his house. A short time later, they travelled back to Zetland. They still had the suitcase but it appeared to be much heavier.
	
	
	Police believe that Robert Johnston is “the Aboriginal”.
	
	
	Police executed a search warrant at the Zetland apartment later that night. Both respondents were present. Police found the black suitcase. Inside were four brown paper bags. Three were sealed and one was ripped open. Each had a label which suggested that they had come from Mexico. Each of the bags contained smaller vacuum sealed bags containing a black granular charcoal like substance. Buried inside were smaller packages containing methylamphetamine. Each package weighed between 190 and 220 grams. Two packages were found loose in the suitcase. A fifth brown bag was found in a cupboard. It contained the same charcoal like substance and smaller packages of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	The packaging of these drugs was the same size as those supplied to the undercover police officers two weeks earlier. A total of 47 plastic bags were found. Digital scales and 10 mobile phones were also seized. $1,200 was found on Lopez-Rios. Analysis revealed that all 12 bank-notes came from the money used by the undercover operatives to purchase the drugs on 12 August. $1,000 of $1,500 used by Hatzisavvas to pay the rent was also found to be part of the “buy” money. A total of 9.42019 kilograms with a purity of over 80 per cent was seized.
	
	
	The next day police returned to the Zetland premises and upon further inspection, discovered six bottles labelled “tequila” in a box. The bottles were later examined and found to contain 3.964 kilograms of liquid methylamphetamine with a purity of 20 per cent. Fingerprints from Lopez-Rios were on one of the bottles and on two of the brown paper bags. Robert Johnston’s fingerprints were found on an opened paper bag. The combined quantity of methylamphetamine seized from the apartment was 13.384 kilograms.
	


Sentence judgment – Hatzisavvas


	
	Having reviewed the factual background to the claim, her Honour summarised the submissions of the Crown and Hatzisavvas as to the seriousness of the offending. Her Honour set out her conclusion on this issue as follows:
	


“Each offence is self-evidently serious. The offender had ready access to large quantities of methamphetamine and was involved in the supply of it for profit.

I agree with Mr Boulten that of the two Mr Lopez-Rios appeared to be the one making the decisions, however, as the Crown pointed out they were living together in the apartment at Zetland where the drugs were found and seemed to be operating together.

The quantity involved in count 1 does place that offence below the middle of the range of objective seriousness but not appreciably so and I agree with Mr Boulten that count 2 is a mid-range offence.

Madam Crown submitted that I would conclude that the offences were aggravated as they were part of an organised criminal activity.

Mr Boulten submitted that I would not reach that conclusion as that fact is inherent in matters of this kind.

I agree with Mr Boulten.” (Sentence judgment 6.9, 7.1 – 7.5)


	
	By reference to a psychologist’s report, letters from friends and family and a certification from the “Breakout Program” her Honour summarised the subjective case of Hatzisavvas as follows:
	


“He is the eldest of three siblings of his Greek parents and was born in Australia in April 1970. He has a minor criminal history which I do not consider to be of much relevance here. When he was seven the family moved to Greece where his father worked, making marble. The offender described to Ms Wakely a positive and relaxed lifestyle in Greece and said that he was provided with a good education and that his parents ensured he continued private English lessons to maintain the language.

When he was 20 he returned here independently and spent the following year living with his relatives until the remainder of his family also returned.

He has had a number of romantic relationships in the past and lived with a number of partners for periods of time. However his last serious relationship took place around seven years ago and ended after two years due to his lifestyle choices at that time.

In the future he would like to settle down and have a family.

He has various friends who visit him in gaol. They are mostly a positive influence and have their own businesses and families.

He finished high school in Greece and excelled at sport. Upon his return to Australia he completed a one year course in computer programming through Randwick College, then got a job with a mechanical engineering company and remained there for a few years. Following that he went to university to become a PE teacher. However he only completed 18 months of the degree before winning Lotto and withdrawing from his degree.

He won one million dollars on Lotto in 1996 and then bought four units which provided him with a considerable income. He later traded shares on the stock market and purchased a shop, which he owned until 2003. He was doing well until 2001 when his use of substances increased and became problematic, ultimately leading to poor financial decisions and financial problems.

He was then forced to sell his properties to cover his debts and regain control over his finances. However he continued to engage in a negative cycle of substance abuse and poor monetary management which ultimately led to him losing all of his assets and money by approximately 2010.

After his Lotto win he started consuming large amounts of alcohol. He then started using cocaine in social settings as at that time everyone wanted to be his friend and over time he came into contact with numerous people who also used cocaine. His life became a constant party.

Between 2000 and 2010 he used cocaine each day. Over time and as his money dwindled his use also slowed and his social network changed but when he had money he would resume frequent use. However he told Ms Wakely that when he had no money “no-one wanted to know me”. He told Ms Wakely that prior to his arrest he was using cocaine regularly. He also told her that he knew of people who were involved in offences of this kind and thought he would take a chance to make money and get back on his feet.

He said he hoped to repay his debts of $100,000 and then get back to work. He feels sorry for his mother who gave him everything and he told Ms Wakely that “I shamed the family, I feel sorry and ashamed”.” (Sentence judgment 7.7 – 9.4)


	
	Her Honour found that since being in gaol Hatzisavvas had completed the Breakout Program and was currently completing a computer course. For 17 months he had been a supervisor of inmates who refurbish Qantas headsets. He would like to pursue further study while in custody and hoped to obtain the necessary tickets for demolition work.
	
	
	Upon his release he intended to live with his parents and hoped to purchase a business such as a shop or a delivery service. He told Ms Wakely that he was aware that substance abuse clouded his mind and that since ceasing substance abuse, he was thinking more clearly. He told her that being in custody had motivated him to change his lifestyle.
	
	
	Her Honour reviewed the test results obtained by Ms Wakely. Despite the use of substances being reduced, Ms Wakely found that he still met the criteria for psychological dependence compulsive use. The test results indicated that his level of intelligence was extremely low. Ms Wakely accepted that this may have been an underestimate but her impression was that he was of below average intelligence.
	
	
	Ms Wakely gave a very positive prognosis for his rehabilitation. Her Honour accepted that Hatzisavvas appreciated the seriousness of his conduct and that he was genuinely sorry for the shame which he had brought upon his family. Her Honour accepted the assessment of Ms Wakely and found that Hatzisavvas was in a low risk category of re-offending. Her Honour qualified these findings by noting that because he had not lived a normal lifestyle since 1996, only time would tell whether he would be able to return to an ordinary life upon release. Her Honour took into account his strong family support and the absence of a significant criminal history.
	
	
	Her Honour found that Hatzisavvas had provided some information to the authorities, which was truthful and accurate, and of some value as intelligence. Her Honour regarded that assistance as indicative of remorse and that it pointed towards the unlikelihood of him offending in the future. Taken with his early plea of guilty, her Honour assessed Hatzisavvas as entitled to a discount on sentence of 33 per cent.
	
	
	In relation to totality, her Honour said:
	


“In Mr Boulten’s submission I needed to be careful not to double count as the offences were committed as part of a course of conduct involving the same source of the drugs and so he submitted although there should be some partial degree of accumulation it need not be great.

Madam Crown submitted that there should be some degree of accumulation as it cannot be said that the criminality for one offence is wholly comprehended in the elements of the other offence.” (Sentence judgment 11.9 – 12.1)

“I accept that the offender committed each offence as part of a course of conduct. However the offences are separate and distinct and so I propose to reflect in the aggregate sentence I impose a degree of partial accumulation.” (Sentence judgment 12.9)


	
	Her Honour received submissions as to the relative importance of the part played by Mr Hatzisavvas in the drug supply. Her Honour noted that she had sentenced Kucuk in relation to count 1 and in relation to a proceeds offence on a Form 1. She characterised Kucuk’s function as that of a high level broker who facilitated the coming together of the buyer and seller for a not insignificant commission. Her Honour noted that Kucuk, who was aged 44 at the time of sentence, had a criminal history which included serious firearms offences and a supply a prohibited drug offence for which he received a sentence of imprisonment. Her Honour commenced her sentence calculations for Kucuk at 10 years and then reduced them by 60 per cent for his plea of guilty and assistance.
	
	
	Her Honour then said:
	


“In those circumstances, and having regard to what the offender did, Mr Boulten submitted I would conclude that although the offender was further back in the line of distribution than Mr Kucuk, his moral culpability was not significantly higher than Mr Kucuk’s and was less than Mr Lopez-Rios’ having regard to the fact that Lopez-Rios was directing the offender on the 27th and 28 August and kept his distance from the actual transaction on 12 August, which in Mr Boulten’s submission suggests he was further up the hierarchy than this offender.

Obviously there are significant differences between the cases of Mr Kucuk and the offender, which work in Mr Kucuk’s favour, including the discount of 60% against the discount of 33%. However, he had a matter on a form 1, which I took into account, and he was not entitled to the leniency I am satisfied this offender is entitled to, having regard to Mr Kucuk’s earlier serious criminal offending.

So far as their respective offending is concerned, I agree with Mr Boulten that it is about the same level as Mr Kucuk’s was as Mr Kucuk was in contact with Mr Li on the one hand, and the offender and Lopez-Rios on the other, and as I accept the offender was unlikely to have received much more of a reward for his role than Mr Kucuk received.” (Sentence judgment 14.1 – 14.8)


	
	Her Honour referred to the sentencing principles in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Her Honour noted the Judicial Commission statistics which had been placed before her on behalf of Hatzisavvas and said:
	


“… statistics are a blunt tool as they tell me nothing about the offence or the offender but they are of some value as a reference point. I also recognise that no two cases are the same. However, I have found the cases of some assistance.” (Sentence judgment 15.1)


	
	Her Honour then imposed the sentence to which reference has already been made.
	


Sentence judgment – Lopez-Rios


	
	In relation to the seriousness of the offending, her Honour said:
	


“Mr Rahme, who appeared for the offender, accepted that what was involved here was a serious course of conduct and that the offender had a very hands on role in relation to each offence.

Neither the Crown nor Mr Rahme wanted to be heard against the conclusions I expressed when I sentenced Mr Hatzisavvas, that is that I would not conclude that count 1 was as high as in the middle of the range of objective seriousness and in relation to count 2, I would find that it was no higher than the middle of the range.

Each offence is self-evidently serious. The offender had ready access to large quantities of methylamphetamine and was involved in the supply of it for profit. As I found when I sentenced Mr Hatzisavvas, the quantity involved in count 1 does place that offence below the middle of the range of objective seriousness but not appreciably so and I consider that count 2 was a mid range offence.” (Sentence judgment 6.3 – 6.8)


	
	In the course of the sentence proceedings, the following exchange took place between the Crown and her Honour:
	


“CROWN: Your Honour, when it comes to the aspect of parity, our position is that the starting penalty is the same for Mr Hatzisavvas as it is for Mr Lopez Rios and that there are minor differences in the way they dealt with things, but they were certainly there as a joint enterprise at all times, and there is only a marginal difference in Mr Lopez Rios’s facts, and that’s the fourth and fifth line relating to the large quantity in late August. The difference therefore becomes, notwithstanding Mr Lopez Rios has subjective material which is different to that of Mr Hatzisavvas, our position is still that the Court would look at the commencing sentences being the same, but Mr Lopez Rios does not have the benefit of the discount that Mr Hatzisavvas did have and Mr Kucuk in a slightly greater extent, and Mr Kucuk only had one charge as well.

HER HONOUR: My starting point for Mr Hatzisavvas in respect of count 1, I think was nine years.

…

And in respect of count 2 … with 11 years. So they’re the figures that you suggest

CROWN: They’re the figures that the Court would apply in sentencing Mr Lopez Rios.

HER HONOUR: Yes, all right, thank you, Madam Crown. ….”

(Transcript 21.8.2015, p3)


	
	By relying on a report of Dr Nielssen, psychiatrist, other medical reports and references, her Honour summarised the subjective case of Lopez-Rios.
	


“The offender is 36. He has a limited criminal history which I do not consider should deprive him of leniency.

He was born and raised in Pereira Colombia where he spent the first 19 years of life going to school and doing three years of a civil engineering degree.

He arrived in Australia in 2000 to study English.

He later worked and established a business in the construction industry and became a citizen.

In 2005 he was diagnosed with testicular cancer and lost his testicles. As a result he now has monthly testosterone injections and cannot have children. It is a concern to him that he does not know how much damage the medication is doing to his liver and kidneys although he is grateful for the medical attention.

His five year relationship then broke up and his depression, which he had developed as a result of the cancer, got worse and he closed his business and decided to go to Colombia and spend some time with his family.

Each of his parents now have cancer.

He came back to Australia and was introduced to methylamphetamine and before he knew it was addicted to it.” (Sentence judgment 7.3 – 7.9)


	
	Her Honour noted that Lopez-Rios had tried to be as productive as he could while in custody and had done a number of courses including the SMART Program. He had returned to religious worship and the gaol chaplain commented favourably on his co-operation with prison staff and compliance with prison routines.
	
	
	Her Honour noted that Dr Nielssen believed that Lopez-Rios had a good prognosis and good prospects of rehabilitation having regard to the circumstances in which he developed his drug addiction which led to the offending. Her Honour largely adopted that conclusion and found:
	


“I am satisfied that the offender appreciates the seriousness of his conduct and the devastating impact drug use can have on people. I am also satisfied that he is sorry for the shame he has brought upon his family. I am satisfied that he has good prospects of rehabilitation having regard to his age, his solid work history, and as I was particularly impressed with the contents of his letter, which suggests that he has real insight into his situation.” (Sentence judgment 9.4)


	
	In relation to totality, her Honour said:
	


“Madam Crown submitted there should be some degree of accumulation as it cannot be said that the criminality for one offence is wholly comprehended in the elements of the other offence.” (Sentence judgment 9.3)

“I accept that the offender committed each offence as part of a course of conduct however the offences are separate and distinct and so I propose to reflect in the aggregate sentence I impose a degree of partial accumulation.” (Sentence judgment 9.7)


	
	In relation to the position of Lopez-Rios in the drug supply organisation, her Honour said:
	


“The parties here suggested that I would find the criminality of Mr Hatzisavvas and the offender to be about the same despite the submissions to the contrary that had been made by Mr Boulten who appeared for Mr Hatzisavvas, and that apart from the s 23 factor, I would deal with the offender in much the same way as I had dealt with Mr Hatzisavvas.

I propose to do so. Although when I sentenced Mr Hatzisavvas I agreed with Mr Boulten that of the offender and Mr Hatzisavvas, the offender appeared to be the one making the decisions. I did not find this a significant matter as I accepted the Crown’s submission that they were living together at the place the drugs were found and seemed to be operating together. I have found that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation whereas I found Mr Hatzisavvas’ were reasonable. And I have found that the offender was remorseful.” (Sentence judgment 10.9 – 11.4)

Crown submissions


	
	The Crown did not rely upon any cases as setting out a range of sentences for offences of this kind or as providing guidance as to an appropriate range. The Crown did point out that all of the cases to which her Honour was referred by the respondents concerned the supply of ecstasy. None concerned the supply of methylamphetamine. The Crown accepted that under the only ground of appeal relied upon, it had to establish that the aggregate sentences were “unreasonable or plainly unjust”.
	
	
	In relation to its first particular of inadequacy, i.e. a failure by her Honour to properly assess the objective seriousness of the offending, the Crown accepted that an assessment of this kind involved an evaluative process and the exercise of a discretion and as such, it was reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 (Mulato v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [46], Gall v R; Gall v R [2015] NSWCCA 69 at [125]). The Crown submitted that such an error had occurred in this case.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that her Honour should have found that both offences were above the middle of the range for offences of this kind. The Crown relied upon concessions by senior counsel for Hatzisavvas (which were implicitly accepted in the sentence proceedings of Lopez-Rios). It was accepted on behalf of Hatzisavvas that these were serious examples of each offence and demonstrated a serious course of conduct in which the offenders played a very “hands on” role. It was also accepted that Hatzisavvas played “an essential role”, was “quite a central figure” and was involved for financial gain. The Crown submitted that in addition to the increase in the quantity of methylamphetamine, it was clear from the telephone intercepts and conduct of the respondents in relation to the second count, that further supply activities were imminent. The Crown submitted that by reference to the money involved in the first supply, the drugs involved in the second count would have involved transactions approaching the $2 million mark.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that for count 1, in respect of both respondents, her Honour was unduly influenced by the quantity of methylamphetamine and did not properly appreciate the part played by them. The Crown submitted that her Honour focused too much upon count 1 and the circumstances surrounding it and did not adequately assess the seriousness of the offending and the criminality involved in count 2. Had she done so she would have assessed count 2 as substantially in excess of the midrange. This was particularly so when one had regard to the high purity (80%) of this extremely addictive and dangerous substance. The Crown submitted that her Honour had no regard to those matters nor to what the respondent stood to gain in relation to count 2 had the supply proceeded to finality.
	
	
	In relation to its second particular of inadequacy, the Crown submitted that the indicative sentences showed a flaw in her Honour’s reasoning in that her Honour made no mention of general deterrence and denunciation apart from a general reference to s 3A of the Sentencing Act. The Crown submitted that in a case such as this where a large commercial quantity of drugs was involved, general deterrence was of prime importance. The Crown submitted that it was clear from the start points chosen for the indicative sentences that insufficient, if any, regard was had to the principle of general deterrence. In making that submission the Crown accepted that the appeal was not against the indicative sentences but against the aggregate sentence. In that regard, the Crown relied upon the statement of principle in R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199 at [17] by Grove AJ (with whom Macfarlan JA and McCallum J agreed) that an “erroneous approach in the indication of the sentence that would have been imposed for the offence may well reveal error in the aggregate sentence reached”. The Crown referred also to PD v R [2012] NSWCCA 242 at [44] per Beech-Jones J (with whom Basten JA and Hall J agreed); R v Rae [2013] NSWCCA 9 at [33] per Button J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Price J agreed).
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the indicative sentences failed to have regard to the two important guideposts available to her Honour, i.e. the maximum penalty of life imprisonment and the standard non-parole period of 15 years. The Crown stressed that these guideposts were applicable to each of the offences for which her Honour was sentencing. The Crown submitted that the indicative sentences, in particular the non-parole periods, did not appear to have regard to the guideposts and most importantly, failed to reflect the degrees of criminality involved in each offence. The Crown submitted that by reference to the difference in seriousness between count 2 and count 1, the relativity between the starting points for the indicative sentences, i.e. a difference of 2 years, revealed error.
	
	
	In relation to its third particular, i.e. insufficient accumulation, the Crown accepted that with an aggregate sentence the process of accumulation is notional (R v Brown at [35] per Grove AJ) and that the degree of concurrence and accumulation was only implicit since the indicative sentences are not actually imposed (Cullen v R [2014] NSWCCA 162 at [26] per Adamson J). The Crown sought to rely upon the notional accumulation as indicating an error in reasoning and approach by her Honour. It was therefore possible to determine the likely notional accumulation and sentence structure because there were only two indicative sentences for each respondent.
	
	
	Following that approach, the Crown submitted that 12 months accumulation (for Hatzisavvas) and 9 months accumulation (for Lopez-Rios) was patently inadequate given the different and serious nature of the criminality involved in each of the offences. On that issue, the Crown relied upon its submissions in relation to the other particulars of manifest inadequacy.
	


Lopez-Rios submissions


	
	Lopez-Rios relied upon R v Cimone [2001] NSWCCA 98; 121 A Crim R 433 where Beazley JA (Studdert and Sperling JJ agreeing) said in relation to a Crown appeal:
	


“27 Cosovan’s sentence, on its face, also appears to be manifestly inadequate. If it is, the principle stated in Diamond and Steele would apply. However, there has been no Crown appeal in the case against Cosovan. Indeed, the Crown, in a practical sense, has shut itself out of an appeal in that case by expressly accepting before the sentencing judge that the sentence imposed on Cimone was the benchmark against which Cosovan’s sentence should be measured.”


	
	Lopez-Rios submitted that in accordance with that statement of principle, the Crown was precluded from appealing against the sentence imposed on him because it had conceded in his sentence proceedings that parity principles warranted notional “starting points” commensurate with those arrived at by her Honour in sentencing Hatzisavvas. Lopez-Rios noted that Hatzisavvas had been sentenced on 7 August 2015, i.e. three weeks before he was sentenced (28 August 2015). Lopez-Rios noted that the sentencing judge was not informed at the time that he was sentenced that a Crown appeal was being contemplated in the Hatzisavvas matter.
	
	
	Lopez-Rios submitted that having invited her Honour in the sentencing proceeding to strictly apply the parity principle, and not having told her Honour about any anticipated appeal against the Hatzisavvas sentence, the Crown now argued that her Honour had erred in complying with its submissions. In those circumstances, just as in R v Cimone, Lopez-Rios submitted that the Crown had shut itself out of an appeal against the sentence imposed in his case.
	
	
	Lopez-Rios submitted that the Crown’s submissions concerning accumulation and the misapplication of the principle of totality were misconceived. In that regard, Lopez-Rios relied upon what was said by R A Hulme J (with whom Leeming JA and McCallum J agreed) in R v Jennar [2014] NSWCCA 331:
	


66   The last mentioned of the Crown's submissions may be despatched immediately. In assessing whether a sentence for multiple offences (whether it be an aggregate sentence or otherwise) is excessive or inadequate, it is quite arbitrary to identify one of the components and then regard the balance as being referrable to all of the other components. It is as illegitimate as arguing that the indicative sentences for the Water Board Bowling Club robbery offence and the shooting offence add up to more than the aggregate sentence and so the respondent must not have received anything for the three other offences. Indeed, counsel for the Crown almost conceded the futility of such an approach four paragraphs earlier in her written submissions.

67   I have earlier referred to some of the authorities relating to totality and questions of concurrency and accumulation: see, particularly, the summary of principles provided by Hall J in R v XX at [52]. The sentencing judge, as observed earlier, stated that he had regard to such principles. The question is whether the final result reflects that he correctly applied them.”


	
	Lopez-Rios submitted that the Crown was unable to make out its ground of manifest inadequacy because it had not referred to any cases which established a range of sentences or provided some guidance as to what would be an appropriate range.
	
	
	In that regard, Lopez-Rios relied upon The Queen v Pham [2015] HCA 39 (French CJ, Keane and Nettle JJ) where their Honours said:
	


“28   Previous decisions of this Court have laid down in detail the way in which the assessment of sentences in other cases is to be approached. It is neither necessary, therefore, nor of assistance to repeat all of what has previously been said. But, in view of the way in which the Court of Appeal approached the task in this case, it is appropriate to re-emphasise the following:

…

(7)    Appellate intervention on the ground of manifest excessiveness or inadequacy is not warranted unless, having regard to all of the relevant sentencing factors, including the degree to which the impugned sentence differs from sentences that have been imposed in comparable cases, the appellate court is driven to conclude that there must have been some misapplication of principle.”


	
	Lopez-Rios submitted that assistance could be provided to this Court by the decision in R v Li [2014] NSWCCA 327. The principal judgment was delivered by Fullerton J (with whom R A Hulme and Garling JJ agreed). The facts were that a complaint of manifest inadequacy was upheld in respect of a sentence of 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months. That sentence was imposed following a plea of guilty to the offence of knowingly take part in the supply of 24.9782 kilograms of methylamphetamine. A wholly concurrent sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 4 months, was imposed for another offence of conspiracy to supply 1 kilogram of methylamphetamine. Lopez-Rios submitted that the facts in Li represented criminality of a significantly higher order than his. He submitted that in Li there was an ongoing and salaried recruitment, involvement in a much greater quantity of drugs and cash and a willing commitment to a well entrenched and sophisticated criminal syndicate operating from overseas.
	
	
	Lopez-Rios submitted that the 9 month differential in the respective head sentences between him and Hatzisavvas did not support a conclusion that “there must have been some misapplication of principle” in the sentence imposed by her Honour in his case. He submitted that the sentence in his case demonstrated a consistency in the application of principle with the approach taken by this Court in Li.
	


Hatzisavvas submissions


	
	The oral submissions by Hatzisavvas differed somewhat from the written submissions. He did not, however, abandon his written submissions.
	
	
	In relation to the Crown’s first particular, Hatzisavvas stressed the discretionary nature of an assessment of objective seriousness and relied upon the principles set out in Mulato v Regina.
	
	
	In relation to the Crown’s second particular, Hatzisavvas emphasised his strong subjective case to which her Honour had regard. At the time of sentence, he was aged 45 and facing prison for the first time. He had pleaded guilty at an early stage in the proceedings and had provided some assistance to authorities. His prior criminal record was inconsequential and he was entitled to a measure of leniency. He had a long standing addiction to prohibited drugs at the time and was of limited intelligence. He was genuinely remorseful and had good prospects of rehabilitation. His subjective case was significantly stronger than that of Kucuk.
	
	
	In relation to the failure to mention general deterrence, Hatzisavvas relied upon R (Cth) v Nguyen; R (Cth) v Nguyen [2010] NSWCCA 331 where a similar complaint was made. There Simpson J (Hall and Garling JJ agreeing) said:
	


“44   I would reject that contention. The issue of general deterrence is fundamental to any sentencing decision, and is known to be of particular importance in offences involving drugs. I would not infer that this was overlooked. Rather, I would infer that, by reason of its very primacy, it called for no express statement (although, I would add, it would generally be wise at least to record that it has been taken into account).”


	
	In relation to particular 3 of the Crown’s appeal, Hatzisavvas submitted that while the offending in count 2 was more serious than that in count 1, the only obvious difference between the two offences was the additional quantity of the drug in count 2. He submitted that otherwise the features of the offending were the same in each case. There was no evidence of the plans which were on foot for the sale of the drugs involved in count 2. He submitted that there was a connection between the two counts and that the offences were committed within a relatively short period of time and were part of a course of conduct. He accepted that some accumulation was appropriate and that her Honour had taken that into account in the aggregate sentence.
	
	
	In oral submissions, Hatzisavvas focused upon the issue of parity and the residual discretion which had to be exercised in a Crown appeal.
	
	
	In relation to parity, he adopted the submission of Lopez-Rios that the acceptance in argument by the Crown of the adequacy of the indicative sentences in his (Hatzisavvas) proceeding meant that the Crown was precluded from appealing against the aggregate sentence imposed on him. Hatzisavvas submitted that in those circumstances, it would offend the parity principle for his sentence to be increased. He submitted that this would bring about the very situation which occurred in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 which the High Court said should be avoided. Because of this concession by the Crown, it would be unfair and create disparity if his sentence was increased but that of Lopez-Rios was not, because of the Crown’s conduct.
	
	
	In relation to the exercise of the residual discretion, Hatzisavvas submitted that in the sentence proceedings of Lopez-Rios, not only did the Crown accede to the same indicative sentences being found as in his case but it was a party to proposing such a course of action. He submitted that in the exercise of its residual discretion this of itself should cause the Court to refrain from interfering with the sentence imposed on him if the Court were disposed to do.
	
	
	Hatzisavvas submitted that there was no issue of principle involved in that the principles for the sentencing of offenders convicted for the supply of large commercial quantities of prohibited drugs were well understood. The sentence imposed upon him was not derisory. He relied upon the statement in R v Robert Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 by Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing) at [70] that:
	


“70   … the purpose of a Crown appeal is not simply to increase an erroneous sentence imposed upon a particular individual. It has a wider purpose, being to achieve consistency in sentencing and the establishment of sentencing principles. That purpose can be achieved to a very significant extent by a statement of this Court that the sentences imposed upon the respondent were wrong and why they were wrong. ...”

Consideration


	
	The principles applicable to a Crown appeal are now well understood. A claim of manifest inadequacy requires the Crown to establish that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust in a sentencing environment where there is no single “correct” sentence and judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with the application of proper principle and consistency of approach (Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6]; Makarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]; Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [58]).
	
	
	Uniformity of sentencing is a matter of great importance in maintaining confidence in the administration of justice. Inadequate sentences give rise to a sense of injustice, not only in those who are the victims of the crimes in question but also in the general public, and are likely to undermine public confidence in the ability of the courts to play their part in deterring the commission of crimes. To permit the Crown as well as convicted persons to appeal against sentences assists in maintaining confidence in the administration of justice: Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295 at [306] (McHugh J).
	
	
	The primary purpose of a Crown appeal against sentence is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having a duty of sentencing convicted persons. In the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5B Criminal Appeal Act 1912 the court retains a residual discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient: Green v R; Quinn v R at [1]. The Crown must negate any reason why the residual discretion of this Court not to interfere should be exercised: Griffiths v The Queen [1977] HCA 44; 137 CLR 293; CMB v Attorney General (NSW) [2015] HCA 9 at [36]; 243 A Crim R 282. As was observed in Green v R; Quinn v R at [42] cases might arise where the court concludes that the inadequacy of the sentence appealed from is so marked that it amounts to “an affront to the administration of justice” and risks undermining public confidence in the criminal justice system. In such a case the court is justified in interfering with the sentence.
	
	
	A claim of manifest inadequacy is a conclusion and does not depend upon the establishment of specific error: Dinsdale v R at [6]. In R v Harris [2015] NSWCCA 81 Adamson J (Basten JA and RA Hulme J agreeing) observed that where the only ground of appeal is manifest inadequacy, identification of specific error is not required. Her Honour noted that nonetheless identification of specific error may assist to explain why a sentence is manifestly inadequate. Her Honour observed that CMB v The Attorney General (NSW) did not support the proposition that specific error must be identified before this Court will intervene if manifest inadequacy can be established.
	
	
	A difficulty for the Crown in its first particular of manifest inadequacy challenging her Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending in each case, is the rationale underlying the decision in Mulato v Regina. While this Court may have come to a different conclusion on that issue, judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with the application of proper principle and consistency.
	
	
	In Mulato Spigelman CJ said at [37]:
	


“37   Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour. In my opinion it was open, although I have some hesitation in deciding so and find it to be at the lower end of the range which could reasonably be held to be so characterised.”


	
	Simpson J who agreed with Spigelman CJ, said:
	


“46 The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is quintessentially for the sentencing judge. It is, if not a finding of fact, then the exercise of an evaluative process akin to fact finding or the exercise of a discretion. As such it is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. The importance of respecting the role of a first instance judge should never be underestimated. It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance judge. That is not because objective seriousness is something determined by reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, in respect of which it is conventionally held that the first instance judge is in a superior position. It is because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system. Each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance.”


	
	Like Spigelman CJ in Mulato, I have some hesitation in accepting her Honour’s characterisation of objective seriousness for each offence and it was undoubtedly at the lower end of the range. That having been said, it is well established that absent error this Court may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because the Court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the way in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her discretion (Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671 – 672; Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at 477 – 478).
	
	
	Applying those principles, I am not satisfied that the Crown’s first particular of manifest inadequacy has been made out.
	
	
	There is another reason why the Crown has not succeeded in making out its first particular. This relates not only to the first particular but to the Crown’s second particular of manifest inadequacy which is directed to the indicative sentences proposed by her Honour.
	
	
	In the sentence proceedings relating to Lopez-Rios, the Crown made no submission contrary to her Honour’s proposal of assessing objective seriousness in that matter in the same way as she did in the Hatzisavvas matter. Her Honour noted that the Crown did not wish to be heard on that issue. Additionally in the Lopez-Rios sentencing proceedings, the Crown specifically endorsed the indicative sentences proposed by her Honour in Hatzisavvas. The Crown did so on the basis that subject to their different subjective cases, the overall criminality of the offending by Lopez-Rios was similar to that of Hatzisavvas (see [37] hereof).
	
	
	As was submitted by Hatzisavvas, if these concessions by the Crown in the Lopez-Rios matter effectively precluded the Crown from challenging his sentence on those bases, (i.e. errors in objective seriousness and the indicative sentences), the parity principle would operate to prevent this Court increasing his (Hatzisavvas) sentence by having regard to those first two particulars of manifest inadequacy. To so increase the Hatzisavvas sentence would give rise to the very problem identified by the High Court in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at [32] and [37].
	
	
	It follows that the Crown has failed to make out its first two particulars of manifest inadequacy.
	
	
	It is necessary to consider the submission of Lopez-Rios which has as its basis the decision in R v Cimone. That submission has two limbs. The first is that because the sentence proceedings in his matter took place three weeks after those of Hatzisavvas, the Court would infer that a Crown appeal in the Hatzisavvas matter must have been under consideration even though no document had yet been filed. Lopez-Rios submitted that if such were the case, her Honour should have been informed of that fact in his sentence proceedings.
	
	
	The second limb for the submission is that the endorsement, if not promotion, by the Crown of the indicative sentences proposed in his case has the same effect. He submitted that if, as was likely, the Crown was contemplating an appeal in the Hatzisavvas matter, the position adopted by the Crown was quite inconsistent with that fact and had the effect of misleading her Honour. Lopez-Rios submitted that these facts placed the matter on all fours with what had occurred in R v Cimone and that in accordance with that decision (see [51] hereof), the Crown is precluded from appealing against the sentence imposed on him.
	
	
	The facts in R v Cimone were somewhat unusual in that a co-offender had been sentenced by another judge approximately a month after Cimone. When sentencing the co-offender, the judge had relied upon the sentence imposed on Cimone as providing a benchmark for the sentence imposed on the co-offender. When sentencing the co-offender, the judge was not told of the existence of a Crown appeal in the Cimone matter. There was no appeal by the Crown against the sentence imposed on the co-offender.
	
	
	It was in that context that the observation by Beazley P at [51] hereof was made.
	
	
	The facts here are different from R v Cimone in material respects. Given the somewhat slipshod way in which the Crown dealt with the Lopez-Rios sentence proceedings, I am not prepared to infer that the Crown was considering an appeal against the Hatzisavvas sentence at that time. Moreover, the Crown when it endorsed similar indicative sentences in the Lopez-Rios matter to those proposed in the Hatzisavvas proceeding, did not in terms, or implicitly, endorse the aggregate sentence passed in the Hatzisavvas matter. Finally, unlike R v Cimone, the sentences passed on both co-offenders in this case are the subject of a Crown appeal.
	
	
	Accordingly, I have concluded that the issue of accumulation raised in particular 3 of the Crown’s case on manifest inadequacy remains available to be relied upon by the Crown. As already indicated, I accept that insofar as the Crown’s first two particulars are concerned, it is precluded from relying upon them as a basis for a finding of manifest inadequacy against both respondents.
	
	
	The Court has not received much assistance by reference to cases dealing with supply of a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. The Crown did not rely upon any cases and those relied upon by the respondents in the sentence proceedings concerned the supply of ecstasy not methylamphetamine. The only “comparative” case relied upon before this Court was R v Li. Unfortunately, R v Li provides little by way of guidance as to an appropriate range of sentences for supply of the kind before the Court.
	
	
	As Fullerton J made clear more than once in R v Li, the court there was bound by a number of extremely generous and in some cases incorrect factual findings by the sentencing judge. The Crown in its appeal against sentence in Li had not challenged any of those findings. On that issue, Fullerton J said:
	


“50   The written submissions were brief in the extreme. In seeking to persuade the Court that the individual sentences and the non-parole periods were manifestly inadequate, it was not submitted that any of the factual findings made by the sentencing judge favourable to the respondent were either unsupported by the evidence or findings not open to him. …

…

52   The senior Crown prosecutor who appeared on the hearing regarded himself as bound by the approach the Crown had articulated in the written submissions. For that reason, he did not seek to be heard on what appeared to me to be a number of questionable factual findings made in the respondent's favour concerning both the actual extent of his knowing involvement in the criminal organisation of which he admitted he was a member, evidenced by his conduct in Australia, and the circumstances of his arrest. I have already noted that his Honour's failure to find that the offending was part of a planned and organised criminal activity is contradicted by the agreed facts. …”

Her Honour was also highly critical of the unchallenged findings by the sentencing judge that the position of the offender was that of a mere “courier” and that “he had determined to withdraw from the criminal syndicate before he was arrested”.


	
	In relation to the Crown’s third particular of manifest inadequacy, I am satisfied that the level of accumulation is so clearly disproportionate to the seriousness of the criminality involved that the only conclusion open is that her Honour’s sentencing discretion miscarried. Her Honour appears to have focused very much upon count 1 and the actual supply of one kilogram of methylamphetamine and not taken into account the substantially greater criminality associated with count 2. Although count 2 was part of an overall course of dealing, it was entirely separate from count 1. Both respondents were actively involved in the movement of almost 14 kgs of methylamphetamine. One can confidently infer that the acquisition by them of that substantial quantity of drugs presaged a further supply such as had occurred in relation to count 1.
	
	
	A conclusion to that effect is not prevented by the observations of R A Hulme J in R v Jennar. R A Hulme J was there pointing out the difficulty in assessing accumulation and concurrency where a number of indicative sentences were involved. Here there were only two indicative sentences proposed for each respondent so that the extent of any accumulation and concurrency in the aggregate sentence could be readily determined.
	
	
	The concession made by the Crown in the Lopez-Rios matter as to objective seriousness and the indicative sentences did not relieve her Honour of ensuring that the aggregate sentence ultimately imposed adequately comprehended the full extent of both respondents’ admitted criminal offending. Aggregate sentences of 8 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 5 years and 9 years with a non-parole of 5 years 6 months fell so short of appropriate sentences that the Crown has succeeded in establishing that they were manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	This is particularly so when one has regard to the important guideposts of the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period applicable to each offence. These are not a mere formality, but yardsticks created by the legislature to guide sentencing courts. Against a standard non-parole period of 15 years the non-parole periods of 5 years and 5 years 6 months for two large commercial supply offences cannot be justified even on the most favourable view of the respondent’s criminal offending and their subjective cases. I have concluded that the aggregate sentences are so inadequate as to amount to “an affront to the administration of justice which risks undermining public confidence in the criminal justice system” (Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at [42]; R v Van Ryn [2016] NSWCCA 1 at [282]).
	
	
	This does not end the matter. There remains the issue of the residual discretion. I am conscious of the submission of Hatzisavvas that the position adopted by the Crown in the Lopez-Rios sentence proceedings is a matter which should result in the exercise of the residual discretion in the respondents’ favour. I am satisfied, however, that the Crown has established that her Honour’s sentencing discretion so miscarried that it resulted in sentences that were well below those that could be properly imposed and that the Crown appeal should not be dismissed.
	
	
	Because it has become necessary to re-sentence the respondents, consideration has to be given to any changes in their circumstances which have occurred up to the present time.
	
	
	In an affidavit affirmed on 5 February 2016, Hatzisavvas said that he had complied with gaol discipline and had completed a first aid course. Up to the present time he has not had the opportunity to participate in drug counselling. Because he is an inmate of the South Coast Correctional Centre at Nowra, it has been difficult for his family to visit him. When he received notification of the Crown appeal in September 2015, he became upset because he thought that the legal proceedings were over. I do not regard these matters as significantly adding to his subjective case. There is no affidavit of Lopez-Rios bringing his situation up to date.
	
	
	In re-sentencing Hatzisavvas for the reasons set out above, I make no change to the indicative sentences. I propose that the aggregate sentence imposed on 7 August 2015 be quashed and be replaced with an aggregate sentence of 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years.
	
	
	In re-sentencing Lopez-Rios I propose that the aggregate sentence imposed on 28 August 2015 be quashed and be replaced with an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 11 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months. Both sentences are to commence on 28 August 2013.
	
	
	Accordingly, the orders which I propose are as follows:
	


Hatzisavvas


	
	The Crown appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence imposed by Flannery SC DCJ on 7 August 2015 is quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, the respondent is sentenced to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years, commencing 28 August 2013 and expiring 27 August 2020.
	


Lopez-Rios


	
	(1)   The Crown appeal is allowed.
	
	
	(2)   The aggregate sentence imposed by Flannery SC DCJ on 28 August 2015 is quashed.
	
	
	(3)   In lieu thereof, the respondent is sentenced to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 11 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months, commencing 28 August 2013 and expiring 27 February 2021.
	



	
	FULLERTON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL that the Crown appeal against the inadequacy of the aggregate sentence imposed on each of the respondents be allowed and with the orders proposed by his Honour on re-sentence.
	
	
	Those orders preserve the disparity between the aggregate sentences imposed on the respondents by the sentencing judge, consistent with what her Honour found was a differentiation between their roles in the supply of the commercial quantities of methamphetamine the subject of each of counts 1 and 2 - a factual finding not challenged by the Crown on the appeal.
	
	
	I also agree with his Honour that the intervention of this Court and re-sentence is not by reason of the sentencing judge’s appointment of indicative sentences for each of counts 1 and 2. The conduct of the Crown in the sentencing proceedings foreclosed upon any assessment of the “adequacy” of the indicative sentences as revealing error in the aggregate sentence (see for example R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199 at [17]).
	
	
	It is the preponderant weight of all the sentencing factors, including the objective seriousness of offending in both counts, that has driven me to conclude that there has been a misapplication of the totality principle in the sentencing exercise and that manifestly inadequate aggregate sentences have resulted.
	
	
	It is the notional accumulation of 12 months in the aggregate sentence of Hatzisavvas and the notional accumulation of 9 months in the aggregate sentence of Lopez-Rios for the discrete criminality inherent in the actual supply of a commercial quantity of methamphetamine in granular form (count 1) and, within weeks of the commission of that offence, the deemed supply of the same drug in both granular and liquid form (count 2) (and in a total amount more than 13 times the commercial quantity applicable to that drug) that represents a failure on the part of the sentencing judge to properly apply totality principles in the exercise of her sentencing discretion.
	
	
	For this Court to intervene to correct a sentencing error in the imposition of markedly inadequate aggregate sentences is consistent with the “limiting purpose” of an appeal brought under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act (see Everett v R [1994] HCA; 181 CLR 295 and The Queen v Pham [2015] HCA 39; 244 A Crim R 280).
	
	
	Although the Crown did not seek to persuade the Court that the aggregate sentences are manifestly inadequate by reference to sentences imposed in comparable cases, or that the misapplication of principle is evident from undertaking a comparison with other cases, that does not derogate from the force of the Crown submission that the notional accumulation between both counts in the appointment of the aggregate sentences failed to reflect the total criminality inherent in the offending comprehended by counts 1 and 2. I do not regard the passage in Pham to which the respondents’ counsel referred in the following extract, as obliging the Crown to demonstrate that a sentence under challenge as inadequate, is at variance with comparable cases before appellate intervention is justified.
	


[28] Previous decisions of this Court have laid down in detail the way in which the assessment of sentences in other cases is to be approached. It is neither necessary, therefore, nor of assistance to repeat all of what has previously been said. But, in view of the way in which the Court of Appeal approached the task in this case, it is appropriate to re-emphasise the following:

(1) Consistency in sentencing means that like cases are to be treated alike and different cases are to be treated differently.

(2) The consistency that is sought is consistency in the application of the relevant legal principles.

(3) Consistency in sentencing for federal offenders is to be achieved through the work of intermediate appellate courts.

(4) Such consistency is not synonymous with numerical equivalence and it is incapable of mathematical expression or expression in tabular form.

(5) For that and other reasons, presentation in the form of numerical tables, bar charts and graphs of sentences passed on federal offenders in other cases is unhelpful and should be avoided.

(6) When considering the sufficiency of a sentence imposed on a federal offender at first instance, an intermediate appellate court should follow the decisions of other intermediate appellate courts unless convinced that there is a compelling reason not to do so.

(7) Appellate intervention on the ground of manifest excessiveness or inadequacy is not warranted unless, having regard to all of the relevant sentencing factors, including the degree to which the impugned sentence differs from sentences that have been imposed in comparable cases, the appellate court is driven to conclude that there must have been some misapplication of principle.


	
	While a comparison with comparable cases indicating the sentence under challenge to be at marked variance with them might, in an appropriate case, be a sentencing factor of considerable weight, it is not a factor that operates as a precondition to a successful Crown appeal. In this case, despite what is said to be the mitigating influence of the respondents’ subjective circumstances, the aggregate sentences imposed on the respondents reflect sentences well below that which could be justly imposed for offending of this kind, and on this scale.
	
	
	There is little point in seeking to appoint the extent of the respondents’ business as drug suppliers or, for that matter, the positions either occupied as wholesale suppliers of commercial quantities of methamphetamine, in both granular and liquid form. In considering the adequacy of the aggregate sentences, what cannot be overlooked is her Honour’s finding (which is not in contest) of mid range offending for count 2 and offending “not appreciably below” the mid range for count 1. On that assessment alone, I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL that aggregate sentences of 8 years and 3 months and 9 years (with non-parole periods of 5 years and 5 years and 6 months respectively) are “unreasonable and plainly unjust” (see Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 as cited in R v Wood [2012] NSWCCA 231; 84 NSWLR 581 at [50]).
	
	
	As Hoeben CJ at CL observed at [51]-[53], Lopez-Rios sought to persuade the Court that what his counsel submitted was a statement of principle in R v Cimone [2001] NSWCCA 98; 121 A Crim R 433 should foreclose on the Crown appeal being allowed in this case. In that case, the Crown on sentence expressly submitted that the sentence of one co-offender was the benchmark against which the sentence on Cimone should be assessed. In the Court’s view, this had the effect of foreclosing on any challenge to the inadequacy of his sentence in circumstances where the co-offender’s sentence was not the subject of a Crown appeal. I share his Honour’s view that the Crown’s invitation in Lopez-Rios’ sentence proceedings for her Honour to apply parity principles when she was considering the undiscounted indicative sentences for counts 1 and 2 (Hatzisavvas having been sentenced in separate proceedings three weeks earlier) does not foreclose on the Crown challenging the adequacy of the aggregate sentences that were imposed on both respondents. It might have been otherwise were the Crown either expressly or by necessary implication to have endorsed the appropriateness of the aggregate sentence imposed on Hatzisavvas in Lopez-Rios’ sentence proceedings or to have sought to appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence of only one of the respondents.
	
	
	To the extent that the conduct of the Crown in the sentence proceedings of Lopez-Rios is relied upon by both respondents as weighing against the Crown satisfying the Court that the residual discretion should not be exercised (see CMB v Attorney General (NSW) [2015] HCA 9; 243 A Crim R 282), I am not persuaded that the conduct of the Crown should have that impact on this appeal. Neither am I persuaded that there is any sufficient additional basis to invoke the residual discretion in the respondents’ favour.
	
	
	RS HULME AJ: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL and can accordingly omit from these reasons much of the detail to which his Honour refers.
	
	
	The first of the offences committed by each of the Respondents was of supplying 1 kilogram of methylamphetamine, a quantity at the bottom of the large commercial range, a circumstance which led the sentencing judge to describe the offence as “below the middle of the range of objective seriousness but not appreciably so”. The second of the offences committed by each of the Respondents, involved the deemed supply of 13.384 kilograms of methylamphetmine, found in premises they occupied. The sentencing judge described this second offence as “mid-range”. Details of what was found on the execution of a search warrant at the Respondents’ premises recounted by Hoeben CJ at CL make it clear that the Respondents committed their offences as part of an ongoing large scale commercial operation, no doubt for the financial benefits they would bring.
	
	
	For the supply of the 1 kilogram the Respondents were paid $190,000 from which sum $50,000 was paid to others who facilitated the transaction. That methylamphetamine was of high purity, about 80%, as was about 9.4 kilograms of the 13.384 kilograms which was the subject of the second charge. It is therefore a reasonable inference that the large quantity would have realised for the Respondents well in excess of $1,000,000. There was unchallenged evidence before the sentencing judge from a police officer very experienced with the drug trade that leads to the conclusion that that street level sales in 2013 were commonly of 0.1 to 0.2 gram at a price of $50-$150 each. Thus at street level the 1 kilogram would yield 50,000 to 100,000 deals and would be worth about $5,000,000. On a similar basis, the larger quantity would yield 500,000 to 1,000,000 deals and was worth approximately $50,000,000. In these calculations I have assumed the drugs were not, as commonly occurs, “cut” or diluted.
	
	
	By s 25(2) and Schedule 1 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, Parliament has provided a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for the supply of a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine and by s 54A et seq of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 a standard non-parole period of 15 years for such offending. The standard non-parole period “represents the non-parole period for an offence (in respect of which it is specified) that, taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of that offence, is in the middle of the range of seriousness” and is a matter that, in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence in respect of which there is such a period specified, a court is required to take into account. Section 54B of that Act also requires the Court to adopt a similar approach when determining an aggregate sentence.
	
	
	Her Honour decided to impose aggregate sentences as permitted by s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In doing so, she was required to indicate that sentences she thought appropriate for the individual offences and did so. The indicative sentences were, in the case of Mr Hatzisavvas, imprisonment for 6 years including a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months and, for the second offence, imprisonment for 7 years and 3 months including a non-parole period of 4 years 3 months. In the case of Mr Lopez-Rios, imprisonment for 6 years 9 months including a non-parole period of 4 years and, for the second offence, imprisonment for 8 years 3 months including a non-parole period of 5 years.
	
	
	The sentences her Honour ultimately imposed were, in the case of Mr Hatzisavvas, imprisonment for 8 years and 3 months, including a non-parole period of 5 years, and in the case of Mr Lopez-Rios, imprisonment for 9 years including a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months. In arriving at these figures and those for the indicative sentences her Honour held that the Respondents were entitled to a discount of 25% for pleading guilty and, in the case of Mr Hatzisavvas, a further discount of 8% for assistance to authorities Apart from some minor rounding, the difference in discounts accounts for the difference in sentences thought appropriate and ultimately imposed on the Respondents. The non-parole periods also reflect findings of special circumstances which the Crown conceded and which led to reductions of a little over 1 year in the case of each offender.
	
	
	There were of course the Respondents’ subjective factors to be also taken into account. Mr Hatzisavvas was born in 1970 and had a relatively minor criminal record – for driving with a low-range PCA and for common assault (for which he was fined $1,800) – a stable family history, and in her Honour’s view presented with reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The evidence also showed that Mr Hatzisavvas had a far better start in life than most, a good education and extremely good fortune in winning Lotto but chose to party and indulge in alcohol and illegal drugs until he became addicted and over a period of in excess of 10 years wasted the substantial assets he had. Her Honour seems to have accepted statements by Mr Hatzisavvas that he felt sorry and ashamed for what he had done to his family – feelings which were presumably absent or ignored in the preceding 10 years.
	
	
	Her Honour found that Mr Lopez-Rios “appreciates the seriousness of his conduct and the devastating impact drug use can have on people. I am also satisfied that he is sorry for the shame he has brought upon his family. I am satisfied that he has good prospects of rehabilitation having regard to his age, his solid work history, and as I was particularly impressed with the contents of his letter which suggests he has real insight into his situation”.
	
	
	Mr Lopez-Rios had told a psychiatrist, Dr Nielssen, that his involvement in offending began with his own addiction to methylamphetamine, this in turn flowing from depression, a breakdown in a long term relationship, itself contributed to by testicular cancer and its aftermath. Mr Lopez-Rios had also had a good start in life and his education had included 3 years of a civil engineering degree. He had used cannabis and cocaine when younger and occasionally ecstasy. His criminal record consisted of one charge of driving with a mid-range PCA and, in 2011, one charge of possession of 10.2 grams (pure) of a drugs or plants suspected of being illegally imported. For the latter offence he was placed on a 12 months good behaviour bond.
	
	
	However none of these matters, singly or in combination can justify the sentences imposed. General sentencing principles require that the subjective circumstances of an offender not be allowed to overshadow the objective seriousness of an offence and that a sentence reflect the offence’s objective seriousness – R v Dodd (1991) A Crim R 349 at 354; R v Scott [2005] NSWCCA 152 at [15]; R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at [15].
	
	
	Against the statutory guidelines of life imprisonment and a 15 years non-parole period the sentences imposed by her Honour - in the case of Mr Hatzisavvas, imprisonment for 8 years and 3 months, including a non-parole period of 5 years, and in the case of Mr Lopez-Rios, imprisonment for 9 years including a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months, and this for two offences, one of which fell fairly within the statutory reference of “middle of the range”, committed by each Respondent – are utterly disproportionate and manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	The situation is a fortiori once regard is had to the enormous value which the evidence before her Honour showed the drugs to have, and this whether at a wholesale or retail level. Given the profits to be made, if the sentences imposed in this case are typical it is no wonder that, as I indicate later in these reasons, the number of methylamphetamine dealing offences is increasing.
	
	
	That said, the reasons of Hoeben CJ at CL demonstrate that the conduct of the representative of the Director of Public Prosecutions who appeared at Mr Lopez-Rios’ sentencing proceedings, in accepting that the starting points used in the determination of the indicative sentences appropriate for him should be the same ones as recorded in Mr Hatzisavvas’ case, effectively precludes this Court from allowing a challenge to those starting points.
	
	
	The indicative sentences were determined principally on the basis of those starting points, discounts for pleas and findings of special circumstances. There was no challenge to these last two matters in the court below or in this Court. It follows that this Court should approach the Crown’s challenge to the adequacy of the sentences ultimately imposed upon the basis that the indicative sentences were correct. While sight must not be lost of the question whether the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate, in effect the issue for this Court boils down to whether the degree of accumulation apparent in the aggregate sentences imposed was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	Section 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which provides for the imposition of aggregate sentences, is a procedural provision – R v MJB [2014] NSWCCA 195 at [55]. Its purpose was “to ameliorate the difficulties of applying the decision in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57: 194 CLR 610 in sentencing for multiple offences.” – JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297 at 39.
	
	
	The requirement in s 53A that judges state the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences instead of an aggregate sentence been imposed, makes it clear that the section was not introduced to enable judges to avoid the imposition of sentences that properly reflect multiple instances of criminality and that, except insofar as it simplified the formulation of the sentence, the section does not affect the operation of the principal of totality.
	
	
	That principle finds expression in Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; 166 CLR 59 at 63 where the High Court endorsed an extract from D A Thomas, ""Principles of Sentencing"", viz:-
	


""The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate sentence is 'just and appropriate'.""


	
	In R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130; 171 A Crim R 267 at [45]–[46], after quoting the above passage, this Court said:
	


Two points may be made. Firstly, the principle is expressed in terms of coming back from the result of a simple aggregation. Secondly, if each individual sentence is appropriate for the criminality of the offence to which it relates, prima facie additional criminality requires an increase in sentence. Obviously the totality principle imposes limits to that last proposition but those limits will rarely if ever go so far as to justify wholly concurrent sentences for all of a series of offences such as those here. Subject to those limits, in general, sentences significantly cumulative should be imposed for separate serious offences of which those here are all examples.

In this connection the Court endorses the remarks of Sully J, though as a member of a two judge bench, in R v Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34. At [36] - [37] his Honour said:-

""... (There) is the need to ensure public confidence in the administration of criminal justice; and, in particular, to ensure that there does not emerge in the community at large a perception that there is not all that much to choose between the person who commits one or two offences, and the person who commits six or seven offences, for the reason that somehow or other they all manage to finish up with effective sentences between or among which there is hardly anything in practical terms to choose.

It needs to be clearly understood by all concerned that a person who commits a deliberate series of discrete offences, - and the present applicant's case, is a good example of the kind, - he must not be left with the idea that by intoning references to the principle of totality as though it were some magic mantra, he can escape effective punishment for the offences which follow successively one upon another throughout the whole course of a studied and deliberate course of criminal behaviour.""


	
	Some of those remarks have no literal application here but the principle does.
	
	
	On separate occasions, each of the Respondents committed very serious offences. If in the case of Mr Hatzisavvas the appropriate sentence for his first offence was 6 years and the sentence appropriate for the second 7 years and 3 months, an increase in the first sentence by only 2 years or an increase in the second by only 1 year is quite disproportionate to the seriousness of the offence inspiring the increase.
	
	
	Had the approach in R v Mill and R v Harris been followed, the sentencing judge would have arrived at a total sentence of 13 years and 3 months and then, if her Honour thought that period not “just and appropriate”, she could have reduced it. Such a course would have been calculated to have made clear to her Honour how inadequate and disproportionate to Mr Hatzizavvas’ criminality the sentence ultimately imposed on him was.
	
	
	Similar remarks may be made in respect of the sentences indicated for, and imposed on, Mr Lopez-Rios and of all non-parole periods.
	
	
	The sum of the indicated non-parole periods in the case of Mr Hatzisavvas was 7 years and 9 months and in the case of Mr Lopez-Rios 9 years. In that the indicated non-parole periods may reasonably be regarded as a reflection of starting points that the Crown accepted, this Court should, as I have indicted, proceed on the assumption they were adequate. The non-parole periods her Honour imposed, respectively 5 years, and 5 years and 6 months, amounted to very substantial reductions which were unjustified, manifestly excessive and which resulted in manifestly inadequate sentences. I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL’s description that the result is “an affront to the administration of justice which risks undermining public confidence in the criminal justice system” and that the Crown appeal should not be dismissed in the exercise of this Court’s discretion. I accept his Honour’s summary of the further material adduced for consideration in the event of re-sentence and that the indicative sentences should not be changed.
	
	
	In the case of Mr Hatzisavvas, a simple accumulation of the indicative sentences would result in a sentence of 13 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 7 years and nine months. In the case of Mr Lopez-Rios, a simple accumulation of the indicative sentences would result in a sentence of 15 years with a non-parole period of 9 years. Considerations of totality lead to the conclusion that these periods should be reduced and I agree with the sentences proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	There is one further topic to which I would advert, although in light of my view that the Crown’s conduct in the sentencing of Mr Lopez-Rios means that this Court should proceed on the basis of the indicative sentences fixed by the sentencing judge, it does not affect the conclusions at which I have arrived.
	
	
	In Toole Kurt v R; Toole Joshua v R [2014] NSWCCA 318 at [118] I observed:-
	


The courts cannot be unconscious of the increase in frequency of offences involving trafficking in amphetamines. Statistics published by the Bureau of Crime Statistics confirm that that is the case, the rate of offences per 100,000 of the population having roughly doubled over the last 10 years. Clearly the weight to be given by the courts to deterrence should also markedly increase and result in a commensurate increase in sentences. However, I have not found it necessary in considering this ground to place weight on this factor.


	
	During the hearing of the appeal in this matter, I raised the remarks that I have quoted from Toole Kurt v R; Toole Joshua v R and indicated that I felt entitled to adopt in this case the course that I foreshadowed in that case. I provided to counsel a number of publications which I suggested, “tend to support the proposition that the trafficking in amphetamines has increased substantially”.
	
	
	Mr Game SC, appearing for Mr Hatzisavvas, took exception to my doing so upon a number of bases. He submitted, inter alia that it was unfair for a single judge to raise the issue at the end of the hearing, and inappropriate in a Crown appeal where the issue had not previously been raised. There followed a number of exchanges which included the Court inviting the parties to provide further submissions if they wished. This they did. Those on behalf of the Crown on 26 February, those on behalf of Mr Hatzisavvas on 8 March and those on behalf of Mr Lopez-Rios on 14 March last.
	
	
	In substance, those on behalf of the Respondents contended that the Court was not entitled to proceed as I had foreshadowed, that it would be unfair to the Respondents who were privately funded to expect them to respond to the sort of information in the documents to which I refer below, that, particularly given the terms of s 144 of the Evidence Act 1995, the Court could not take judicial notice of the contents of those documents and that in any event the proper way of dealing with any thought of a general increase in penalties was by way of a guideline judgment as contemplated by Division 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It was further submitted that any increase in the penalties imposed for methylamphtamine offences would offend the proportionality between these offences and those involving heroin or MDMA apparent on the face of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 or Customs Act 1901; Adams v The Queen [2008] HCA 15; 234 CLR 143 was referred to.
	
	
	Some of these arguments may have some validity but what they do not deal with is that the prevalence of a type of offence is, and has always been, relevant to sentencing – R v Cuthbert (1967) 86 WN (NSW) 272 at 278; R v Williscroft (1975) VR 292 at 299, 302; R v Downie and Dandy (1997) 95 A Crim R 299 at 304-6; R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120 at [100] - [103] and the courts may take notice of a change in prevalence that is notorious – R v Hayes (1984) 1 NSWLR 740 at 742; 11 A Crim R 187 at 189; Downie at 305. It is true that in R v House [2005] NSWCCA 88 at [24] Wood CJ at CL suggested that the topic of increased prevalence might be better left for a guideline judgment but there is nothing in the legislation providing for such judgments to suggest that any limitation on the powers that the courts had previously exercised was being introduced. Courts have not previously taken the view in this area that because Parliament can address a problem the courts should not. I see no reason why, if the judges perceive a problem, they should neglect to deal with it just because there is another method available.
	
	
	Furthermore, it is clear that if a court regards a prevailing standard of sentencing as too low, it is not obliged to correct it by an upward trend rather than an abrupt increase – Poyner v The Queen (1986) 60 ALJR 616. There are cases where, as a matter of discretion, an increase in a level of sentencing, has been brought in over time – R v Lewfatt (1993) 70 A Crim R 66; R v D (1997) 96 A Crim R 364, R v Kench [2005] SASC 85; 152 A Crim R 294 but whether these are all reconcilable with Poyner v The Queen is a question I need not pursue. It may of course be necessary, as I did in this case, for a judge to give the parties notice of any change in approach he intends to adopt – Pantorno v The Queen [1989] HCA 18; 166 CLR 466 at 473.
	
	
	It may be that I complicated the issue by referring to publications – though the cases referred to demonstrate that course was not inappropriate - but having done so it is worthwhile to record what they say. In the above quotation from Toole Kurt v R; Toole Jushua v R I have recorded statistics published by the Bureau of Crime Statistics. Another publication, “Methylamphetamine-related Emergency Department Presentations by Admission Status” published by the New South Wales Government Health Department revealed that from 2009 to 2014 there has been an increase in the number of persons presenting to Emergency Departments from 394 to 2,982. The numbers of these admitted increased from 124 to 973, an 8-fold increase. The publication “Australian Trends in Ecstasy and Related Drug Markets 2014” published under the aegis of the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at [6.5] confirms the increase, albeit at a lower rate. A fourth, the “NSW Recorded Crime Statistics March 2015 Quarterly Update” recorded large increases in the recorded rate of amphetamine related offences in regional New South Wales as well as in parts of Sydney and that “National survey data shows that the proportion of people using methamphetamine (ice) daily or weekly had jumped from 9.3% in 2010 to 15.5% in 2013”.
	
	
	Another, the Australian Crime Commission publication “The Australian Methylamphetamine Market, the National Picture” of March 2015 reported at page 10, that “in the past 5 years there has been significant growth in the detected importation, manufacture and supply of” methylamphetamine and that “(o)f all illicit drugs, the ACC assesses that methylamphetmine, and in particular crystal methylamphetamine, poses the highest risk to the Australian community”.
	
	
	To these matters I may add reference to the fact that, although the change occurred after the Respondents’ offences, Parliament has given recognition to the problem by halving the minimum quantity that falls within the large commercial quantity range to which a maximum penalty of life imprisonment applies – see Drug Misuse and Trafficking Amendment (Methlyamphetamine) Regulation 2015. Whether this will be enough to inspire an increase in penalties for those dealing in large commercial quantities remains to be seen.
	
	
	However, I do not need to rely on the information to which I have referred. I am satisfied from my general community knowledge that there has been a substantial increase in the use methylamphetamines. I have now sat in this Court for almost 20 years and that experience also confirms the fact that there has been a very substantial increase in the frequency of offences involving trafficking in amphetamines. I am satisfied that that knowledge of those increases is notorious and not reasonably open to question and thus a matter about which s 144 of the Evidence Act 1995 says proof in not required.
	
	
	But that said, because of the Crown’s attitude during the sentencing of Mr Lopez-Rios, I do not feel able in this Crown appeal to implement the view I expressed in R v Toole.

		01 August 2016",2016-07-31 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701253,Pierre Sukkar v Regina (No 2) [2016] NSWDC 154,"Judgment


	
	Pierre Peter Sukkar (the applicant) seeks an order for costs following his conviction appeal being allowed on 21 August 2015.
	
	
	Section 70(1)(a) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (the Act) contains a power to award costs following a successful conviction appeal if the Court is satisfied that the investigation was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner.
	
	
	The applicant contends that the conditions provided for in section 70(1)(a) are satisfied and that I should exercise my discretion to award costs in his favour. By agreement between the parties, if the current application is unsuccessful the applicant intends to make further application pursuant to the provisions of section 70(1)(b)-(d) of the Act, to be argued later.
	
	
	The applicant relies on the material tendered in the appeal, my judgment and an affidavit of Hayley Rake (the applicant’s solicitor) sworn 22 July 2016.
	


The relevant law


	
	Section 70(1)(a) of the Act must focus on the investigation. In relation to the failure to call a witness or take a statement from a witness the applicant for costs does not need to establish what that witness would have said. If there are 5 eye-witnesses to an incident and the police interview and call only one and the prosecution fails then the sub-section may be satisfied: Cliftleigh Haulage Pty Ltd v Byron Shire Council [2007] NSWCA 13 at [20]-[21].
	
	
	The inquiry involved in section 70(1)(a) is wider than section 70(1)(c) of the Act. The extent of the investigation or the lack of investigation may be the basis for the finding that the investigation was either unreasonable or improper: RB v DPP [2015] NSWSC 248.
	


Factual background


	
	On 30 August 2013 the applicant and the co-accused Mr Nassif were arrested and charged.
	
	
	On 23 September 2013 the matter was mentioned at the Downing Centre Local Court. Pleas of not guilty were entered and the Court made orders for the service of a brief of evidence.
	
	
	On 6 November 2013 the matter was mentioned again before the Local Court. Further charges of assault police occasioning actual bodily harm were laid in Court. A brief containing one statement, that of Constable Benson, was served. The matter was adjourned to 27 November 2013 for reply to the brief.
	
	
	On 27 November 2013 the matter was listed for hearing on 18 March 2014, with a one day estimate.
	
	
	On 2 December 2013 Constable Benson took a statement from Dr Trantalis, his treating orthopaedic surgeon. The statement was taken to support the allegation that Constable Benson had suffered a serious shoulder injury, capable of amounting to grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	On 12 December 2013 a further charge of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm was laid against the applicant.
	
	
	On 22 January 2014 Constable Benson passed an occupational skills assessment and medical conducted by NSW Police.
	
	
	On 28 January 2014 Constable Benson served a further statement by him dated 28 January 2014 alleging that he was unfit for full police duties and the statement of Dr Trantalis. The statement of Constable Benson did not refer to the fact that he passed the assessment and medical a few days before and that he had been declared fit for full duties.
	
	
	On 12 February 2014 the matter was listed before the Local Court to vacate the hearing date. The applicant opposed that course. The applicant made representations to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to withdraw the indictable charge.
	
	
	On 20 February 2014 Constable Benson’s injury management file was closed on the basis that he had maintained his pre-injury duties for 4 weeks.
	
	
	On 27 February 2014 the DPP’s application to vacate the hearing date was refused.
	
	
	On 13 March 2014 the DPP advised that he intended to prosecute the indictable charge. The hearing date was vacated in relation to the applicant.
	
	
	On 18 March 2014 the co-accused’s hearing matter commenced before his Honour Magistrate Bradd.
	
	
	The applicant issued a number of subpoenas to the Commissioner of Police and Dr Trantalis relating to the injury to Constable Benson. There were 3 episodes of non-production before the Court.
	
	
	On 11 June 2014 the co-accused was found not guilty by his Honour Magistrate Bradd.
	
	
	On 31 October 2014 the matter was listed for an application to cross-examine Constable Benson and Dr Trantalis at committal on the issue of grievous bodily harm. The orders were granted and the matter was listed for committal hearing on 10 December 2014.
	
	
	On 5 November 2014 the applicant sent representations to the DPP seeking that he withdraw the indictable charge on the basis of the acquittal of the co-accused and the state of the evidence relating to grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	On 10 December 2014 the prosecution sought an adjournment of the committal hearing on the basis of the unavailability of Constable Benson and Dr Trantalis. The Court was informed that Constable Benson was on ‘stress leave’ and it was unknown when he would be fit to attend court. Dr Trantalis was said to be unavailable for other professional reasons. The indictable charge was dismissed and the summary charges were set down for hearing on 2 April 2015.
	
	
	On 16 March 2015 a further brief of evidence was served including 2 statements from security guards employed at the hotel dated 27 March 2014 and 16 May 2014 that had not been previously served.
	
	
	On 2 April 2015 the applicant was convicted of fail to quit licensed premises, resist arrest and assault police. The applicant was acquitted of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm and the back-up charge of common assault relating to the injury to Constable Benson.
	
	
	On 21 August 2015 I allowed the applicant’s conviction appeal on the basis of a combination of the following matters:
	



	
	the CCTV footage did not correspond with the evidence of the police officers;
	
	
	Constable Benson did not take steps to obtain independent evidence from security guards or patrons, as the incident, or other police officers as the injuries he allegedly sustained;
	
	
	the objective evidence he claimed to have, namely photographic evidence of injury, was not produced;
	
	
	the email correspondence between the police officers and their contact about their evidence led me to the conclusion that their evidence was contaminated. I was persuaded by the applicant’s submission that the reason for the contact between the police officers relating to their evidence was to explain the differences between the narrative created on the night of the offence (contained in the COPS entry and the Facts) and the CCTV footage.
	


Consideration


	
	Taking into account all of the evidence, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the investigation was both unreasonable and improper for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, Constable Benson unreasonably failed to interview independent witnesses to the incident. These witnesses were the security guards present at the location where the incident in the hotel occurred and the other patrons of the hotel. The other patrons of the hotel were likely to be independent and to be of most relevance to the investigation. The security guards were also important, especially when the police became aware of the content of the CCTV footage that did not depict the applicant spitting at Constable Benson as alleged. A record of the names and security licences of the security guards working at the hotel was required by law, and they were thereby available to be traced by Constable Benson: see sections 4, 35 and 36 Security Industry Act 1997. Two such statements were obtained early in the course of the investigation but not served until 2 weeks prior to the hearing. In my view this supports the conclusion that the security guards were available to be interviewed and that a failure to do so was unreasonable. Further, in this respect the failure to serve the statements in a timely fashion was improper as it denied the opportunity for the applicant to investigate their evidence.
	
	
	Second, the investigation relating to the medical evidence provided in support of the alleged injury sustained by Constable Benson was unreasonable and or improper. It should be initially noted that Constable Benson made no contemporaneous complaint of a serious shoulder injury. The process of taking of Dr Trantalis’ statement was highly irregular. It involved the gathering of evidence about the alleged victim by the alleged victim. That statement was then served at a time when there had been a material change in circumstances that were known to Constable Benson, i.e. that he had passed his medical and occupational skills assessment and had been declared fit for full duties. The gathering of the evidence in this way gave rise to a significant conflict of interest that was improper and compromised the integrity of the evidence. The police did not then produce the medical file of Constable Benson in a timely way. The matter ultimately resolved by Constable Benson refusing to come to court to be cross-examined at committal. The investigation of the injuries sustained by Constable Benson was incomplete, untimely and resulted in the provision of misleading evidence to the applicant. On this aspect I am satisfied that the investigation was both unreasonable and improper.
	
	
	Third, I am satisfied that the content of the statements of Constable Benson and Constable Niall for the reasons I gave on 21 August 2015 was contaminated by inappropriate contact email contact between them as to the content of their evidence.
	
	
	I order that the prosecution pay the applicant’s costs of the appeal and the Local Court proceedings.
	
	
	I have not heard any submissions as to the quantum of the costs sought, or the date by which I should order payment of the costs in accordance with section 72 of the Act.
	
	
	I will hear the parties on those issues.

		01 August 2016",2016-07-31 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2701255,SafeWork NSW v Freedom Foods P/L [2016] NSWDC 153,"Judgment


	
	Freedom Foods Pty Ltd (the offender) has pleaded guilty to an offence that as a person who had a health and safety duty pursuant to section 19 Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (the Act), it failed to comply with that duty and thereby exposed Mark Torbuck to a risk of death or serious injury contrary to section 32 of the Act.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine of $1.5 million.
	


Facts


	
	The Agreed Statement of Facts can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The offender conducted a business manufacturing gluten and allergen free cereal and snack products. Mr Torbuck had been employed by the offender as an Operator since 28 September 2013.
	
	
	On 28 July 2014, Mr Torbuck was rostered to commence work at 2pm on the Flake Roller Machine (the machine) with Paul Puntoriero. The Flake Roller Machine formed part of the extrusion line.
	
	
	On 28 July 2014 Mr Torbuck was working as a Main Extrusion Line Operator and had been in this role for approximately 1 week. He had been undergoing on the job training in this role for approximately 2 months prior to the incident, however he had not been assessed as competent to work on the machine.
	
	
	Trent Pearse, a Production Supervisor, had been rostered to work on 28 July 2014 between 2pm and 10pm. However, Mr Pearse in fact commenced his shift at 12:33pm and finished at 4:52pm.
	
	
	The Flake Roller Machine was approximately 2.15m high, 2.2m wide and 1.3m deep. On the top of the machine was an opening measuring approximately 800mm by 120mm, underneath which were two opposing rollers. An in-feed chute had been fitted over the top of the opening and was held in place by four spring-loaded clips. One of those clips was missing on the date of the incident. There was a steel platform over the top of the machine with an attached staircase, to allow employees to deliver product into the top in-feed chute.
	
	
	At approximately 5:30pm on 28 July 2014, while Mr Torbuck was working alone, the machine became blocked. He kicked the chute to stop product from continuing to pass into the machine and then unclipped and removed the in-feed chute. He used a broom handle to try and clear the blockage. When this was not successful, Mr Torbuck opened the rollers of the machine, undid the clips securing the in-feed chute and removed the chute. The machine did not stop operating. Mr Torbuck balanced himself on top of the machine and the mobile work platform. He used one hand to hold onto the platform whilst using the other to clear the blocked product. As he did so he slipped and his hand fell into the rollers. The rollers grabbed his fingers and started turning.
	
	
	Mr Torbuck yelled and a nearby cleaner activated the emergency stop switch. A few minutes later additional employees attended and manually wound the rollers back to release Mr Torbuck’s hand. Mr Torbuck was taken by ambulance to Griffith Base Hospital before being airlifted to Canberra Hospital.
	
	
	The incident removed the skin, tissue and tendons on Mr Torbuck’s hand and required the amputation of all 4 fingers on his right hand. Mr Torbuck further suffered torn ligaments in his right arm and shoulder. He underwent several unsuccessful skin grafts, hand surgery, physiotherapy, hand therapy and counselling.
	
	
	Mr Torbuck returned to work on 20 October 2015 on restricted duties 15 hours per week. The offender created a truck driver and site maintenance role for Mr Torbuck and leased a truck for this role at a cost of $8,625.23.
	
	
	Mr Torbuck has not attended work since 2 December 2015 but remained employed by the offender.
	
	
	The offender paid for Mr Toburck’s wife and children to travel to Canberra, and for their food and accommodation whilst he was in hospital. The offender also provided financial assistance to Mr Torbuck’s mother who cared for his children when he and his wife went to Melbourne for him to undergo further surgery.
	
	
	The offender purchased and installed fittings and made adjustments at Mr Torbuck’s home to accommodate his injury.
	
	
	The offender arranged fundraisers for the purchase of a car for Mr Torbuck and made a financial contribution towards the purchase price. In around mid-August 2015 the offender paid for four employees to deliver the car to Mr Torbuck in Canberra. The offender also paid for repairs to and servicing of the car.
	
	
	Between the date of the incident and 29 November 2015, the offender made payments to Mr Torbuck to top up his workers’ compensation payments. These top-up payments amounted to approximately $16,500.
	
	
	The offender has committed to creating a role for or redeploying Mr Torbuck at any of its site in New South Wales or Victoria, and covering relocation costs if required. The offender has offered to assist Mr Torbuck in undertake training and further education. The offender has secured a secondment at a retail hardware store for Mr Torbuck and has agreed to continue paying his wages should he accept this position.
	


Training and Systems


	
	The offender trained employees working on the extrusion line through on the job training with an experienced buddy.
	
	
	Mr Torbuck undertook induction training with the offender upon commencing employment, re-training in February 2014 and upon returning to work in October 2015. During induction employees were instructed not to remove guards from machines whilst in operation.
	
	
	At the time of the incident Mr Torbuck had not been given in-depth instruction in operating the machine, or seen the Standard Operating Procedure or the operator’s manual for the machine. He had not been given instruction or seen a documented procedure about how to clear a blockage in the machine.
	
	
	At the time of the incident Mr Torbuck had not been trained in isolation procedures and did not know how to lock out or tag out the machine.
	
	
	There were no systems in place at the time of the incident to prevent unauthorised removal of the in-feed chute.
	
	
	Following the incident the offender took a number of steps including
	



	
	training employees in a revised Safe Operating Procedure for the machine;
	
	
	developing a skills matrix which it displayed at the premises and shows the core training employees must have completed to work in each production area;
	
	
	amending the Enterprise Bargaining Agreement to include disciplinary sanctions for breaching the new safety provisions; and
	
	
	Employing a Group Workplace Health Safety and Environment Manager.
	


Modification of the Machine


	
	The machine was installed at the premises in around 2009. At that time the in-feed chute was bolted in place. Between 2009 and the incident the machine was modified by replacing the bolts with hand operated spring loaded clips. No risk assessment was conducted prior to making these modifications.
	
	
	Following the incident the offender conducted a risk assessment of the machine and made a number of modifications.
	
	
	The spring loaded clips were replaced with bolts to secure the in-feed chute and an electrical interlock was fitted to the chute so that the chute could not be removed until the machine has stopped.
	
	
	Key locked doors were installed on the machine and keys were placed with maintenance staff to prevent unauthorised entry.
	
	
	Safety switches were installed on all removable guarding on the machine, including the in-feed chute. These switches can only be released once the rollers have stopped moving.
	


Standards and Regulations


	
	At the time of the incident there were relevant standards applicable to the use of plant.
	
	
	Managing the Risks of Plant in the Workplace Code of Conduct (July 2014) identified engineering controls, such as the installation of guards to prevent contact with moving parts of machinery, as a method of controlling the risk.
	
	
	The Work Health and Safety Regulation 2011 (the Regulation) required, pursuant to cl 208(2) that a person with management or control of plant must ensure that when access to an area of plant requiring guarding is necessary during operation that there be an interlocked physical barrier.
	


The Offender’s Evidence


	
	The Offender read an affidavit of Timothy Moses affirmed 25 July 2016. Mr Moses was cross-examined before me at the sentence hearing.
	
	
	Mr Moses is the General Manager of the offender and performed this role at the time of the incident.
	
	
	In his affidavit Mr Moses gave evidence that the offender commenced operations in April 1995 and has not been previously prosecuted for any work health and safety matter.
	
	
	At the time of the incident it was the policy of the offender to ensure that there was one supervisor rostered on at the premises at all times. On 28 July 2014 Mr Pearse was required to work from 2pm to 10pm. He did not apply to start or leave early on that day.
	
	
	Mr Moses provided that if Mr Pearse wanted to commence or finish work early on a given day he would have been required to apply to Mr Thomas for leave. Applying for time in lieu or leave was described as being a two stage process. The first stage was to verbally seek approval from a supervisor, with the second stage being a formal process in which a leave form was signed by both parties prior to that leave being taken. Those forms are kept. Mr Moses provided that this form would have been most definitely required if Mr Pearse was to take time in lieu.
	
	
	Mr Moses gave evidence in cross-examination that he looked for the forms to see if any request for time in lieu had been made by Mr Pearse for that day, however that none were found. Mr Moses also made inquiries with Mr Thomas after the incident about whether a leave application had been made.
	
	
	Records showed on the day of the incident Mr Pearse clocked into work at 12.43pm but did not clock out. Mr Moses said that it would be unusual for an employee not to clock in or out. The failure to clock out by Mr Pearse has been investigated by the offender and Mr Pearse had been issued with a warning for failing to follow company process.
	
	
	In cross-examination Mr Moses gave evidence that the policy to ensure that a supervisor was on-shift at all times was written in the Business Policies and Procedures of the offender. There would be a handover of shift between supervisors to ensure that no supervisor left early.
	
	
	The machine was used most days and following the incident the offender developed a Safe Work Method Statement for unblocking the machine. Interlock devices were placed on the in-feed chute of the machine and similar devices were placed on other machines. The offender reviewed its machines to ensure compliance with the relevant standards.
	
	
	Mr Moses provided that supervisors undergo formal training every 6 months, whilst other employees receive refreshment training every 12 months. All employees are assessed on compliance.
	


Consideration


	
	I have had regard to the objects of the Act set out in section 3 and the purposes of sentencing set out in section 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Objective Seriousness of the Offence


	
	The proportionality principle requires that a sentence should neither exceed nor be less than the gravity of the crime having regard to the objective circumstances: Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472, 485-6, 490-1 and 496. At common law, the term “objective circumstances” was used to describe the circumstances of the crime. The gravity of the offence was assessed by reference to its objective seriousness: R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [15].
	
	
	The task requires the court to consider where in the range of conduct covered by the offence the conduct of the offender falls: Baumer v R (1988) 166 CLR 51 at 57. This assessment will generally indicate the appropriate range of sentences available which will reflect the objective seriousness of the offence committed, and set the limits within which a sentence proportional to the criminality of the offender will lie: BW v R [2011] NSWCCA 176 at [70].
	
	
	The sentencing judge should take into account not only the conduct which actually constitutes the crime, but also such of the surrounding circumstances as are directly related to that crime and are properly regarded as circumstances of aggravation or mitigation: R v Wilkinson (No 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [61].
	
	
	The existence of a reasonably foreseeable risk to safety that is likely to result in serious injury or death is a factor relevant to the gravity of the offence: Capral Aluminium Limited v Workcover Authority of New South Wales (2000) 49 NSWLR 610 at [89]. The question of foreseeability of the risk is to be determined objectively.
	
	
	The risk posed to employees when using machines with movable parts is an obvious one. The machine was not used everyday and had become blocked approximately 7 or 8 times in the preceding year.
	
	
	Employees had been generally instructed not to remove guards from machines whilst they were moving. Mr Torbuck had not been trained in isolation procedures or how to clear blockages in the machine. He had not been trained in how to safely operate the machine. No supervisor was present at the time as Mr Pearse left early without the authorisation of the offender. Any systems in place at the time of the incident were behavioural controls only. The system failed because Mr Torbuck was not trained on the machine and the supervisor was absent. But for the incident it appears that the measures in place went a substantial way towards ameliorating the risk.
	
	
	The risk in this case could have been eliminated by the use of an interlock device which prevented the in-feed chute from being removed whilst the rollers underneath were moving. The offender fitted such a device following the incident.
	
	
	Mr Torbuck sustained injuries to his right hand, arm and shoulder, and amputation of four fingers. He has required ongoing treatment including surgery. The risk was one of serious injury.
	
	
	Mr Torbuck put himself in a position of peril by attempting to clear the blockage in the way that he did. He acted contrary to his training not to remove the guards on machinery whilst it was in operation.
	
	
	The offence is in the low range of objective seriousness.
	


Deterrence


	
	The penalty imposed in relation to this offence must provide for general deterrence. Employers must take the obligations imposed by the Act very seriously. The community is entitled to expect that both small and large employers will comply with safety requirements. General deterrence is a significant factor when safety obligations are breached: Bulga Underground Operations Pty Ltd v Nash [2016] NSWCCA 37 at [180].
	
	
	There is also a need for specific deterrence, however in this case it is substantially reduced for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, the offender took immediate steps to improve the safety of the machine involved in the incident, as well as other machines at its factories. The offender also took a number of steps which I have outlined already to improve safety across the business.
	
	
	Second, the prior conduct of the offender in its regular training of employees and policy of 24 hour supervision on-site, demonstrated a commitment to workplace health and safety.
	
	
	Third, the offender has accepted responsibility for the breach of its duty which caused the injury to Mr Torbuck. It has provided extensive support to Mr Torbuck and his family over the two year period since the incident occurred.
	
	
	Specific deterrence remains relevant, despite my finding that the offender is unlikely to re-offend because the offender continues to employ a large workforce over a number of sites: Bulga Underground at [185].
	


Aggravating factors


	
	There are no relevant aggravating factors.
	


Mitigating factors


	
	The offender does not have any record of previous convictions: section 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This factor should be assessed by reference to the fact that the offender has been in operation for 21 years and operates five factories.
	
	
	The offender is unlikely to re-offend: section 21A(3)(f) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. At the time of the offence the offender had in place a number of systems to ensure that employees were adequately trained and that supervisors were on-site at all times, although those systems failed on the date of the incident. Following the incident the offender took significant steps to improve safety on its sites. The offender has demonstrated a genuine commitment to workplace health and safety. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender is unlikely to re-offend.
	
	
	The offender has demonstrated remorse: section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender took a number of steps after the incident to provide support to Mr Torbuck including financial support, modification of duties to assist him in returning to work, and assistance in undertaking further education and training. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender has accepted responsibility for its actions and demonstrated genuine remorse and contrition.
	
	
	The offender entered an early plea of guilty: section 21A(3)(k) and section 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender is entitled to a discount on penalty that reflects the utilitarian value of that plea. The extent of the discount should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25%, but that is only a guide. The primary consideration in determining where in the range a particular case should fall is the timing of the plea, so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount: R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]. The plea also indicates remorse: Borkowski at [32].
	
	
	The prosecutor accepted that the offender entered a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity and is entitled to the maximum discount on penalty. In the circumstances, the appropriate discount for the plea of guilty is 25%.
	
	
	It was submitted on behalf of the offender that I should take into account cooperation with investigating authorities as a mitigating factor pursuant to section 21A(3)(m) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This factor was not conceded by the prosecutor and was not the subject of any evidence at the sentencing hearing.
	


Penalty


	
	The offender is convicted.
	
	
	The appropriate fine is one of $100,000 that will be discounted by 25% to take into account the early plea of guilty.
	
	
	I impose a fine of $75,000.
	
	
	I order pursuant to section 122(2) Fines Act 1996 that 50% of the fine is to be paid to the prosecutor.
	
	
	I order that the offender pay the prosecutor’s costs as agreed in the sum of $25,000.

		01 August 2016",2016-07-31 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2701276,R v Gouliaditis (No 2) [2016] NSWDC 216,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: I will begin these remarks on sentence by repeating what I said on the last occasion Mr Gouliaditis appeared before me. Drugs are terrible things and users of drugs are often, indeed almost always when they are using drugs, terrible people. They lie, they cheat and they deceive as they pursue their desperate need to obtain drugs. The people who are responsible for much of this misery are drug dealers such as the offender who appears for sentence today. It is for this reason - the harm the drug dealers cause - that ordinarily those who are detected dealing in drugs receive severe, even harsh sentences.
	
	
	This offender’s decision to become a drug dealer to supply his own habit was one made when he was himself addicted to drugs. He decided to fund his addiction by supplying drugs to others. He was not one of those drug dealers who was attracted to that criminal activity by the promise of easy money and a luxurious lifestyle. Nevertheless through his drug dealing activities he exposed others to the awful consequences of drug use and drug addiction. His behaviour was wrong and seriously so.
	
	
	The offender had been a recreational drug user for some time since he was attending university. In 2001 he was fined for three offences of possessing a prohibited drug. He tried to abstain but after that drifted back to using drugs a few years later. His mental health went downhill in around 2012, at that time he broke up with a partner, briefly he reunited but then realised that the relationship would not be re-established. A further stress occurred when his parents became aware of his sexuality. Although his parents are fully supportive of him now their reaction when they learnt that he was a homosexual was not a happy one. He was depressed and used drugs to deal with it. At first ice helped him to deal with his emotions, that drug made it easier for him to work and socialise, but as is always the case such improvement was highly temporary. As his usage increased he became depressed and ashamed and began to hate himself.
	
	
	His drug use escalated to the stage where he was using ice intravenously. He entered what many people have described as a downward spiral. While he had previously been an exemplary employee and a very fine solicitor he began to fail to meet deadlines and unless he was in court he would not even get to work before 11am. His conduct was of such concern to his employers that they had arranged for him to be seen by a psychiatrist, that never came about because he was arrested before the consultation could take place.
	
	
	He became distressed as a result of stresses in the relationship with his third partner, a man who used drugs. As a result of his escalating drug use he was greatly in debt. He owed family members $20,000. On two credit cards he had debts totalling $30,000. And he also had personal loans totalling $17,000. It never occurred to him, such was the level of his addiction, that he could have stopped using drugs. Of course looking back at things later he now realises it would have been better to have been revealed as a drug user than to have become a drug dealer, but that is what he became.
	
	
	He has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to two offences, one of ongoing supply of a prohibited drug and another of possessing a prohibited weapon, namely a taser. His drug dealing activities were detected by police who, as part of their investigation, arranged for him to meet an undercover officer. On four occasions she purchased drugs from him. On the first occasion it was .28 grams of methylamphetamine for $200 and 10 mils of 1-4 butanediol for a hundred dollars. A week later he supplied her with a gram of methylamphetamine for $500 and 20 mils of 1-4 butanediol for $200. A further week later he obtained 10.5 grams of methylamphetamine supplying 3.22 grams of that drug to the undercover officer for $1,400. Shortly after that he supplied the undercover officer with 3.5 grams of methylamphetamine for $1,400 and a quantity of 1-4 butanediol for $2,500.
	
	
	Of course it is some comfort that those particular drugs did not actually make it to any users but the offender was not to know that and, in any case, he does not pretend that the only drugs he supplied were drugs to undercover police officers.
	
	
	When I sentence him for the offence of ongoing supply he has asked that I take into account five matters on a Form 1, one of those is an offence of supplying 2.25 grams of methylamphetamine to a man by the name of Gary McCort. The offender supplied him with methylamphetamine on three occasions after which Mr McCort was arrested and the drugs he had in his possession were seized. After he was released by police he contacted the offender and told him that he required further drugs to replace the ones that had been taken from him. The offender did supply him with drugs on that occasion.
	
	
	Also appearing on the Form 1 is an offence of resist arrest. When police arrested the offender he struggled with them. The police were particularly interested in seizing the iPhone that he had in his possession.
	
	
	When police searched him they found 1.38 grams of methylamphetamine and $1,145. The offence of possessing the quantity of methylamphetamine appears on the Form 1 as does an offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime relating to the money found in his possession.
	
	
	Finally when dealing with the Form 1 when police searched the offender’s car they found ten vials containing a total of 106.4 mils of 1-4 butanediol.
	
	
	After his arrest the offender told police that in his room at his home they would find a safe and in the safe they would find a taser. The offender provided police with the electronic code to access the safe and police did find such a prohibited weapon in the safe. The offender explained that a person who was supplying drugs with him tried to get him to buy the taser, when that request was made his partner was with him and he encouraged him to buy the taser, so he took it but never actually formed the intention to buy it. He gave evidence that he had never used the taser as part of his drug dealing activities.
	
	
	So the offender stands to be sentenced for the offence of ongoing supply of prohibited drug and possessing a prohibited weapon. Both offences are very serious. The drug matter carries a maximum penalty of 20 years while the prohibited weapon matter carries a maximum penalty of 14 years with a standard non-parole period of three years. I have taken into account both the maximum penalties and where appropriate the standard non-parole period in deciding on the sentences to impose on the offender. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period appear in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	As I mentioned the offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to those offences. There is also another factor which I will not mention but which is well known to the parties. When I take into account the pleas of guilty and that other factor I have decided to impose a sentence on the offender which is 40% less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	There is a principle of law which is well-know and which needs to be applied when drug dealers are sentenced. It is this; those who are trafficking to a substantial degree must receive a sentence of fulltime imprisonment unless there are exceptional circumstances. At least that was the principle of law stated at the time before the sentencing option of an intensive corrections order was available. Whether the principle continues to apply in those terms now that ICO’s are available is a matter worthy of consideration.
	
	
	Ultimately one day the Court of Criminal Appeal may provide some guidance as to whether the introduction of ICO’s as a sentencing option requires some modification of the well-known rule. In EF v R [2015] NSWCCA 36, Simpson JA at para 12 made an observation, she said:
	


“I further observe that, at the time these statements of ‘policy’ or ‘rule’ were made, the option of an intensive correction order did not exist that was introduced into the Sentencing Procedure Act with operation from 1 October 2010...”.


	
	Justice Simpson’s observations is one which has been made on many occasion by judges of this court.
	
	
	In my view it is important to recognise what sentencing options were available at the time the rule was first laid down and then repeated on many occasions. The most significant form of punishment short of fulltime custody was periodic detention. As is well known by the older judges and lawyers, the way periodic detention operated was such that after one third of the sentence had been completed there was no custodial component at all. Indeed it operated from then on more like a community service order than a sentence of imprisonment. One can understand, when that was the most significant punishment short of fulltime imprisonment, the rule that fulltime custody was required in cases where offenders were trafficking to a substantial degree, unless there were exceptional circumstances shown. One could understand why the rule would be stated in those terms, given the sentencing options available to sentencing judges at that time.
	
	
	Intensive corrections orders are, as Simpson JA recognised a new form of sentence. No one could suggest that they approach the severity of fulltime custody but they do involve substantial limitations on a person’s liberty.
	
	
	Of course what I have said thus far about the intensive corrections order option is of less importance if the offender satisfies me that there are exceptional circumstances which would justify a sentence of other than fulltime imprisonment. It has always conceded by Mr Boulten SC, who appears for the offender, that his client was trafficking to a substantial degree.
	
	
	Mr Boulten shouldered the burden of attempting to demonstrate to me that there were such exceptional circumstances. He fully acknowledged that no one circumstance was of itself exceptional, but together he submitted that they did amount to exceptional circumstances justifying a sentence of other than fulltime imprisonment. He referred to the following matters:
	
	
	Firstly there was the offender’s motive. I have already discussed this, this was not a case where the offender dealt in drugs to provide himself with a luxurious lifestyle. To the contrary his life was falling apart in a most unattractive way. His motivation for supplying drugs was to fund his own drug addiction.
	
	
	Secondly Mr Boulten relied on the offender’s psychiatric disorder which arose around the time he decided to sell drugs, for a number of reasons.
	
	
	The third matter relied on by Mr Boulten is something which I will not mention in these publically published remarks but again the parties know what I am talking about and if necessary so will the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	Fourthly Mr Boulten relied on the substantial remorse demonstrated by the offender. He now acknowledges that lives are destroyed through drug use and that his actions in supplying drugs helped to cause such harm.
	
	
	Mr Boulten relied on 11 months of quasi custody undergone by the offender. He spent 11 weeks in Odyssey House before he was asked to leave, not because of any drug use it should be emphasised, and then eight months in William Booth House from which he successfully graduated with glowing reports.
	
	
	Sixthly there is the topic of extrajudicial punishment. As I have mentioned the offender was a fine young lawyer with much promise. He accepts now that that career is now denied him.
	
	
	Seventhly there is the offender’s particular vulnerability in prison. He suffers from some physical illnesses, and he would no doubt find incarceration a frightening prospect as a result.
	
	
	The final matter relied on by Mr Boulten is the offender’s rehabilitation. When he first appeared before me he had only recently graduated from the Salvation Army program. For only a very short time he had been living in the community away from the highly structured experience of life in William Booth House. He had not used drugs while there and he had no intention of using drugs ever again, but as Major Seymour the then manager at William Booth House recognised, predicting whether he would be rehabilitated for life would be more accurately assessed if he demonstrated a substantial period of being drug free while in the community. Accordingly I adjourned the matter under s 11 of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act, over objection from the Crown,. As I explained at the time, his conduct while on the s 11 remand would be of assistance to me in deciding whether fulltime custody was required and if it was how long that should be.
	
	
	Further evidence was tendered today concerning Mr Gouliaditis’ behaviour since I adjourned the matter. His rehabilitation has continued, it has continued to the extent that he is now in fact employed fulltime at William Booth House. After the matter was adjourned he began by volunteering there. There was a staff shortage in January 2016 and the offender accepted casual fulltime employment. In February 2016 the position was offered to him on a permanent basis and Mr Gouliaditis accepted. Thus Mr Gouliaditis is in no small way doing much good for the community, particularly by assisting people of the type he harmed through his drug-dealing activities. Many times in sentencing considerations such as paying back to the community for the harm an offender has caused are taken into account. In this case the offender’s current role very much achieves what he can in that regard.
	
	
	As I mentioned he has harmed many people through supplying drugs to them but he is now assisting such people through his work at William Booth House. One consequence of where he works is that Mr Gouliaditis is almost on a daily basis assessed as to how his rehabilitation is going. A letter from Major Seymour, the offender’s employer was tendered today, he says:
	


“My view is that Nick is doing exceptionally well, he remains honest about the issues that underpinned his addiction and talks positively about how his life (in particular his relationship, family and friends) has improved since graduating from WBH. Importantly he continues to attend chapel every week, meet with his sponsor regularly and attend 12 step meetings. I am also aware that Nick is receiving treatment from a psychiatrist and therapist. These are the foundations of a strong recovery.”


	
	Other material tendered today supports the assertion that the offender’s rehabilitation is proceeding well. There is one qualification to that of course and that concerns a drug screening test conducted on a urine sample which the offender provided on 14 March 2016. Evidence was called as to the nature of the testing which produced that result. The offender gave evidence, expert reports were tendered, Mr Seymour’s letter refers to it and a letter from the offender’s sister was also tendered. I note that the Crown did not object to the hearsay nature of the letters from Mr Seymour and Sabula Gouliaditis, the offender’s sister.
	
	
	The conclusion I have reached regarding the test on 14 March sample is that it was a test which revealed a false positive. I say that for the following reasons: the evidence has established that the test conducted on that sample was a screening test only, it seems to be undisputed that substances other than amphetamine can react in a similar way to amphetamine in such a screening test and that further testing is required to either confirm or disprove the presence of amphetamine once a screening sample suggests that that drug might be present. Unfortunately for the reasons which were explained in evidence, such further testing was not possible on the 14 March sample, it having been destroyed seven days after the screening test was carried out.
	
	
	What I have already said about the nature of the test conducted on 14 March is confirmed by something else. A further screening test conducted in April has the notation FTR, (further testing required) but after such further testing was carried out it was revealed that there was no amphetamine present. That tends to support the assertion that the screening test can produce a false positive.
	
	
	The third factor which has led me to conclude that it was in fact a false positive concerns what is something I mentioned earlier. He was at the time, and still is, working fulltime at William Booth House - a place where many people are highly alert to the effects of drug use on people and could be expected more than almost anyone else in the community to be able to identify when a person has used drugs. Major Seymour, who at that time had daily contact with the offender, saw no indication that he had taken drugs, nor did any other staff at William Booth House raise their concerns that the offender had used drugs with Major Seymour.
	
	
	There was also a letter from the offender’s sister to which I made earlier reference. It is important to note that the test of the sample on 14 March came six days after a negative result from a sample produced on 8 March. Thus if the offender had in fact used drugs it must have been in those six days, yet the letter from Ms Gouliaditis speaks about his movements in those six days and her observations of him over that time. There are also inconsistent with the offender having used drugs in that six day period.
	
	
	I should not also that the offender himself gave sworn evidence that he had not used drugs since he first appeared before me. He was cross‑examined with an appropriate degree of scepticism by the Crown. His answers explained many of the concerns that I might otherwise have had as to whether he truly had given up drugs as he told me had.
	
	
	And then the final matter I took into account regarding the test of 14 March was that after this experience there was a change in the testing facilities used. From then on the offender began to use a testing facility which complied with the relevant Australian Standard. He has been regularly tested since moving to that testing facility and there has been no further suggestion of there being any amphetamines in his urine. For those reasons I am satisfied that the result produced from the testing of 14 March sample was a false positive and did not demonstrate the offender’s use of illegal drugs.
	
	
	As I mentioned earlier, when the matter was first before me the Crown opposed a s 11 remand. It was the Crown’s position at that stage that nothing less than fulltime custody was required. I gather that the Crown has now modified its position. The Crown emphasises that custody of some sort is required but no longer presses for fulltime custody. Sometimes when the Crown agrees with a submission put by counsel for an offender it makes the job of sentencing job harder rather than easier. This is not a jurisdiction where parties can bind the judge about what sentencing outcome is appropriate.
	
	
	I am satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances justifying a sentence of other than fulltime imprisonment. I have determined the length of the sentences to impose upon the offender and after taking into account the discount of 40% to reflect the offender’s early pleas and the other matter, alternatives to fulltime custody thus become available. Given the likelihood of a sentence of two years or less I propose to refer the offender for assessment as to his suitability to serve that sentence by means of an intensive corrections order.
	
	
	There are only two conditions of bail, not to use, any illegal drugs whatsoever and to tell the officer-in-charge if he moves address within 24 hours of having moved.

		15 September 2016",2016-07-21 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2701280,Zuhaib Shahzad v R [2016] NSWCCA 94,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with N Adams J and with the orders which she proposes.
	
	
	CAMPBELL J: I agree that the orders proposed by N Adams J should be made for the reasons her Honour gives.
	
	
	N ADAMS J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed upon him at the District Court at Sydney on 20 March 2015. The sole ground of appeal is that the applicant suffers a justifiable sense of grievance when comparing the sentence imposed upon him with the sentence imposed upon his co-offenders.
	
	
	On 1 May 2014, the applicant and his two co-offenders Wasim Abdul Kherkhah and a juvenile offender who shall be referred to herein as OA were arraigned on an indictment containing two counts of robbery armed with a dangerous weapon contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and one count of conspiracy to commit a robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. The applicant and his two co-offenders all pleaded not guilty. A trial proceeded before Frearson DCJ and a jury of twelve. The jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of each count against all three offenders on 6 June 2014.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 is 25 years’ imprisonment. Conspiracy is a common law offence for which the penalty is at large.
	
	
	Proceedings on sentence were conducted in relation to all three offenders concurrently and on 20 March 2015 all three offenders were sentenced at the same time. The applicant was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of nine years and six months with a non-parole period of six years, to date from the day he went into custody on 13 March 2011.
	
	
	The indicative sentence for Count 1 on the indictment (‘the Liquorland robbery’), taking into account a Form 1 offence of allowing himself to being carried in a stolen vehicle contrary to s 154A(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900, was imprisonment for seven years and four months. For Count 2 (‘the Brewhouse robbery’) the indicative sentence was imprisonment for seven years and three months. In respect of Count 3, the conspiracy to rob the Prospect Hotel, the indicative sentence was one of imprisonment for five years and three months.
	
	
	The co-offender Mr Kherkhah received an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for eight years and three months with a non-parole period of five years. In sentencing Mr Kherkhah for the Liquorland robbery, his Honour took into account on a Form 1 an unrelated armed robbery contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 as well as an offence of allowing himself to be carried in a stolen vehicle. He was also sentenced for two offences of possess prohibited pistol contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW). The co-offender OA received an aggregate sentence of seven years with a non-parole period of four years and three months. In addition to the offences on the indictment, OA was sentenced in relation to an offence of possess prohibited firearm contrary to s 7(1). Two unrelated offences of armed robbery contrary to s 97(1) and a further offence of possess prohibited firearm were taken into account on a Form 1.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the sentence imposed upon him on a sole ground of appeal asserting disparity as between the sentence imposed upon him as compared with those imposed upon his co-offenders.
	


Factual background


	
	There was no dispute as to the facts on sentence and they are common to each of the offenders. Despite his Honour having heard all of the evidence at the trial, an agreed statement of facts was tendered at the sentence proceedings and formed the basis of the facts as found for the purposes of sentencing.
	


Liquorland robbery (Count 1)


	
	At about 8pm on 6 March 2011, the applicant and his co-offenders Wasim Kherkhah and OA drove to Liquorland at Kings Langley in a white Camry sedan and parked in an adjacent car park.
	
	
	Each offender was disguised, wearing dark clothing, a balaclava and gloves. One was armed with a 9mm pistol with a silencer and one with a knife. The third offender was carrying a tartan bag.
	
	
	The offender with the pistol held it to the head of the store attendant Ricky Young and demanded that he open the safe. After being told that it would take four minutes to open the safe, the offenders took cash from the till, as well and cigarettes, before fleeing in the white Camry. As the offenders were leaving, the offender with the pistol told Ricky Young to run to the backroom “or I’ll shoot you.”
	
	
	In the course of the robbery, the offender with the knife had made two elderly customers at the back of the store sit on the floor. That offender had also told a second male employee, who appeared from the rear storeroom, to sit on the floor.
	
	
	The property stolen had a total value of $3,645.
	


Brewhouse robbery (Count 2)


	
	The events the subject of Count 2 on the indictment occurred on 7 March 2011 at Lalor Park. At about 11pm, the applicant, Mr Kherkhah, OA and a fourth co-offender Edris Barez arrived at the car park of the Brewhouse Hotel in the same white Camry that was used in the Liquorland robbery.
	
	
	Three of the offenders entered the Hotel through the rear while the fourth remained in the Camry. Once again, one of the offenders was armed with a pistol while another carried a knife, and the third person carried only a tartan carry bag. The offenders wore dark clothing, balaclavas, hoods and other face coverings.
	
	
	The offenders threatened the staff of the Hotel with the weapons. James Mayol, a security guard, had a gun pointed at him and was ordered to sit on the ground. The offenders took money from the till. The offender with the pistol pointed it at the manager, Tracey Kisiel, and demanded that she lead him to the safe in the manager’s office. She did so and that offender obtained approximately $28,000 from the safe.
	
	
	The three offenders fled out the rear of the Hotel and into the waiting car.
	
	
	The money stolen amounted to $31,187.
	


Prospect Hotel conspiracy (Count 3)


	
	At around 9pm on 8 March 2011, CCTV captured the applicant, Mr Kherkhah and OA visiting the Prospect Hotel in Prospect. They conducted surveillance for about 20 minutes.
	
	
	On 9 March 2011, the applicant and Mr Kherkhah stopped the applicant’s car in area of the M4 adjacent to the Prospect Hotel. They were apparently overheard speaking of needing a torch and about the place being “only two minutes away.”
	
	
	At about 8pm on 13 March 2011, the three offenders and other men drove to the same location on the M4 in the applicant’s car. Another co-offender Gurbaz Nagi was the driver on this occasion. The applicant, Mr Kherkhah and OA left the vehicle and went into the bushes adjacent to the Hotel. Their movements were monitored by PolAir. Shortly thereafter police arrested the applicant and OA together on Toongabbie Road. Mr Kherkhah was arrested on Blacktown Road.
	


Remarks on Sentence

Relative culpability of the three co-offenders


	
	The sentencing judge considered that it was not possible to differentiate between the applicant, Mr Kherkhah and OA in terms of their culpability for the offending conduct in Counts 1 and 2. His Honour said of Count 1:
	


“All three offenders will be sentenced on the basis that they were intruders. All bear full responsibility for what took place and this is not one of those cases where a participant in a joint enterprise can be considered less culpable than others by virtue of the role that was played. It is not one of those cases and I treat them all, in terms of the objective gravity, as being similarly culpable.”


	
	In relation to the Brewhouse robbery, his Honour observed:
	


“This was a particularly serious example of this type of offence. There is no reason to distinguish between the culpability of the offenders. It was a well-planned, thuggish, brazen, and well-organised robbery by young men with weapons.”


	
	His Honour made no express finding as to relative culpability in relation to the conspiracy charge. Given that no material difference as between the relative culpability of the three offenders can be ascertained from the agreed facts, I am prepared to accept that his Honour sentenced the offenders on the basis that they were also all equally culpable for that offence.
	


Findings in respect of the applicant


	
	The applicant was raised in Pakistan. He moved to Australia as part of a sponsored family at the age of 15 whereupon he settled in Wentworthville and later in Granville. His father left the family and was absent for some 10 years. As a consequence, the applicant experienced financial disadvantage. At the age of 13, the applicant and his family were robbed at gunpoint in their home.
	
	
	In 2010, the applicant travelled to Pakistan against his will to marry a cousin as part of an arranged marriage. The applicant was subsequently reported to police for non-consummation of the marriage and was incarcerated for a period of time. The applicant’s experiences in custody in Pakistan caused the applicant to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”), a condition for which he has self-medicated with alcohol and illicit drugs.
	
	
	The applicant did not give evidence on sentence. A psychologist’s report under the hand of Jason Borkowski was tendered on behalf of the applicant at sentence, which included a diagnosis of PTSD and substance abuse disorder. Mr Borkowski was cross-examined at length in the course of the sentence proceedings. Although his Honour accepted the diagnosis of PTSD, he ultimately rejected the applicant’s claim to Mr Borkowski that a drug debt in the amount of $20,000 was a significant motivator of his offending behaviour.
	
	
	Although the sentencing judge recounted the above history in his remarks on sentence, he made no finding as to whether he considered the applicant’s subjective circumstances as being disadvantaged in any way.
	
	
	The applicant was 21 years old at the time of Liquorland and Brewhouse robberies. He turned 22 shortly before his arrest for the conspiracy charge.
	
	
	The applicant had only one prior conviction on his criminal record. That conviction was for common assault. The Pre-Sentence Report tendered on his behalf on sentence disclosed that he had an “outstanding work ethic” in custody and showed leadership qualities, although there had been some early misconduct.
	
	
	The sentencing judge found the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation to be “fair” at the highest. He further found that, although the applicant accepted responsibility for his offending behaviour, there was no evidence of genuine remorse.
	
	
	His Honour found special circumstances being the applicant’s mental condition and varied the statutory ratio such that the non-parole period represented 63% of the total aggregated sentence imposed on the applicant.
	


Findings in respect of co-offender Mr Kherkhah


	
	The co-offender Mr Kherkhah moved with his family from Afghanistan to Australia as a child. He was described as experiencing social isolation and difficulties in his education. He was sexually assaulted while he was in Year 8 and consequently also suffers from PTSD. The sentencing judge made a positive finding that Mr Kherkhah’s life had been “quite disadvantaged.”
	
	
	He was 18 years old at the time of the commission of the offences. The sentencing judge took into account his “state of maturity,” making a finding that he is “…much younger than Mr Shahzad.” He had previously been dealt with in the Children’s Court for an offence of armed robbery. He was sentenced in relation to matters additional to those upon which the applicant was sentenced, being two further counts of being in possession of a pistol. He also asked for an additional armed robbery offence to be taken into account on a Form 1 in relation to the Liquorland robbery.
	
	
	His Honour could not conclude that Mr Kherkhah was unlikely to re-offend and noted that he had recommenced using drugs in custody. His Honour found that that he presented a moderate to high risk of recidivism and that he exhibited a “low level” of remorse.
	


Findings in relation to the juvenile co-offender


	
	The juvenile offender OA was aged 17 years at the time of the commission of the Liquorland and Brewhouse robberies. His father had been murdered by the Taliban in Afghanistan when OA was four years old. As a result his family fled to Pakistan. The applicant moved to Australia at the age of 10, where he was the victim of bullying at school. The sentencing judge found that, “…he has a particularly tragic background and a background of profound, and substantial, and obvious, disadvantage.”
	
	
	OA had previously received a sentence of probation in the Children’s Court for an offence of robbery in company. At the time of being sentenced for these matters he was also sentenced in relation to an additional count of possessing a weapon. He asked for a further charge of possessing a weapon to be taken into account on a Form 1 in relation to that offence. He also asked that two offences of armed robbery be taken into account when being sentenced for the Liquorland robbery.
	
	
	OA had no drug habit. His prospects of rehabilitation were found to be “at least fair but verging on good.” His Honour also found that he was remorseful, exhibited no misconduct in custody, and that had been a “dramatic change in his behaviour in custody.”
	


The applicant’s submissions


	
	The applicant relies upon the difference between the aggregate sentence imposed upon him and those imposed upon co-offenders Mr Kherkhah and OA in circumstances where the sentencing judge declined to differentiate between their respective roles. Further, Mr Kherkhah and OA asked that further offences of armed robbery contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 be taken into account on Forms 1. It is contended that the difference is such as would give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant.
	
	
	On behalf of the applicant it was contended that the only difference between the three young offenders is their age at the time of the commission of the offences: 17 years, 18 years and nearly 22 years respectively.
	
	
	The applicant submits that the co-offenders were, to a large degree, like offenders who ought to be treated in a like manner: per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [28].
	
	
	Co-offender Eddie Barez was also sentenced in relation to the Brewhouse robbery and Prospect Hotel conspiracy and Gurbaz Nagi in relation solely to the Prospect Hotel conspiracy. The applicant does not rely on any disparity with the sentences imposed upon those offenders.
	


The respondent’s submissions


	
	The respondent submits that the applicant has not demonstrated error. It is contended that the difference between the aggregate sentences imposed upon the applicant, Mr Kherkhah and OA is explicable by reference to the different subjective findings made in respect of each co-offender. The differentiation is said to give effect to those findings.
	
	
	The respondent relied upon this decision of this court in Tuivaga v R [2015] NSWCCA 125 where Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom RA Hulme and Wilson JJ agreed) observed the following:
	


“[55] It is of significance that the same judge sentenced both the applicant and Barnes. He was fully cognisant of their moral culpability and of their subjective cases. Specifically, his Honour was fully aware of the difference in their subjective cases and he reflected that difference by a reduction of 6 months in the non-parole period of imprisonment to be served by the applicant.

[56] In such circumstances, where the primary judge has recognised the importance of the parity principle and has given effect to it, this Court has said that it will be cautious and not overly willing to intervene. Disparity which leads to appellate intervention must be “gross, marked or glaring” (Tan v R [2014] NSWCCA 96 at [39]). In Mammone v R [2013] NSWCCA 95 at [45] – [46] Latham J (with whom Button J and Grove AJ agreed) said:

“45 ... The imposition of different sentences does not, without more, raise ""equal justice"" considerations. Moreover, a sense of grievance is only ""justifiable"" or legitimate if the application of objective criteria compels the court to that conclusion. The age, background, criminal history and role in the offence of various offenders may justify some disparity: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49 at [31].46 In particular, as the majority in Green & Quinn make clear,A court of criminal appeal deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity will have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders.”

Consideration


	
	It is well established that a court may reduce a sentence not in itself manifestly excessive “in order to avoid a marked disparity with a sentence imposed on a co-offender."" Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at [31].
	
	
	As Gibbs CJ observed in Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606, ""…the reason why the court interferes in such a case is that it considers that the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done.""
	
	
	As the plurarity observed in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at [62] (footnotes omitted):
	


“The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria. The application of the parity principle does not involve a judgment about the feelings of the person complaining of disparity. The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise.”


	
	The authorities indicate that this Court should be slow to interfere with the discretion of a sentencing judge on the basis of disparity and that such intervention should only be on cases where the disparity is “gross, marked or glaring”. This is particularly the case where, as here, the offenders are all sentenced by the same judge: Lam v R [2014 NSWCCA 50 at [42]; Loader v R; Dunn v R [2013] NSWCCA 215 at [91]-[96].
	
	
	In the present case the sentencing judge was undoubtedly conscious of the issue of parity observing, in the context of referring to s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 2001 (NSW), that “there are also some equal justice considerations.” His Honour gave detailed reasons for the sentences imposed, setting out the relevant subjective matters and making specific findings regarding remorse and prospects of rehabilitation. As none of the offenders had pleaded guilty, his Honour was in a position to observe all three offenders through both the trial and sentencing proceedings. Despite this, it is noted that none of the three offenders gave evidence before him.
	
	
	The applicant has not established that the difference between the aggregate sentence imposed upon the applicant and that imposed upon OA gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. It is accepted, as is contended by the applicant, that OA had engaged in ‘adult behaviour’: R v Voss [2003] NSWCCA 182 at [14]. However, OA was still a child at the time of the commission of two of the three offences for which he was sentenced. His background of disadvantage and trauma eclipsed that of both the applicant and Mr Kherkhah. The sentencing judge expressly had regard to s. 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1997 and the principles relevant to sentencing young offenders as set out in KT v R (2008) NSWCCA 51; 182 A Crim R 571 when he sentenced OA.
	
	
	The differences as between the applicant and Mr Kherkhah are more difficult to identify. As the High Court observed in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen, a difference in sentence can be justified upon the basis of differences as between the co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise.
	
	
	As for the part each of the offenders played in the criminal conduct, his Honour sentenced each on the basis that they were equally culpable. No differentiation on the basis of criminality is relevant. I note from the Remarks on Sentence that the evidence tended to suggest that the applicant was the only offender not holding a weapon. Despite this, his Honour assessed the criminality of the co-offenders as equal.
	
	
	Turning to the differences in their subjective cases, I note the following features.
	
	
	First, the applicant was nearly four years older than Mr Kherkhah, the difference being between 18 and nearly 22 years of age. While age is certainly a legitimate basis for differentiation, a young man of 21 years turning 22 years of age may not be considered significantly more mature than a young man of 18 years. The sentencing judge took into account Mr Kherkhah’s “state of maturity” and found that he was “…much younger than Mr Shahzad.” In circumstances where neither the applicant nor Mr Kherkhah gave evidence and in the absence of any expert evidence to that effect, it appears that such a finding could only have been based on the fact of their relative ages.
	
	
	Second, there was a slight difference in their criminal histories in that the applicant’s was less serious. Whereas the applicant only had a prior conviction for common assault, Mr Kherkhah had a prior conviction for armed robbery.
	
	
	Third, the applicant was only being sentenced for the three matters of which he was convicted at trial. Mr Kherkhah was also being sentenced for additional firearms offences.
	
	
	Fourth, whereas the applicant asked that a matter of take and drive conveyance be taken into account on a Form 1 in relation to the Brewhouse robbery pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, Mr Kherkhah asked that a more serious, and unrelated, matter be taken into account, namely one offence of armed robbery in addition to an offence of deemed larceny. As Spigelman CJ observed in Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 at 159:
	


“The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence.”

In these circumstances, it would be expected that the Mr Kherkhah’s Form 1 matters would impinge in some way upon his sentence for the offence on the indictment.


	
	Fifth, it is difficult to identify any significant differences in the subjective circumstances of the applicant and Mr Kherkhah. Both were diagnosed as suffering from PTSD. Both have suffered some disadvantage in their childhoods as set out above. Although his Honour expressly made a finding that Mr Kherkhah’s life had been “quite disadvantaged,” he made no finding either way on that issue in relation to the applicant.
	
	
	Sixth, the sentencing judge found the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation to be “fair” at the highest and that there was no evidence of genuine remorse. His Honour observed that he could not make a finding that Mr Kherkhah was unlikely to re-offend. Moreover, he found that he presented a moderate to high risk of recidivism and exhibited a “low level” of remorse.
	
	
	Overall, putting to one side the three to four year age gap, all of the differences as between the applicant and Mr Kherkhah pointed towards, if anything, the applicant’s subjective features being more favourable than those of Mr Kherkhah. In circumstances where there was found to be no difference in their culpability, it is difficult to see how the applicant received a head sentence one year and three months longer and a non-parole period one year longer than that imposed on Mr Kherkhah.
	
	
	A court will not intervene to re-sentence an offender based on perceived disparity unless the difference is “gross, marked or glaring.” The question as to whether a difference in sentence is “marked” is one upon which reasonable minds may differ. For my part I accept that a difference in the non-parole period of twelve months and a difference in the head sentence of one year and three months are sufficiently marked as to warrant the intervention of this court. I accept that the disparity between the sentences imposed upon the applicant and Mr Kherkhah is such as would tend to give rise to justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant.
	
	
	I consider that the applicant has established error.
	


Re-sentence


	
	Error having been established, it is necessary for this Court to exercise afresh the discretion to re-sentence the applicant: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601 at [42].
	
	
	An affidavit affirmed by the applicant on 7 April 2016 was filed in the application to be read in the event that error was established and the court proceeded to re-sentence. In re-sentencing the applicant I take into account the information contained in that affidavit pertaining to the applicant’s commitment to his vocational training as well as his commitment to refrain from substance use. He is apparently managing his symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression with prescribed medication.
	
	
	For the purpose of re-sentencing I accept the findings made by the sentencing judge. Consistent with the findings I have made above I am mindful of the need in re-sentencing the applicant to achieve parity with the sentence imposed on his co-offender Mr Kherkhah. I have taken into account the differences in the ages as between the applicant and Mr Kherkah. I am satisfied that some disparity as between their sentences is appropriate for that difference. I have taken into account the principle of totality. I make a finding of special circumstances based on the evidence as to the applicant’s PTSD.
	
	
	Having regard to the objective seriousness of the offending, the applicant’s subjective features and the sentences imposed on his co-offenders, I consider that the appropriate sentence for the applicant is an aggregate sentence of eight years and nine months with a non-parole period of five years and six months. The indicative sentences are six years and nine months (for the Liquorland robbery), six years and eight months (for the Brewhouse robbery) and four years and ten months (Prospect Hotel conspiracy).
	


ORders    


	
	I propose that the Court make the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	Quash the sentence imposed by Frearson DCJ on 20 March 2015.
	
	
	Sentence the applicant to a period of imprisonment for eight years and nine months to date from 13 March 2011 and expiring on 12 December 2019 with a non-parole period of five years and six months. The applicant will become eligible for parole on 12 September 2016.
