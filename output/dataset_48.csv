GROUNDS OF DECISION
On 24 May 1986, the abovenamed Chia Ee Lin ('the petitioner') was lawfully married to the abovenamed Gwee Hak Theng ('the respondent'). Both are Advocates and Solicitors. At all material times, the petitioner was practising as a legal assistant to the respondent in the firm of Spencer Gwee & Co.
On 19 May 1988, a female child of the said marriage by the name of Samantha Gwee Shou Xi ('the child') was born.
On 14 June 1991, the petitioner fled from the matrimonial home at No.19, Jalan Buloh Perindu, Singapore, clad in T-shirt, shorts and slippers, leaving the child behind.
On 31 July 1991, the petitioner filed this Petition for divorce on the ground that she cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent as the respondent is a man of violent temper, abusive and insulting to her both in private and in public and had on many occasions used and/or threatened the use of violence on her person. The petitioner also prays for custody of the child.
As the petitioner was denied access to the child by the respondent since she fled from the matrimonial home, she applied by Summons in Chambers entered No. 5138 of 1991 on 16 August 1991 for sole custody, care and control of the child and for monthly maintenance for the child.
On 23 August 1991, Chan Sek Keong J., as he then was, made an interim order pending the disposal of this application, granting the petitioner interim access to the child on Mondays and Wednesdays from 5.00 pm to 8.00 pm, on Saturdays from 2.00 pm to 6.00 pm and on alternate Sundays from 9.00 am to 2.00 pm. It was further ordered that access be effected by the respondent handing the child to the petitioner at the Mountbatten Community Centre. The child was also to be returned to the respondent at the said community centre at the end of the petitioner's access period. Leave was also given to the parties to cross examine all deponents of the affidavits.
On 30 August 1991, the petitioner filed an application in Summons in Chambers entered No. 5481 of 1991 to vary the said interim order of Chan Sek Keong J. to the effect 'that pending the disposal of the application under Summons in Chambers No.5138 of 1991, the custody, care and control of the child ...' be forthwith vested in the petitioner with access to the respondent on Mondays and Wednesdays from 5.00 pm to 8.00 pm, on Saturdays from 2.00 pm to 6.00 pm and on alternate Sundays from 9.00 am to 2.00 pm.
The application in Summons in Chambers No. 5481 of 1991 was heard by Chan Sek Keong J. on 5 September 1991. He varied his earlier order by giving additional access to the petitioner pending the hearing of her application in Summons in Chambers entered No. 5138 of 1991 then fixed on 10 September 1991 as follows:
(i) Thursday 5 September 1991 from 4.00 pm to 7.00 pm; (ii) Friday 6 September 1991 from 9.00 am to 2.00 pm but if the child was in kindergarten in the morning from 1.00 pm to 5.00 pm; (iii) Saturday 7 September 1991 from 2.00 pm to 6.00 pm; (iv) Sunday 8 September 1991 from 9.00 am to 4.00 pm and (v) Monday 9 September 1991 from 9.00 am to 2.00 pm but if the child was in kindergarten in the morning from 1.00 pm to 5.00 pm.
The petitioner's application in Summons in Chambers entered No. 5138 of 1991 then came up for hearing before me on 10, 11, 19 and 23 September and it was then adjourned part heard. Pending the resumed hearing, I made an interim custody order in favour of the petitioner with access to the respondent on Mondays to Fridays daily from 6.00 pm to 9.00 pm, on Saturdays from 2.00 pm to 6.00 pm, on Sundays from 9.00 am to 4.00 pm. To reduce contact between the parties to the minimum, I also directed that access was to be effected by a relative or servant of the respondent picking up the child from the petitioner's residence at 41 Quemoy Road and the return by a relative or servant of the petitioner picking up the child from 19 Jalan Buloh Perindu.
The matter then came on for resumed hearing on 17 to 21 February, 2 to 5 March, 21 and 28 March and 31 March 1992. At the conclusion of the hearing I confirmed the interim custody order in favour of the petitioner, the respondent to have access to the child on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5.45 pm to 8.45 pm, on Saturdays from 2.00 pm to 6.00 pm and alternate Sundays from 9.00 am to 4.00 pm. The child is to be picked up from and returned to 41 Quemoy Road by a relative of the respondent. I also ordered the respondent to pay monthly a sum of $1000 for the maintenance of the child with effect from 1 March 1992 and costs of this application. I also declared that there was no basis for the allegations made against third parties by the respondent in these proceedings. The respondent has appealed against my decision. I now give the grounds for my decision.
On custody, s 118 of the Women's Charter Cap 353 provides:
""In any suit for divorce, or for nullity of marriage, or for judicial separation, the court may, at any stage of the proceedings, or after a decree absolute has been pronounced, make such orders as it thinks fit with respect to the welfare of any child and may vary or discharge the said orders, and may, if it thinks fit, direct proceedings to be taken for placing the child under the protection of the court.""
In making any order for custody, the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child. See s 119 of the Women's Charter which states:
""(1)The court may at any time by order place a child in the custody of his or her father or his or her mother or < where there are exceptional circumstances making it undesirable that the child be entrusted to either parent > of any other relative of the child or of any organisation or association the objects of which include child welfare, or to any other suitable person. (2) In deciding in whose custody a child should be placed, the paramount consideration shall be the welfare of the child and subject to this, the court shall have regard - (a)to the wishes of the parents of the child; and (b)to the wishes of the child, where he or she is of an age to express an independent opinion.""
Similar provisions are to be found in s 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act Cap 122:
""Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and save in so far as such welfare otherwise requires the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody ... nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.""
Section 119(2) of the Women's Charter was considered by the Court of Appeal in Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold 
(1991) 2 MLJ 147
. In delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Chao Hick Tin J. at page 150 stated:
""Obviously the court has to take all relevant factors into account in considering the welfare of the children. It seemed to us clear that the learned judge had this foremost in his mind when he made the following observations: 'The practical application of this principle (i.e. s 119(2) of the Women's Charter) is not always easy in matrimonial causes disputes where custody is fought for, and children are almost the unfortunate objects of their parents' attention: more often than not, a court has to decide on a balance of various competing and conflicting considerations.' We agree with counsel for the appellant that some of the relevant factors are these: (i)the conduct of the parties; (ii)the wishes of the parents and the wishes of the child where he or she is of an age to be able to express an independent opinion; (iii)a young child would be best looked after by its mother; (iv)which party can offer better security and stability; and (v)that siblings should not be separated. We also agree that the fact that one parent is more capable of providing material comfort for a child does not necessarily render that parent a better parent and thus entitles him or her to the custody of the child. In the final analysis it is an exercise in weighing the relevant factors which often conflict.""
The child is a little girl born on 19 May 1988. She is the only child. When the petitioner was 7 months pregnant, and the scan showed the child to be a girl, the respondent showed his disappointment and walked out of the consultation room. On their return to the matrimonial home, he threw her things out and drove her out of the house. The respondent does not dispute his disappointment. He said at the hearing at page 53 of the Notes of Evidence:
""I was disappointed because my brother also had girls and they were also similarly disappointed. There are more girls in our family. This is no big deal. Put it you were unduly sensitive over my expression of disappointment.""
In support of her application for custody of the child the petitioner alleged physical violence by the respondent. These include but are not limited to the following:
(1)That in 1987 the respondent slapped the petitioner in her face so hard that she sustained a hairline fracture of the bridge of the nose. The respondent denied slapping her and causing the injury and deposed that the `petitioner had in fact hit her head by accident against the bedroom door. This occurred whilst she was in a tirade and a violent mood.' (2)That in September 1990 the respondent threatened her with a 12"" knife pressing it against her throat. The respondent admitted pointing the knife at the petitioner but not at the throat but sought to justify it by an alleged confession by the petitioner of adultery. The petitioner denied committing adultery and denied ever making any confession of adultery. To this date, no co-respondent has been cited. On the `knife' incident the respondent during the hearing admitted under cross-examination at page 167-168 of the Notes of Evidence as follows:
""Q:On the September 1990 incident (knife incident) do you agree it was a 12"" knife?
A:It is a normal knife taken from the kitchen. It could be about 12"".
Q:How close were you from her?
A:From where I was pointing the knife and the tip of the blade is about 6"" from her face.""
(3)That sometime between December 1990 and February 1991, the respondent went to her room at their law office, locked the door and then abused and assaulted her. The respondent confirmed the occurrence of this incident but gave his version as follows: `This incident did not occur in the manner described by the petitioner. There was an argument in the office concerning her name being included in the office unit that I was purchasing. In fact the petitioner had attempted to push me against the wall but she lost her balance and knocked herself against the table. I took her to the doctor.' (4)That in the evening of 14 June 1991, the respondent who had always refused to attend any of the petitioner's family functions, tried to force her to attend a wedding dinner with him. She refused and locked herself in her bedroom. They had been sleeping in separate rooms by then. She had also by then been sleeping with a 7 iron golf club by her side as protection against the respondent. The respondent tried to break down her bedroom door. The petitioner telephoned the respondent's sister Juliet Khoo and requested her to talk to the respondent over the telephone to calm him down. After receiving a call from Juliet, the respondent is said to have shouted: `call Juliet to embarrass me, will you. I will smash your face. It will be worth 5 years.' He then attempted again to break down the bedroom door. Fearing for her life, she fled through the other door of the room, ran down the staircase and out of the house clad only in shorts, T-shirt and wearing a pair of slippers. She jumped into the first taxi that came along and did not return to live at the matrimonial home thereafter. This incident was substantially confirmed by the respondent when he deposed: `Although the petitioner had intimated that she was coming that night to my family's dinner, she refused to come, taunting me from behind the locked bedroom. I gave her 10 minutes to dress and was on the verge of leaving the home when I received a telephone call from my sister, Mrs Juliet Khoo, informing me that the petitioner refused to come. I went upstairs and shook the collapsible door between our bedrooms but she left from the < other > door of her room without my knowing this. I did not see her nor did I know what she was wearing when she left. I did not threaten her nor did I force her out of the house.' The respondent's version, in my view, confirmed the petitioner's version. There was no reason for the petitioner to telephone Juliet Khoo just to tell her the petitioner was not going to the dinner. Juliet Khoo obviously telephoned the respondent at the request of the petitioner to try to calm him as alleged by the petitioner. (5)That their maid Susanita Almendralejo (`Susanita') was assaulted by the respondent for allowing the petitioner into the matrimonial home to visit the child. The respondent is said to have slapped the maid on the face and pulled her hair. Susanita in her affidavit deposed as follows: `On 24 July 1991, the petitioner came to the house to see her daughter. She asked me to open the gate for her to enter. I agreed to do so as I was very unhappy that Samantha could not see her mother. The petitioner spent about 20 minutes with Samantha. She left when the respondent's mother telephoned the respondent at the office to inform him that the petitioner was in the house. About half an hour later, the respondent returned to the house. He was very angry at me for opening the gate and allowing the petitioner in. He shouted at me. He pulled my hair, squeezed my neck with his hands and slapped my face.' The respondent denied the allegation but in so denying seemed to admit to pulling her hair. `... I did chastise the maid but I did not do more than hold her hair to vent my frustration to the maid for ignoring my instructions not to open the door and not to let the petitioner into the matrimonial home without contacting me.' The respondent also refused to pay Susanita her salary and did not allow her any days off. It subsequently also emerged that he refused to release her personal belongings which to this day are still with the respondent. I found the respondent's explanation for not paying Susanita incredible. The explanation in the letter from his solicitors to the petitioner's solicitors, being exhibit CEL-2 to the petitioner's affidavit of 30 August 1991 read: `The arrangement made with the maid is that her wages are kept and this is within the knowledge of your client.' But see page 42 of the Notes of Evidence when the petitioner was being cross-examined by the respondent:
""Q: Did you know Susanita was unhappy because I was keeping her salary?
A: I did not know she was unhappy and I did not know she had not been paid until much later.""
Quite clearly payment of the maid's salary was withheld by the respondent without the consent of the maid and not in accordance with arrangements made with her. Eventually Susanita ran away on 25 August 1991 and sought refuge in the home of her former employer one Deborah Tsui. (6)That on 18 August 1991, the petitioner telephoned the matrimonial home and informed the respondent's mother that she was coming to visit the child. She arrived at 11.00 am accompanied by her friend Anita Chew who is also an Advocate and Solicitor. On their arrival, they found the door open but the gate was locked. The petitioner rang the bell for 10-15 minutes but there was no response. She then climbed over the gate, entered the house through the open door and went up to the second level by the staircase. The respondent suddenly appeared and assaulted her and tried to push her down the staircase. Her screams alerted Anita Chew who climbed over the gate and rushed into the house. Only then did the respondent stop assaulting the petitioner. The petitioner then telephoned the police who arrived shortly thereafter. (7)On 2 September 1991, there were two incidents at the Mountbatten Community Centre, one at 5.00 pm and the other at 8.00 pm. At 5.00 pm the petitioner accompanied by her father, PW2, arrived to pick up the child for her access period. They alleged that the respondent kept abusing PW2 saying `you got no balls'. In the 8.00 pm incident, the respondent called PW2 `useless bastard, dog, lousy grand father, bloody coward'. PW2 then came out of his car to reason with the respondent saying: `be sensible, you are here on a court order not on your own free will, why do you self-destruct and later as always blame it on others, I do not want to quarrel with you.' The respondent is said to have retorted while raving: `All this is rubbish. Nonsense.' He then kicked PW2 in the thigh and punched him on the forehead causing his glasses to fall off. The respondent then turned on the petitioner, squeezed her neck and threw her onto the ground a couple of times. In his affidavit filed on 9 September 1991, the respondent gave his version of these two incidents as follows: `I did not abuse her father. I merely walked over to him to talk to him and to tell him that he should not pretend to be an honest man and allow his daughter to behave and proceed in the manner she was doing. I deny saying the words alleged in para 4 of the petitioner's affidavit. At 8.00 pm on that day, when I arrived at the Mountbatten Community Centre to pick Samantha up, I wished to continue talking to the petitioner's father. I did not abuse him in the words stated in para 9 of the petitioner's affidavit. What I did say was that he should be more responsible as a father and stop pretending. He did not remain silent as suggested. Instead he started to be hysterical, shouting at me. It was he who took a swing at me and I avoided him by ducking and raising my leg. In fact, I am not quite sure if my leg touched his body. It was at this point of time that I heard my mother shouting. I turned and saw my mother struggling and the petitioner was snatching Samantha from my mother. I ran towards them, snatching Samantha away from the petitioner with one hand and with the other I grabbed the petitioner by the neck and pushed her whereupon she fell to the ground. I definitely did not squeeze her neck as suggested. Neither do I recall getting hold of her neck a second time. She may have gotten up from the ground after falling and I could have pushed her again.'
The petitioner's father is a retired school teacher aged 55, height 5 ft 2 in. and had undergone an operation for cancer. Would he have initiated the fight by swinging at the respondent who denies kicking him but so coincidentally `avoided him by ducking and raising his leg'? There was also no reason for the petitioner to snatch the child back moments after she had first handed over the child at the end of her access period. The injuries alleged by her to have been caused by strangulation and her being thrown onto the ground were supported by the medical report and photographs annexed to the petitioner's affidavit of 4 September 1991. The medical report listed the following injuries:
(i)Bruised marks on the neck, consistent with attempted strangulation; (ii)Abrasions on palms and right elbow most probably due to a fall; (iii)Stiffness of the neck with paravertebral spasm; (iv)Tenderness over the right gluteal region.
The medical report was by Dr Low Tze Choong of Toa Payoh Hospital to which the petitioner was admitted on 2 September 1991 following the incidents at the Mountbatten Community Centre and discharged on 4 September 1991. The injuries were still visible on 10 September 1991 when the petitioner testified for the first time before me. The spread of the injuries on the neck was consistent with her being strangled with both hands.
The petitioner had previous to 14 June 1991, left home on three occasions allegedly also because of the respondent's physical violence. But on each of these previous occasions, she had been persuaded to return home.
In answer to these allegations of violence against him, the respondent persistently accused her of misappropriation and that her parents purchased 41 Quemoy Road with the proceeds of her misappropriation. In his affidavit of 14 February 1991, he stated:
""... The real truth is that the petitioner's parents have benefitted from the ill gotten gains of the petitioner. As mentioned, they have bought a house out of the blue for $515,000/- cash when I have lost half a million.""
The respondent refused to accept that the petitioner's father purchased this property on retirement with his gratuities and Central Provident Fund savings and he also sold his smaller house at Serangoon Garden Estate to upgrade to living in this bigger house. See page 50 of the Notes of Evidence when the respondent was cross-examining the petitioner.
""Q: At that time I was particularly aggravated by the fact that your father was buying another property and I did not know where he could have the money. I ask you where your father could have the money to buy a second property.
A: Respondent did not ask me where my father could have the money. He knew that my father had just retired and would be drawing his CPF and gratuity and the respondent lamented that the civil service paid incompetent people implying my father so well that they could afford to buy a second house.""
The absurdity of this allegation is apparent when one examines the earnings of the respondent. When the petitioner married the respondent on 24 May 1986, it was just about one month after the he lost his job as a legal assistant earning a salary of $6000-$7000 a month. He then started his own firm and later the petitioner joined him. He gave the gross earnings of his firm during the 5 years from 1986 to 1991 as follows:
(1) for the first year, they ran a loss after drawings of $6000 to $7000 a month. Expenses amounted to $7000 to $8000 a month; (2) for the second year, their gross earnings were around $200,000 for the year with expenses of $7000 to $8000 a month; (3) for the third year, their gross earnings were between $250,000 to $300,000 but expenses amounted to $10,000 a month; (4) for the fourth and fifth years, their gross earnings were between $320,000 to $350,000 a year but expenses went up to $13,000 a month.
The matrimonial home at No 19 Jalan Buloh Perindu and their office premises were purchased with loans from financial institutions and consequently mortgage repayments had to be made. See the evidence of the petitioner under cross examination by the respondent at page 70 of the Notes of Evidence.
""Q: I suggest to you that you left on 14/6/91 because among other reasons by then you had your name included in the purchase of the house and office unit, so it was time to move on?
A: Utter rubbish. The purchase was on 80%- 90% mortgage ...""
It seems obvious that the respondent could not have $500,000 to be embezzled by the petitioner to finance her father's purchase of 41 Quemoy Road.
Pressing on with his claim all along that the petitioner was committing criminal misappropriation, he alleged that she then engineered the incidents of assaults on her thus giving her cause for leaving the matrimonial home each time to avoid her misappropriation being detected. See Notes of Evidence at page 46 where the respondent was cross-examining the petitioner:
""Q: Put it to you that you ran off in the way you did was because it was a matter of time before I could find out about your committing CBT for the last five years?
A: Totally absurd.""
Again at page 64:
""Q: You agree you left home on 4 occasions? A: Yes.
Q: Put it you kept on running away from home because you had taken the $100,000 and created these incidents to run away?
A: Not true.""
See the evidence of the respondent under cross-examination by counsel for the petitioner at page 167 of the Notes of Evidence:
""Q: You alleged that two other occasions, in which she left home namely in December 1990 and 14.6.91 were also because she had created this incident to run away as an excuse because she was afraid she would be discovered?
A: Yes. In December 1990 she disappeared for a month. The maid Lena managed to retrace the location where she was living. I got my mother and sister to go inside and talk to her. During that period she turned up at the office. On one occasion she handed the account books and pushed them to me saying 'you deal with this. From now on I am prepared to work for you free of charge'. These two incidents are connected to her fear of being discovered. This was her way of telling me she had done wrong.""
At page 169:
""Q: You had claimed petitioner had connived to milk you over the years on the instigation of her parents. See your affidavit of 23.1.92 para 11(f)(i) and from questions you put to the petitioner you suggested that after she had taken the $100,000 from the capital gain from sale of the Watten Estate house, she created 3 incidents to run away from home viz: (i) the knife incident (ii) the December 1990 incident (door slamming) (iii) the 14.6.91 incident because she wanted to run away for fear of being discovered. Do you maintain this?
A: Yes. I maintain this.""
One would have thought the surest way to cover up her misdeeds is for her to stay on especially when she was in charge of the office administration and accounts. This absurdity is all the more apparent when one bears in mind that the `knife incident' was said by the respondent to have been provoked by the petitioner's alleged confession of adultery.
In June 1991, the respondent's office accounts had a credit balance of only $10,000. This was seized on by the respondent as the reason for the petitioner running away on 14 June 1991 for good because there was very little left to steal. See page 60 of the Notes of Evidence:
""Q: Put it you remained in the marriage to me for five years was because you were helping yourself to the money from my firm. By June 1991 there was very little for you to help yourself and this was one of the two reasons you left me?
A: Absurd. When I first married him, he was unemployed. Subsequently we even had to borrow money from my parents from time to time. I can adduce proof of cheques. In particular to purchase the first Mercedez in 1988 and then again when we purchased 19 Jalan Buloh Perindu a sum of $50,000 was borrowed from my mother to pay the 10% deposit. I think there were other small loans in between but I cannot remember.
Q: Put it to you I never had to borrow from your mother. I agree we borrowed the $40,000 for the Mercedez but it was only a bridging loan for a week or so?
A: I cannot remember how long the loan was for. But I was trying to make the point how could he say I was there to take his money when in fact there was no money and we had to borrow from my mother.""
Equally baseless was the respondent's suggestion that the slight injuries sustained by his mother in a scuffle with the petitioner in the said incident on 2 September 1991 at the Mountbatten Community Centre caused his mother's death on 23 October 1991. In fact his mother died of cancer. In his affidavit of 23 January 1991 paras 6(e)(iii) and (iv) he stated:
""On 23rd October 1991 my mother Madam Goh passed away. This was some 7 weeks after the petitioner assaulted her on the 2nd September 1991 outside Mounbatten Community Centre. She was of good health all along. In great measure, as a result of the petitioner's conduct and attack, she fell ill and was unable to recover."" ""... I had to attend to my mother who was ill from 2nd September 1991, and to bear the 49 days period of bereavement after her death.""
He repeated this accusation under cross-examination. At page 179 of the Notes of Evidence:
""Q: Your mother passed away, she died of cancer on October 1991. The cancer - 6 weeks before she died. See your affidavit of 23.1.92 para 6(e). You said 'she was of good health all along'. In 6(e)(iii) you said 'she fell ill as a result of petitioner's conduct and attack and was unable to recover'. Do you still maintain these statements?
A: Yes, fully and unreservedly. The good health part was as at 24.7.91 to 25.8.91. She was in good health although she had chronic problems and had to take medicine but she was up and about. There were months she was ill and we had to give her medicine and she would recover. But after that community centre attack her health became worse and became quite bad and never recovered this time. She was fairly heart broken by that Mountbatten CC incident. In the Anita Chew incident she told the petitioner that she loved petitioner like gold in Chinese. She did not understand why petitioner was coming to create trouble. She was 76 years. If there was no attack on her on 2.9.91 my mother would not have passed away so suddenly.""
According to the petitioner all she did was to push the respondent's mother aside to get to the child who was crying while seated in respondent's car during that incident at the Mountbatten Community Centre. Whatever injuries the respondent's mother sustained in the scuffle could not have caused her death.
The respondent also suggested that the petitioner instructed Mr Davinder Singh because he is a Member of Parliament, and further suggested that she went to Toa Payoh Hospital for treatment because her lawyer was the Member of Parliament for Toa Payoh. See the respondent's evidence under cross-examination at page 173 of the Notes of Evidence:
""Q: You have alleged in your cross-examination of petitioner and her father that on evening of 2.9.91 they went to Toa Payoh Hospital because `your lawyer was Mr Davinder Singh and M.P. for Toa Payoh it will be helpful to you, you could blow it up. It will be helpful because of this M.P. and you are going to a government hospital'?
A: My allegation speaks for itself. I maintain I had basis to ask those questions. One of the reasons petitioner's father wanted to put pressure on me by selecting Mr Davinder Singh, a PAP M.P. They did not choose any other lawyer. This is a small divorce matter in terms of issues.
Q: What was the pressure on you by selecting Davinder Singh?
A: Unless we are duffers we live in a country and in this system if you are an M.P. from the ruling party you have certain amount of weight. He can call some shots more than others. The point is Albert < petitioner's father > was trying to intimidate me.""
The truth of the matter is the petitioner after being assaulted at the Mountbatten Community Centre on 2 September 1991 at 8.00 pm went with her father to a private hospital in the East Coast area but was turned away by a doctor in that hospital who said it would be a police case and they did not wish to be involved. The petitioner and her father then proceeded to Toa Payoh Hospital which is the closest to their house at Quemoy Road. Mr Davinder singh was also not the lawyer the petitioner specially sought out. She had sought the advice of a solicitor Mrs Quek Bee See who referred her to Mr Sachi Saurajen of the law firm of Drew & Napier. Mr Saurajen then assigned her matter to a Mr Morris John who was not available. It then went to Mr Davinder Singh. Mr Davinder Singh initially appeared with Mr Jimmy Yim but subsequently applied to be released as he had to attend to other matters, leaving this matter completely in the hands of Mr Jimmy Yim.
In the course of conducting his own case at the resumed hearing against repeated advice from the court to instruct counsel (Court offered to adjourn the hearing for this purpose), the respondent persisted on what he termed `robust' cross examination. He was represented by counsel at the earlier hearing. Through affidavits, cross examination and submissions, he heaped abuses without justification on all those associated with the petitioner even distantly. I set out below some of the unflattering remarks or references made or uttered by the respondent.
Against the petitioner: a can of worms; congenital liar devoid of any redeeming merit; utter lack of self-respect and complete lack of shame, steeped in mediocrity, first rate fortune hunter, fundamentally dishonest person; hypocritical gone case; an eternal problem; avaricious; immature petulant flighty; a quitter; ornamental; self made failure; a turn coat, a freak.
Against the petitioner's father PW2: mongrel dog; dastardly person; 3rd rate fellar; deep-seated self acknowledged inferiority; weakling; cowardly by nature; unable to see no further than his own nose; he ate dirt.
Against the petitioner's mother: petty, small minded, envious, malicious and vindictive person; suffer from inferiority complex; an insipid and rather wicked hearted person; plain evil, not only small-time but truly wicked; evil hearted human.
Against the petitioner's younger brother: lily livered boy, cowers and grovels.
Against one TBK, PW4, a female friend of the petitioner: a freak, conduct worse than atrocious, intermeddler, busybody. Even her husband was not spared.
Against the maid, PW6: impertinent, dishonest, malicious and deceitful, slow-headed, morals of an alley cat.
Against Mr Jimmy Yim, Counsel for the petitioner: he bowed and scraped before Your Honour. I found it too demeaning to do so; counsel is a paid hireling, he was lapping to Your Honour, to Davinder Singh, Mr Sachi Saurajen (instructed to carry the can after Davinder Singh).
Thus on the evidence before me, the respondent is clearly a man easily prone to violence and abusive in nature.
On stable home environment, the petitioner since she fled from the matrimonial home on 14 June 1991 had been staying with her parents and her younger brother at No. 41 Quemoy Road, Singapore. Her father aged 55, is a junior college teacher. After retirement, he taught part-time for a little while at the Regional English Language Centre. Her mother aged 53 is an ex-primary school teacher. She is bi-lingual. Both are healthy. Her brother at the time of the hearing was still a law student at the National University of Singapore. The maid Susanita to whom the child is very attached had gone to work for the petitioner. The petitioner's parents were supportive and were ready to help the petitioner look after the child. Their educational background will enhance the child's development.
The respondent on the other hand was mainly relying on his mother before her death and for a few days after Susanita ran away his sister Molly Chua and a male cousin Peter Kee. From the evidence before me, it was obvious that Molly Chua and Peter Kee could not be expected to assist as part of a long term arrangement. So also was the case of the sister-in-law Catherine Gwee. Molly Chua has her own family with two teenage daughters. She runs a family business known as Fullness Trading Pte Ltd. She doesn't drive and depends on her husband for transport. But her husband has had a quadruple heart by-pass and he must require care and attention himself. Peter Kee is a bachelor of over 30 years old. He lives at Whampoa Drive, a long distance from the matrimonial home. He lives with and looks after his father. He does not drive. Catherine Gwee has a family of her own. She has four children between the ages of 7 and 14. So even with a new maid that the respondent employed in place of Susanita, I had no doubt that the child would have a better and more stable environment living with the petitioner than with the respondent.
Thus taking principally the above factors into account, namely, the child being a little girl of 3 years old, the respondent's violent and abusive nature and his conduct, better educational and home environment in the petitioner's parents' home and the support of the petitioner's parents in looking after the child, I was of the view that in the interest of the child, custody should be awarded to the petitioner. In doing so, I awarded liberal access to the respondent.
In fairness to third parties who have been maligned in these proceedings by the respondent, I also declared that there is no basis for the attacks made against them by the respondent.",1992-07-28 00:00:00,SG High Court
